   <p>The three Scandinavian nationalities, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish, held a splendid banquet in Scandia Hall. The meeting was a good symbol of the manner in which these three groups are attempting to unite.</p>
   <p>The committee that handled this meeting consisted of Messrs. W. Colberg, T. Jager, Niels Juul, and John Riis, who together represented eight singing societies. The hall was decorated with American, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish flags. The program opened with a potpourri of American melodies. The president, Mr. Niels Juul, spoke wittily and cleverly. He declared that these societies were Scandinavian, not Danish, not Norwegian, not Swedish.</p>
   <p>The banquet was held in Chicago because of the World's Fair. We are offered the large hall in Jackson Park [for a concert], but we must have a chorus of one thousand voices....</p>
