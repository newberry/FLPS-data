   <p>[General Information]</p>
   <p>The Board of Directors meets the first Wednesday of each month.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>The Society for the Danish Old People's Home meets quarterly, on the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December, at Dania Hall, 1651-53 North Kedzie Avenue, at 8 o'clock P.M. Address all correspondence to the Secretary, Mr. L. V. Larsen, 1854 North Kedzie Avenue. Payments of all kinds are to be sent to the Financial Secretary, Mr. Ralph C. Petersen, 3136 West North Avenue. Attorney for the Society [is] Mr. Peter B. Nelson, 105 West Adams Street.</p>
   <p>Church services are held at the Home on the fourth Wednesday of each month. The Reverend A. W. Andersen had conducted the services for the past twenty-four years.</p>
   <p>The following publications are received at the Home free: The Danish Pioneer, Danish Times, Nordlyset, Pet Danske Ugeblad, Skandinaven, Kirkelig Samler, Hjemmet and Brugsforenings Bladet.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>To the Officers and Members of the Society for the Danish Old People's Home:</p>
   <p>In making my second annual report to you, I wish to express to you my earnest appreciation of the courtesy and co-operation that you have given me.</p>
   <p>During the past year many activities for the benefit of the Home were successfully carried on. I will mention a few of the outstanding ones.</p>
   <p>Our banquet at the Hedinah Athletic Club in March was a brilliant affair and was very well attended. The Banquet Committee and all those who sold tickets are to be commended for their splendid work.</p>
   <p>Our Tag Day in May, in spite of bad weather and depressed business conditions, was better than we had hoped for. Much credit is due to Mrs. Erica Hansen, <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>Chairman, and all the women who braved the rainy weather on two successive Mondays to tag for our Home.</p>
   <p>Our annual Summer Festival Picnic at the Home in June was a social and financial success, and after the hard work of the Committee under Mrs. Minnie Hansen and Mrs. A. K. Sorensen, it was a pleasure to have it so well attended and supported by our people.</p>
   <p>In December we held our Bazaar in Dania Hall. The generosity of our friends and the tireless work of the ladies who for many months prepared gifts to be raffled off under the expert auctioneering of Mr. Hans Christian Ericksen, Chairman of the Bazaar Committee, all contributed towards making this bazaar successful.</p>
   <p>In the excellent operation of the Home, I would like to mention the splendid work of the House Committee under Mrs. A. K. Sorensen, the Admission Committee under Mrs. C. P. Ditlefsen, the efficient management of Mr. and Mrs. Arent Nielsen.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>We appreciate and give thanks for the spiritual guidance of Rev. A. W. Andersen and other ministers who have held Services in the Home; for the medical care of Dr. C. F. Roan and Mr. Hansen, Superintendent of the Lutheran Deaconess Hospital.</p>
   <p>The Trustees, Mr. Hans Christian Ericksen, Mr. H. P. Richelsen, and Mr. J. C. Berthelsen, are to be commended for their careful and diligent work in the administration of their duties. Mr. P. B. Nelson handled our legal affairs very satisfactorily.</p>
   <p>I wish to thank the various clubs and societies for their generous support, the private entertainers who gave of their talent for the enjoyment of the residents of the Home, and the Danish press for their co-operation in publishing news of the activities of the Home.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Several improvements have been made to the building. Mr. Carl Skafgard donated part of his time in caulking all the windows and other work, for which we owe him our appreciation and thanks.</p>
   <p>The Home was very fortunate in receiving a bequest from the estate of Mr. J. J. Dau, former Chairman of Reid Murdoch Company, of two-twentieths of his estate; it is now in the process of being probated, and as yet we do not know how much the Home will receive, but it will be a great help, as our present investments do not bring in as much income as in past years. We will still need donations and gifts until the income from the endowment fund will be sufficient to take care of the current expenses of the Home.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, I hope that each member will make a special effort to attend the Quarterly Meetings of the Society to keep in touch with the activities of the Home.</p>
   <p>ANDREW BENSON, PRESIDENT.</p>

   <p>Report of House Committee for 1935</p>
   <p>To the Officers and Members of the Society for the Danish Old People's Home:</p>
   <p>In submitting our report for the year of 1935, we feel that another year has brought added comfort, convenience, and efficiency to our home, as a result of fine team-work and splendid co-operation from our loyal friends and supporters in this worthy undertaking.</p>
   <p>During the past years five women and one man were admitted into hour Home, and during the same period six of our residents passed away; two residents were dismissed. At the close of 1935, there were 52 residents; thirty-three women and nineteen men. This included three married couples.</p>
   <p>In rendering our report on the general health condition of the residents for the past year, we feel justified in stating that most of our folks have enjoyed good health; of course, we have a number of our old folks requiring <a name="p24" class="page-break">24</a>special attention, due to their feebleness. In connection with the care and service rendered to these residents, we wish to express our deep appreciation to the nurse and matron for their vigilance and faithful discharge of their duties.</p>
   <p>As in previous years, we have enjoyed the visits of numerous clubs, churches, lodges and societies, as well as individuals, who have contributed most generously towards sociability, which is a significant part of our endeavor in bringing about the atmosphere of home. Our monthly birthday parties continue to be well attended, and with the improved transportation facilities to Norwood Park, we feel assured of a steady increase of visitors at these parties, appreciated by all concerned, and may we extend our appreciation to each participant and contributor towards its success.</p>
   <p>To Mrs. George Rasmussen, we wish to express our deep appreciation and thanks for the many gifts received during the year--valuable gifts, too numerous to mention.</p>
   <a name="p25" class="page-break">25</a>
   <p>The Folk Dancers from the Danish-American Athletic Club gave an exhibition at the Home on Mother's Day which was greatly enjoyed by the old folks, and visitors present. For this kind consideration and thoughtful act we express our appreciation.</p>
   <p>On Wednesday, August 21, most of our old folks attended the annual picnic of the American Automobile Association, which was held at Lincoln Park, where a most pleasant day was enjoyed, and refreshments were served. A fine program of all kinds of entertainment was also given. Eleven automobiles were placed at our disposal for transportation of our residents.</p>
   <p>One of the outstanding events of the year was the Golden Wedding Anniversary of Mr. and Mrs. Felix Remmer, who celebrated the event in company of friends and relatives.</p>
   <p>Mr. Carl Skafgard deserves much credit for the untiring service he has rendered our Home this year, as well as former years, for the many improvements <a name="p26" class="page-break">26</a>made possible that would otherwise be prohibitive. Mr. O. W. Kollner is also entitled to thanks and appreciation for service rendered in the line of electrical work.</p>
   <p>To Mr. Ove Knudsen and his fine staff of players, who staged the play of "Noddebo Praestegaard" at our Home on Sunday, March 3, we are greatly indebted. This play was enjoyed immensely. Pastor Videbeck and his fine mixed chorus from Ebenezer Church have also visited the Home. Pastor Enok Mortensen showed pictures from Denmark, and Reverend A. Freeman Kunz is conducting regular religious service at the Home. To these ladies and gentlemen we express our appreciation and thanks for their various contributions to the welfare and enjoyment of our residents.</p>
   <p>Our new dishwashing machine, donated by Mr. J. C. Nielsen, is undoubtedly the most valuable improvement made this year, and aside from sanitation, has placed our kitchen on a higher degree of efficiency to the benefit of all concerned.</p>
   <a name="p27" class="page-break">27</a>
   <p>We have received a number of plants from Mr. Schousboe, florist. From the Danish-American Athletic Club we have received a bust of Hans Christian Andersen, which adorns a corner of our parlor.</p>
   <p>Due to the fact that the date of our Christmas party fell on a Monday, the attendance was not so great this year, as the previous year; however, we feel it was a great success. Pastor Andersen conducted the service prior to the serving of the Christmas dinner and subsequent party.</p>
   <p>The fine condition in which we find our Home is a credit to Mr. and Mrs. Arent Nielsen, and their devoted interest and care for our old folks is commendable. During the past year Mr. Arent Nielsen has washed and painted many of the rooms, and thus has effected a great saving. To our nurses and girls we extend our appreciation for faithful service, and to our residents we likewise extend appreciation for their willingness to assist in the work in and outside the Home.</p>
   <a name="p28" class="page-break">28</a>
   <p>In conclusion we wish to thank each and every person, who in any manner or form contributed towards the welfare of our Home and its residents.</p>
   <p>Yours very truly,</p>
   <p>The House Committee</p>

   <p>Report of Annual Tag Day for 1935</p>
   <p>During the past year our committee has attended the monthly meetings held by the Chicago Federation of Aged and Adult Charities at the First National Bank, with a view to obtain the best results on our annual Tag Day for the Danish Old People's Home.</p>
   <p>Our receipts for Tag Day held May 5, 1935, amounted to $840.82. We would like to take this opportunity to thank our workers for their untiring efforts and co-operation last year, and we hope our Committee will receive the same <a name="p37" class="page-break">37</a>support for our next Tag Day, to be held May 4, 1936.</p>

   <p>To Our Members:</p>
   <p>The strength of any organization is dependent upon the moral and financial support given by its membership, and the very same statement applies to our Home. For the past six years our membership has declined to a point where we feel it a matter of duty to call your attention to the fact. As our Home is not self-sustaining, we must depend on the moral and financial support of our membership, and we feel confident that you fully realize the value and benefit of numerical strength and we therefore appeal to you as a member to do your share towards increasing our membership and adopt the slogan, "Every member get a member", We shall be glad to furnish you with application blanks upon request. The membership dues are $3 and up, per year. We feel confident that there are many charitable-minded Danes in Chicago that would be more than willing to join our society, if only approached.</p>
   <a name="p39" class="page-break">39</a>
   <p>May we count on your co-operation?</p>
