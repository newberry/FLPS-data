   <p>The banquet in honor of Hans Christian Andersen in Orchestra Hall took place on April 3. About 1,700 dinner guests were present, which is about two thirds of the capacity of the hall. The music was by Ole Nielsen's orchestra, and the singing by one hundred Danish singers consisting of members of Harmonien, Hejmdal, Magneten, Arbejder-Sangforeningen, and Lyren.</p>
   <p>Aage Engels wrote an excellent prologue [Translator's note: For text of prologue see Revyen, Apr. 1, 1905]. It was read by the author himself. The Reverend Mr. Gjorup gave a lecture on the life of Hans Christian Andersen, but the audience found it rather long, as it lasted one hour and fifteen minutes. The Reverend Adam Dan read two of Andersen's stories. The Reverend Mr. Rordam spoke about the history of the Danish Children's Home.</p>
   <p>Then came the singing under the grand old choirmaster, T. Elbert; there was also fine singing by the ladies' singing society Illinois; and solos by Miss Hertz <span class="page-break">2</span>(singing) and P. Marinus Paulsen (violin). Finally there was folk dancing by young girls in Danish and Swedish national dress.</p>
