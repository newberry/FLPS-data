   <p>The heroic knight is not dead: His name is Carl Antonsen, Chicago, correspondent for The Danish Pioneer, and self-appointed oracle for not only the Danes but the Norwegians in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Antonsen tells a fairy tale--Botker, the editor of Revyen, is in the hospital, the printer is dead (drunk), and so the Revyen is also dead, dead from--what?</p>
   <p>To attack a man who is ill, and in the hospital, and cannot defend himself, is cowardly, so cowardly that it makes Antonsen eligible for membership in the "Danish-Norwegian Press Club". I do not want to discuss this issue further, because I fear Antonsen may send his wife or his mother-in-law up to my office with horse-whips.</p>
   
   <p>Sohus Neble, owner of the Pioneer, should give Antonsen a pink slip. But the colonel (Neble) loves his office boy, and so will not fire him.</p>
