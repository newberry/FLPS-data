   <p>Under the auspices of the National Security League, a loyalty party and banquet will be held in the La Salle Hotel, Wednesday, February 6, in honor of the American flag and all that it represents. The affair is for all nationalities and peoples of the earth, now citizens or residents of the United States. The number of guests expected is 1,500, including women as well as men, and not less than seventy-five different races and nationalities will be represented.</p>
   <p>The idea is to demonstrate how these people have found a home in this country, and are willing, if necessary, to fight and make sacrifices so that liberty, democracy and the American flag may live and prosper. Telegrams will be sent to all the represented nations throughout the world. Loyal German-Americans, Austrians, Belgians, and Turks will participate.</p>

   <p>Henry L. Hertz will represent the Danes on the arrangement committee, with John C. Christensen (Dania's president), from the West Side, and E. C. Bunck from the South Side. The affair was arranged on very short notice, so only a small number of invitations were sent out, but all those attending without formal invitations will be cared for, if they will make reservations soon.</p>
