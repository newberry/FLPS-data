   <p>p.2.col.3........The Scandinavian Karl Marx Club has extended an invitation to Mrs. Lucinka Hansen (Socialistic lecturer from Denmark) and Niels Reisgaard (her co-worker) to take part in a discussion of Socialism at Jacobsens Hall tomorrow evening. Mrs. Hansen has made many statements smacking strongly of something for from Socialistic and has been faithfully supported by Reisgaard and the Karl Marx Club is determined to find out why the two are permitted to preach doctrines other than that adopted by the bona-fide Socialist Party.</p>
   <p>In addition to his support of traitorous line of teaching. Mr. Reisgaard is, as a side issue, presenting a plan for a Danish colony to be established in Virginia. Repeated questioning by Revyen and others has failed to bring forth a direct <span class="page-break">2</span>answer regarding the project and his promise to call at this office for an interview regarding the proposed colony has not been fulfilled. This side-stepping and feinting appears to indicate something questionable, a something that fears publicity and shuns the light.</p>
   <p>However, both the Karl Marx Club and Revyen, are determined to solve both problems when they will be given such publicity as each may deserve.</p>
