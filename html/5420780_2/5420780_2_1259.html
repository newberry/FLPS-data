   <p>A new club, Skandinavisk Discussionsklub Fremad (Scandinavian Discussion Club Forward), has been founded. Its aim is to spread culture and information among Scandinavian workers. There are to be lectures on science, economics, history, politics, and literature. The club also asks everyone who has books which he does not wish to keep to give them to the library.</p>
