   <p>The Ladies Song Club of Illinois, attracted a large and representative audience at its concert last Saturday night. The concert itself, as well as the dance following it, was a great success. The program was selected with good taste and a sense for lively variety, and the assistance could not have been better chosen.</p>
   <p>The star of the evening was, of course, Mme. Ragna Linne, who was enthusiastically applauded.</p>
   <p>The concert certainly was a credit to the club, which last Tuesday celebrated the second anniversary of its founding.</p>
