   <p>We beg to inform the Skandinaven that it is wrong and foolish to make such a statement as that communism and socialism have the same principles and ideas. Skandinaven, you are wrong again. Do you realize how many intelligent and highly educated persons are Socialists? That a Dane and a Norwegian were arrested in their homes for lecturing on Socialism does not give you any right to issue such a statement. We know that socialist doctrine is not always gold, but it has opened many eyes to reality. Maybe the Skandinaven will correct its error in its next issue.</p>
