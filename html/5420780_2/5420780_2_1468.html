   <p>Well situated and under the best possible leadership, Dania went through the period of depression which followed the first Chicago World's Fair, and the Society made its impression on all greater events, whether they concerned the [Danish] colony, or whether Denmark and Danish movements called for attention.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of the new century the Danish population started its second great migration to the western parts of the city. Groups of Danes settled in the vicinity of Wicker Park and Humboldt Park, and in 1910 Dania's building already stood lonely and deserted in the old neighborhood. The wise men in the Society understood at once that Dania also must move, and on March 5, 1910, they were successful in selling the old building for the sum of $20,500. The Society's cash fund amounted at that time to some $8,000, but in spite of all efforts it was not possible to find a suitable building in the new vicinity: For a while Dania rented space in "Steensland's," at that time an elegant villa on Evergreen Avenue; the quarters there being small, they had to hold their large affairs in other more suitable places. The forty-ninth anniversary of the Society was celebrated in Old Style Inn, at the corner of Division Street and California Avenue, a celebration that will be remembered by many of Dania's members today.</p>
   <p>With Peder Kristensen as president, assisted by such active members as C. H. C. Nielsen, Fritz Frantzen, Herskind Petersen, M. Houlberg, and others, an attempt was made to find lots where a suitable building might be erected, and on November 19, 1911, the committee reported that the Dania Society was the proud owner of two lots, numbers 1651 and 1653 North Kedzie Avenue, which had cost $3,500. On November 24, 1912, the new building was officially dedicated, and that event was followed by a fiftieth anniversary celebration, which occurred on December 29 of the same year.</p>
   <p>Dania's elegant hall and the comfortable rooms for social affairs were admired, and soon the hall was used by nearly all Chicago's Danish societies. Great festivities and important events took place, in which Dania displayed its ability to solve problems of a Danish-American nature. As Dania at various times had honored Hans Christian Andersen, Holger Prachmann, and other great Danish names, it now paid homage to Georg Brandes, the Student Singers, Dr. Christian Fenger, and many others.</p>
   <p>The members of Dania demanded that one of the city's parks be named after an outstanding Dane, and when finally the park at Fullerton and Naragansett Avenues was called Jacob A. Riis Park, it must be admitted that Dania was largely responsible for this honor.</p>
