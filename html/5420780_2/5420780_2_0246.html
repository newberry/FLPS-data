   <p>"All's well that ends well" is an old phrase applicable to humans and human destinies also. It expresses a summing up of changeable circumstances and obstacles that have been conquered for the benefit of harmony and contentment. We are thinking of Chief Librarian J. Charles Bay, who recently has been appointed knight of the Danish Flag which appointment has been received with approval by the public over here as well as in Denmark. His official distinction, of course, is only a part of the visible evidence of achievements by a man of sincere purpose, achievements which are significant also to the Danes.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bay is a man of wide experience. His fields of activity varied before he found his right place as a librarian, first in the Library of Congress, later as Chief Librarian of the John Crerar Library of Chicago where he has made extensive use of his wide scientific knowledge.</p>
   <p>Coinciding with the Danes' conception of titular councillors and "real" titular councillors, we have in America librarians and "real" librarians, the former knowing the mechanical part of library science, the letter possessing, in addition, a deep understanding of books and their present and future values.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>They possess a keen sense of judgment and know instantly what a book contains when scanning over its pages. Bay is of the "real" kind. He has a biblophilist's ability to make books serve him as though they were human beings.</p>
   <p>The John Crerar Library has a great collection of Danish scientific literature. To be sure this library would have had a great number of Danish works whether or not Mr. Bay had been there, but the fact that Denmark is so well represented must be ascribed to the efforts he has made to that effect. In addition it is due to Charles Bay's efforts that original volumes of Saxo, Flora Danica and other famous Danish works are to be found in other libraries in this country.</p>
   <p>He is a man who never forgets to call your attention to the great works produced by Danish authors. Neither does he ever forget that he is Danish and hails from Rudkobing. He is ever true to his origin and cherishes the memory of the little house on the side-street where he was born. Its inhabitants were common, ordinary people, who nevertheless possessed a high degree of culture - only it was minus the academic varnish. No wonder J. Charles Bay is a great friend of Evald Fang Christensen famous for his collection of Danish folk lore, and the author Jeppe Aakjeer as well as of Mr. Feilberg, with whom he corresponds regularly.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>If we consider "the experience of being conscious of one's self on the basis of historical assumptions," as being a correct definition of culture, Charles Bay is a man of culture. I remember how impressed I was when he told me of his visit to Denmark last summer, how he had been standing in the portal of the Ribe Cathedral re-living the arrival of Queen Dagmar, how he saw, as in a vision, the golden masted ship unfold its silky sails while slowly proceeding up the Ribe River, and how he heard Valdemar the Victorious and his young bride pass through the self-same portal on their way to the high altar.</p>
   <p>An experience of that sort is possible only for a genuine Dane and a man of culture. Mr. Bay speaks Danish with preference and does it with a remarkable degree of perfection.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bay's intellectual contribution to the bridge building between Danish and American culture is unquestionable. His many translations of Scandinavian literature to English and as many visa versa are sufficient evidence; particularly his translations of Danish hymns and poetry are made with great skill and understanding. The University of Copenhagen and the Royal Library both have received a great deal of additional literature, American and Danish, through the efforts of Charles Bay. He is widely known in Danish library circles.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>His historical interests have led him to intensive study of the history of the Middle West, the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys in particular. He is regarded as an authority on this subject, known and appreciated among Americans, and numerous are the works to which Charles Bay has furnished the introductory chapter; he himself is the author of many historical works. As the years go by, Charles Bay seems to work harder and harder. Far into the night you'll see the light in his study where a valuable collection of literary gems is housed, and where the picture of his mother has its place on the among the pictures of famous personalities.</p>
   <p>A few words do often express a world of truth. For instance, when Charles Bay told me of the honorary decoration he had received he added: "I would rather give it to my wife." Such a statement reveals as in a flash what sort of character you are dealing with. Charles Bay could hardly have paid a finer compliment to his wife, and it reflects instantly on himself.</p>
   <p>Faithful to his origin, to his adopted country, and his home, are fundamental aspects of Librarian J. Charles Bay's character. When, in addition, he has preserved his genuine Danish view of life, the honor conferred on him must be said to be well deserved. Of those who left Denmark and never returned, J. <span class="page-break">\5</span>Charles Bay is a worthy representative.</p>
