   <p>The Sherman monument was dedicated in Washington, D.C. on October 16. Present were Mrs. Sara Rohl-Smith, widow of the Danish artist, who had done most of the work, and her nephew, Peter Ole Suhr. The statue was unveiled by a nephew of General Sherman. President Theodore Roosevelt and General Sickles spoke.</p>
   <p>After a competition in 1896, Carl Rohl-Smith of Chicago was given the commission for the monument. He was under contract with the government and the "Society of the Army of Tennessee." The monument was to be finished within four years at a cost of $90,000. In 1897 Mr. C. Rohl-Smith moved to Washington. During a visit to Denmark in 1900, he took sick and died suddenly, but his splendid wife carried on the work. The monument was finished by the Danish sculptors, Lauritz Jensen and Carl J. Bonnesen from Copenhagen, and the Norwegian artist, Sigvald Asbjornsen from Chicago.</p>
   <p>The family of General Sherman was greatly moved, when they saw the excellent likeness of the late general.</p>
