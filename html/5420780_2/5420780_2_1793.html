   <p>Wednesday, October 20, at 8 P. M., in Wicker Park Hall, the Scandinavian Relief Committee will present its second large affair. The concert part of the program is especially good. Many well-known Danish artists will appear, but the star of them all is the ballet dancer Grethe Lind who needs no introduction to Chicago Danes.</p>
