   <p>Volkmar Johnsen, Danish author and composer, has for more than a generation been a well-known figure in Danish social life in Chicago. He was famous for his wit and sarcasm, and for years no party was complete without his presence or a poem or two from his pen. He was also very active in all amateur plays in the colony.</p>
   <p>All of a sudden he started to be a business man and began as a salesman for a piano firm. For several years he ran a tobacco and music store on Milwaukee Avenue. Later he moved his store to Western Avenue, near Peter Madsen Lagoni. Here he published for half a year his little paper: Ha! Ha! but he soon became tired of the paper, and Mr. Chr. Botker took it over and started a Danish paper under the name of Revyen.</p>
