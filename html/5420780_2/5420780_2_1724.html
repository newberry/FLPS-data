   <p>Mrs. James Thorsen, the founder of Danish Old Peoples' Home, of Chicago, died March 23. The funeral was held March 25.</p>
   <p>Mrs. James Thorsen conceived the idea of establishing a Danish Old Peoples' Home and began working for its realization in 1871. The fine home in Norwood Park is adequate evidence of the success of her work. During the sixteen years which have elapsed since its establishment, a little faithful group of hard working ladies have constantly regarded Mrs. Thorsen as the mother of the home. When their work was made subject to severe criticism it was always Mrs. Thorsen who encouraged and pleaded for patience, so that the good work might continue. The death of Mrs. Thorsen will be mourned by the inmates of the home, as it will be by the little society which will continue the good work in her spirit, and in commemoration of her sacrifices. To her last day Mrs. Thorsen kept on encouraging us not to forget the old folks, but to continue the humanitarian work.</p>
   <p>Let us all support Danish Old Peoples' Home better than ever, for the benefit of old Danish men and women and in commemoration of Mr. Thorsen, the first one to call our attention to this noble cause.</p>
   <p>Mrs. C. A. Hanson,</p>
   <p>President, Old Peoples' Home.</p>
