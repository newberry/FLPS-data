   <p>A former Danish railroad man, Peter Hansen, bought land on the Michigan prairie fifteen or sixteen years ago and specialized in the raising of potatoes, for which he is now using fifteen acres. On this area he harvested about 1000 bushels of potatoes last year, a record for which he and Danish farmers in general are being acclaimed by one of the largest newspapers in the state.</p>
   <p>Says the paper: "Among the farmers in West and Middle Michigan, the Danes seem to be the ablest, and the county of Montcalm has become amazingly fertile under their hands.</p>
   <p>"Most of them arrived here only a few years ago from their homeland, with nothing but their baggage, which they carried on their backs, and they started in with empty hands. Almost every Dane who settled in these parts <span class="page-break">\2</span>on virgin soil has prospered.</p>
   <p>They are the type of people that do not sit down and wait for lady luck to come around; they go after her! Go out among their farms and see how fertile they are, how healthy and happy are their children and their homes attractive.</p>
   <p>These farmers enjoy good living, and are as a rule happy and contented. They do not like to quarrel; their word is as good as a cashier's check, and they pay their bills on the date on which they are due."</p>
