   <p>In writing about folk dances, there is no particular system or group of dances that is more outstanding than others, because a nation's folk dances represents its culture, and has become a means of expressing the inner feelings of that people. These old folk dances show typical temperaments of the various nations.</p>
   <p>The Danish folk dances differ from most others in their soft and carefree movements and are symbolical of Denmark, its people and nature. There are, however, dances that are typical of other nations as well.</p>
   <p>When the common people gathered in the olden days, it was through dancing they expressed their feelings--it was the spiritual language, understood and loved by all, through which the moods and strifes of their daily lives found experssion. Typical are the Shoemakers' Dance and the Weavers (Weaving Wadmel). The dance that occurs most frequently in all folk dancing is the waltz, which took form in the 16th century in France.</p>

   <p>The Polka, a Bohemian national dance, was first danced by the peasants, but during the 18th century it gained popularity in many other countries. The Gallop which is a Hungarian dance is also very old. The Quadrille was danced all over Europe in the 16th century. The Polonaise and Mazurka are Polish and Russian dances. From these, many other dances, have been created.</p>
   <p>In Denmark, the old folk dances have relinquished their popularity in favor of the more modern ballroom dancing, a mixture of everything and not much of anything with the exception of such specialty dances as the tango and, of course, the waltz. The "Society for Promotion of Folk Dances in Denmark" has successfully undertaken to gather up the old Danish folk dances and melodies in order to preserve the culture, they represent. In every hamlet in Denmark these dances still hold sway both for their wholesome fun and their cultural value, and is considered by the people as a precious possesion to be handed down to future generations.</p>
   <p>Also in America have we folk dances. This country has come to value and <span class="page-break">\3</span>appreciate their cultural influence. Many minor schools as well as universities practice folk dancing. Among the Danes in America, folk dancing is a natural feature at gatherings and festivities. There are at least fifty different groups throughout the states who enthusiastically strive to promote folk dancing.</p>
   <p>Our dances are, no doubt, best suited for the American schools because they are easy to learn and understand and are as light and carefree as the typical American.</p>
