   <p>The committee for the Danish Sisterhoods decided that they would not raise a monument for the organizer of the Sisterhood, Mrs. Christine Hemmingsen, at this time. They have so far heard from ninety lodges, and collected only $260. It is expected that the sixty other lodges will respond, which will give them the required amount necessary to raise the monument.</p>
