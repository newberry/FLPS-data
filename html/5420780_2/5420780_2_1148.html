   <p>Last Thursday, Hejmdal, this new Danish-Norwegian weekly newspaper, appeared for the first time. This paper stands for liberal principles, and in regard to the enjoyment of life represents the point of view of all foreign-born. The paper is opposed to all narrow-minded coercion and in the impending election campaign sides with the opposition.</p>
   <p>Hejmdal contains worthwhile reading material. The paper also keeps a correspondent in Norway and in Denmark. The publishers of this paper, Riechel and Salmonsen, are independent people and will know how to keep their independence. The paper will also accept advertisements.</p>
