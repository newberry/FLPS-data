This was a very small percentage of the foreign population, but this does not take into a count those who came to this country years ago, and whose descendants have been conspicuous in the life of the nation. Governments of States and Senators in Congress have been natives of Denmark, or descendants of Danish natives. They have developed vast dairy interests, especially, and have introduced their sucessful methods of agriculture in America. In the Northwest, they form a large part of the population. They have led in the formation of banks and commercial bodies, and wherever they have gone, they have taken with them their high moral views and their habits of industry. Their unswering loyalty to the land of their adoption is evident everywhere.</p>
