   <p>Our countryman, Dr. Axel Frank Phillipson, has invented a sound proofing device which is also capable of rendering harmless the poisonous carbon gas, which flows freely from the exhaust pipe of every automobile.</p>
   <p>Later a Frenchman by the name of Eugene Royn has copied the invention trying to grab the honor and the profit. However, the invention is Mr. Frank Phillipson's creation and he perfected it during his two years' stay in the state of California for his health. The Los Angeles Times published a lengthy explanation of the "mistake" in its November 9th issue, and bought an interesting interview with the inventor.</p>
   <p>The invention will be of great importance of the automobile industry, and no doubt it will be installed in every new car leaving the factory. Also it will be of great use where sewers are dug by means of air-hammers powered by gasoline engines or wherever gasoline engines are being used indoors.</p>
