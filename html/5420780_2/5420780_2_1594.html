   <p>The Danish Lutheran Children's Home in Chicago is a child of Trinity Church. At a church convention held in Chicago 1883 a discussion was brought up about the urgency and possibility of a Danish home for orphans and neglected children of Danish parentage. Though much interest was manifested, nothing was done until, as it seemed, the Lord himself laid the children at the door of the church. A mother of four children was dying. Rev. A. S. Nielsen, Pastor of Trinity Danish Lutheran Church had been called and was standing at her bedside with her poor husband. She turned to the pastor and said: "I am ready to die, but, my poor children!"--The pastor replied: "If your hour of departure has come, that you may go home to be with the Lord, then, my dear, go with peace, your children shall be provided for with God's help.</p>
   <p>Thus it came to pass, that the thought of a Danish Children's Home was materialized. When the mother died, Rev. Nielsen went to some of his parishioners <span class="page-break">2</span>and collected $15.00, rented a small apartment and engaged a former Diaconess from Copenhagen, Elisabeth Nyrup, as matron. August 12th, 1884 the four children were admitted and the Danish Lutheran Children's Home started, Trinity congregation was the main support of the Home; the following year at the synodical meeting at Clinton, Iowa, the Home was accepted by the Synod of the Danish Ev. Lutheran Church in America. A frame house on Maplewood Avenue, near Milwaukee Avenue, was bought and dedicated as Danish Children's Home. 1905 a new substantial building was erected on Evergreen Avenue. 1915 an addition was built to make room for more children. The pastor of Trinity Church has already been, the director and superintendent of the Home and managed its affairs together with two laymen, elected by the congregation. An Auxiliary Board of ladies have for twenty years taken care of "Tag Day" collections. The first matrons: Magdalene Sorensen, Mrs. Martha Olsen, Mrs. Ane Hansen and the present, Miss Cristense Holm, had all been selected from Trinity Church. Several legacies have been received from former members of the congregation $14,000.00 were left to the Home by bookkeeper Jens Nielsen 1914 and $14,000.00 by H. P. Larsen 1924 and $10,000.00 by Walter Mathiesen <span class="page-break">3</span>1932 and several smaller.</p>
   <p>Several hundred children have benefited of the hospitality of the Home during the past 49 years, some have stayed there from 10-12 years and many now spread all over the country and have their own good homes and families, off and on they visit the Home, and it is a pleasure to hear how thankful they are for the good time they spent in the Home and for the good influence and kindness they received.</p>
   <p>A summer camp is now contemplated near Greenville, Michigan for the children for many years they were placed with farmers in the adjacent states during summer vacation, but of late it has been difficult to place them. The Children's Home has been recipient of many gifts during past years from its many friends all over the country and has been a blessing for many children and we hope it may continue its good work for many years to come.</p>
   <p>The Danish Lutheran Church in America has for 20 years supported two other <span class="page-break">4</span>Danish Children's Home, one in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, which was closed a few years ago and one at Tyler, Minnesota.</p>
   <p>The United Danish Lutheran Church maintains two Children's Homes, one in Elkhorn, Iowa, and the other Waupeca, Wisconsin: may these also become a blessing to many who are in need of such good Christian Homes!</p>
