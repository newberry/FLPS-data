   <p>All Czechoslovak voters are hereby advised to vote for a change of the Volstead Act. The Chicago voters and all other voters in our county will have an opportunity to vote for either of the two propositions placed before them on the so-called small ballots.....One of these small ballots will contain a proposition asking that the present prohibition act be changed in the sense that the manufacture and sale of five per cent beers and light wines be permitted. It is a referendum vote which gives the voters an opportunity to express their opinions as to prohibitory laws, and in reality this is the first time that such an opportunity has been given them.</p>
   <p>The Eighteenth Amendment to the National [Federal] Constitution was approved by state legislatures and the Volstead Act was approved by the Congress, but in neither case were the American people asked what they thought about such <span class="page-break">\2</span>limitations of their rights. Both the [Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act] were adopted against the wishes of the majority of American citizens, and these citizens see the necessity of using such devices by means of which the forfeited rights taken by Congress may be returned to the people.</p>
   <p>Next Tuesday the Illinois voters will have the first opportunity of proving by their votes that they are dissatisfied with the existing prohibition laws, and that they desire that these be reduced in their region. More than half a million of voters in our state have signed a petition for a referendum vote on this question, and this in itself is a proof that the people are dissatisfied with the constant limitations of their rights. But half a million voters are only a part of the number of Illinois voters who will cast their ballots next Tuesday, and of the Czechoslovaks who are thus to vote there should not be one who would not vote against the present prohibition law. We are convinced that there is not a single Czechoslovak citizen who would not wish to change the existing prohibition law, and it is therefore necessary that every one of us <span class="page-break">\3</span>place a cross after the word "yes" as provided for on the small ballot.</p>
   <p>We call the attention of our people to this small ballot knowing that it frequently happens that such small ballots are easily overlooked when a person deals with such large ballots as he will on next Tuesday. We repeat that it is necessary to place a cross behind the word "yes," thus giving an affirmation to the proposition permitting the manufacture and sale of light wines and beers.</p>
   <p>The second small ballot will deal with the permission to float a bond issue for fifty-five million dollars to pay a bonus to the soldiers and sailors of Illinois who served during the World War. The last legislative session approved the bonus but referred the giving of the permission to float the bond issue to the people. We believe that our soldiers and sailors should receive that bonus. When they marched to battle there was not one of us who would have denied such aid to them, and there is no reason why such aid should <span class="page-break">\4</span>be denied them now. We are certain that a great majority of our Czechoslovak voters will vote for the bonus.....</p>
