   <p>It is only a week until the judicial elections, and, therefore, it is time that citizens should choose their candidates and decide for whom they will vote. We Czechs have a candidate on the ballot this time, upon whose election much should depend. He is Mr. Hugo Pam. That much interest in his candidacy and election is evident among us is shown by the resolution published in yesterday's issue of this paper, and which was signed by well-known citizens and businessmen.</p>
   <p>As we have mentioned before, Mr. Pam was born of Czech parents here in Chicago. His father came from Plzen [Pilsen, Bohemia], and settled in Chicago in 1870. The present candidate for the office of Judge of the Superior Court was reared in the neighborhood of Halsted and Dusold Streets. He was always in close contact with the Czechs, and always was their friend. If he is elected, we will have in that important office a man who knows us, appreciates us, and who will take our part, <span class="page-break">\2</span>if necessary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hugo Pam, as a lawyer, gained a good reputation, and for that reason, deserves to be elected Judge. Immigrants have always had a defender and friend in him. He is one of them, and he always endeavors to aid them with constructive advice and good deeds. From all this, it will be seen that we will be acting only for our benefit if, at the election a week from tomorrow, we unanimously elect him as a Judge of the Superior Court.</p>
