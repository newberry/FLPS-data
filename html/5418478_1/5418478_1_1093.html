   <p>Some of our Typesetters have disregarded the agreement of a week ago, and now come forward with a new demand.</p>
   <p>We are particularly blessed by people who like to share. Eight years ago members of a literary society, requested that we turn our business over to them. We served these impudent applicants according to their merits. Now it seems this is all to be repeated.</p>
   <p>Although it is only a week since we signed an agreement with the Typographical Union, in which we agreed to terms such as even the Typesetters of the large English papers can not boast of; although we put into force the various articles of the agreement some of our typesetters prepared a surprise for us yesterday. They stopped work at noon and in the afternoon delivered their ultimatum, which says: "Give each of us, one like the other, a share in the business as large as each of you have. If you do not divide with us before 4 o'clock this afternoon, we will step out of the job."</p>
   <p>If the workers in an English business, or of any nationality came with a like request, they would simply be laughed at, and called crazy. But with us anything is possible. What would Geringer say if his typesetters suddenly arose and said: "Make us share holders in your business or we will not work!" But the workers of Geringer would not think of such an idea. In the first place, "Jesus" is a rich capitalist and no one dare oppose people of that class, but everyone has courage against a fellow-worker, or a firm which is financially weak. In the second place Geringer in his business has ruled and still rules with an iron hand. The workers in his plant are like so much machinery, whereas, with us the share-holder in the business works along side another worker; respects him as a fellow worker and allows him all the rights and privileges which he himself enjoys. For that, our typesetters repay us by coming forward with a proposition that they share in the business. To be sure, we know very well from which direction the wind blows.</p>
   <p>More than two months ago a deputation of our typesetters visited Mr. Albieri to offer him the Editorship. Because they were not shareholders with us, and the other papers evidently had not made them their agents, it is plainly to be seen that some of our typographers at that time were already working towards the founding of a new paper. In this work and preparation they progressed steadily, with the expectation that, Denni Hlasatel, and Svornost, would not sign an agreement with the Union as the conditions of the agreement were carried to extremes. In this event they wanted to come out with a new newspaper, raise a hue and cry and create a whirlwind of dust and publicity for themselves. They miscalculated. Bohemian newspapers, with the exception of Narod, signed the agreement and in that manner took the trumps away from our ambitious typesetters. The various articles of agreement were strictly adhered to by Denni Hlasatel and there remained nothing else for our dear typesetters to do except cast aside the Union mask behind which they hid, repudiate the agreement, make new demands which were impossible of fulfillment, and then quit work to found a newspaper for themselves.</p>
   <p>The ultimatum handed to us was signed by people, who had been employed by us for only a few months. It contained the name of a former shareholder who again wished to become a shareholder in our business; but who when, Denni Hlasatel was in its most difficult period had himself paid out and went to work for a rival paper. There are names on this ultimatum of persons with whom, should we associate would ruin our business, for which we struggled so fiercely, and on which we have worked for the past ten years.</p>
   <p>We are and will remain union. If the union lives up to its agreements and laws it will never have occasion for any action against us. We will not discharge any of our enterprising typesetters, and if any one of them wishes to return to work under union conditions he has an open road. But we will not divide with anyone. Even a beggar defends his bag with all his might if someone wants to take it.</p>
   <p>Our paper is union. All work on it is done by union labor. The entire present affair results from the fact that nine typesetters quit work without giving notice, handing us the previously mentioned ultimatum to the amusement of ourselves and the entire public, hoping, by that means to cover their decision to enter upon the publication of a new newspaper.</p>
   <p>When they have passed through the experiences and struggles, such as we have had to contend with, then let some one approach them with a demand such as they have made of us.</p>
   <p>They will give it to them!</p>
