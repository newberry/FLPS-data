   <p>Night school courses will be opened at the J. Sterling Morton High School, Cicero, Illinois. There is one class provided for the study of the Czech language. It will be conducted with the condition that at least twenty students enroll. Cicero is a predominantly Czech town with a mayor of Czech descent.....</p>
   <p>There is no use in teaching a child a foreign language up to his fourteenth year if he is to forget it later. The course is free..... Would it not be a shame for Cicero not to be able to muster out the minimum of only twenty students?</p>
