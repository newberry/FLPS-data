   <p>The school for citizenship will probably begin this week. The teachers will announce all particulars as to hours and places of instruction. The principal of the high school was requested to furnish teachers free of charge, and it is probable that this request will be granted.</p>
   <p>Urged by the president, the zoning laws were explained to the assembled members by Mr. Frank Matousek. According to the plan, as explained by the speaker, certain streets in Cicero will be reserved for factory uses, others will be residential. Complaints about the poor condition of 50th Avenue, north of 22nd Street, were given to the executive committee which will make efforts to have the street improved. Another complaint was made about school children who have to wait for the opening of the school building often until 8:45 A. M. and in all kinds of weather. Mr. Solar, who is a member of the School Board, was present when this complaint was made, and, urged by the president, gave explanations of why the school building is locked until that time. He assured the members that this practice will be discontinued [so that the school children may enter the buildings in bad weather].</p>
