   <p>Great interest is being shown among the Democratic voters in the Thirty-fourth Ward, as to who will represent the ward in the central body at this time when so many elections are taking place.</p>
   <p>The most popular candidate with the Czech voters is Mr. Josef Kacena, Junior, and his candidacy has been favorably received throughout the entire ward.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kacena is active among our people, and is as well liked in public life as he is in his private undertakings.</p>
   <p>There is still more than a month before election, but the many friends of Mr. Kacena, even now, are working feverishly to secure a victory for him.</p>
