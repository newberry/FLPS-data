   <p>Since our prohibitionists have received such important support as the signatures of Joliet prisoners, there is, of course, nothing else left but to make the entire state dry without any further delay. A Protestant reverend who is the chaplain of the Joliet penitentiary, induced twelve hundred prisoners to sign a petition requesting the state legislature to introduce prohibition in Illinois. Only about one hundred of them refused to sign, and those who did sign will hardly benefit the prohibitionists.</p>
   <p>As a result of their sentence to serve time in the state penitentiary, these prisoners have lost their civic rights and, according to the law, noncitizens have no right to ask the legislature for anything. But the prohibitionists will soon proclaim that the whole state must become dry when even twelve hundred Joliet prisoners have found it desirable.</p>
