   <p>Announcement is made to all Bohemian organizations and unions, that the Bohemian Printers Union No. 273, donated from its treasury fifty dollars for the benefit of striking butchers. If it becomes necessary and the strike is prolonged, the union will levy an assessment for the benefit of the strikers. Friends and workingmen, it now depends upon you to govern yourselves according to the example of the Painters' Union because every union workingman will realize that should the butchers' strike be lost our unions will be lost at the same time. Therefore, brothers, help is unavoidable, for misery appears from all directions. With brotherly greeting from Bohemian Painters' Union No. 273.</p>
   <p>Frank Zelibor, Sec.</p>
