   <p>Voters of the Twelfth Ward evidently came to the conclusion that they would put to a test in their own ward the old proverb "a new broom always sweeps clean". The incumbent, Alderman Joseph I. Novak, is a man of merit, and has distinguished himself in the City Council; but, nevertheless, a great majority of the voters decided upon and voted for new alderman, Mr. Joseph Cepak. Mr. Cepak's reputableness is unquestioned; and it is expected that he, as alderman, will prove his ability to the best interests of his ward. Mr. Cepak received 6,128 votes, of which 4,333 votes were from men, and 1,795 from women. Mr. Novak received 2,256 votes. [Translator's note: The Twelfth Ward is preponderantly inhabited by Bohemian immigrants or Bohemian-Americans.]</p>
