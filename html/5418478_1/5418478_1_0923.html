   <p>The local newspaper, Record, has been lately agitating very hard, to gain new subscribers among our countrymen; and in order to attract them more easily, it places on the front page from time to time some tasteless and senseless event, taken out of public life. It never misses an opportunity to molest the Bohemians, and consistently has mentioned for the last few days, that the Poles and Bohemians maintain a special school for perjury, in which are trained witnesses, on how to give false evidence in the courts, how to proceed with mendacious complaints against the city for damages, injuries, etc. This kind of scoundrelism will empower the Poles and Bohemians to proceed in courts with complaints for slander against the Record and against Mr. Ryan, the lawyer, and we will have enough proof to bring them to the Grand Jury. We can't deny that it can happen that, here and there, some of our people will enter with a less substantial claim, being persuaded by his lawyer to do it; nevertheless it is a disgrace when the Record asserts that the Poles and Bohemians conduct a special "school," where the witnesses are instructed how to swear falsely.</p>
   <p>We are sure that Mr. Ryan and the reporters, who are on the Record in close <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>contact with the Bohemians, would be able to find among their own country-men, Irishmen, a greater number of similar cases than among the citizens of other nationalities.</p>
