   <p>The regular election of officers of the Union of American Musicians, a national organization with offices on South Clark Street, directly opposite the Federal Building, was held last Tuesday. There were two candidates for the office of president: our countryman, Mr. F. Lhotak, the well-known musician, and a non-Bohemian who had held the office prior to Mr. Lhoták's term.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lhoták was re-elected by a vote of 326 to 240. To be elected president of a body as large and important as this Union is indeed a signal honor, and we are happy to be able to congratulate Mr. Lhoták on the confidence and prestige he enjoys among the musicians of America....</p>
