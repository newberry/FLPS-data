   <p>This is the name of a new organization, founded this November the 20th. The main purpose of this organization is to unite all different factions in one strong body and to organize a large and strong labor party, which would then be able to demand the improvement of existence of all working people through the ballot. The power of the oppressed can be reached only by uniting them. Thus their party will solve the main problem to provide better for the working classes, to avoid in the future starving individuals on one side and millionaires on the other.</p>
   <p>The last meeting on last Sunday was abundantly visited by members and guests, whom all are well informed about the purposes of the party.</p>
   <p>Completing the internal business part of the organization, we will start at once to agitate among our countrymen and to open similar sections in other Bohemian populated districts of Chicago, and later on, outside of our city. The membership is open for every workingman whose desire is to end thehardship of the working Bohemian population.</p>
