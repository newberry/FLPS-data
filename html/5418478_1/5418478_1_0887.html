   <p>p. 1--Yesterday the money collected on the "big tag-day" was divided among thirty-one charitable associations, namely children's and old people's homes and institutions.</p>
   <p>Mrs. W. Scott Thurber, president of the Chicago Children's Benefit League, which sponsored this tag-day, make a public statement of the amount of money collected which was $54,324.77. All this money was turned over to institutions to be used in caring for the poor and the orphan children of Chicago. The largest amount, $3,137.40 was given to the Chicago Refuge for Girls, and the smallest amount was assigned to the South End Center Day Nursery.</p>
   <p>Catholic and Protestant organizations received money for the care of their orphans, and the Norwegian Orphanage also received a share; but the Bohemian Orphanage was completely forgotten! The committee had no knowledge of the Bohemian Orphanage, and therefore it received nothing.</p>

   <p>Yet the Bohemians contributed their share on this tag-day; but for all the help and the support which they accorded to make it a magnificent success they reaped no reward.</p>
