   <p>The Bohemian Democratic Club of the 9th Ward held a special meeting last night.</p>
   <p>At the meeting, they unanimously nominated Mr. Ed. J. Novak of the 19th ward as candidate for the lower House of Representatives for the fifth district. Since the Bohemian Club of the 19th ward will have a special ticket in the field with a Bohemian delegation, it would be fitting that our Democratic citizens attend the primaries which will be held tomorrow.</p>
