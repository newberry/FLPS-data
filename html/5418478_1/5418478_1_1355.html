   <p>The voters of the Tenth Ward are facing the fact that their ward will be represented by only one alderman, and the Czechoslovak citizens of this ward are facing the danger that the present Alderman Frank Klaus may be their last representative in the City Council. Our Plzen (Pilsen, a district preponderately inhabited by Bohemians), which was the cradle of our political activity, had its first Bohemian alderman a long time ago, and ever since that time, our countrymen have had their own representative in the City Council. But recently, conditions changed to such an extent that the Tenth Ward may be represented by only one alderman, and the Czechslovak citizens of our Pilsen settlement may lose their only alderman.</p>

   <p>Alderman Frank Klaus' term will expire this spring, and he is seeking reelection. But Alderman James McNichols, whose term does not expire until a year from now, is also running for the office of alderman. The reason why Alderman McNichols acts so unreasonably is the fact that the City of Chicago will probably be divided into fifty wards, and therefore in order to secure his place in the City Council, in case of such a redivision, he is running for the office of alderman now, to the detriment of his colleague.</p>
   <p>It certainly is a peculiar picture that our ward politics present--a man who is supposed to serve another year is prematurely seeking a new term. But if he succeeds, the Tenth Ward will be represented by only one alderman, whereas all the other wards will have two, and the Czechoslovak element and the south part of the Tenth Ward would be without representation. If the citizenry wishes to attain such an end by its politics, it can stay away from the polling places a week from tomorrow, and by its negligence be guilty of allowing our Plzen to be without a Bohemian alderman during the next two years, or probably forever. But if it is of importance to our people to have <span class="page-break">3</span>a Bohemian alderman in the City Council, then it is the duty of every voter to see that Alderman Klaus is re-elected. He proved to be a good and active alderman, and if both political parties are against him, that is more reason why the people should support him. His activity is generally recognized not only by our ward, but also by organizations which followed his activities in the City Council. The Municipal Voters' League recently published the following proclamation:</p>
   <p>"Citizens of the Tenth Ward may be proud of the development of Alderman Frank Klaus' activities in the City Council. It warrants the faith which the Americans have in their institutions. When fifteen years ago he began his work as alderman, many people doubted that he would be able to tender any real service to his ward and to the city. His political environment was unfavorable, but he finally arrived at the conviction that an alderman should represent the people and not the political bosses. Toward this direction he focused his activity, until he became a worthy alderman, much more energetic and much more sincere than many other aldermen who force their personalities ahead.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Both political parties are working against him for the simple reason that he refused to vote according to the wishes and dictates of the political bosses. His struggle is very difficult. Every voter in the Tenth Ward who has red blood in his veins should support and vote for Alderman Klaus."</p>
