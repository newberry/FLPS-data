   <p>In the next meeting of the City Council, the Mayor will probably make recommendations on the members of the School board. It is very important for us that one of the members be of Czech stock. In former times, we always were certain of having one of our countrymen on the board. Under the administration of Mayor Thompson, however, we did not rely upon the chance of a similar appointment, though we felt entitled to it. The Czech friends of the Mayor ought to make clear to him that the appointment is not a mere affair of politics, but an acknowledgement of the rights of citizens and taxpayers, who form an important part of the community, and who demand adequate representation.</p>
