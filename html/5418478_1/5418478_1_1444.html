   <p>Chicago Bohemians are progressing. Their growth is not only numerical, but they can be found in all branches of public life. The number of our industrial and business enterprises is increasing. Bohemian property is assuming gigantic proportions, and Bohemians are now looked upon with respect in American circles. In politics, we are reaching the position which belongs to us in accordance with our numbers and our abilities. Bohemians have held many important offices, and in the majority of cases with honor to themselves and their nationality. Now an opportunity is being offered to us, to send the first Bohemian Congressman to Washington to place a countryman in an office, such as no Bohemian in America has ever held. We have desired this for a long time, and now our desires are to be fulfilled.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian element is so strongly represented in the fifth Congressional district, that the election of a Bohemian candidate, and a Democrat at that, is assured. Now the most important question for us is to select a candidate, one who will not only win in the primaries and be nominated, but who will guarantee that he will work <span class="page-break">2</span>honorably and capably while in office at Washington. The candidacy most talked about of late is that of Mr. Karl Vopicka, the well known countryman and president of the Bohemian brewing company, Atlas.</p>
