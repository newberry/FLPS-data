   <p>Fifty years ago, it was the Bohemian Slavonic Rifle Company in the State of Illinois which first offered its services to President Lincoln to help keep the Union intact and abolish slavery. Today, again, our brave Sokols are rallying behind the Star Spangled Banner to prove that they are in the front of all others. We may have faults and deficiencies just as have all other nationalities in the large complex of the United States. There is, however, one trait to which we may always point with pride. It is the sincerity and earnestness with which we regard the oath that binds us to the vital interests of this great republic, with its destiny, and better future. This is, in the last analysis, the best testimony that can be given the American Czechs.</p>
