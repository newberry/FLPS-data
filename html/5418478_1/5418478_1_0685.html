   <p>P.1--Chicago may well cherish the strong hope that sometime after next Sunday it will become the most moral city on the globe. It has just been decided to appoint a commission whose duty it will be to swat everything which might offend our moral sensibilities. Mayor Busse, has been intrusted with the task of forming such a commission, and it will consist of fifteen morals-mongers of both sexes. Mr. Busse is highly pleased to have been thus honored, and he has declared himself ready to do, whatever may be asked of him. We, however, merely point to the Chicago Women's Temperance Union, from which some members of the commission are to be selected.</p>
