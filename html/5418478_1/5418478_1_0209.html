   <p>Every thoughtful citizen is very much pleased when he hears of the great desire of Bohemians to acquire an education. When he hears that Bohemian parents are thoroughly mindful of their children's education according to their means.</p>
   <p>In Chicago 25,000 Bohemians should take pride in the number of youths attending institutions of learning. Last year (5) five Bohemians attending "Grammar School" distinguished themselves with such extraordinary diligence, they were admitted to the High School.</p>
   <p>They were F. J. Patera, Jos. Koupeny, B. Novy, K. Wilen, and John Traotina. So far as is known they are thoughtful, ambitious youngsters who no doubt will serve their country to the honor of our nationality.</p>
