   <p>The Chicago School Board, which is controlled by Mayor Thompson, had to submit to the pressure of public opinion, finally. It has administered a regular "kick" to His Majesty from the House of Hohenzollern by banning the page containing the Kaiser story from the schoolbooks.</p>
   <p>This victory of the populace of Chicago should not be taken as final. The affair ought to have an aftermath. The Kaiser has admirers not only in Chicago, but they are dotting the entire United States, and school-books all over the Union are teeming with articles disseminating pro-German tendencies. Radical steps should be taken by discerning Chicago citizens to initiate a widespread campaign to extirpate the puffy signals to the "Vaterland" (Fatherland) which, in the course of years, have been so cunningly planted in the schoolbooks. The American public has been by far too indulgent in regard to this matter, but it is luckily becoming aware of the fact that its tolerance was bestowed not only on an unworthy object, but on an extremely dangerous one, and that it is necessary to block the propaganda decisively.</p>
