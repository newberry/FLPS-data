   <p>Taking issue with the attacks directed against us during the recent strikes of the garment workers, we feel under an obligation to state our side of the case. What has been done to us was unjust. We suffered and bore it without complaint, though we knew it to be false. Now we want to let the public know the truth.</p>
   <p>The strike has been taken advantage of by a great number of people who are totally indifferent toward the welfare of the working-men and who seized the opportunity, created by the general confusion, to climb upon the back of the worker and grab what they could get away with. To banish any thought that we might purposely omit names, we proclaim openly that we mean the people of the Spravedlnost, when we refer to those who give preference to their own interests over the welfare of the striking workers. It was foremost in thier mind to <span class="page-break">2</span>help put their decaying paper upon its feet. Had they riveted their attention to the questions that were paramount in importance, the strike would have taken a somewhat different turn.</p>
   <p>We have bent our efforts toward truthful reporting, carefully refraining from mentioning news of a nature inciting to unrest, for we are well aware of the difficulties that mar the results of arbitration in negotiations with men under the influence of violent emotions. At the same time, we know well enough that it is more profitable to rouse a crowd to a high pitch of fanaticism, wait for the crucial moment, and then to retreat, leaving others in the front. Such were the tactics employed by the Spraveldnost.</p>
   <p>From the very beginning of the strike we have made it a rule not to accept advertisements concerning the workers, never minding the <span class="page-break">3</span>antagonistic sentiment we thus aroused against ourselves among the strikers, as we contemplated the predicament of many a small contractor fighting for his existence; but our pacifistic efforts were not appreciated by him either.</p>
   <p>In the strikers' meetings little was said for the useful information of the workers; most of the time was spent in harassing the crowd and getting subscribers for the Spravedlnost, Mr. Balvin, chairman of the strike committee, never lets an opportunity pass to yell his field cry, "I am a Socialist, and I work for Socialism!" Mr. Kostka, of the Spravedlnost, is another leader who works for his own salvation, just as Mr. Balvin "works for Socialism" and not for the good of the workmen.</p>
   <p>The Czech tailors will keep on thinking of this strike with a bitter taste in their mouths. The management of the strike was, on the whole, <span class="page-break">4</span>conducted in an able manner and with some sincerity; the meetings, however, were usually polluted by speakers and others who had no business to be present. This dampened the spirits of those seriously concerned and discouraged men cannot win a strike. The Czech workers certainly know their duties better than those of any other nation, but it is not the Spravedlnost that is responsible for this fact. That paper took the strike into its own hands and brought it to its conclusion - a glaring failure.</p>
   <p>We wish to call the attention of the public to the direction in which the flood of editorial and forensic abuse was hurled against the Denni Hlasatel only, for other papers, e.g., the Narod, which had taken a pronounced anti-strike attitude, were left unmolested. Why? They draw few subscribers and so are harmless. In the beginning of the strike we lost, through the Spravedlnost's agitation, about 150 subscribers, most of whom have returned to us, now that they see the light.</p>
