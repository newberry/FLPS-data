   <p>An ardent campaign is being agitated among the Bohemian Catholics, in opposition to the new school laws which have been proposed in the State Legislature. A meeting of Bohemian Catholics, which is to take place in the St. Prokop parish school, 18th and Allport Sts, has been called for this afternoon. The meeting and its purpose will be announced, during the morning services, in all local Bohemian Catholic Churches. This movement is already in full force among the German Catholics. Among others, Theodore B. Thiell, chief director in this battle, on the part of the German Catholics, will speak at the meeting this afternoon. The Catholics are opposed to the placing of various schools under State supervision and also to the distribution of school books, free of cost, to all children.</p>
