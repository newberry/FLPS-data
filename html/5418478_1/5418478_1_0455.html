   <p>In a meeting of the City Council of Chicago held yesterday, our Aldermen, John Toman and Joseph Kostner of the 34th Ward, presented a resolution which is emphatically challenging the City Council to take steps to induce the State Legislature to repeal its decision concerning the National Prohibition Amendment, and which started the National Prohibition. The resolution was referred to the judicial committee. In it it is claimed that the Eighteenth Amendment was accepted during the time when our country was in a state of great excitement, and when our people did not have sufficient opportunity to consider such an important and extraordinary new matter. It is asserted that the Eighteenth Amendment is a violation of personal liberty and the States' independence, and that until the time when the Supreme Court will decide on its constitutionality, all the citizens ought to aid the officers in the enforcement of this law. The resolution is also asking that the copies of it be sent to Governor <span class="page-break">\2</span>[Frank] Lowden, to the speaker of the House of Representatives and to the chairman of the State Senate.</p>
   <p>The main purpose of this resolution, proposed by the Aldermen John Toman and Joseph Kostner, is that this question of prohibition should be decided by a referendum.</p>
   <p>The Aldermen also made it clear that they are interested in seeing to it that the sale of beer and light wine is made legal. Alderman Anton Čermák, chairman of the judicial committee, to which the resolution was referred, and also most of its members, proved in different matters that they are of the same liberal opinion, and it is surely expected that the resolution will be approved by them, and will be recommended to the City Council for its acceptance.</p>
