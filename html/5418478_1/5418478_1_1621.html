   <p>The recount of the votes given the aldermanic candidates of the 29th Ward on April 4 was completed yesterday. The Republican candidate, Alderman Mathias A. Mueller, incumbent, received twenty votes more than our countryman, Felix B. Janovsky, the Democratic candidate. The special committee, consisting of Aldermen Anton J. Cermak, Bauler, and Snow will not make its report on the recount to the elections committee of the City Council before next week, and it is expected that it will be several weeks before a definite decision is made by the City Council in this contest.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen, who make up a large portion of the residents in the twenty-ninth Ward, and who followed the progress of the recount with such great interest, are, to the utmost, unpleasantly surprised with the result as announced last night.</p>
