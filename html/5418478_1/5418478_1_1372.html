   <p>The election of trustees of the school board will be held on April 21. The city of Cicero is growing by leaps and bounds, and so is the entire West Side. It will be necessary to devote more attention to the management of the schools than has been done before. For this reason, a greater number of Czechs should be elected to the school board. Frank J. Petru, our fellow-countryman, has yielded to the urgent demands of representatives of our language element and to a petition containing over eight hundred Czech and other Slavonic names, and has decided to become a candidate for the office of trustee. We wish to mention that the office is an honorary one with no emolument attached to it, and no political obligations either--just as it always should be.</p>
   <p>It is of paramount importance for our countrymen to appear at the polls, which will be open from 6 A. M. to 4 P. M., to cast their votes for Frank J. Petru, and to ignore completely handbills presented to them by the opposition.</p>
