   <p>The rumor is gaining more and more strength that the responsibility for the bankruptcy of the house of Robert Pitte &amp; Son is going to be attached to Robert Pitte, the father. Influential political friends of Pitte's son have taken steps to see him exonerated. He is a former alderman of the 20th Ward, and now holds office as a member of the Cook County Civil Service Commission. It is being pointed out that his office took up Pitte's time to such an extent that he could not do justice to the duties accruing from his father's business, and therefore, could hardly be taken to account for irregularities that occurred while he was absent.</p>
   <p>It is not within our authority to pass judgment; that is the business of the jurors before whom the Pittes will have to appear, sooner or later. But we warn certain people not to attempt to clog the wheels of justice. We shall spare no ink, but take those under the limelight who want to cover up activities that smell different from Eau de Cologne.</p>
