   <p>P.1--We announce to all the Bohemians of Chicago that we have founded a co-operative society under the name of Cesky Bazar (Bohemian Bazaar). For this enterprise ten thousand share have been issued, valued at ten dollars a share, a total capital of one hundred thousand dollars. The shares are issued in small denomination in order to enable even the poorest to secure one or more of them and thus become a part-owner of the Bazaar.</p>
   <p>Only one member of a family is entitled to receive one or more shares, and no one may subscribe more than $10,000. Thus individual control is made impossible.</p>
   <p>The shares will be paid for in two installments, the first to be due as soon as all the shares are subscribed, the second when the purchasing for the Bazaar begins.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Bazaar will consist of and deal through the following departments: clothing, yard-goods, footwear, and men's and women's furnishings.</p>
   
   <p>It will sell all sorts of fashionable ladies' apparel, curtains, rugs, furniture, household goods, stoves of all kinds, groceries, and in general everything included in the stocks of department-stores.</p>
   <p>It is a pleasure to us to announce that this good idea has taken root, and that a great number of shares have already been subscribed for. But more shareholders are needed to make it possible to begin our work. We further inform the public that each shareholder will enjoy special purchasing advantages in all departments besides the yearly dividend which he will receive, and at the same time he will remain an owner, according to our charter, for ninety-nine years, so that perhaps even the third generation will enjoy the benefits of this enterprise.</p>
   <p>Do not, therefore, lose such an opportunity. Sign up at the next meeting of the Cesky Bazar! The meetings are held regularly at 8 p.m. in the hall of the Plzensky Sokol.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>The Promotion Committee.</p>
