   <p>P.1--A beautiful school-building has been erected on Central Park Avenue beside St. Agnes's Church, a testimony to the pride which Bohemian Catholics take in their schools. Yesterday the foundation of the school was celebrated, and a large number of societies, some in uniform, took part in the ceremony. The church, the school, and the adjacent streets were lavishly decorated with flags. A passageway embowered with green branches led to the entrance of the school, and along this the procession passed, headed by Father Molitor, archiepiscopal counsellor, who performed the rite of consecration. After the official celebration those in attendance removed to the near-by garden, where an entertainment was presented.</p>
