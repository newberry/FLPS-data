   <p>Instructions in the Bohemian language continues satisfactorily at Harrison High School. There are forty-nine new pupils in two classes, and 123 in all five classes--a considerable number. Of course, it could be much larger if it were not for various circumstances limiting the attendance. For instance, pupils of technical courses are not admitted in foreign-language classes. For others the schedule of hours interferes, the Bohemian classes taking place at times when the would-be enrollees are occupied by their regular studies.</p>
   <p>I wish to invite the attention of our public to the fact that all high school subjects will be taught in the night classes at Harrison High School. There will be also an advanced course in the Bohemian language and literature. But this course will be offered only if there is a sufficient number of students.</p>
   <p>There are many of those among us who did not have an opportunity to complete their education while in the old country. The knowledge of the Bohemian <span class="page-break">\2</span>language is very important from the practical point of view to our businessmen, lawyers, physicians, etc! Do not fail to enroll if your are interested in seeing this course in operation!</p>
