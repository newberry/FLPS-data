   <p>The printing plant of Narod is closed today, because the Benedictines did not sign an agreement with the Bohemian Typographical Union. At yesterday's meeting of this union, the strike was called. Narod thus far has not been a union shop, though its typesetters have become members of the union.</p>
   <p>The strikers ask the support of the public.</p>
