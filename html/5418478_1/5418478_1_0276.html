   <p>It gives us pleasure to report that the enrollment of students in classes of the Bohemian language to be held in Harrison (formerly Farragut) High School is very satisfactory. Two new classes of over twenty-five students each have been formed, increasing the total of those who learn the Bohemian language there to more than ninety. There were more applicants, but not all of them could be accepted.</p>
   <p>The Medill High School received over thirty applications. However, since there was no competent teacher readily available, and no hours could be agreed upon which would be satisfactory to a large enough number of students, the organization of classes and instruction had to be postponed. Arrangements are now in progress which will make it possible to accommodate all applicants at the start of the next school year. Parents are cautioned, however, to apply in advance for the acceptance of their children.</p>
   
   <p>So far, instruction in the Bohemian language is offered in the Harrison High School only, at Spaulding Avenue near 24th Street. Next year, classes will be formed in all high schools in which a sufficient number of students applies....</p>
