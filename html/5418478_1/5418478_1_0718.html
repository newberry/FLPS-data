   <p>Mayor Thompson may feel gratified with the behavior of the School Board appointed by him. The Board, like the Mayor, is avoiding everything that might possibly hurt the feelings of the Germans, here and abroad, and it is striving to show that Chicago really is "the sixth largest German city in the world," as the Mayor put it. We have no School Board--we have a German "Schulrat"!</p>
   <p>The Board rejected a proposal by Mr. Czarnecki by seven votes to three. Mr. Czarnecki's motion demanded that the parents of one hundred thirty thousand Chicago school children be requested and encouraged to tear the page containing the offensive "Kaiser story" from the books. Still another motion by Mr. Czarnecki was defeated proposing that the superintendents of the various schools prepare a list of the names of all parents who refuse to tear out the page; the list is to be submitted to the Government for further action. The Board passed a motion by Superintendent Shoop purporting the removal of fully forty pages from seventy thousand school books; the remainder of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>schoolbooks are to be used in the eighth grade only. Among the forty pages to be torn out is the one containing the "Kaiser story." Mr. Czarnecki pointed out the inconsequence of such proceedings, but his objection was overruled.</p>
   <p>The meeting was a stormy one.....Mrs. Snodgrass declared that by suggesting to a child to tear out the page it is taught a destructive practice which is related to anarchism. Mrs. Thornton, another member, concurred in this opinion, and added that when she was a little girl, she was being constantly warned against spoiling or damaging anything. To this Mr. Czarnecki answered "We cannot fight against the Kaiser with gloves on. He alone, is responsible for the innumerable murders...."</p>
   <p>The whole matter was referred to Mr. Shoop, who declared that the issue is too difficult and delicate a matter to be decided upon precipitately.</p>
   <p>The ladies and gentlemen now dominating the School Board had intended to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>distribute a few juicy plums in the form of well paid jobs, but in view of the impending criticism from the public, they postponed further action.</p>
