   <p>It is necessary that our Czechoslovak voters understand that in order for Mr. Anton J. Cermak to gain the nomination for the office of president as well as a member of the County Board of Commissioners, two crosses must be made on the primary ballot--one for his candidacy as president of the said Board, and another for his membership on the same board. If, for instance, Mr. Cermak gained his nomination for the office of president and lost the nomination for the office of a member, the former nomination would be worthless for the simple reason that, not having been nominated as a member of the Board, he can not become the president of it. This fact must be kept in mind when you mark your ballot..... In the seventh place on the ballot you will also find the name of Mr. Josef Mendl; every Czechoslovak man and woman should affix a cross before that name.....</p>
