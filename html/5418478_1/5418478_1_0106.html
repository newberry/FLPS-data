   <p>The foes of the teachers' federation claim that the best interests of the Chicago schools are being harmed because, they say, the federation antagonizes the teachers against the School Board. There may be some truth in this, provided it is justified to call "antagonizing" the federation's attempts to protect the interests of the taxpayers by opposing the leasing of school ground at ridiculously low prices. Even if the federation has been against the Board in other matters, as well as fighting for more money for the teachers, we are unable to see in it anything harmful to the children. But it certainly was extremely harmful when, before the federation came into existence, the teachers were without any protection and had to depend on the influence and good graces of politicians.</p>
