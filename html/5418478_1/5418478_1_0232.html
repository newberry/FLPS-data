   <p>Prof. J. V. Nigrin of Harrison High School declares that many responsible Americans have arrived at the conclusion that immigrant children who have been "Anglicized" here are not necessarily "Americanized." In brief, the language alone cannot perform the assimilation. The national traits of the various immigrants cannot be removed and simply substituted by purely American characteristics. Gradual, smooth methods in Americanization will surely bear the best fruits.</p>
   <p>The study of foreign languages is not detrimental to sane American sentiment. On the contrary, it is helpful to Americanization in that it facilitates the association with, and the approach to, the virgin immigrant clay. In this manner our future fellow citizens can be better instructed about this country and their duties towards it.</p>
   <p>An article in this vein, written by Professor Nigrin, is printed in the latest</p>
