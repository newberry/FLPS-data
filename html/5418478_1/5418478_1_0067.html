   <p>A new school is going to be built near Crawford Avenue between 17th and 19th Streets to relieve the congestion in Penn School on West 16th Street and South Harding Avenue. The cost of the building is estimated at $320,000. The need of a new school in that district has long been recognized, but nothing was done until Alderman John Toman took energetic action to help the neighborhood which is strongly populated with Czechs.</p>
   <p>The John Sprye School on West 24th Street and South Marshall Boulevard, shall also be relieved of supernumerous pupils by an appropriate addition. Respective resolutions have been passed by the school board.</p>
