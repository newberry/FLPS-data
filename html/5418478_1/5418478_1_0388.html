   <p>The meeting of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) was held [yesterday]. President Josef Tichava opened the meeting. All of the officers of the Federation and many of the delegates were present. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read.</p>
   <p>A letter was read from the patronat (board of trustees) of the school of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky(Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), situated in Town of Lake [in Chicago]. The trustees, in referring to payment of tuition, informed the Federation that they were not officially advised as to the rules of making such payments to the Federation; they also mentioned the great expense they have incurred in having their school building and their classrooms cleaned and redecorated. It was decided to send them a letter. The delegate <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of the Jan Amos Komensky School complained about the great hardships that school has in meeting the obligatory school fees; the delegate argued that the school management lacked funds, but in spite of their financial struggle they turned one third of their tuition fees over to the Federation. A report was made concerning a school picnic-excursion of the Spolky school on west 18th Street. [It was decided] to permit the management to retain the surplus from receipts ($7.37) which is to be used by the school in the next entertainment given for the children.</p>
   <p>The bindery bill for $138.75 submitted by Mr. Safranek was ordered paid, but the economics committee will first audit the items. Mrs. Radesinsky made a motion that registration for the [fall] semester be set for September 2, [1922]; this was approved and the school children will enroll on that day.</p>
   <p>Applications for teachers' jobs were referred to the executive committee to be passed on. A lively debate followed the introduction of a motion specifying that the free thought ideas be propagated by the teaching staff. Dr. Mueller <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>agreed with Mr. Jelinek who insists upon a more systematic presentation of free thought principles, and will gladly co-operate to that end.</p>
   <p>The entertainment committee for the Staroceske Posviceni (Old Czech Festival) to be held by the Federation on September 17, 1922, submitted its reports which were approved. It was decided that the treasurer, Dr. Mueller, pay all the bills connected with the arrangements for this festival.</p>
   <p>The receipts for August 19, 1922, were as follows: From the T. G. Masaryk School, $150.00; dues from the Illinois Grand Lodge of the Cesks-Slovanska Bratrska A Podporujici Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Fraternal and Benevolent Union), $51.05; from the Socialni Sekce Zen Cislo 2 (Women's Social Section No. 2), $3.50; total receipts $204.55. Disbursements: Bindery bill to Mr. Safranek, $138.75.</p>
