   <p>The Bohemian community in Chicago is growing in a gratifying manner. It is increasing numerically; it is getting stronger economically; it is even, to a certain extent, improving intellectually. But there is one respect in which it is gradually surpassing other Bohemian communities in the United States--in public scandals and the rather well-known stool pigeon and informant affairs. In this the Bohemian colony in Chicago is rapidly gaining a supremacy which will by no means be envied by our close and more distant neighbors. What good does it do to try to make other nationalities more acquainted with the better qualities of the Bohemian element if, on the other hand, we permit the luxuriation in our own midst of such an obnoxious weed--a weed which is slowly poisoning the atmosphere in which we live? This is a phenomenon worth pondering by all sensible people.</p>
