   <p>P.4--The Reverend Duncan C. Milner recently delivered a lecture on "Law Enforcement," in which he pointed out the importance of the next election. He expects a mayor to be elected who will have "backbone enough" to see to it that the laws will be followed to the letter. What Pastor Milner has in mind when he refers to the laws is perfectly well known, and he himself makes no bones of it. He is explicit. We quote him verbatim:</p>
   <p>"Abolish the saloon, and all the smut, the lewdness, and the obscenity will vanish with it. This monster cannot be leashed and tamed; it must be annihilated. Why, it has been revealed that dealings in liquor lie at the bottom of the corruption in the city hall recently exposed."</p>
   <p>The only point on which the pastor needs to be corrected is his opinion on what type of man should be sought for to succeed Busse. Chicago indubitably needs for this office a man whose reputation is known to be above reproach, who will do his duty without thought of personal gain, and who posseses the confidence of the voters to a sufficient degree to insure his election. But the Reverend Mr. Milner demands the rejection of any candidate who declares before the election that he will not prosecute "certain violators" of the law. The pastor may, however, rest assured that no man will, for the time being, be elected either mayor or State's attorney whose views on the Sunday-closing law do not coincide with the opinion of the overwhelming majority of our fellow-citizens.</p>
   <p>A metropolis of Chicago's character and significance, can intrust the management of its affairs only to a man who is free from the yoke of obscurantism, retrogression, and hypocrisy. If the opposite thing should happen, it would be a crime against the welfare of the city and a mistake, for which we should have to pay quickly and dearly. There is no dearth of men in Chicago who could hold the office of mayor with honor to themselves and for the good of the city, and it is equally true that some man of this character should devote all his time and his energy to the promotion of public welfare. We have only to knock at the right door.</p>
