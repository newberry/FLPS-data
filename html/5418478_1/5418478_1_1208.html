   <p>Last night's news from Washington, D. C., that Professor T. G. Masaryk advocates the recognition of the Bolshevik Republic of Russia, has had the effect of a cold shower upon numerous Czech-American fanatics and ignoramuses who have, up to the present, been stubbornly keeping their eyes shut to the fact that the great majority of the Russian people agree with, and support, the principles and tactics of the Bolsheviks, regardless of their character and qualities. These people [Czech-American fanatics] will not admit that it is not up to us to dictate to the Russian people which form of government they should choose.</p>
   <p>Many people expected that, as soon as he arrived here from Russia, Masaryk would give the Bolsheviks a sound thrashing. If our leader uttered an opinion which tallies with the attitude assumed by us from the very beginning of the <span class="page-break">2</span>social--the October--revolution, then this fact will gain in significance, for the reason that when Masaryk entered Russia he did not enter as a friend of the Bolsheviks. Masaryk, on the contrary, went to Russia, believing that the socialist revolutionary regime headed by Kerensky and the Bolshevik movement were transitory fits of radicalism from which Russia would recuperate soon, and that conservative liberalism, represented by Miljukov, would in good time be at the helm again.</p>
   <p>Masaryk, like so many others, labored under the delusion that the days of the Bolshevik rule were numbered. Its fall has been persistently predicted from November up to now, yet Lenin and Trotsky are still firmly in the saddle. Their theories and methods may or may not be to our liking. Nevertheless, it would be foolish and meaningless to convince ourselves by autosuggestion that a reaction is within sight.</p>
   <p>The antagonistic spirit against the Bolsheviks pervading our Czech-American press is founded on the belief that the Bolsheviks were those who demoralized <span class="page-break">3</span>the Russian army for the express purpose of inducing a separate peace, and that their leaders are accepting bribes from Germany for furthering this aim. This latter accusation is not being given serious thought anywhere today; the first charge, however, still retains its validity. The fact remains that an irresistible yearning for peace has seized upon the mass of the Russian army who had no inkling of an idea of what Bolshevism is. It was the convinced Bolsheviks who tried to prevent the Germans from advancing toward the Dvinsk region, and whose efforts were stultified by undisciplined hordes of Russian peasant soldiers who dashed for their homes in utter disorder, ransacking whenever they had a chance. No government in this world, no party whatever, could have prevented the Russian people from forcing an end to the war which it was morally incapable of pursuing.</p>
   <p>Some silly people maintain that Kerensky could have retained his hold on the Russian government had he had some of the chief Bolsheviks shot. Yet Kornilov had whole battalions of Bolsheviks shot, with the only result that he was persecuted as an outlaw and had to keep in hiding to escape the same fate as befell General Dutov.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Some arguments against Bolshevism that have gained currency among us were absolutely infantile and preposterous. Many declared steadfastly that Trotsky's real name was Bronstein, and Lenin's was Zederblum. This latter contention is a blunt lie, for Lenin used the name of Zederblum as an alias to escape persecution by the Czar's government, and he comes really from ancient Russian aristocratic ancestry. Even if all these allegations were true, that still would not convict the Bolshevik party of treason against the Russian people. For instance, it is also true that the leader of the enemies of the Bolshevik party was a man by the name of Schroeder, the mayor of Petrograd. Other objectors assert that it was the Jews who deposed the Kerensky government; yet Kerensky himself was of Jewish descent.</p>
   <p>It certainly does not behoove us Czechs to take umbrage at such trifles. Such insignificant arguments should not be advanced by a people which was awakened to national consciousness by a man named Jungmann, and for whose practical politics Rieger laid the foundations--a people whose most modern political history was written by Eim--a people whose greatest financial economist was Kaizl, <span class="page-break">5</span>minister of finance in the Austrian government, and whose leader in its greatest political organization is Scheiner, while the Jew Stransky has for years been directing Czech politics in Moravia.

   <p>We must make an alliance even with the devil, if only it will serve to defeat the Germans. That is the main thing. Let Bolshevik principles be as repulsive as they may; as long as they contribute to the downfall of militarism, it would be foolish to oppose them obstinately and vainly.</p>
   <p>The stronger the Bolshevik government grows, the more effectively it will resist German militarism, and the nearer will victory come within the grasp of democracy. The best way the Allies can help the Soviet government is to recognize it officially.</p>
   <p>If England can recognize the government of the White Guard of Finland, which plays into the hands of the Germans and fights the Allies at Murmansk, there <span class="page-break">6</span>is certainly every reason to recognize the Bolshevik government, the sworn enemy of the German ideology.</p>
   <p>This fact was unknown to Masaryk [until he went to Russia], and because he is a grand man, he did not hesitate to voice his opinion, in spite of his being opposed to Bolshevism, as is an overwhelming majority among us.</p>
