   <p>The Bohemian member of the Board of Education, Mr. Kristian R. Walleck, created a big stir among the Germans in Chicago when he entered a motion, during the last year, to introduce Bohemian and other foreign languages into the schools visited by fifty percent of foreign pupils. Nevertheless the Bohemians and other nationalities were thankful for it.</p>
   <p>Now, while this motion is under deliberation and Mr. Walleck endeavors very zealously to pass it through, decreasing even the percentage of foreign pupils to thirty percent, his work is really so much more meritorious. All Bohemian societies have acknowledged his activity and at the meeting of May 11th, the presidium of the club "Lipany" No. 199 made a resolution to express to Mr. Walleck a strong public approval for his efforts with the Board of Education to introduce the Bohemian language in the school program.</p>
   <p>As we have known Mr. Walleck for a long time, we believe that his efforts are honest; his intentions are generous and all his endeavors in this direction are real and actual. It is really surprising that there is somebody <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>whose desire is to hurt this good work, secretly or publicly; somebody who generally is respected as good Bohemian too, and who proclaims himself as a Bohemian, especially always before the election period. This person is a well-known Democratic boss, a magnate (bashaw) of the 8th ward, Mr. William Loeffler. As long as he was active in the smaller political affairs the Bohemians were sufficient for him but since he started to climb the political ladder higher and higher, he found it advantageous for himself to look for cooperation and support to his friends of the same religion, and the Hebrew press recommended him exclusively as a representative of the Jews.</p>
   <p>The political activity of Mr. Loeffler is not ended yet. It is said he hopes to receive a nomination for State Auditor or something similar. In this case he would be in need, not only of Bohemians but of Jews and Germans too, who are very strong in number but are not satisfied with the project of Mr. Walleck's; that's why Mr. Loeffler is against Mr. Walleck's motion and assures the Germans that he is disappointed, but not responsible for Mr. Walleck's behavior.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The local German daily, Freie Presse, which on every occasion condemns the European and local Bohemians, is depending totally on Mr. Loeffler, who as a political boss can easily forbid Mr. Walleck to agitate for the Bohemian language in the public schools. It published, yesterday, an interesting editorial note in which you can read a paragraph:</p>
   <p>"The City Clerk, Mr. Wm. Loeffler, who considers the nominated Mr. Walleck suitable to the position of a member of the Board of Education, announces that the said Mr. Walleck, proposing the teaching in the schools of Bohemian, Polish, Swedish, and other languages, acted of his own accord. It is apparent that this proposal is simply a covert attack against the German nation. According to Mr. Loeffler's statement, Mr. Walleck will keep his mouth shut in the future and his project will be buried forever."</p>
   <p>In spite of it that Mr. Loeffler's promised to the Freie Press to attend to it "that Mr. Walleck keeps his mouth shut," we are sure that he possesses enough courage and esteem for personal liberty and good achievements not <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to subject himself to the authority of the political boss of the 8th ward.</p>
   <p>The Bohemians and other nationalities are with him and conscious of their cooperation given to Mr. Walleck by each step leading to the realization of his motion. Our countrymen should remember what Mr. Loeffler knows and how he washes his hands in the presence of the Germans, "that he is not responsible for Mr. Walleck's deeds."</p>
   <p>We doubt that Mr. Loeffler would act this way were he in his heart a sincere Bohemian; his present general behavior proves that he is not a Bohemian at all but he needs them merely for his own purposes. He considers, evidently, the Bohemians as a herd of sheep not worthy of receiving any attention, in comparison with the Germans, stronger in number and more significant in state politics.</p>
   <p>It would be very desirable if Walleck's motion would pass and we are full of hope that Mr. Walleck will do everything possible in this direction. In case it would fail, the Bohemians, the Poles, and other nationalities will know <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>exactly from what direction the wind blows and that a great Slav and Bohemian, Mr. Billy Loeffler, supported the blowing, together with the Germans. Mr. Loeffler should be aware that he attained his sunny political place only by Bohemian cooperation.</p>
