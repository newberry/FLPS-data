   <p>p. 3.. The Butchers' Employees' Educational Club announces a reduction from $3.00 to $1.50 for membership during the two months from November 1st to January 1st, and a similar reduction down to 25 cents per month for regular dues. This club is decidedly one of the best mutual aid societies in Chicago. It has, up to date, 130 members, all of them honest, diligent Czech workingmen.</p>
   <p>The above offer serves the purpose of enabling every butchers' employee to join the organization without great expenses. The club has made it a main point of its activity to keep working hours within due limits, and also to eliminate work on Sunday. He is mistaken who thinks this an impossibility, for what has been enforced elsewhere can be done here also, and we are convinced that more than half of our employers will agree with our demands and even support us in our struggle.</p>
   <p>Many among them have urged us indeed to commence action on this issue. It is, therefore, up to the workingmen to organize and begin the work lustily, as nothing but good can come of it. It is certainly necessary for us to wake up, for every other workingman finds himself in better conditions than we, the <span class="page-break">\2</span>butchers' employees. There are here many who work from eighteen to twenty hours per day for small wages, Saturday till midnight, and Sunday from five in the morning till noon time or longer.</p>
   <p>We expect you, our brethren, to set up an agitation in order to get the greater part of the workingmen together before the new year begins, that shall be devoted to ardent work for the betterment of our conditions. Everyone more than fifteen years old, and who is of the butcher trade, and also new immigrants in possession of their work-book, can become members.</p>
