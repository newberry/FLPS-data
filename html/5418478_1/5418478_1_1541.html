   <p>The Ceskoslovensky Poplatnicky Spolek v Cicero (Czechoslovak Taxpayers' Association of Cicero) held its regular meeting on March 6 with a large attendance. In this meeting, six new members were initiated and the names of seven others were presented for membership. All those who were present, including the representatives of the taxpayers' associations of Glyde and Warren Park, followed the proceedings of the meeting with interest. The past primaries and the political activity of municipal employees were discussed. Further, attention was called to the high cost of street paving and it was recommended to award these jobs to smaller contractors. A proper committee was appointed to consult with such property owners whose streets are to be paved, in order to obtain more suitable terms.</p>
