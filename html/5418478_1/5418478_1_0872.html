   <p>We Czechs, whether faithful or renegades, infidels or heretics, are all gifted with genuine Christian patience, both in the old country and America. Those who are compelled to venture across 26th St., between Western Ave., and Rockwell St., and work their way through the excavation, will bear us out. Thousands of people cross there daily, thousands plunge up to their ankles in the mire and some up to their knees. A very few of them give vent to their ire in three good round oaths - all the rest of them, however, take it with loyal meekness. All of them are Czechs and have many an acquaintance in the City Hall and the street car company offices. In these places, however, the characteristic patience of the Czechs is too well known, and so nothing is being done about the nuisance. If this nationally distinct weakness were not known, some remedy, e.g. in the form of a boardwalk, would have been provided a long time ago. But <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>why should the "big shots" worry, when they are certain that the Czechs will wait till the mire is frozen and they will meekly break their limbs when trying to cross over, just as they are today almost drowning themselves by trying to perform the feat.</p>
