   <p>Exercises were held in all public schools yesterday afternoon in memory of those who fought in the civil war, but probably in no other school was there a more sincere celebration held than in the Hedges School at 47th St. and Winchester Ave., which is attended largely by Bohemian children. The principal of this school Miss Malley, a highly educated lady, has a deep love for Bohemian children and likes the Bohemian, people for their goodness and tolerance.</p>
   <p>On no occasion does she forget to place in the program some Bohemian song, At yesterday's celebration, the children sang "Kde domov miy" (Where my Home Is) and another national song.</p>
   <p>Because the invited speaker from the "Grand Army" did not appear, the principal asked the gymnastic instructor, J. Cermak, to speak to the children in their mothertongue.</p>

   <p>These listeners were very much pleased when the meaning of Decoration Day was explained to them in the language of their cradle-days.</p>
   <p>when the speaker, in conclusion, urged them to be not only ardent Bohemians but to become good Americans, they all promised enthusiastically to do so.</p>
