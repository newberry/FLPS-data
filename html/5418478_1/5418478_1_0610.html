   <p>Mayor Thompson was yesterday given an invitation to attend and see the parade organized by the United Civic Societies of Chicago as a protest against the Mayor's order to close saloons on Sundays. The letter of invitation sent to the Mayor was signed by the Civic Societies' president, George Landau, and the secretary, Anton J. Cermak, and reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"The United Civic Societies of Chicago is organizing a parade for autonomy and personal liberty which will start Sunday, November 8, at 2:00 P.M. Preparations are being made for the erection of a platform on Washington Street directly in front of the City Hall. We present, herewith, an invitation to you and the members of your cabinet to review this parade. We assure you that we shall greatly appreciate it if you will honor us by your presence on the platform...."</p>
   <p>Seventy-five new instances of violation of the order were reported by the police yesterday, but all these are unimportant cases and there is no doubt that the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Mayor, who so far has not found any case serious enough to be punished by loss of license, will also do nothing in these cases.....</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Thirteen names of Bohemian saloonkeepers who are among the seventy-five are omitted in translation]</p>
