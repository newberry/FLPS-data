   <p>Mr. J. B. Dibelka, a Bohemian member of the Chicago Board of Education, submitted in yesterday's meeting of the Board committee on buildings and grounds a resolution aiming at the beautification of yards adjacent to public schools. The resolution was passed on to a specially appointed committee. Mr. Dibelka stated that there is not a single decent-looking school yard in Chicago, and he proposed that the services of an expert, whose sole duty would be to keep school yards in a fitting, pleasant condition, should be secured.</p>
