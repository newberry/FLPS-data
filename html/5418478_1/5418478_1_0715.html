   <p>The most important question before the people of Chicago is how long Mayor William Hale Thompson is going to be kept in office.....</p>
   <p>His pro-German attitude was being dismissed with a laugh up to the moment when he refused to welcome Marshal Joffre who is visiting here with French and British representatives....but now the National Defense Council and numerous other organizations are of the opinion that the only means of deposing the Mayor is by impeachment for malfeasance in office.....</p>
   <p>Whatever may happen to Thompson, whether he be driven from office or allowed to remain, it is certain that he will be remembered as the most despicable mayor Chicago has ever had.</p>
