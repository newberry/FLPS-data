   <p>All Czechoslovak voters of both sexes who are citizens of Cicero, Illinois and who are interested in the progress of the public schools should go to the polls next Saturday. The voters should above all see to it that Mr. Frank J. Petru is re-elected president of the school board. Mr. Petru has served in this capacity for two one-year terms and has proved himself to be the right man for the right job. Although the office of president of the school board does not involve any salary, Mr. Petru, during the two years he served, devoted his time and energy to this office, ever mindful of the possibilities to improve our school system. The results of his efforts are well known to all our citizens and....it is desirable that Mr. Petru be re-elected.</p>
