   <p>Mr. Josef A. Mendl, the Bohemian Democratic candidate for the nomination of county sheriff, we are told, is now working in the suburban and rural parts of our county. He is being welcomed everywhere, and he seems pleased with the results of his campaign. However, it will be a stiff fight, and the question of Slavic politics looms high this year. The united votes of all Slavs can secure the victory for our candidate in these primaries. Our brother Poles have a large number of candidates for various offices, and they are counting on Bohemian support; they are campaigning among our countrymen.</p>
   <p>No doubt the Poles will get the Bohemian--and Slavic--votes if they themselves will show evidence of Slavic mutuality of interests. It will all depend upon whether or not our brother Poles will do their duty toward Mr. J. A. Mendl. If they give him their support and secure other help they may be able to offer, our countrymen will repay in kind and vote for their candidates in the primaries and in the regular elections.</p>
