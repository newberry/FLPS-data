   <p>In the first place it is our women, our Czechoslovak mothers and daughters who should give all their efforts to help those candidates on the regular Democratic ticket both in the city of Chicago and in the county of Cook. There are a great many reasons why they should help these candidates win. They should take advantage of the few remaining days before election to propagandize in such a way that not a single Czechoslovak family would be left in Chicago that would not be thoroughly informed and instructed, thus making certain that every member of such a family, who has the right to vote, would go to the polls, and there, asking for the Democratic ballot, vote for Anton J. Cermak for president of the County Board of Commissioners, and for Josef Mendl for member of the same body. Besides they should vote for all the rest of the candidates who were recommended by the regular Democratic organization. The strongest reason why they should do so is that of kindness.</p>
   
   <p>Observe how many Czechoslovak widows and orphans need help. It is true that the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) helps most efficiently those people who, because of poverty and sorrow, require help, but that is not enough because, due to increased unemployment, the number of our indigent people is on the increase, and the Spolecnost has, alas, not enough means to help everybody. But we have the Board of County Commissioners, we have the County agent whose duty it is to provide for indigent families. We pay for it and pay enough, but, let us ask, how many of our own poor people are there who ought to be thus aided by the County? Compared with other foreign-language groups, very few indeed. And now, you ask the reason for this. There are many, but the greatest of them all is that a high percentage of those people who actually need help do not even know where to ask for it; there are others who would ask for it but not knowing the English language, they are too self-conscious and as a result they suffer rather than ask for help. How changed these conditions would be if we placed our own people in offices which deal with matters of this kind. Let us imagine that Anton J. Cermak becomes president of the County Board. That same Cermak who was the creator of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, who since its foundation works zealously for its upkeep, not only contributing personally and generously to it, but seeking contributions to it among other foreign-language groups, thus doing his utmost to aid our own poor. Cermak is not doing it nor has he ever been doing it for political reasons; such charitable deeds do not bring him any profit except, of course, the inner satisfaction of having done his self-imposed duty well.</p>
   <p>Josef Mendl, too, is a zealous and generous supporter of the Spolecnost, and therefore of our poor. You Czechoslovak women and girls will, therefore, understand that these two men are the right candidates for whom you should fight with enthusiasm and with joy now that you know why every Czechoslovak family ought to engage in this political fight and win!</p>
   <p>When these two men are elected--and if we unite behind them they will be elected--then hundreds upon hundreds of Czechoslovak widows will receive their widows' pension paid by the County, a pension which, though they are fully entitled to it, they have not hitherto received. Hundreds of our indigent will receive their support from the County, a support which is their due but which they have not received. Indigent persons will only need to report to Cermak or to Mendl and their cases will be settled. A Czechoslovak woman can feel elated, have a feeling of satisfaction in her heart, only when she knows that other women, other mothers, other unfortunate girls who suffer innocently, are at last being well cared for.</p>
   <p>Today, tomorrow, and every day until the day of the primary election there will be meetings held in which Anton J. Cermak, Josef Mendl, and the whole Democratic ticket will be boosted. To visit these meetings, to listen to the speakers is the duty of every one of us. Let no one say that he has his mind made up and that he has already decided for whom to vote. There are many new things which one may learn. The ballot will be too long and unwieldy; it will be complicated, and the average voter, therefore, should be fully instructed in marking it. And such instruction will be given to everybody--but only in these meetings.</p>
   <p>The Democratic ward committeemen and all precinct captains of the Fifth Congressional District have decided to call a meeting of all the workers for the regular Democratic ticket. This meeting will be held on Wednesday in the large hall of the Pilsen Sokol, Ashland Avenue near 18th Street. The managers of this meeting are the following ward representatives from the Central committee of the regular Democratic organization: First Ward, Mr. Josef Mendl; Eleventh Ward, Congressman Adolph J. Sabath; Twelfth Ward, Mr. Anton J. Cermak; Twentieth Ward, Mr. Dennis Egan. The preparations for this meeting are extensive. Thus, for instance, all the candidates on the Democratic ticket will be introduced. The following gentlemen will be the speakers: Congressman Adolph J. Sabath; Alderman Anton J. Cermak candidate for the office of president of the County Board of Commissioners; Josef Mendl, candidate for the office of member of the County Board of Commissioners; Frank Venecek, the first assistant of the County agent, who on this occasion will give a detailed description of the work of the County agent and tell how the president of the County Board may, through the County agent, help the poor of Chicago. The program will include musical entertainment, both vocal and instrumental. There is no doubt that our Wednesday meeting will be an eventful one in this stirring campaign. A capacity crowd of our Czechoslovak women and girls is urged to come to this meeting.</p>
   <p>This evening there will be a meeting in Linduska's hall, 27th Street and Central Park Avenue, in other words on the south side of the Thirty-fourth Ward. Great interest is being shown by our voters in this meeting, and no doubt that it will be very well attended. As a special attraction, Mr. Walter Golas will make his first speech as candidate for the office of State delegate from the Nineteenth Senatorial District. Mr. Golas is a young and talented man, and in spite of the fact that up till now he has not been a candidate for any office, he is well-known and has the confidence and respect of the voters of the Thirty-fourth Ward. The sponsors of this meeting expect the Czechoslovak women and girls to come out in large numbers.</p>
   <p>Other meetings for candidates on the regular Democratic ticket will be held in the Twelfth Ward as follows: Mr. Anton Denemark's hall, 2300 South Homan Avenue. The speakers here will be: Messrs. Anton J. Cermak, Otto Kerner, Matt Hanus, Josef Cepak, Otto Fuerst, and several others. The other meetings will be in Mr. Novak's hall, 25th Street and Homan Avenue, and in Mr. Fitz's hall, 2026 South Washtenaw Avenue.</p>
   <p>Every Czechoslovak woman voter, who is registered as a member of the Republican party, will receive a sample ballot marked to indicate which candidates should be supported. This will be in accordance with the recommendations of the Roosevelt Club of Republican Women. Our countryman, Mr. Albert B. Holecek has been recommended by that club as a candidate for the office of senator from the Nineteenth Senatorial District. There is no doubt that Bohemian women who belong to the Republican party will follow this recommendation.</p>
