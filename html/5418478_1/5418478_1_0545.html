   <p>Prior to the enactment of prohibition the most numerous cases on the court dockets were those of disorderly conduct while intoxicated. Prohibition will stop such cases completely in a short time. A delayed report for 1920 issued by the Chicago Police Department for the past four years shows the following number of such cases: 1917, 55,947; 1918, 45,414; 1919, 35,608; 1920, 32,859. To offset this, home made whisky--"moonshine"--has caused quite enough evil because it shows its effects in a much more serious type of offense or crime. There were 116 murders committed in Chicago in 1920, and taking the first seven months of this year as a criterion, it may be anticipated that there will be at least 130 murders in 1921.</p>
   <p>In 50 of the 116 cases of murder in 1920 no arrests were made. Twelve cases cleared themselves up automatically by suicide of the murderer. Three of the 116 assassins were hanged. Twenty-one were sent to Joliet. Seventeen were found innocent by the jury, and in thirty-two cases the indictment was quashed. There are twenty-five cases awaiting disposal.</p>
   <p>The 5,150 policemen employed by the Department in 1920 had less to do during that year than did the 4,706 policemen employed in 1908. This would lead to the belief that prohibition has been helpful, just the same, to some extent. The report shows another interesting fact: It reveals that saloonkeepers and those employed by them have been and are more law-abiding citizens than bankers and brokers. Of the former, only 289 were arrested. But 330 others arrested were identified as either brokers or bankers. During the year, 26 detectives, 113 milkmen, 49 policemen, 18,849 chauffeurs, and 21,251 workingmen were arrested.</p>
   <p>Although there were 438 persons killed by automobiles, as against 290 in 1919, there were fewer instances of arrests for speeding. The police found 4,340 out of the 5,947 stolen cars.</p>
