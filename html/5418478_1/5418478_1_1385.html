   <p>There were only a few political meetings held yesterday, and most of these were small ward meetings and precinct gatherings, but the candidates for the office of mayor and their friends were not idle.....We again call our voters' attention to Mr. [Robert] Sweitzer's [German] definite promise to start public works on a large scale....All that should be of great interest to all of us because it means that so many more working men will finally find employment and means of making a living.....</p>
