   <p>p. 1, col. 2.. It is very inspiring to note the victory of Mr. O. Novak, a Bohemian who was elected to serve as Trustee of the Sanitary District of Chicago. Mr. O. Novak was the only Bohemian candidate on the Republican ticket, but he emerged with the largest majority of votes of all other candidates on the ballot. He won very easily over his Democratic opponent.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian voters showed no discrimination in parties, therefore it was possible for Mr. O. Novak to win by such a large majority of votes. They realized that he was well qualified for the position and therefore responded with wholehearted support.</p>
