   <p>The Sdruzene Spolky (United Civic Societies of Chicago), the representative body of the liberal element of Chicago's population, gave to the press yesterday, photostatic copies of a letter received from William Hale Thompson before the election. In the communication he promised to oppose all blue laws and keep saloons open on Sundays. The letter reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"The undersigned takes pleasure in advising you that he is the Republican candidate for the office of mayor of the City of Chicago, that he favors the principles of personal liberty, local autonomy, equitable taxation, and all the aims for the promotion of which the United Civic Societies of Chicago was organized; that he proposes to support these aims by every means in his power, that he believes that every citizen should be protected in his full enjoyment of the personal rights and privileges guaranteed to him by the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Constitution of the United States and the State of Illinois, and that, in case he should be elected mayor of the City of Chicago, he will use all honest means to promote the following objectives:</p>
   <p>"(1) To oppose all laws known as 'blue laws'. He proclaims in the first place that he is against the closing of [saloons] on Sundays because he is convinced that the state law concerning that closing is unenforceable and should not be enforced by the city administration. That he is against any and all ordinances, the purpose of which is to limit Chicago citizens in the enjoyment of full freedom during the day of their rest and recuperation.</p>
   <p>"(2) That he is in favor of 'special bar permits' for decent societies and other decent organizations, giving them the right to serve beer until three o'clock in the morning and thus enabling them to hold their customary entertainments.</p>
   <p>"(3) That he will, in his capacity as Mayor, use his right of veto against <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the enactment of any ordinance limiting the rights of personal liberty, or the suspension of any liberal ordinance now in force, especially if its purpose be to amend or revoke the ordinance concerning 'special bar permits' as now in force.</p>
   <p>"(4) That he will oppose the enlargement of dry districts inside the city limits, unless such enlargement should be requested by the majority of the residents of a district in which at least two thirds of the lots are improved by residential buildings.</p>
   <p>"(5) That he is absolutely opposed to seeing Chicago enclosed within the sphere of the anti-saloon law.</p>
   <p>"(6) I also declare that I have not signed any obligation to the Anti-Saloon League or any other so-called 'reform organization,' or to any newspaper."</p>
   <p>This, so clear a promise, and what the Mayor did Monday, needs no comment.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Acting on the basis of these premises, the political committee of the United Civic Societies adopted a resolution in yesterday's meeting denouncing the Mayor as a man who does not keep his promises. At the same time, a meeting of the executive committee was called for Thursday night in order to organize a public protest against the Mayor and his closing ordinance.</p>
   <p>It has not yet been decided what steps the supporters of the principles of personal liberty will take in order to force the Mayor to retract the ordinance and to dispose, once and for all, of the whole question of closing saloons on Sundays. A plan is being discussed to demand the enforcement not only of the Sunday closing law, but all blue laws that are in the statutes. The rigid enforcement of such laws which so far have been dead letters would close all theaters on Sundays, would stop all electric cars, ball and other games, and close all amusement parks. This, however, would be attempted only if all other means failed.</p>
   <p>The above quoted promise is said to have been signed by the Mayor on <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>March 31, 1915, in his home at 3200 Sheridan Road. Present were Eugene Pike, then director of Thompson's campaign, and three members of the United Civic Societies: President G. Landau, chairman of the committee for political action; Adolf D. Weiner, and organizer, Leopold Neuman. The officials of the United Civic Societies declare that Thompson was the only candidate to sign such a pledge. The pledge was prepared upon the initiative of Mr. Pike, who indicated what it should contain and suggested to the officials to make it "strong".</p>
   <p>The officials of the United Societies assert that they did not request such a pledge from Mr. Thompson, and that he invited them to his own residence, signed the pledge, and handed it to them of his own free will.</p>
   <p>Secretary of the United Civic Societies, Mr. Anton J. Cermak, who works with his usual energy to avert this blow directed against the liberal element of Chicago, has made the following statement:</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>"We did not request any of the candidates to give us pledges. During the primaries we supported Democrat Harrison, and Republican Jacob Haye who is a member of our organization. After the primaries there was a rumor that our organization would support Sweitzer. Bugene Pike, who was the director of Thompson's campaign, came to our office and gave us the assurance that William hale Thompson was favorable to our principles. We did not ask that he should sign a pledge. Harrison has never signed anything of that kind, and we have never demanded it of any candidate. Someone, suggested that Thompson visit the meeting of our political committee, and Pike assured us that Thompson would be glad to come. On the day of the meeting Pike came in and told us that Mr. Thompson was ill at home, and that he would like the committee to call on him and bring along a pledge for his signature. Pike remarked that the pledge might be as "strong" as we should like to have it. He went so far as to suggest what it should contain. Its text shows that the pledge is a very clear one. At that time the question of special bar permits was being discussed and we made the paragraph referring to that question considerably stronger than the rest of the pledge. In the 1911 <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>campaign, Charles E. Merriam signed a pledge for us, and we showed it to Pike in our office. Pike read it and remarked: 'You may make it much stronger for William Hale Thompson.'</p>
   <p>"So, on Sunday, March 21, George Landau, K. D. Weiner, and Leopold Neumann went to see Thompson in his home on Sheridan Road. They found there Mr. Thompson in the company of Mr. Pike. They had with them Merriam's pledge and the pledge prepared according to Mr. Pike's suggestions for Mr. Thompson. Mr. Pike took Merriam's pledge, showed it to Mr. Thompson, and pointed out the ways in which his (Thompson's) pleage was stronger than Merriam's. Pike said: 'What do you think of it, Bill? What do you think of that guy, Merriam, who makes such a saintly face in the Council; there is nothing he would not make a 'dig' into, and at the same time he signs a pledge like this when he runs for 'mayor?' Thompson read the pledge, said that in a few points it could be still stronger, and signed it.</p>
   <p>"Sweitzer also came to a meeting of the committee, but he did not sign any <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>pledge, and we did not ask him to do it. When we issued our recommendation for the election we did not mention any candidate by name but said that both candidates were suitable. Now the mayor has violated a pledge which he suggested and signed by his own free will without having been asked to do so."</p>
   <p>The resolution adopted in yesterday's meeting of the political committee of the United Civic Societies of Chicago reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"The United Civic Societies of Chicago, through its committee on political action, protests most strongly against Mayor Thompson's action in ordering the closing of saloons on Sundays, and condemns it as an unjustified attack on the personal liberty of Chicago people. It designates Mayor Thompson as a pledge-breaker because he has broken a very definite pledge, voluntarily given and signed upon his own initiative. It denounces Mayor Thompson as a man who secured our support by a mendacious written proclamation in which he claimed to be a liberal-minded man, and a foe of blue laws and closing of <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
cafes on Sundays."</p>
   <p>While Mayor Thompson, denounced by all liberal citizens of Chicago and applauded by all our fanatics, was on his way west yesterday, he arrogantly declared in Omaha that he is happy to have broken his own word and that he would gladly do it again. His chief of police, Healey, held a conference with Corporation Counsel Folsom as mayor Thompson's representative, concerning means for the strictest enforcement of the saloon-closing ordinance. After the conference, Healey issued the following statement:</p>
   <p>"Owners of cafes who are found to have their cafes open next Sunday will be simply arrested. The prosecution will be in the hands of the state's attorney and not of the city prosecutor because the charge will read as a violation of a state law. When found to have violated the law for the second time, even though they may have been discharged by the court in the case of their first offense, they will be arrested again, and I shall recommend the voiding of their licenses. I do not care whether or not they were sentenced <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>for the first violation. The second arrest will call for a severe punishment and their licenses will be revoked."</p>
   <p>The police "pasha" [sic] proposes the following method of enforcing Mayor Thompson's decree: Saloons must not be open even if they were to sell water or soda only. The bars in coffee houses and restaurants must be closed. Alcoholic beverages must not be served to hotel guests in their rooms. Clubs on Michigan Avenue must be as dry as the last saloon on West Madison Street. Alcoholic beverages must not be served at entertainments from midnight between Saturday and Sunday until midnight between Sunday and Monday. Restaurants will not be permitted to serve sandwiches soaked in whisky as is being done in some dry places with the claim that it is food. According to this proposal of Chief of Police Healey, Chicago must be as dry as Sahara in public places....</p>
   <p>Saloons in Cook County outside of Chicago's city limits will be open on <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>Sunday. The fanatics, encouraged by their success with Mayor Thompson, have approached Sheriff Traeger with the request to have the Sunday closing law enforced also in the rural parts of the county. But he definitely refused to become a tool of the fanatics. He said:</p>
   <p>"The duty of our office is to execute court orders. Every community in the county has its own administration, and, according to my opinion, it is up to this administration to decide whether the saloons should be closed or open. It is my opinion that roadhouses belong under the supervision of county commissioners. By men are not policemen. I have only one hundred and ten of them, and if I should do the police duty in the whole county, I should need at least one thousand. I believe that the people of each community should decide by voting how they wish to have the question of saloons solved."</p>
   <p>The fanatics were relying also on State's Attorney Hoyne to do their dirty work, but there, too, they were disappointed. He said it was not his business <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>to arrest saloonkeepers who have their places open on Sunday no matter whether they are in or outside of Chicago. This was the duty of the sheriff, the police, and the constables. The following communities in Cook County will have their saloons open next Sunday: Lyons, Blue Island, Chicago Heights, Thornton, Forest Park, Franklin Park, Homewood, Mr. Olivet, Posen, Riverdale, St. Mary's, Evergreen Park, Maywood, and Schaumburg.</p>
   <p>The prohibitionists in Chicago were most elated yesterday. They were jubilant over Mayor Thompson's decree and proclaimed that it is the beginning of the end of saloons in Chicago. They denied very definitely that they had threatened to indict Mayor Thompson for nonperformance of his duties. Some of the mayor's friends have tried to vindicate him by saying that he was forced to issue the decree because of such a threat. The fanatics are bragging of their very great political power in Chicago and declare that Carter H. Harrison could have been mayor again if he had done ten days before the election what Mayor Thompson did on Monday. Now the prohibitionists blue-Sunday promoters will double their efforts to make Chicago dry on weekdays, <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>and to introduce general prohibition.</p>
   <p>If the closing decree should be enforced the saloonkeepers will demand a reduction of license fees in proportion to the losses suffered by having their saloons closed Sundays. Two such proposals were offered in the Monday meeting of the City Council and referred to the licensing committee. One of them proposes the reduction of the fee to five hundred dollars, the other to one seventh of the present fee, that is, one hundred forty-three dollars annually.</p>
