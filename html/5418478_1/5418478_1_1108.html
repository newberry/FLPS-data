   <p>A desire is being aroused among Bohemian workingmen in the local number industry for the organization of a union. This is really a desirable step, for these people are in many instances oppressed, and know not what to do with their divided forces. If they unite and create an integral body, they will be given consideration and they could then set up their demands. The realization of their objectives be accomplished through their allied efforts.</p>
   <p>However, if such an organization is to have a good foundation, it must originate with workers, must spring from their own desire to form a cohesive body among themselves.</p>
   <p>Unions based upon forced membership, do not have solidarity and they fall apart at the slightest tremor. Therefore, those who are interested in seeing a solid organization established should talk it over frequently with their fellow-workers and spread the idea from one factory to another. When sufficient interest in this direction is evidenced, a public meeting can be called and the final work of organizing accomplished. We hope that our workingmen will soon achieve their aims and appear before us as a powerful organization in welfare activities.</p>
