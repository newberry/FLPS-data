   <p>Our Slovak brethren are doing everything in their power to be instrumental in the liberation of their nation from Austrian rule. A drama from the history of their country, "Hatus Trencansky" (a name of their national hero) will be given in walsh's hall, Noble and Emma Streets tonight.</p>
   <p>Translator's Note:</p>
   <p>The summarized announcement captioned "For the Liberation of Slovakia," serves as an example for the mutual and undivided sympathy of Czechs and Slovaks for one another during the World War.</p>
