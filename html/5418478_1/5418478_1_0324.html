   <p>The Bohemian societies "Sokol" have adopted a set of resolutions protecting against the granting of special favors to any foreign nationality by the State or municipal government; indorsing the compulsary education law, and requesting the Board of Education to omit the German language from the course of study in the city schools because they believe "it is inconsistent with American principles and a hindrance to the perfect learning" of the language of the American people. Mass meetings of Bohemian Citizens, for the purpose of ratifying these resolutions, will be held Wednesday evening at No. 102 Wade street: Thursday evening at Columbia Hall, forty-eight and Paulina streets: Friday evening at Bohemia Turner Hall, corner of Taylor and Canal streets, and Saturday evening at No. 400 West Eighteenth street.</p>
