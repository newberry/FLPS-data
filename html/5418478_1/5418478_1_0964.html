   <p>The Bohemian Sokols were invited as usual to attend a masquerade Ball given by the German Turners in "Vorwaerts" gymnasium, last Monday night. The Bohemian Sokols decided to enact a Bohemian Wedding Party at the Ball. With about thirty members in the party, among them ten women and a bag-piper in costume, the celebrators departed from the hall of "Tel. Jed, Sokol" Gymnastic Union Sokol at about 10:00 P.M. To the lyric sounds of a genuine bag-pipe the merrymakers arrived at the Ball. The arrival of the party was the signal for thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Wedding Party was the subject of general attention, so much that even Mayor Harrison, who was present, asked that it be specially presented before him. Later, in his speech, he praised first the Bohemian Nationality, flattering the Bohemian population particularly, and expressed sorrow because he did not learn the Bohemian Language in his youth. Only after this did he make mention of Germans, their entertainment and so on.</p>
   <p>Needless to add that the Germans present were none too pleased because of the attention paid to the Bohemians by the Mayor; also none of the German Newspapers even mentioned the Bohemian Wedding Party at the German masquerade in "Vorwaerts".</p>
