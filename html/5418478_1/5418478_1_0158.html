   <p>The new public school in Berwyn will bear the name of Karel Havlicek [a prominent Bohemian patriot of the early nineteenth century]. This will be the first recognition of this kind our nation has received in Chicago suburbs. It has been accomplished without the necessity of calling meetings, without interventions, and without any noise whatever. They know how to do it in Berwyn. They elected a school board with a Bohemian majority and now they have things their own way.</p>
