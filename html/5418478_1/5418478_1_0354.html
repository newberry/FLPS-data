   <p>The school board of the Cicero-Stickney school district has ordered a special election in order that a new bond issue for the building of high schools may be sanctioned. The bond issue of $600,000 at 5 1/2 per cent interest is to be used for the construction of four high schools. Two of the projected schools are to be erected in Cicero and two in Berwyn. The building sites of these schools are described as having the following boundaries: A block bounded by 15th and 16th Streets and Wesley and Euclid Avenues in Berwyn, Illinois; a block bounded by 51st Avenue and 51st Court, and another bounded by 52nd Avenue and 32nd Street, both in Cicero, Illinois; and a block bounded by Maple and Harlem Avenues and 35th and 36th Streets in Berwyn, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The members of the Česko-Slovanský Poplatnický Spolek V Cicero (Czecho-Slavonic Taxpayers' Association of Cicero) registered great consternation and amazement over this proposed bond issue. By this unprecedented act, which militates against all custom in such cases, the school board has shown its tactlessness. The members of the aforementioned taxpayers association believe that the citizenry is already much overburdened by taxes and special assessments, and that the new bond issue, as proposed by the board, would unduly increase their tax burden.</p>
   <p>There is the J. Sterling Morton High School located on Austin Boulevard, adjoining which there is a large empty lot which may serve as the proper site for the erection of an annex and still leave enough room for an athletic field.</p>
   <p>By utilizing this vacant lot and by building such an annex, the expense required by the new project which is favored by the school board would be materially lessened. The Česky Poplatnický Spolek does not object to the building of schools and high schools if they are actually needed. It [the association] objects, however, to a waste of money and to the issuing of bonds at a time when there is no direct need for the building of a new school, let alone four of them. The J. Sterling Morton High School was erected in a very suitable place so that it borders indirectly upon the towns of Berwyn and Cicero, and the students in these two localities may reach the school very easily. By building a suitable annex, the purchase of expensive real estate would thus be avoided; the same holds true in regard to the building of expensive school structures. The citizens would not be required to assume a new tax burden.</p>
   <p>There have been previous protests voiced against the building of new high schools, and it was pointed out then that there is no immediate and crying need for them. Now, in spite of all these protests, the school board has ordered an election to take place on February 4 to vote for the issuance of bonds amounting to $600,000.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Česko-Slovanský Poplatnický Spolek, which numbers a great many members, is asking all countrymen who are citizens of Cicero and vicinity to vote against the bond issue for the above-mentioned reasons.</p>
