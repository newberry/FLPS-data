   <p>The Bohemian Taxpayers' Club in Morton Park presented a petition to the Town Board in Cicero asking that electric lights be placed in the middle of each block on streets running east and west in the area between 22nd and 26th Streets, and between 54th and 56th Avenues.</p>
   <p>The Taxpayers' Club is asserting that it is in the interest of all the residents of that district to have a better lighting system installed, because up to this time, the present system has proved to be inadequate. It is time that the necessary improvements are made.</p>
   <p>The petition was assigned to a committee, and it is hoped that favorable action will be forthcoming.</p>
