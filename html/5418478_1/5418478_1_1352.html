   <p>....Our Czechoslovak voters, both men and women should consider the importance of the forthcoming primaries. In these elections a number of Bohemian candidates will run on the Democratic ticket, and every one of them will need the support of his countrymen in order to emerge victorious. One of the Bohemian candidates is running for the office of president of the county board of commissioners which is one of the most important offices one may attain in the county, and which is associated with all matters concerning the forest preserves.</p>
   <p>That man is Anton J. Cermak, and although there is a formidable rival competing with him in this election, [we feel certain] that Mr. Cermak will win by a large majority if all of our Czechoslovak voters perform their duty. It is therefore required that all such citizens be registered if they are not yet registered, and an opportunity for that is offered on Tuesday next.....</p>
   <p>Last Friday a meeting was held in the hall of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies, in which the majority of voters were Bohemians, Slovaks, and Poles. [These men] have formed a new organization under the name of Southwest Democratic Club. The meeting was presided over by Mr. Felix B. Janovsky who pointed out the significance of the forthcoming elections and mentioned the fact that among the men on the regular Democratic ticket the honor of candidacy fell to [several] Czechoslovak and Polish citizens. The mere mention of the name of Mr. Anton J. Cermak as a candidate for the office of president of the county board of commissioners brought forth a storm of enthusiasm, and the new organization will use all its energies to insure his election. As permanent officers of the new organization the following men were elected: Mr. F. B. Janovsky, president; Mr. Stanley Wolek, vice-president; Mr. Vaclav Houser, treasurer. The next meeting will be on March 24, and will take place in the old school building of the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies on 18th and May Streets.</p>
