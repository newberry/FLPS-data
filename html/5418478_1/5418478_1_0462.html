   <p>It is interesting to note that some English language papers, which have been rabidly prohibitionist up to the present, are turning toward a more tolerant view. They are gradually becoming aware of the danger and the impending damage to the country if Congress should vote for national prohibition.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Daily News, a paper which has always advocated dry measures, now admits that prohibiting the manufacture of beer and wine would not be wise..... The Chicago Tribune is even more outspoken on the issue. It points to Europe, where restrictions on account of the War, have been limited more to solid foods than to liquids. Radical measures, like prohibition, should not be introduced during War time. "If any restrictions are to be placed on consumption, this should be done only in case of urgent necessity," the paper says.</p>
