   <p>The general Bohemian meeting declared itself for Harrison and recommended Mr. Soukup for the office of appraiser.</p>
   <p>The general Bohemian political meeting called for yesterday afternoon in Sokol Hall was not attended as well as was expected. The cause was probably the holiday of Whit Sunday.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless at the meeting were present the representatives of all the wards, citizens estimable, and influential with the Bohemians and the other nationalities. The meeting had Democrats and Republicans in about equal numbers. The discussion was not long and culminated in a unanimous resolution, that we Bohemians without consideration of different political creeds, should request that Mayor Carter H. Harrison might be renominated for the candidacy of this office (Mayoralty) and should accept the renomination when offered, even by the Democratic party.</p>

   <p>The second resolution was made on behalf of the City Appraiser for the West Side, for which office we approve the candidacy of Mr. Soukup. We recommend his election and we will support the same to the limit.</p>
   <p>The main speaker was Adam Kraus, who finished the speech with the motion that all Bohemians vote the Democratic ticket. How there should be elected a committee to elaborate the necessary resolutions. - The motion was accepted and five members of the Resolution Committee elected: Messrs. A. Kraus, Dr. G. Fischer, V. Kaspar, J. Nikodem and J. F. Kohout.</p>
   <p>After a little while the Resolution Committee declared that the Resolution was formulated and V. Kaspar read it to the audience:</p>
   <p>"Whereas; the spring-election is nearing and we, as citizens and Bohemian taxpayers, are taking interest in it to obtain a considerable government for the future, as we have had for the last four years, because we acknowledge that Carter H. Harrison is an intrepid and capable magistrate, we assert, that it is the duty of every citizen to serve his community when he is called on, <span class="page-break">\3</span>Therefore be it Resolved: that we Bohemian citizens of Chicago ask Mayor Harrison to accept the mayoral candidacy even in case it will be offered by the Democratic party. We, all Bohemians, assembled in the general National meeting, regardless of political creed, will cordially support his election."</p>
   <p>The Resolution was accepted unanimously. V. Kaspar asked the favor to propose one more resolution. He read it as follows:</p>
   <p>"Whereas; the Appraiser's office on the West Side of the City of Chicago is very important, because it demands a just and suitable estimation of real estate and</p>
   <p>Whereas; our countryman, Joseph Soukup, has occupied this office twice already, each time with dignity and to the full satisfaction of the community,</p>
   <p>Therefore it is Resolved; that we, Chicago's Bohemians proclaim and approve Joseph Soukup as candidate for said office and, at the same time, we promise to support his candidacy in the coming election unconditionally and extensively."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>This resolution was accepted unanimously, too.</p>
   <p>A. Kraus made a motion to elect a committee of five members to communicate these resolutions to Mayor Harrison and Mr. Soukup. The motion was accepted and the elected committee will accomplish its mission this afternoon. The meeting was adjourned.</p>
