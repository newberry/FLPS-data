   <p>"If an enrollment of twenty pupils cannot be reached, no Czech class will be held in the evening courses of Carter Harrison High School."</p>
   <p>This dictum pronounced by Mr. Morse, principal of the school, threatened to become a reality last Tuesday, but the decision was deferred until tonight. However, only fourteen students have enrolled for this course so far.....</p>
   <p>We appeal to Czech young men to do justice to the nation from which they are descended, and also to act in their own interest by joining the class which, if it materializes, will be taught by Professor Bohumil Kral every Tuesday and Thursday from 7 P.M. to 9 P.M.</p>
   <p>Czech parents should urge their children to enroll. Among the fourteen prospective students of the class, two are Germans! They feel that they would profit by a knowledge of the Czech language, but woe, our own Czech students seem indifferent! Is this not painful, and does it not cover us with shame?</p>
