   <p>Last Sunday, December 6, 1914, a huge meeting was held in the hall of Sokol Oak Park. The meeting was devoted to the discussion of means to effect the opening of Berwyn to the Cafe business. The meeting enjoyed a very large attendance, if we consider the extremely inclement weather prevailing that day. As usual, most of those present were workingmen, and the majority were Sokols who took a most lively part in the discussions. The meetings gave evidence of the fact that the population of Berwyn is not, by far, as indifferent to the welfare of their town as it used to be....</p>
   <p>If Berwyn citizens will continue to display as much interest as they showed at the meeting in the defeat of the reactionary, fanatical, intolerant element whose purpose it is to enslave the working classes, I am sure that our work will be crowned with success. All those present agreed that the struggle will be hard, and the only way to gain a victory is to go, united, toward the one and only aim, and to secure the co-operation of as many voting citizens, men <span class="page-break">2</span>and women, as can be reached, for our cause. Our last defeat does not mean that we shall be defeated again. I have talked to many non-Bohemians residing south of the Burlington tracks and I have found that there are many of them who will vote with us, because they are getting tired of the closed dry district and realize that....the properties in such a neighborhood do not rise but rather decline in value. Let us not forget that the majority of Swedish, Polish, Croatian and Slovene nationals will be voting with us. Therefore all we need for victory this time is a united front.....</p>
   <p>That the work of the Bewynske Sdruzene Spolky (Union of Berwyn Associations) is getting recognition is evident from the fact that there are already some friends of freedom who are offering us their financial support. Thus, we have received twenty-five dollars from Mr. J. Jedlan, treasurer of the Kirchman State Bank as a contribution to defray our campaign expenses.....</p>
   <p>All similar donations will be acknowledged in the daily newspapers, and should <span class="page-break">3</span>be addressed to secretary F. A. Svoboda, 2613 South Ridgeland Avenue, Berwyn, Illinois.....</p>
