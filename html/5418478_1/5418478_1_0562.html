   <p>The United Societies held a meeting in the Planters Hotel recently at which representatives of the various national groups of Chicago reported on the preliminary work accomplished for the impending battle against prohibitionist action in this city.....</p>
   <p>The committee on resolutions submitted a motion to express congratulations to Anton J. Čermák, secretary of the United Societies, for the favorable outcome of his controversy with Judge William Gemmill. Complete confidence in the manner in which Mr. Čermák conducts business as chief bailiff of the Municipal Court is voiced in the resolution.</p>
   <p>Mr. Čermák responded in words of wholehearted gratitude for this manifestation, <span class="page-break">\2</span>adding that had Judge Gemmill not been incited by certain people, who, for sheer maliciousness wish to embarrass the bailiff's office, he would not have demanded the investigation.</p>
   <p>A municipal judges' investigating committee exonerated Mr. Čermák, as was reported in an earlier issue of the Denní Hlasatel.</p>
