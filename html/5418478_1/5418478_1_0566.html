   <p>The Czech branch of the United Societies held a meeting in the hall of Sokol Chicago last Thursday night. Considering the large number of members, the attendance might have been better. The bad weather and inadequate transportation surely had something to do with this.</p>
   <p>Since Mr. John Cervenka was detained, Mr. Joseph Bolek opened the meeting and was elected temporary chairman. He pointed out the danger in the activities of prohibitionists and similar reformers. These elements filed petitions just recently demanding revocations of certain licenses, and also asked that a "dry" amendment be placed before the next session of the State legislature.</p>
   <p>The speaker warned that if the "dry" fanatics succeeded in their efforts, hardly a single one of our halls could be preserved for us, which would mean the end of our social and national life. Another menace in prohibition looms, i.e., an increase of taxes by one hundred per cent. Our city is $3,500,000 in debt, and this amount has to be paid. It can be done only by taxation. A regular source of revenue from saloon licenses has been destroyed <span class="page-break">2</span>by the closing of several hundred taverns, for which the rotten Thompson administration is to blame. If the prohibitionists win out, the taxpayers will have to foot an extra bill of $600,000. These are the prospects we have to face. Work and sacrifices will be needed to forestall their realization.</p>
   <p>Alderman John Toman followed by characterizing certain leaders of the Juvenile Protective League. He singled out the Reverend Yarrow, Mmes. Rowland, Menford, Howe-Britton, and De Witt, calling them barkers and liars in plain English. He substantiated his contentions beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
   <p>The first report of these stool pigeons concerned an entertainment held at the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs on January 17. These spies claim to have seen drunken boys and soldiers, half-naked girls sitting on the laps of young men, indecent dancing, and the sale of alcoholic beverages to soldiers and minors. All this could be seen even after midnight. Yet Mr. Kubik, president of the club Valley Rose, and the rest of its members, swore that all these accusations were plain inventions. The police report also branded these spies <span class="page-break">3</span>as common, ordinary liars, declaring that there was not one drop of intoxicating liquor dispensed at that affair, and only nice people who enjoyed decent diversion were present.</p>
   <p>Another entertainment, in the hall at 3000 Union Avenue, was pictured in a similar light. When they arrived, the snoopers said, drunken persons were being carried from the premises. One of those investigating ladies bought two bottles supposed to contain cherry wine, but she is convinced that it was real wine! Some of the girls, the sniffers claimed, poured beer from the gallery down upon the boys who were dancing; dancing couples fell on the floor, etc. The police report again states that the entertainment moved well within the limits of good behavior. It is a fact that a material share of the proceeds from this entertainment went for the relief of relatives of victims of the "Eastland" disaster, and that the club counts highly respectable citizens among its members, as for instance, Messrs. Millburt, Stanek, Stock, and others. The club is known as a benefactor of the needy of the neighborhood. There was only one disturbance, and this was caused by a man who invaded the hall, but he was quickly driven out. This is according to the police report.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Similar reports were made about the North Side Turner Hall. The prohibitionist rabble even denounced a policeman as being drunk, although he has not touched intoxicants in any form in his whole life!</p>
   <p>The height of brazenness and shamelessness of the "drys" was reached in a report on an entertainment allegedly held at 1825 Robey Street, where glaring indecencies were perpetrated. Drinking and various kinds of debauchery were rampant. The sniffers even "discovered" that there was one common toilet room for both sexes, etc.!</p>
   <p>And now listen to the official report issued by the captain of that police district and signed by Chief of Police H. Schuttler! It reads: "There is no dance hall at the place mentioned, nor is there any at all in the entire neighborhood. The place referred to is occupied by a lime pit one thousand feet deep, from which that spot takes its name among the inhabitants of the neighborhood, and which is the property of the Illinois Lime and Crushed Stone Co!"</p>
   <p>This is certainly significant, is it not? And this set of notorious liars <span class="page-break">5</span>and rabble-rousers has the backing of all our English language dailies who support them as best they can.</p>
   <p>Mr. Toman went on to say that the kind of services rendered by the Juvenile Protective League is best illustrated in the records of our State legislature, page 84, of the year 1915. A committee consisting mostly of "drys" issued the following memorable statement: "So far as it is not under the jurisdiction of state, county, or municipal government, the Juvenile Protective League of Chicago is an utterly insignificant body. The fact has been established before the Juvenile Court, the Court of Domestic Relations, and the Morals Court that the League has wrought more evil than it has done good, and the Chicago public would be better off without it."</p>
   <p>Notwithstanding the utterance of the highest legislative body of our State, the League is permitted to continue unhampered in its perpetration of absurd injustices.</p>
   <p>Mr. Toman's address was wholeheartedly applauded. He was followed by <span class="page-break">6</span>Mr. Joseph Placek, who urged the assembly to sacrifice and to work persistently in opposition to the fanaticism which constitutes a menace to all of us. He proposed that an agitation committee of nine members be formed to work out a program for future activities of the Czech branch of the United Societies. Mr. John Cervenka became chairman of this committee, and Mr. Anton J. Cermak an ex officio officer. The other members are Messrs. Placek, Princ, James Basta, Mejda, and Mmes. Vilik, Statek, and Sedlak.</p>
   <p>Contributions from various Czech organizations were handed over to Mr. Stastny, secretary of the branch. The amounts varied down to $2, the Sokol Chicago topping the list with $25.</p>
   <p>Further contributions are earnestly solicited. For reasons of economy, all notices within the organization and those to the public will be published through the Czech press.</p>
