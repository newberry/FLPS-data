   <p>....The primary elections will take place a week from Tuesday....They will be of especially great importance to the Czechoslovak citizens, for it is the first time in the history of our County that we Czechoslovaks have had a chance to aid in the election of our own countryman, Mr. Anton J. Cermak, who seeks the office of president of the County Board of Commissioners. Mr. Cermak is supported by the regular Democratic organization. The same organization also supports Mr. Josef A. Mendl, who seeks the nomination for membership on the same Board, and these facts ought to be sufficient to induce every one of our voters to go to the polls. There should not be a single Czechoslovak Democrat absent from the polls on that day.....</p>
   <p>In Berwyn, Illinois, there will [also] be an election of city officials, and since several of these are our countrymen, there is an active interest in this election. It is hoped that Czechoslovak voters will turn out in full number. Among our Bohemian candidates there is Mr. Josef Cerny who again seeks the office of a police judge, a job which he is now performing to our entire satisfaction. It is understood that our countrymen will cast their ballots in his behalf next Tuesday.....</p>
   <p>A great number of our Czechoslovak voters know, of course, Mr. Michael Rosenberg who is recommended by the regular Democratic organization for membership of the sanitary district. Mr. Rosenberg has been active for many years in the Thirty-fourth Ward; he always supported our Bohemian candidates and therefore deserves the support of our Czechoslovak voters.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Albert B. Holecek, who seeks the nomination for state senator for the Nineteenth Senatorial District, is running on the Republican ticket and has the support of the leading Republicans of that district....He is an ardent believer in the principles of personal rights, and when elected will combat the evils of the nonsensically conducted prohibition system by swelling the ranks of its opponents.....Bohemian Republicans! Work with all your zeal so that this countryman of ours may win the nomination for an office of such great importance.</p>
   <p>The following meetings of our Czechoslovak Democratic voters will be held this week:</p>
   <p>On Monday evening, in the hall of Mr. Linduska on Central Park Avenue and 27th Street, Messrs. Cermak, Mendl, A. J. Sabath, and Otto R. Fuerst have promised to speak. Another meeting will be held on the same day in Mr. Anton Denemark's hall, 2300 South Homan Avenue. The speakers will be Messrs. Anton J. Cermak, Otto Kerner, Matt Hanus, Josef Cepak, and others. A meeting will be in Novak's hall, West 25th Street and Homan Avenue; in this meeting besides the aforementioned speakers, there will also be Mr. Otto R. Fuerst, Mr. Vaclav Bambas, and Mr. Jiri Basta.....</p>
