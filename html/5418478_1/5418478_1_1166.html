   <p>Last night's English language papers printed news about discontent among strikers of Czech, Slovak, Polish and Italian nationalities resulting from alleged unfair treatment by the officials of the garment workers' union and the American Federation of Labor. We reprinted the item, and shortly afterward received a communication from the strike committee's office furnishing an explanation. We hasten to publish it:</p>
   <p>"In your copy of last night we read of a 'rival organization' which, it is contended, works against the interests of the garment workers' union. It is true, that the Czech, Slovak, Polish and Italian members are dissatisfied with the actions of the officials of the garment workers' union and the Chicago Federation of Labor as well, and consequently were in conflict with them at the very beginning of the strike, and it is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>equally true that the remonstrating elements consisted chiefly of Czechs, Slovaks, Poles and Italians. It is further true, that when they had to face the tactless treatment by the officials they held separate conferences in which the situation was discussed - but it is incorrect to say that they intend to secede from the Federation of Labor. Their behavior can be called nothing more than a protest against the sluggishness of the officials of the union and the Federation. The resolutions by these conferences were conveyed to the District Council, No. 6."</p>
