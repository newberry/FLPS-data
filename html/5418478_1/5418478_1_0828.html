   <p>A resolution passed by several Slavonic organizations was submitted to Mayor Thompson last night in which objection is raised against a parade, arranged by Austrian agents to be held in the neighborhood of West 22nd and Wentworth Streets, and a decree prohibiting the demonstration is demanded. The communication is signed by the presidents of the following societies: "Slovanska Alliance" (Slavonic Alliance), "Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni" (Czech National Association), "Jihoslovanska Narodni Rada" (Jugo-Slav-National Council), and some Russian societies.</p>
   <p>It calls attention to the process of assimilation of the immigrant, during which the individual is loath to encounter scenes reminding him of the countries which he has left on account of oppression by the government. Assimilation is pointed out as essential to the welfare of America. The resolution states in part:</p>
   <p>"People in the service of the Austro-Hungarian government are constantly looking for an opportunity to prove to their employers that they are drawing no salaries without rendering the equivalent services. A parade headed by "Slavo loyal to Austria," is to be held to honor a monarch, who had filled the entire sixty-eight years of his reign with design, and forced little Serbia into war, and so is guilty of the blood spilled by millions of human beings. The man's name is being cursed by tens of thousands, and a parade is being arranged for him by foreign agents to be held in the streets in a Republican country. The streets of Chicago are not here for this sort of propaganda. If there are some people in this city who wish to hold a "post mortem" celebration, they can do so in their churches or meeting places. Under no circumstances should they be allowed to demonstrate in the streets."</p>
   
   <p>The mayor referred the document to Chief of Police Schuettler, who declared that he was not authorized to prohibit the parade. So it will be held, but the Czechs will not be in it.</p>
