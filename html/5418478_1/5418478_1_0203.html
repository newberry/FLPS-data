   <p>There are thirty-two grammar schools in our city from which 785 boys and girls are being graduated this year. Among these graduates we find fourteen Bohemian names, though there may be more, for our English teachers have a habit of Americanizing Bohemian names to such an extent that one would have difficulty in recognizing them for such. The following are the names of the Bohemian graduates, of them we may well be proud and we wish them continued success in their future endeavors in the higher schools.</p>
