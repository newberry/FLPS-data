   <p>Bohemian citizens of the Tenth Ward should take notice that in the aldermanic contest in this Ward the person of the candidate is not the main consideration; they should use their voting power primarily to assure for themselves a greater prestige, that is something to which they are entitled.</p>
   <p>A small clique of professional Irish politicians on the north end of the Ward wants to rob them of their just representation.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen should consider the importance of the question whether they will be represented by a Bohemian in the next term of our City Council or by an Irishman. Then it will not be difficult to make a decision as to how they should vote.</p>
   <p>It is the duty of Bohemia citizens in this ward to work and vote for Mr. Joseph W. Čermák, because in this way only will they be able to stem the assaults of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the Irish and retain for the future a Bohemian representative in our City Council. It is a matter of great importance to every Bohemian in the Tenth Ward, because it took years before Bohemian citizens acquired that representation to which they are rightfully entitled. Now they should put forth every effort to retain it.</p>
   <p>The Irish politicians use every means to dissuade our countrymen from doing their most important national duty. But let us hope that there will not be a single well-informed voter who will be persuaded to vote against her or his countryman.</p>
   <p>Besides, it is an incontestable fact that Mr. Čermák is far better fitted to represent the interest of the people in the City Council than his opponent because he is a man of experience, a good businessman, and an enthusiastic worker in our fraternal national organizations, whereas his opponent is just a professional politician whose interest is centered on getting a political job, and who wants the Bohemians to help him get that job, even against their own interests and those of a countryman.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>If you want an efficient representative in the Tenth Ward, and representation by a countryman at that, cast your vote for Mr. Čermák.</p>
