   <p>The Mayor's excursion party, now on their way back from San Francisco to Chicago, are returning in very poor spirits. The cause of it is Alderman John Toman of the Thirty-fourth Ward, who, at a banquet in Portland, Oregon, told the Mayor and, incidentally, the people of Portland, what he thinks about the closing of saloons on Sundays. But Thompson and his friends started on the way home with a great deal of dissatisfaction even without this bitter pill to swallow. Thompson did not receive as fine a welcome in the Far West as he had expected, and his heroic deed was not appreciated there, so Alderman Toman's speech did nothing more than intensify the disillusionment already felt by the Mayor and his friends.</p>
   <p>The special train with the Chicago excursionists aboard stopped in Portland the day before yesterday; the local Rotary Club had arranged a splendid banquet for the visitors from the Metropolis of Chicago. The Mayor, as well as a number of members of his party, made speeches, and one of them pointed out <span class="page-break">2</span>Toman as a Democratic black sheep, asking him at the same time to get up and speak. Toman accepted the invitation and his brief talk is the cause of the frigid feelings between the Mayor and the Democratic members of the party. Toman said among other things: "Our Mayor has dug up an old law passed in the days when Chicago was a village and now he wants to see it enforced. The law closing saloons on Sundays was passed when Chicago consisted of a smithy and a general store, and it was dead so long that it is not remembered even by the oldest inhabitants. Chicago is now a cosmopolitan city and is opposed to the decree inflicted upon us by the Mayor."</p>
   <p>Alderman Toman's speech was received with huge applause which, of course, peeved the Mayor and his friends more than anything else. Republican Alderman Norris rebuked Toman for this speech, maintaining that no member of the Mayor's party has a right to speak in that way. But Toman cut him short by saying that since he had been designated as a Democratic black sheep, he had the right to defend his and his party's opinion. Leaving Portland the whole party did not go together. The Bohemian Aldermen Toman, Klaus, and Hrubec formed a little <span class="page-break">3</span>group of their own because feeling was very high between them and Mayor Thompson's partisans.</p>
   <p>The Democratic aldermen, particularly the Bohemian ones, Mr. Toman, who was accompanied by Mrs. Toman, and Mr. Klaus, and Mr. Hrubec, hesitated to join the excursion after the disagreeable surprise prepared for them by the Mayor in issuing the dry-Sunday decree. But they had bought their tickets and made all other preparation for the trip, so they decided at the last minute to go just the same. However, they did not leave with the party; Mr. &amp; Mrs. Toman did not leave until twenty-four hours after the departure of the party, with which they caught up in Salt Lake City, Utah. Now it is rather to be expected that they will avoid a common return home.</p>
   <p>It was also revealed on this occasion who had paid for the trip of the Mayor and his friends to San Francisco. It had become known even before the trip that the aldermen had been offered free fare if they would keep the Mayor company. This offer was accepted by many, but the Bohemian aldermen declared <span class="page-break">4</span>they would pay their own fare. Many politicians accepted free tickets without knowing who had paid for them. Now it has been learned that the bill for the excursion is being footed by Thompson's Republican Club which, it is said, has $100,000 ready for the Mayor's campaign, should he be running for president or any other office whatever. The money, according to our information, comes from donations from many of Thompson's rich friends.</p>
