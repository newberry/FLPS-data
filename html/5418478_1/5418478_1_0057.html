   <p>Night classes at Harrison Technical High School will be resumed next Monday. All classes that were held in the first week of January will again be held, and students who have already enrolled in them will not be required to pay any registration fee. New classes will be offered upon demand, provided a certain minimum number of students enroll.</p>
   <p>There will be instruction in shorthand, typewriting, bookkeeping, technical sciences, and women's handwork. We wish to call particular attention to the classes in the Czech language to be held at Harrison High School, and we hope that the number of students in these classes will be as large as possible.</p>
