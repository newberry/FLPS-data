   <p>P.4 - The large tailoring establishments in the down-town section want to swallow all smaller employers. These must think of means whereby they can save themselves what would they say to the suggestion, that they should themselves organize big business and big factories, which would compete with the Jews who up to now have profited on an now want to ruin our tailors. We must have a little enterprise and courage if we wish to keep up with others here in America. If Jews can become millionaires through the clothing industry, why could not Bohemians at least make a decent living therefrom, since for the most part it is Bohemian labor, through which the Jews become wealthy. If an individual is insufficient to accomplish this why don't several join together, or a whole group? As has already been said, our tailors very existence is involved and they must act. Bohemian workingmen and businessmen surely would support them in their struggle for existence and no doubt many customers would be found among other nationalities for the expert workmanship of Bohemians.</p>
   <p>Why should we Bohemians continuously work only for others, why not work for ourselves sometimes?</p>
