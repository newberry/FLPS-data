   <p>For years it has been a well-known fact that our prohibitionists stop at nothing in their fight against the liberal element. We see this once more in the controversy concerning free lunches in cafes. The prohibitionists say that if free lunches were abolished we would get rid of at least fifty thousand bums at once. These bums come to the city at the approach of winter, knowing that they will get free food when they buy a glass of beer, for which they can always "bum" a nickel. What amazing and beautiful logic! It is very true that men flock to the cities during the winter when work in the country stops, and, of course, it is also true that loafers and bums come with them, because it is easier to worry through a winter in the city than on the snowy plains of the farming areas. That is only natural. But it is amusing to see someone trying to insinuate into the public mind the idea that this undesirable influx would be averted by the abolition of free lunches in saloons.</p>

   <p>We can now expect some crazy, bigoted "Aquarian" to come forward with the suggestion that the heating stoves should be removed from cafes because they provide free warmth to various undesirable individuals. Unfortunate cafes! They are needlessly causing some people a lot of headaches.</p>
