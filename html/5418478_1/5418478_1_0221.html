   <p>Czech students of Carter H. Harrison High School are working strenously to make their Beseda [Club] one of the strongest in that school. There are over one hundred members now. Their meetings began last month, and the following officers were elected: Miss Vlasta Vraz, president; Miss Dagmar Vojan, vice-president; Miss Anna Zyk, secretary; Miss Ella Nazac, treasurer.</p>
   <p>An informal entertainment was given to the newcomers at the end of last month in the smaller gymnasium, and a concert in the large hall of the school building is being planned. One of the main purposes of the Beseda will be to acquaint the teachers with the beauties of Czech music. The club hopes for public support, since the proceeds will be used to further Czech national aims.</p>
