   <p>Last Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock, the Bohemian Citizens Political Club, of the 29th ward, held its regular meeting in the Bohemian American Liberal School Hall, 48th and Honore streets. The meeting was called to order by the chairman; Mr. Jan Pekar. The proceedings were taken by the secretary, Mr. Jan Fejtl.</p>
   <p>The meeting was fairly well attended and several new members were accepted. It was resolved that the club should work in conjunction with other Bohemian and Polish clubs in the interests of the ward. It was pointed out that if the Bohemian element in the ward joins with the Polish element, they will have the decisive voice and will be able to accomplish much if they put up a candidate satisfactory to both. A committee was elected which is to report on the matter at the next regular meeting which is held regularly every third Sunday of each month. The committee is composed of Vac. Elhenicky, Jan Fejtl, and Jan Eichmann.</p>
