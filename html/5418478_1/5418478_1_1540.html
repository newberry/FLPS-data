   <p>The Ceskoslovensky Poplatnicky Spolek v Cicero (Czechoslovak Taxpayers' Association of Cicero) held its regular meeting on June 4. The meeting was fairly well attended. The course of the meeting was lively because the matter of paving streets and improvement of streetcar transportation in Cicero was discussed. Further, the celebration of our tenth anniversary was discussed and it was decided to hold a banquet. The banquet will be given on November 5, in the Sokol Karel Jonas Hall.</p>
   <p>From the report of the Cicero School Board it is apparent that many teachers from our public schools resigned. Small salaries is given as the reason for it. The reports from the board of trustees of the Tomas Masaryk Free Thought School are mostly favorable. The next meeting will be held on Saturday, July 2, at 8 P. M.</p>
   <p>Citizens! Do attend this meeting in great numbers, because there are many important matters to be discussed. Compel your neighbors to join our Association.</p>
   <p>Vaclav Rous, secretary.</p>
