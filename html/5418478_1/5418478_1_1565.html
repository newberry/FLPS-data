   <p>All Democratic meetings held in our Bohemian wards have been surprisingly successful. Every one of them enjoyed huge attendance and showed real enthusiasm for Robert M. Sweitzer [German] and the whole Democratic ticket. Two such meetings took place yesterday.....One was a ladies' matinee at the Thalia Theater, the other an evening meeting in the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs on Lawndale Avenue.</p>
   <p>The latter meeting was called by the Thirty-fourth Ward Democratic Organization for the benefit of the city ticket with Mr. Sweitzer at its head, and Alderman Winfield J. Held who seeks re-election in this ward.....The meeting was presided over by Deputy Building Commissioner J. Kostner, and among the speakers were Messrs. John A. Cervenka, O. Fuerst, Karel Vesely, and Alderman Held.....</p>

   <p>The Thalia Theater was filled to overflowing with our ladies, and the meeting was as fine as any we have seen. Our candidate for mayor, Mr. Sweitzer....was welcomed by thunderous applause.....</p>
