   <p>Our alderman, Joseph O. Kostner, chairman of the City Council committee for home defense, departed for Washington, D. C., to confer with Secretary of the Navy Daniels about his attitude toward the prohibition of beer licenses for entertainments which are frequented by navy men. Congressman A. J. Sabath had previously made arrangements for the interview, and he is also going to arrange for a meeting with Secretary of War Baker. The alderman is of the opinion that decent entertainments should not be denied the right to a license. His words are being interpreted to show that the City Council is taking a more conciliatory attitude toward the question of stringent prohibition measures.</p>
