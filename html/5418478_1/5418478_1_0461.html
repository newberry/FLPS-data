   <p>Alderman John Toman is back from Boston, Mass., where he and other members of the City Council license committee studied conditions of the saloon business. He voiced his admiration for the manner in which it was handled in that city, and expressed his earnest desire to see a similar system established in Chicago. The people would like it very much, true enough, but Mayor Thompson would surely prefer to see the plan defeated, as it would take away a part of his power.</p>
