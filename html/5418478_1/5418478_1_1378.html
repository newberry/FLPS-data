   <p>In Cicero, which operates politically under the supervision of the Chicago election commission there will be held a primary election, which promises to be a very tame affair, because there are practically no contests among the candidates for offices.</p>
   <p>All the political parties have selected their candidates at their caucuses, and only a few citizens are seeking nominations besides these caucus candidates.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ottokar Burianek, the well-known and popular countryman of Warren Park, is the man whom the Czech voters should not forget at next Tuesday's primary election. He is seeking the nomination on the Republican ticket for a four year term of trustee, and with his capabilities is a fit candidate for the position.</p>
   <p>If Mr. Burianek gets the nomination, he surely will be elected. It now devolves <span class="page-break">\2</span>on the Czech voters to place him on the ticket and gain a valuable representative.</p>
   <p>The town engineer Mr. Spicka intends to start an agitation for the paving of alleys in Cicero, and at the next meeting of the town council a motion will be proposed that attempts in that direction be tried.</p>
   <p>According to Mr. Spicka's opinion the alleys should be paved with concrete, which would be the most serviceable, and no doubt this paving would in no small way help to beautify the town.</p>
   <p>It certainly is true that many of the alleys in Cicero are in terrible shape, and especially in the summer the health of the community is endangered.</p>
   <p>For the property owners such an improvement would mean new expenses, and therefore it is likely that many will protest, although eventually the citizens will have to go through with this improvement which would tend to beautify the <span class="page-break">\3</span>community, but would also raise the value of property.</p>
   <p>At the next April town election the citizens will no doubt vote to sanction the issuance of bonds in the amount of $30,000 for the purpose of adding an eight room building to the Burnham school.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the school board of district 99, petitions were distributed; these petitions must receive six hundred signatures of voters in order to put the question of the eight room addition to the voters. It is expected that there will be no difficulty in getting the necessary signatures in time for the April election.</p>
   <p>The school board assures us that this eight room addition is necessary, because Cicero is growing so fast, and the present buildings are crowded. Should the voters approve the bonds, the new addition to the Burnham school would be finished at the end of the summer vacation.</p>
