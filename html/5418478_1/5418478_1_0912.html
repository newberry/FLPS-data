   <p>P.1--The Chicago American issued a special evening edition yesterday in which it stated that thirteen thousand German Turners and Czech Sokols have offered their services to Mayor Dunne for the maintenance of order in Chicago, or in other words for the protection of Negro strike-breakers imported by unscrupulous employers to take the places of honorable citizens who provide for their families.</p>
   <p>We do not know where the American obtained this information. It also mentions the name of a distinguished German, who, it alleges, represents ten thousand Turners, and the name of Karel J. Vopicka, who is said to speak for three thousand Sokols. However, we know of no one who could place himself at the head of our Sokols and speak for them on so important a matter. Such a gesture does not conform to Sokol principles, and we hope that the Sokols will defend themselves against this outrage.</p>

   <p>Mr. Karel J. Vopicka, whom the American mentions as the author of the report, informs us that he is not responsible for the statement or the report in the American, and that he recognizes the Sokols as independent citizens, capable of determining their own activities. He absolutely did not speak with any one about the matter, and his name was used without authority. The idea was conceived by the American's representatives in their contemplation of Sunday's celebration. They were pleased by the stalwart appearance of the lads and thought what excellent protection they would be. They inserted only a few lines about the celebration at that time, but now, when it is a matter of casting reflections on our powerful organization, they are not sparing with their space and use lies to create sensations. Why does not this paper pick the clubs of decrepit American dudes as the targets for it's wretched activity? Guarding their fathers' wagons and serving the felonious Negro gangs would become them much better.</p>
