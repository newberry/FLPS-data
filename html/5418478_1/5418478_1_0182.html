   <p>Mr. J. B. Dibelka, an architect known in all our circles, was appointed principal of the so called apprentice-school. This school is maintained by the Board of Education and is attended by apprentice brick-layers, carpenters, and stone-masons. At the present time the school has 130 pupils, who come under the supervision of the Master Builders Association. The Association sees to it that the pupils attend the school regularly. Drawing, writing, reading, correspondence and job-estimating are taught and the pupils acquaint themselves with the political management of this country and learn how to keep books. Among the teachers active at this school, there is also another Bohemian, Mr. Lunnak. There are several Bohemians among the students. The school premises are located on Division and Sedgwick Streets. The appointment of Mr. Dibelka to the responsible office of this school, is a recognition of his ability and knowledge, which he will surely make use of for the good of his wards.</p>
