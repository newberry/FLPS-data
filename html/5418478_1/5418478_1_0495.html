   <p>As stated in yesterday's Svornost the branch of the Bohemian Woman's Temperance Union was organized. This news will reach our readers in a happy mood.</p>
   <p>In its first meeting we had a hot debate between the partisans and Independents, both parties fighting for the Bohemian branch of Chicago. Mrs. Josefina Leman of Cleveland, Ohio is non-partisan and the Chicago branch was organized the same. As soon as the partisans learned of the meeting place they rushed for it and had long talks.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Grubb of Kansas and Mrs. Huchins of Chicago explaining the bright future of the organization on the Independent side and Mrs. Minerva K. Eliott on the partisan side.</p>
   <p>Then it was agreed to vote, which ended in great majority to stay Independent.</p>
