   <p>Through the kindness of our Czech member of the school board, Mr. Josef A. Holpuch, we have received a very interesting booklet, which simply is an address book of all of our public schools.</p>
   <p>We have often referred to the work of our school board in these columns with the greatest interest because, when calling attention to the work performed by the school board, we have also pointed out how the citizens' taxes are paid. The Czechs are no small unit when it comes to the tax problem.</p>
   <p>The interest from these taxes should be reflected in the teaching of children sent to our public schools.</p>
   
   <p>Our greatest interest in the activities of our school board are centered about the welfare of our Czech schools, or at least in schools attended by pupils of Czech parentage.</p>
   <p>We have brought forth these reports to acquaint the Czech public with the work of the school board for our free schools, and also to keep our countrymen informed concerning the teachers to whom we have entrusted our children.</p>
   <p>Mr. Josef A. Holpuch, our member of the Chicago school board, has always been helpful to us, and it pleased him when the Czechs showed an interest in the affairs of our schools, which interest should not lag among us.</p>
   <p>Lately, we published an account of the number of public schools in Chicago, to which report we now refer because of the interest we Czechs should have in matters concerning our public school system.</p>
   <p>As we have previously announced, there are twenty-three high schools and 277 grammar schools in Chicago. These schools are divided into two separate districts.</p>
   <p>The first district is controlled by committees of the school board. The second district is controlled by school superintendents.</p>
   <p>In both instances we will take notice only of those districts where children of Czech parentage predominate. According to a report of the school board committee, there are twenty-four such districts. To us Czechs, the sixth and eighth are of the greatest concern.</p>
   <p>In both of these districts, our self-sacrificing Czech worker, Mr. Josef A. Holpuch, holds a committee membership.</p>
   <p>The sixth district comprises these schools: Beidler, Bryant, Byford, Calhoun, Chalmers, Emerson, Emmet, Ericson, Hayes, Howe, Key, Lawson, Marshall, May, Morse, Nash, Ryerson, Shepard, Spencer, Sumner, Tennyson, and Tilton.</p>
   
   <p>These schools are in the eighth district: Albany Avenue, Burns, Chicago and Cook County School for Boys, Clarke, Cooper, Corkery, Farragut, Froebel, Gary, Hammond, Herzl, Howland, Jirka, McCormick, Medill, Nineteenth Street, Penn, Pickard, Plamondon, Rogers, Smyth, Spry, Whitney, and Whittier.</p>
   <p>For us, the most notable district is the sixth, under Mr. Lawry's direction; he is the superintendent and inspector of the following schools: Albany Avenue, Bryant, Burns, Chicago and Cook County School for Boys, Cooper, Corkery, Farragut, Froebel, Hammond, Herzl, Howland, Jirka, Jungman, Komensky, Lawson, Nineteenth Street, Penn, Pickard, Plamondon, Spry, Sumner, Troop, and Whittier. The high schools under Mr. Lawrey's direction are Crane Technical and Harrison Technical.</p>
   <p>When looking over the reports relative to individual schools, we find that our countrymen in the positions as principals are poorly represented, and the small number of them does not reflect much credit on Czechs.</p>
   
   <p>The principal of the Goodrich School is our countryman, Mr. Karel J. Lunak; at the Herzl School is Mr. Jaroslav J. Zmrhal; at the Riis School, Miss Cecilie B. Schimek, and in the West Pullman School, Miss A. Pest is superintendent. All these principals preside in grammar schools.</p>
   <p>The assistant principals are: Miss Clara Bednar, at Parker High School; Mr. Frantisek A. Fucik, at the Harrison Technical High School; Miss Anna L. Jilek, at the Herzl High School, and Miss Z. Anna Novotny, at the McCormick High School in Oak Park, Illinois.</p>

Vavrinek, Marshall; and Robert Zika, Englewood High.</p>
   <p>If we consider the large number of pupils in our schools and the number of teachers, we must come to the conclusion that the number of Czech teachers in the Chicago schools is indeed small. Why it is so is an enigma. And we are surprised that our young people, especially our young girls, do not take up teaching as a profession, which is a calling reflecting honor upon those who take it up--and further it pays well.</p>
   <p>There are many positions open for good, conscientious teachers. There are schools where Czech teachers would be welcomed. When we speak of this matter, we do not speak of it without due consideration for the effect which it may have upon our young students, and we call attention to this phase of our Czech life because of actual experience.</p>
   <p>For this reason, we have written this report, which is primarily designed as an encouragement to our Czech-American youth, who should comprehend and admit that our Chicago public schools need a reorganization of the teaching force. Our schools should be released from the grip of elements which try to hold control over them.</p>
   
   <p>The Chicago Czech youth should take it upon itself to prove that what the children can do whose parents proudly proclaim their origin from Saint Patrick [Irish] they too can do, and with even greater success.</p>
   <p>The larger the number of teachers which we will be able to place into our public schools, the more intelligence we will be able to reflect as a national group; this will have its repercussions upon the opinions of our foreign elements, and also upon our American public, whose opinions we value most.</p>
