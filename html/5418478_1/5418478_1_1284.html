   <p>The Velkovybor Chicagske Jednoty Ceskych Dam (Grand Lodge of the Bohemian Ladies' Union of Chicago) held a meeting on Wednesday, October 25, 1922. It was unanimously decided in the meeting to recommend, as strongly as possible, that all members of this powerful Jednota work in behalf of our countrymen--Mr. Anton J. Cermak, who is running on the Democratic ticket for the office of president and member of the board of county commissioners, and Mr. Josef Mendl, who, on the same ticket, offers his candidacy for the office of member of the board of county commissioners. We were informed of this decision by Mrs. Marie Dusicka, chairwoman of the Grand Lodge of the Jednota, and by Mrs. Marie Srajb, the secretary.</p>
   <p>The Klub Zobacek passed a similar motion in the meeting held October 11, 1922, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>according to information received from Mrs. Marie Drasal, secretary, and Mrs. Frantiska Kohl, president of the Hlub. They also unanimously decided to work for Messrs. Anton J. Cermak and Josef Mendl; the members were urged to exert their influence upon all acquaintances and friends to vote for the two candidates on election day, November 7, 1922.....</p>
   <p>We were interested to learn what the league of voters for the state legislature had to say about Mr. Albert B. Holecek, the Republican candidate for state senator in the nineteenth senatorial district. The league of voters recommends Mr. Holecek to all voters, irrespective of what their political affiliations may be....and says:</p>
   <p>"Albert B. Holecek, an attorney, made good as a soldier in the World War. He is a past-commander of an American Legion post, enjoys a fine reputation, and is unusually well qualified for the work of a legislator."</p>

   <p>This recommendation and praise are more significant when we read what the league of voters has to say about other candidates. There seem to be precious few of them whom the league considers fit to sit in the legislative assembly. The league itself gives an account of its procedure before making the above recommendation:</p>
   <p>"The league, in preparing its report for the forthcoming elections, and in accordance with its former practice, disregarded political party affiliations and endeavored to make its decisions on the basis of the qualifications of candidates who would serve our citizens in the most orderly and efficient manner. Strict impartiality was always the slogan of the voters' league, and we now issue a call to all good citizens not to be bound by party politics but to exert the greatest care in their choice of candidates for the state legislature."</p>
   <p>The report, in itself, is the best proof that the league was actually guided <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>by its declared principles in its choice of candidates who deserve to be recommended. In some districts the league recommends Democrats, in others Republicans, according to the qualifications, character, and merit of each candidate. For the nineteenth senatorial district it recommends most warmly the Republican candidate, Mr. Albert B. Holecek.....</p>
