   <p>The election this fall is so important, that preparation must be made for it at once not only by the political parties, but by the voters as well. The latter can best prepare for the election by attending the primaries in force, and in that way arrange for the nomination of capable candidates. We Bohemians are chiefly interested in the election of a Bohemian Congressman on the Democratic Ticket. We hope that more of our countryman will attend the primary on May 2nd, then have ever done so before. In that way they will assure the nomination of Mrs. Vopicka.</p>
