   <p>Mayor Thompson returned to Chicago yesterday. At the Union Depot he was welcomed by city employees, ordered to be there, ministers, and prohibition fanatics who escorted him in glory through streets of the business district of the city. Many automobiles were covered with slogans praising the Mayor for his decree closing saloons on Sundays, proclaiming him savior of our city, a man who would brave anything in order to enforce the laws.</p>
   <p>The parade marched into Cohan's Grand Opera House, where the Sabbath fanatics held a meeting. They, of course, gave Thompson an enthusiastic welcome there, and all their leaders spoke extolling the Mayor for closing the saloons.</p>
   <p>Then Thompson mounted the platform and read a document in which he attacked <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Anton J. Cermak, calling him to the attention of municipal judges, and suggesting that they take action against him; accusing him of failure to do his duty, and urging him to resign from his office of Chief Bailiff of the Municipal Court in case he should refuse to enforce the law.</p>
   <p>Mayor Thompson's document is of such a character that its whole text should be made public. It is something quite unique in the history of our city and will help our public, whose opinion has lately been turning against the Mayor, to know "Big Bill" in all his littleness. Read Thompson:</p>
   <p>"Being asked by the organization carrying the name of United Civic Societies of Chicago to state my personal opinions and my intentions in case I should be elected mayor, I immediately gave the organization a written statement in which I expressed my personal views. It was nothing else than an expression of private opinion. I did not bind myself by that statement to abstain from enforcing the law in accordance with my <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>oath of the office.</p>
   <p>"What a man likes or dislikes is of no consequence if it is against the law which a public officer has sworn to enforce. It is not the function of the chief executive of a city to enact or repeal laws, but to enforce them.</p>
   <p>"I am, and I have always been, in favor of city autonomy. The only way the people can secure good administration, truly liberal government, government of personal liberty, government of equal rights, is honest enforcement of the law by public officials.</p>
   <p>"When Anton J. Cermak, the secretary of the club known as the United Civic Societies, or anybody else, ever thought he could force me to disregard my duties, the duties I have sworn to perform to the best of my ability, he was ignorant of my conception of public duty.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"Mr. Cermak's attacks directed against me because I do my duty are inexcusable, particularly because he himself, as the chief bailiff of the Municipal Court, has sworn to obey the law. His action in attacking the Mayor of Chicago because the Mayor is enforcing the law is detrimental to free government. Mr. Cermak is harming the people whose representative he professes to be.</p>
   <p>"I refuse to believe Mr. Cermak's statement that the men and women who are members of fraternal societies organized for their own good would require the mayor of Chicago to neglect duties he has sworn to perform and which are prescribed by the law.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Cermak! Because you, as an officer of the Municipal Court, have made a public request that a public official violate the oath of his office, and because that request of yours is detrimental to the reputation of the Municipal Court, you should either retract your statement containing that request and give the public the assurance that <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>you yourself will obey the law, or resign your office of Chief Bailiff of the Municipla Court so that Chicago may be spared the odium of having in its courts an official who publicly requests public officers to neglect their sworn duties.</p>
   <p>"I am calling on Harry Olson, the Chief Justice of the Municipal Court, to take notice of the statements made by Mr. Cermak, an officer of his Court, and to ask the judges of that Court to take such steps in this matter as they may see fit.</p>
   <p>"I make this request because the question as to whether or not a public official should enforce the law in accordance with his sworn duty is not a question of what he likes or dislikes, it is not a question of the wet and the drys; it is not a question of personal opinion. It is a question of law and order.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, men and women who believe that law and order should be upheld <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>must join hands and stand united against the enemies of society, no matter who these enemies may be, in case they request public officials to neglect duties they have sworn to perform."</p>
   <p>The attack on Mr. Cermak and his accusation to Judge Olson, as well as the inflaming of all the judges of the Municipal Court against Mr. Cermak are characteristic methods of "Big Bill".</p>
   <p>As it happened, Mr. Cermak was not in Chicago yesterday. He was in Antioch, Illinois, from where he telephoned the following reply: "Bill Thompson cannot intimidate me by any threats. Had he not signed the pledge to the United Civic Societies he would never have been elected Mayor. If I were in his place I should rather resign my office than to enforce the Sunday closing law knowing that the people of Chicago are against it. If it comes to a fight, I am not afraid of Mr. Thompson. I know how to defend what I consider right, good, and profitable for the people."</p>
   <p>According to expert legal opinion, municipal judges are unable to undertake <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>anything against Mr. Cermak, even if they wished to humor Mr. Thompson. According to the State constitution only the State legislature can impeach and suspend an elected official who has failed to discharge his duties.</p>
   <p>There was a rumor yesterday in the City Hall that in case Cermak should continue his attacks against the Mayor because of the enforcement of the Sunday closing law, the States attorney's office would be asked to charge Mr. Cermak with misbehavior in office.</p>
