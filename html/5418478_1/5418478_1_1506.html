   <p>The Ceskoslovansky Poplatnicky Spolek (Czecho-Slavonic Taxpayers' Association) is one of the most important and most powerful organizations in Cicero, Illinois. Its worthy activities, and tireless efforts to improve that community, are well known to all who are interested in the public affairs of Cicero. The Spolek works continuously for the well-being of all the residents and therefore, when once in a great while it arranges some entertainment, the public ought to prove by attending that they appreciate its deserving labors.</p>
   <p>It has well earned this appreciation and citizens who attend the banquet will not only show their appreciation but will find that the entertainment on this occasion will be excellent. The committee has made arrangements for the banquet to be given in the hall of the Karel Jonas Sokol, at the corner of West 25th Street and 55th Avenue, Cicero, Illinois. The admission for a couple [lady and gentleman] is six dollars, and every additional <span class="page-break">2</span>lady pays two dollars. Mr. K. Cada's orchestra will furnish the music. The banquet will begin promptly at 8 P. M. [Translator's note: No date is given.]</p>
