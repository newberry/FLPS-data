   <p>....Some of the members of the Chicago School Board, which is controlled by Mayor Thompson, have the cheek to stand for a story in the books used in grade schools giving praise to the German Kaiser. Again, other members cannot see why the Chicago Poles raise an objection to the name of a public school which is located in the heart of their settlement on the Northwest side of our city, and which is disfigured by the name of Bismarck.</p>
   <p>Not only the Poles, but we Czechs as well ought to be grateful to Mr. Anthony Czarnecki who is making every possible effort to have the name changed from the obnoxious "Bismarck School."</p>
   <p>Is there one among us Czechs who, at the mention of Bismarck, "the Iron Chancellor," would not think of the many thousands of our boys mowed down by the Prussian armies that invaded Bohemia in the War of 1866?</p>
