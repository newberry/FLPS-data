   <p>Yesterday afternoon, the Democratic Convention of West Town was held in the Wallov Hall, corner Adams and Halsted streets. The convention itself was unusually large and very significant for us Bohemians, because there was nominated our countryman Josef Soukup, as candidate for Appraiser's office. There were proposed three more candidates for the same office. One of the delegates, I cannot recollect his name right now, was of the opinion that the Bohemians who form, on the West Side, the major part of the citizens and taxpayers should have in the appraiser's office their countryman Mr. J. Soukup because he had been in this office for two full terms already and because he was again proposed by the Bohemians. This argument was decisive and Mr. J. Soukup was nominated as candidate with a majority of 38 votes.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the convention was Mr. Wilhelm McClure; proposed candidates for the office of West Town Appraiser were: J. Soukup, J. O'Brien, M. J. Hayes, and John O'Brien. The victor with the majority of 38 votes was Mr. J. Soukup.</p>

   <p>As we hear, in the 6th ward there will be nominated a Bohemian candidate to the City Council; the local Independent Democratic Club taking into consideration that Mr. Kalal refused the proffered candidacy. We were not able to verify if this were true. It is strange anyway because the club mentioned has already nominated somebody else in place of Mr. Kalal.</p>
