   <p>The enforcement of the national prohibition law will be impossible, declared Congressman Adolph J. Sabath from Chicago in the House of Representatives, today, in an attempt to exclude from the deficiency appropriation the item of one million dollars, for the maintenance of guards for the liquor warehouses..... "I do not believe that the Government will be able to enforce this prohibition law," said Congressman Adolph J. Sabath. "Before we get through with this, the attempt will cost four or five million dollars a year. You cannot enforce it, because the people of the United States are against it."</p>
