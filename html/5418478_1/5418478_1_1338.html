   <p>.....Every Czechoslovak voter should pay attention to the fact that some of our ablest countrymen are candidates for important offices, and if these men are to be elected to these offices they must receive every vote from our Czechoslovak citizens. One of these candidates is Alderman Anton J. Cermak who was recommended by the regular Democratic organization for the office of president of the County Board of Commissioners, and surely every Czechoslovak citizen hopes that he is elected. But you must not forget that the enemies of the regular Democratic organization have put up an opposition ticket, and that they resort to propoganda to defeat our countryman, one who every Czechoslovak would like to see occupying the chair of the president of the Board. The same thing is true in the case of our well-known countryman Mr. Josef A. Mendl whom the regular Democratic organization recommended for membership of the county <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>board of commissioners. Mr. Mendl has on previous occasion filled that office with great success, and it is desirable that he be re-elected. This will be possible only when every Czechoslovak voter comes to the primaries and casts his or her ballot in behalf of these men. If we desire to be thoroughly represented in public offices, we must win such a representation, and for that we will have an opportunity on April 11.</p>
   <p>There will be many meetings to boost Alderman Cermak, and our Czechoslovak Democrats should take part in all of them. It depends on citizens of Democratic persuasion and Czechoslovak origin to see that Alderman Anton J. Cermak is nominated at the primary election on April 11, and thus gain the opportunity for election in November. The office of president of the County Board of Commissioners surely equals in importance the office of the mayor of the city of Chicago; it is even more important in many respects. Mr. Cermak, has a very fine reputation not only in Chicago, but in the entire country. He has many friends and acquaintances among other foreign-language groups all of which are his boosters, promising a flood of votes in the ensuing primaries. But <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Mr. Cermak trusts that his own countrymen will make a real showing and insure the outcome of this election--a victory for all of us. This showing consists chiefly of a large number of meetings by means of which the boosting of Messrs. Cermak and Mendl and the rest of the candidates is accomplished....The speakers secured for these meetings speak clearly and convincingly stressing the necessity of casting every single Czechoslovak ballot....They show how the present primaries are more important than the actual election itself; they instruct the citizenry in ways which will insure the election of Mr. Cermak and his running mates.</p>
   <p>There will shortly be a large number of such meetings in our Bohemian neighborhoods. Of course, we know that the organizers of these meetings mailed out the usual invitations, etc., but to make sure that the word reaches all of our people, we mention again the various occasions, places, etc. in which our [political] activities come into play. This column, therefore, advertises the following meetings which will be held in the next few days:</p>

   <p>On Friday evening there will be a meeting at Mr. J. F. Pastas place, 3046 West 26th Street, and our office was informed that the program will be very interesting. The speakers will be Messrs. Otto Kerner, Alderman of the Twelfth Ward; J. Cepak, Otto Fuerst, and others. On the same evening there will be a meeting in Mr. Randak's hall, 2700 Turner Avenue, where the same speakers will address <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>our voters of both sexes.....</p>
   <p>Cicero, Illinois is equally active, and there are signs that Messrs. Cermak and Mendl, as well as their running mates on the regular Democratic ticket, will receive so many votes in the primary election that it will astonish even those who entertain the rosiest hopes. Next Sunday a meeting will be held in Mr. Horalek's hall, 25th Street and 59th Avenue.....</p>
