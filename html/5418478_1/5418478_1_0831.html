   <p>The Austrians are beginning to use new tactics. It is reported that a parade was arranged by them for Sunday, featuring the Slavonic nations "loyal to the Empire," and marching for the immortal glory of Emperor Francis Joseph I!</p>
   <p>The demonstration is supposed to serve a three-fold purpose: First, to prove that there are, maybe, some remnants of Slavonic blood still loyal to the Habsburgs, and desire to remain under their rule; second, that the old criminal, who has signed with his own hand over four thousand death sentences during the War, still finds some fools who call themselves his admirers. And third, to incite the Italians against the Dalmatinians. The route, Wentworth Avenue and West 22nd Street, to be covered by the parade, is inhabited, predominantly, by <span class="page-break">\2</span>Italians. The hostility thus created could be used for propaganda, in print or otherwise, against both the Italians and Dalmatians. The parade was a blunt provocation, for the great majority of the Slavonic peoples, so overwhelmingly, to the extreme limit, anti-Austrian.</p>
   <p>but we are exceedingly interested, and so is the broad thinking public, to learn who coaxed the parade managers into using Czech flags at the head of the procession! Some Austrian agents may have intended to create ill feelings toward the Czechs and Slovaks, in case some disturbances should take place during the marching. Or, it may be that the Austrian agents strove to include in their reports to their superiors in Vienna and in Washington the news that they have found Czechs in America who think of the murderers of their fathers back in the old country with gratitude.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>But, by using Czech flags, the agents also intended to mislead the Allies, who have only recently promised their support to the Czech cause. The Slavonic colors displayed should create in the minds of the Allies the impression that they are being double-crossed by those peoples whose interests are to guard those shedding their blood. It is further worth mentioning that the Austrians had tried to engage a Czech band, that of the well-known leader, Mr. Povolny. The latter, however, conscious of his duty as a patriot, flatly refused to hire himself for such a purpose, although he had often before played for those who attempted to persuade him. Our Czech public will surely give proof of acknowledgement of this firm attitude. It would be appropriate to inform our authorities, even the Mayor himself, of the insulting treatment suffered at the hands of aliens by those who have gladly renounced allegiance to their former rulers in order to become American citizens, and enjoy the blessings of Republican freedom. If those provoking agents wish to adore their emperors, they ought to do <span class="page-break">\4</span>it at home, and should not hurt the feelings of tens of thousands of those who have found a better existence here than their bloodthirsty former rulers would ever have provided for them.</p>
   <p>It should be the task of our organizations to call the attention of the authorities to this mischief, and the Czech colors should not be allowed to serve as a means to pay homage to the worst ruler for the last three hundred years, and to whom the Czech nation ever has been a subject.</p>
