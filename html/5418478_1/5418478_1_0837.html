   <p>The central Slovak national organization in America, the Slovenska Liga (Slovak League), has sent the following cablegram to the British Prime Minister on the occasion of the inauguration of Professor Masaryk's lectures at the University of London:</p>
   <p>"The Slovenska Liga of America sends you, on behalf of seven hundred thousand Austro-Hungarian Slovaks settled in the United States, greetings on the occasion of the beginning of the lectures of our noted countryman, Professor Tomas G. Masaryk, at the University of London. We, the American Slovaks, wholeheartedly, desire the success and decisive victory of the British and the Allies' arms, because it is only from such victory that we Slovaks, in narrow political partnership with our nearest brothers, the Bohemians, can hope for liberation from Austro-Hungarian oppression and tyranny, and for freedom and national independence."</p>
   <p>The Liga has also sent a cablegram to Professor Masaryk:</p>

   <p>"Sincere greetings and good wishes for the success of your lectures in which please remember us Slovaks who work hand in hand with the Bohemians for liberty and national independence.</p>
   <p>"For the Slovenska Liga of America,</p>
   <p>"Albert Mamatey, president."</p>
   <p>Both these cablegrams are most timely and appropriate manifestations. Just at this time a conference of representatives of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) and the Slovenska Liga is being held in Cleveland, Ohio, and the cablegrams are harbingers of closer co-operation between the central bodies of the two brotherly Slavic branches in America.</p>
