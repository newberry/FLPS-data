   <p>The secretary of the United Societies, Alderman Anton J. Cermak, announces that the druggists in the prohibition district on the South Side freely and without punishment violate city ordinances and State laws and that they sell intoxicating liquors, without having the necessary license. Mr. Cermak made the rounds accompanied by his chauffeur, stopping also in Hyde Park. They were both successful in getting all the whiskey they wanted from all the drugstores they visited. The city ordinance permits druggists to sell whiskey for medicinal purposes only, but Mr. Cermak and his companion were able to get whiskey everywhere without a doctor's prescription..... . .</p>
   <p>Prohibitionists have a standard excuse for this condition; they say that they are not against drinking, but against saloons.</p>
