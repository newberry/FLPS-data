   <p>Our countrymen, living in the West Town should not miss the opportunity of giving their votes at the next election to our popular candidate, Mr. Cerveny, for West Town Collector. Every one of our men, be he Democratic or Republican, should give his vote to him, because Mr. Cerveny is a trustworthy man. He is more in need of Bohemian votes now than ever before, because the Bohemian wards are showing a strange political inactivity in comparison to previous campaigns. In the main Bohemian ward, the company of public roads has been bought out and the Republican candidate for Alderman will be strongly supported by all corporations, as they know that they can depend on him and that he will not interfere with the interest of his Democratic rival.</p>
   <p>It is very possible that many citizens taking this into consideration would rather abstain from voting, than help willingly in evidently corrupt politics, or they would prefer perhaps to vote the straight Republican ticket.</p>
   <p>This way the interest of Mr. Cerveny would be badly harmed, although during all the years that he has filled the office of West Town Collector he acted towards the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Bohemians as an honest countryman, and never treated the people like other countrymen's politicians, who flatter before the election day and promise everything; but after election, are never home to anyone. Remember all, when election day comes, everybody should give his vote to Mr. Cerveny.</p>
