   <p>Although the weather today is not very agreeable, it will not frighten the Bohemian voters. When a problem concerning the welfare of the whole community comes up such trifles as weather must not be and are not considered by them. The Czechoslovak citizens of both sexes who belong to the Democratic organization and who, during the course of the campaign, have shown so much enthusiasm and determination to help Mr. Anton J. Cermak as well as all our countrymen who are on the same ticket with him, will not be scared away by wind and rain, but will come to the polls to help by casting their ballots for the good of the Democratic and Czechoslovak causes. The Bohemian wards and Bohemian suburbs will show their strength, proving thereby that respect is always due them from everyone.....In the last moment we have received intelligence to the effect that the Thompson gang, which appeared to be non-partisan concerning the Republican candidate of the Nineteenth Senatorial District, will bend their energies to defeat our Bohemian candidate, Mr. Albert Holecek, and help the other aspirant who is a mere puppet of their political machine. Let no one of our voters who has the good of his fellow citizens at heart, <span class="page-break">\2</span>give ear to their wiles.....</p>
   <p>Before our newspaper reaches the hands of our readers, many of our men will already have performed their duties of a citizen, for many go to the polls before they go to their respective daily occupations. But our women, sisters, and daughters, who have their equal political rights, will go to the polls later. It is they who will have a chance to read this issue, and it is to them that we speak. Whether you be of Democratic or Republican persuasion, go to the polls and by your votes help those men who will work for us, men of whom we may be proud as Czechoslovaks and as citizens of America.....</p>
