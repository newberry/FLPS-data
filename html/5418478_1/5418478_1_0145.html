   <p>Certain members of our Board of Education are trying to change the system of gymnastics used in our schools. For the present system, which is also taught in our Bohemian Sokol and German Turner gymnasiums, and in which the use of many different kinds of apparatus is stressed, they wish to substitute the Swedish system of gymnastics. This system has already been introduced in about four Chicago public schools "on trial," we are told.</p>
   <p>This happened after the Board members James B. Dilbelka, Turner, H. W. Huttman, John C. Harding, and C. O. Sethness had been unjustly ousted by our mayor, and after Chairman Reinberg had refused to recognize them as members of the Board in spite of a court decision in their favor.</p>
   <p>Charles S. Peterson, a Swede by birth and a member of the Board of Education, now chairman of the finance committee, is stressing the fact that no apparatus is needed under the Swedish system, and therefore under that system the cost <span class="page-break">2</span>of outfitting and the upkeep of gymnasiums could be considerably reduced.</p>
   <p>Deacon W. T. Sumner is supporting Mr. Peterson. He is also one of the staunch supporters of the School Superintendent, Mrs. Ella Flag Young.</p>
   <p>It is up to Bohemian Sokols and German Turners and all others who believe in the value of our system of gymnastics to register their protests at the right time and place.</p>
