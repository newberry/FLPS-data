   <p>The YMCA held a fair in its building, 3210 Arthington Street, a gift by Rosenwald, during the days from Dec. 29, 1916 to Jan. 1, 1917. The exhibition which stood under the sign of "Crafts and Arts," brought many samples of skill and talent before the eyes of the visitors, who had come in great numbers, to which men prominent in their vocations contributed a large contingent. The arrangement committee consisted of some members most influential in the association, which may be called the biggest of its kind in the United States. Only objects of merit were placed on exhibition.</p>
   <p>There were two divisions: one for grammar and one for high schools. In the former we did not encounter the work of a single pupil of Czech descent by either close or distant relationship. In the high school division, on the contrary, there were long rows of work done by Czech pupils and they were being discussed with utmost interest. There was a printer's roller made by Julius Bizik, of Crane High School which was awarded the second prize. The first prize in the Carpenter's Section was won jointly by Josef Prochazka, and Karel Luire. In the Patterns' Section it was Jan Stastny who received the first prize.</p>
   <p>Pupils of the C. H. Harrison High School, however, won the highest honors. Among these, Anton Coufal, of 3614 W. 26th Street, son of the well-known choir director and light-opera conductor, distinguished himself by winning two prizes in the Art Section, in which another Czech-American, J. Vopat, came into prominence. We are giving these names to the public because by doing so we are giving well-deserved publicity to the young men and a stimulus for the further pursuit of their ambitious aims.</p>
