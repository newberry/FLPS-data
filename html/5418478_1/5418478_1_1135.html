   <p>The words of the well-known workingmen's song, "Chce-Li Mocna Paze Tva, Vsechna Kola Stoji" (If so wills the mighty arm, all wheels stop rotating), have proved to be true in Chicago. The union of streetcar and elevated railway employees has called a strike after trying in vain to make the Chicago Surface Lines agree to arbitration on a basis that would assure the employees a just and equitable decision. The strike started today at 4:00 A. M.</p>
   <p>The order to strike was issued from the union's headquarters in Briggs House yesterday afternoon, but even after that, almost until midnight, attempts were being made in the Mayor's office to bring about an agreement between the companies and the employees. But all such attempts shattered against the stubbornness of Director Busby, who would not even listen to the request that certain requests of the employees be granted prior to the beginning of arbitration proceedings.....</p>
