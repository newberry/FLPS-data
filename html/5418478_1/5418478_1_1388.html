   <p>All friends of our Bohemian candidate for nomination for the office of County Sheriff, Mr. Jos. A. Mendel, are hard at work in the various West Side wards....</p>
   <p>No more meetings for him will be held.... because his prospects seem really very good.</p>
   <p>The entire English language press of Chicago is strongly in favor of Mr. John A. Cervenka's nomination for the office of Clerk of the Probate Court. This is the best evidence that he is considered a most able officer not only by his countrymen, but also by all the American people.</p>
   <p>Congressman Adolph J. Sabath's record is his best recommendation.....Democratic voters of the Fifth Congressional district cannot do better than to give him their votes......</p>
