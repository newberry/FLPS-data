   <p>p.1-- Our people are not ignorant of the fact that the Prohibition Party does not attack the Chicago saloon only. They have long ago learned that the fanatical Prohibitionists' intentions are directed against personal liberty in general. There is hardly a single Bohemian in Chicago who does not know the Prohibitionists' trump card, and consequently all know that the Drys play a crooked game. All know that they want first to annihilate the saloon, and that after they succeed in that, they will turn to other issues and finally dictate to us not only what to drink but also what to do at all times. This of course we shall not and must not allow to happen, and it is therefore the duty of all liberal-thinking citizens to enlist in one mighty army to repel the attack against the first strong fortress of liberty, the saloon business. Bohemians will not be told by any one in the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>world what to drink, what to eat, and how to live. There is one person, it is true, to whom we will listen,--the physician whom we consult when we are ill.</p>
   <p>In the meeting held last night in the Pilsen Sokol Hall under the auspices of the United Societies the prohibition movement was thoroughly discussed, so that not even one who may have lent a willing ear to the blandishments of the pharisaical Prohibitionists' could hesitate any longer to rise against that riff-raff and fight them on every front. The hall overflowed with enthusiastic liberals who filled it with peals of applause during everyone of the speeches, which bristled with pointed remarks.</p>
   <p>Mr. John A. Cervenka, first vice-president of the United Societies, opened the meeting at 2 p. m. He was then elected chairman and explained to the assembly the purpose of the meeting. He than gave the floor to Mr. Michels, who immediately sailed into the prohibition movement with these words:</p>
   <p>"These people begrudge us the pleasure of having a glass of beer in an inn <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with an agreeable conversation; they want us to drink in alleys and shanties, as people drink in those sections where Prohibition has succeeded."</p>
   <p>Mr. Michels was followed by Mr. Michaelis, editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, who expressed his joy at the tremendous response to the invitation to this mass-meeting and then continued;</p>
   <p>"We are all immigrants or the children of immigrants, and it is immaterial how long we have been in America. Immigrants deserve great credit for the development of this country, and that is why we are proud to be known as immigrants. The Prohibitionists on the contrary are continually attempting to prove that as native Americans they are superior to the immigrant. Well, I am glad to admit that they are Americans and the offsprings of Indians, and Indians, as is well known, must not be allowed to take a single swig of alcohol because this will result in an eruption of beastial ferocity dangerous to their environment. But it is impossible to get along with that paltry trash who have no red blood and no honor in them."</p>
   <p>Alderman Anton Cermak, the next speaker, exposed by incontrovertible evidence <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and precise conclusions the hollowness and falseness of the arguments of Prohibitionists:</p>
   <p>"It is not a question of whether we shall have saloons in Chicago but the question of personal liberty for every one of us. Prohibition cannot prohibit the use of liquor, but it can put upon us such burdens that we shall be sorry that we have allowed affairs to go so far. We still have the power to destroy the Prohibition movement, but unless we do so now, it will rise to attack us over the entire State. The struggle will then have fatal possibilities and may easily and in disaster. I wish to submit some figures which show that Prohibition cannot forbid liquor but will put a burden upon the liberal-minded taxpayer."</p>
   <p>And then Mr. Cermak produced some very interesting statistical data. He compared towns where there is no prohibition with such as are under the heel of the drys; invariably in the former towns there were fewer instances of punishment for drunkenness than in the latter. The reason for this, Mr. Cermak said, is that in the free towns beer is used to quench the thirst, <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>whereas in towns which have prohibition liquor is consumed only to aggravate thirst. Internal revenue from the sale of liquor has increased fifty per cent in States which have adopted prohibition. In Chicago the sixth, seventh, and twenty-fifth wards, dubbed "silk-stocking wards," the very hotbeds of Prohibition, yield $375,590 in city taxes for general consumption. The fifth, eighth, ninth, twelfth, and twenty-ninth, populated by the liberal element, pay $1,369,500. On the other hand, the general expenditure of the city for the upkeep of the prohibition wards is $643,345.78, while the liberal wards receive $868,738.86; this shows that the taxpayers of the liberal wards have to pay for the prohibition wards populated by the wealthy.</p>
   <p>After these telling comparisons a certain Gilchrist Lawson, a Protestant preacher and a protagonist of Prohibition, appeared and asked for the floor. He demanded of Mr. Cermak whether it is not true that the inhabitants of the prohibition wards, for the very reason that they are wealthier, are those who maintain the charitable institutions for the benefit of the poor. The arrogance of this half-crazy fanatic caused much indignation in the gathering, but Mr. Cermak promptly demonstrated by figures which he had ready that it is the poor who pay for the police in the rich wards, for the old people's homes, and for the hospitals as well. Mr. Cermak's explanation had the desired <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>effect, and the preacher retired with dejected mien.</p>
   <p>In a brief speech Mr. Cyril Jandus pointed out the economic consequences of Prohibition.</p>
   <p>"Seven thousand stores would have to close, and twenty thousand men would have to look for other occupations; besides that, seven million dollars in taxes would have to be raised from other sources," he warned.</p>
   <p>Congressman Sabath then took the floor and said: "This multitude of intelligent men and women and their attitude convince me that our liberty will be preserved, and that no one will succeed in wresting it from us."</p>
   <p>Mr. Sabath then charged the Prohibitionists with taking money from the poor without contributing any for their needs. He did not spare the heads of the railroad and street-car companies, who almost without exception are Prohibitionists.</p>
   <p>"How well they care for their property and foster its growth:" the congressman <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>exclaimed. "And what do they do for their working-men? When a car is damaged, they promptly have it repaired for further use. But when a man becomes incapacitated while working for them, he is abandoned, and another takes his place."</p>
   <p>The speaker characterized such behavior as downright criminal and unworthy of citizens of the United States. He referred to the struggle against Prohibition in the city of Baltimore, where as a speaker he had put the question squarely before the leaders of the prohibition party:</p>
   <p>"What are you going to give the people in return for the saloon? Do you think that working-men can gather in clubs like yours and drink champagne? No, gentlemen, the working-man to-day needs the saloon for the discussion of public affairs and as a place for social gatherings."</p>
   <p>Several other speakers appeared on the platform and spoke in various languages. The meeting was an unqualified success. However, we recommend that some one be engaged for the next meeting to speak in Bohemian for the benefit of those who do not understand English very well.</p>
