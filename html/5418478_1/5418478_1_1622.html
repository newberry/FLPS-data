   <p>The recount of the votes given the aldermanic candidates of the 29th Ward in the April election made remarkable progress yesterday. When the vote of the 23rd precinct had been recounted last night, the Republican candidate, Mr. Mueller had a majority of eleven votes over the Democratic candidate, our countryman, Mr. Janovsky.</p>
   <p>The recount is being followed with great interest among the Bohemian Democrats of the 29th Ward, and many of their representatives are present at all times in the offices of the Board of Election Commissioners, where the recount is taking place.</p>
