   <p>The indifference of Chicago Bohemians to one of the most important matters which concerns them, and about which all the Bohemian-Newspapers have had something to say, is truly amazing. We are referring to the matter of teaching the Bohemian language in some of the city schools. In spite of inquiries from all directions, there is maintained on this subject the silence of the grave.</p>
   <p>If we were not aware that the important matter of the Sharpeshooters has taken precedure over other matters at the present time, we would be forced to think that Chicago Bohemians had lost their love for their mother tongue entirely. However, we hope that when our disturbed thoughts have quieted down, that some active national society, or some group of individuals, will take the task upon themselves and work for its realization with vigor.</p>
