   <p>Many times we have had the opportunity to call the attention of our countrymen to the manner in which the local foreign press, especially German and English, are using the smallest facts to lower the Bohemian immigrant element to a basis below that of the Polish or Russian Jew. Our Bohemian immigrants were depicted as enemies of the American regime, ignorant, anarchistically inclined and trying to overthrow the regular government.</p>
   <p>We should be thankful for this kind of inspiration to the individuals who collected money among the American population for educational purposes for the local Bohemians. It is impossible to refute such calumnies with two or three columns of writing about some prominent Bohemian citizen or about some national undertaking which is published in the American news by the country of this or that other person.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The German journals and especially those which reflect the local voice of the people, as for instance, the Abendpost and others, are helping to spread among foreigners the false impression that the Bohemian working masses are very low in every way. At the outbreak of the tailors strike, one of the local German newspapers lamented the Bohemian tailor trade and added to it that Bohemia is one of the nations that brought poverty to this country. Everybody knows how our intelligent tailors tried to keep on the level, to organize the workingmen in the tailor business and to agitate for improvement of the trade.</p>
   <p>In yesterday's copy of the Record for instance, there appeared a news story entitled, "Bohemians are Fighting With Bohemians. A Few Shots Were Fired And The Fighting Was So Violent That Police From Three Stations Were Called." The local press spreads this kind of information with pleasure. Among American readers, we have collected the details on the above item in the Record. There was a little first fight between two Bohemians. We hope our readers, friends of the Bohemian population, will pay no attention to this kind of wrong information <span class="page-break">3</span>The local Bohemian workingmen know very well that the Bohemian community and press sympathize with them. They will carefully watch themselves so that nothing may happen, which would give the English newspapers a chance to write stories again, dishonoring our honest workingmen. Endurance, self-esteem, general moderation and reputation will elevate the Bohemian workers and place them on the high level with others.</p>
