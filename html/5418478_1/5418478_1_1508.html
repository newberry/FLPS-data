   <p>In spite of the very hot weather a meeting of the Cesko-Slovansky Poplatnicky Spolek v Cicero, Illinois (Czecho-Slavonic Taxpayers Association of Cicero, Illinois) was held on September 2, and was well attended. The picnic committee submitted its report on the picnic arranged by the Spolek, and it was agreed that the proceeds of the picnic were satisfactory.....The citizen Klimes, a trustee, reported on the West Suburban Bus Line. The company asks for permission to run its busses through our community, that is, over 22nd Street and Ogden Avenue, and westerly to Fullersburg, Illinois. The fare which the company intends to charge would be seven cents in Cicero, but the town council insists that it be not more than five cents. The council asked the Spolek to aid it in obtaining better advantages from the said company. After a brief debate it was decided that the executive board should study the problem, and weigh its advantages and disadvantages.</p>

   <p>The matter of sprinkling lawns and gardens came up for discussion, and it was reported that certain citizens were fined for transgressing the law regulating the use of water between the hours of 6 A.M. and 9 P.M. After a lengthy debate it was pointed out that the Western Electric Company sprinkles its lawns all day long without interference [by the authorities]. It was decided that the executive board should investigate this matter and find out whether the Western Electric Company uses its own water or the city's. The same board is to find the reasons also for the very low water pressure; the upper stories seem to lack a sufficient water supply; often the water stops running altogether.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the Spolek will be held on October 7, and the citizens are requested to attend in full numbers. Those who have not paid for their [picnic] tickets are asked to do so in the next meeting by paying to the secretary</p>
   <p>Vaclav Rous, secretary,</p>
