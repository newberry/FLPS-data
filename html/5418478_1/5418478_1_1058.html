   <p>Dear Brothers! Because of the growing number of applicants and cramped quarters, it will be necessary to enlarge the present premises of the Česká Utulna A Sirotčinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). The members of the Unie Českých Tesaru v Chicago (Union of Bohemian Carpenters of Chicago) have agreed to co-operate in the erecting of an addition to the present building and to ask other crafts of the building trades for co-operation.</p>
   <p>We therefore make this appeal to our Bohemian bricklayers, trusting that they too will lend a hand in such a noble and humanitarian undertaking.</p>
   <p>Do not hesitate, but prove that our section always was and will be among those whose help is available to others, when it is really needed.</p>
   <p>Donate one day of work, or a few hours of your services daily, if you can. This will, without doubt, help more than collections.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>A meeting whose purpose is to provide a full explanation of our objectives and to furnish an opportunity for an exchange of opinions on this matter will be held May 17 at 2 P. M. at Mr. Josef Hacha's, 26th Street and Springfield Avenue. The organization committee of Bohemian bricklayers is expecting a large attendance.</p>
