   <p>To-morrow is the day of Democratic primaries and in all wards can be seen "doubled activity."</p>
   <p>The same kind of movement and activity was demonstrated in Bohemian wards. The Bohemian Democratic organization of the 8th ward has scheduled this evening a big meeting in Dusek Hall on Allport Street. It is expected that the hall will be over-crowded. The main purpose of the meeting is the nomination of Bohemian candidates and it is of major importance because the Bohemian population should have the best representatives.</p>
   <p>The first Bohemian Democratic Club of the 10th ward held a big meeting yesterday in the hall at 1024 W. 18th Street. It was determined to promote Joseph Bruzek as candidate for Congressman from the 2nd district.</p>
