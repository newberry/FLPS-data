   <p>The decisive step has been taken and if it were not for the cursed indifference and sluggishness among us, we could know before tomorrow morning what kind of reception was given to our petition to the School Board, in regard to the teaching of the Bohemian Language in our Public Schools.</p>
   <p>It is to be regretted that, in view of very great importance of this matter, the personal interest of the greater portion of our countrymen remains unprecedentedly cold and indifferent. There is, no doubt, but that it was for this reason that the meeting which was held last night, in the interest of this generally known cause, was so little attended.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened and presided over by Citizen Leo Meilbek. After the explanation of the purposes of this meeting, namely the selection of a committee for the securing of signatures to the petition. Mr. M. Baumruker gave a brief talk, pointing out the usefulness and benefits to be derived from the teaching of the Bohemian Language in the Public Schools, describing the convenience of the present time for the accomplishment of this purpose.</p>
   <p>"Let us give some thought to the Bohemian English (Liberal) School, even though it is sufficient for our purpose, still no one can deny that if the Bohemian Language were taught in the Public Schools it would be of great benefit to us for in the former, English is not studied so well as in the latter, and after all, English is the chief language here."</p>
   <p>Many bitter truths were spoken by our esteemed friend and all those present admit that he was right. It was brought out that some of our countrymen were opposed to the teaching of the Bohemian Language in the Public Schools, fearing that they would be forced to pay additional taxes for that purpose. To be sure they are very much mistaken. The appointment of an instructor of the Bohemian Language in the Public Schools will cause no increase in the tax levy upon Bohemians, because the estimated needs for school purposes are spread upon the entire city and each one is required to pay a certain sum, whether they have one, two, five or no teachers whatever and whether or not they send their children to school.</p>
   
   <p>Supposing that the taxes were really increased because of this appointment of a Bohemian Teacher, who would receive about $600.00 yearly, how much increase would fall upon each citizen of the community, surely not over one cent before the entire amount would be made up. Let no one be frightened about this matter; the teaching of the Bohemian Language can be introduced into the school system without any additional outlay or expense to us. Let the parents who have children attending the Throop school sign the petition when it is presented to them and secure the signatures of their neighbors.</p>
   <p>The petition which was made public last Monday was to have been delivered to the School Board today, but owing to the lack of a sufficiently large number of signatures the presentation is postponed for two weeks.</p>
   <p>The committee appointed for the securing of signatures is as follows: Jan Poustecky and J. Sedlacek.</p>
   <p>Once more we wholeheartedly urge all our countrymen who have children attending the Throop School to see to it that the petition for the teaching of Bohemian have as many signatures as it is possible to get.</p>
