   <p>If we want to be consistent, we ought to practice consistency in selecting English language papers for our daily use. The majority of the American papers look down upon us with disrespect. This is a well-known fact which we have not forgotten. Only recently, one of the biggest sheets published in its report on the parade held for the preservation of personal liberty here that "the Czechsmarched along because they want more beer." On rare occasions only did the local English papers make favorable mention of us, and then only after much entreating on our part. Even now, in these turbulent times, when our people are standing up in the very front of all others for Uncle Sam, has this condition changed. There is, however, one paper which has now and then published articles about our people and its rights which could have not been written more sympathetically had the author been the most ardent patriot <span class="page-break">2</span>from our own ranks. We refer to the Chicago Journal. Its attitude towards us is very friendly. We ought to appreciate this fact and reciprocate their hospitality towards our ideals. We have not too many such friends in the English press. Let us, therefore, value them.</p>
