   <p>On Monday, January 10, Mr. E. S. Vraz, a friend of our School, a renowned traveler and president of the Americka Narodni Rada (American National Council), visited us for the purpose of delivering a lecture to the pupils of the Czech section of the Harrison Technical High School on the natural beauties and the architectural monuments of Bohemia. In order that all the two hundred Czech students of the seven grades might attend the lecture in the small hall assigned to us, in which a color-reproducing machine throws the pictures on a screen in colors, it was necessary for Mr. Vraz to repeat the lecture four times. It was no doubt a difficult task for the lecturer; but without doubt it brought its rich reward, as might have been expected.</p>

   <p>The ardent words of the speaker, reinforced by sixty brightly lighted color photos showing the beauties of Bohemia and the monuments of our splendor and our great past, imbued our students with a pride that could not be disguised. These word-pictures of the speaker, along with the color pictures, showed the students that they are descendants of a nation of great renown, for which God willing, even now a great future is in store.</p>
   <p>The lecture was attended by many Bohemian students who do not study the Bohemian language, and therefore we may say that the lecture strenghtened the race-consciousness of the Bohemian students and awakened in those who are not studying Bohemian a livelier interest in the work of the Bohemian section.</p>
   <p>The interest in this lecture was so intense that I will try to have an illustrated lecture every semester. One will be about the natural beauty of Bohemia; another will give an account of the nation's music; and a third describe its art. Surely, in that way, understanding of Bohemian culture and love for it will be aroused.</p>
