   <p>A lively interest in the coming election of candidates for office in Cook County is shown in all Czechoslovak districts, which appears certain to help the regular Democratic ticket to victory on September 11. This is easy to understand. Our people are eager to see the most capable and worthy men elected, but they also want to be represented by people of their own nationality. The regular Democratic party has given our people the recognition to which we are entitled, but we cannot win just representation unless we do our duty at the polls.</p>
   <p>There are two candidates whose names should be an incentive for every worthy Czechoslovak, and prompt him to help them to victory. Mr. Anton J. Cermak is running for the office of sheriff of Cook County, and Mr. John A. Cervenka is competing for office as a member of the Board of Review. Both are known to every Czechoslovak in the county.</p>
   <p>Mr. Henry Stuckart, chairman of the Executive Committee of the Democratic party <span class="page-break">2</span>in Cook County, issued a warning against the practices employed by the opponents of the regular ticket. One example is the improper use of the name of a Mr. A. J. Cermak of Karlov Avenue, whom they want to pass off by trickery as a candidate for the office of sheriff against the regular candidate, Mr. Anton J. Cermak. They intend to split our votes between two Cermaks.</p>
   <p>Another candidate for whom Czechoslovaks should vote is Mr. Edward Rada, candidate for State senator in the l0th District, which is composed of parts of the 10th, 11th, and 20th wards, where Czechoslovaks are strongly represented.</p>
