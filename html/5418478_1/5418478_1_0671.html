   <p>Prohibition seems to be gaining ground all over the United States. We go from one extreme to another. Where formerly alcoholic beverages, especially the "potent" kind, were being consumed in large amounts, suddenly complete prohibition was instituted, accompanied by such evils as hypocrisy, intolerance, snooping, etc. If it were moderation, we should be the first in favor of it. But prohibition, in our opinion, is worse than excessive drinking.</p>
