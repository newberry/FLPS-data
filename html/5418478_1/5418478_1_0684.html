   <p>Those who are financially interested in or follow the development of the new Bohemian colony in Morton Park will be glad to hear that, by a vote of eight to one, the local council adopted an ordinance permitting the conduct of cafe business in a certain part of the community. The liberal element settled in this suburb had been working for quite some time for this privilege. Now it has finally succeeded in convincing the wise members of the council that catering to puritanical prejudices would hamper the development of this new and promising settlement.....</p>
   <p>The number of cafes is not limited; the license fee is set at five hundred dollars a year.....The territory where cafes are permitted is described as: 25th Street between 54th and 56th Avenues, the east side of 56th Avenue between 25th and 26th Streets, and the south side of 22nd Street between 54th and 56th Avenues.</p>
