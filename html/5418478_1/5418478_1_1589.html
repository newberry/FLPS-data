   <p>The activities of the Cesky Obcansky Klub (Bohemian Citizens' Club) in Oak Park are undoubtedly well known to the general public in that community. Founded in 1907, the Club consists of wide-awake and alert citizens, all of whom are active both in local political life and in national Bohemian affairs.....Its principal merit lies in the foundation of a Bohemian free thought school which the Club supported and which was finally transferred to the management of the Patronat Karel Havlicek (Trustees of the Karel Havlicek School). [Translator's note: The article mentions a number of various donations.]</p>
   <p>Lately the Club merged with the Klub Ceskych Poplatniku (Bohemian Taxpayers' Club). This powerful body will now no doubt represent our nation in Oak Park properly.....</p>
