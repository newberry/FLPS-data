   <p>If those sincere German Socialists, to whom their Socialist creed means more than their Germanism, could advise their comrades on this side of the ocean they would ask them to help the United States to beat the Kaiser, Prussianism and militarism, those three great obstacles in the development of Germany and of all mankind. But the Socialists in this country are for peace, and thus support the Kaiser, Brussianism and militarism. They damage their own cause, and are a detriment unto all mankind. We cannot comprehend how the Czech and Slovak Socialists can find this compatible with the dictations of their conscience. We are, however, not surprised to see the Germans act like this. They are leaders of the party here. There are very few Liebknechts among them, but all the more Scheidemanns and Davids.</p>
