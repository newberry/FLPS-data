   <p>Within the last few days Chicago was to have been flooded with strikebreakers who were to take the places of the striking employees of the Chicago streetcar and elevated railway systems. The kind of men who were being brought here from other cities may be judged by the fact that the police have found among the arrivals twenty-five known criminals, and a more thorough investigation would, no doubt, discover many more of them. It is generally well known that only the lowest type of men can be hired for breaking a strike. That there would be many thieves and other criminals among them is obvious. Such men, of course, are always in favor of making an excursion to Chicago from New York or Eastern cities. That is something that cannot be changed, but the worst of it is that these morons like to stay in Chicago, and thus they increase our army of criminals, which is large enough as it is. Many of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>them will have to leave Chicago very soon, but those who are the least desirable will try the hardest to settle here. That means that our police will have still more to do than they have now, and this will be a condition brought about by the streetcar and elevated lines that had hired these strikebreakers.</p>
