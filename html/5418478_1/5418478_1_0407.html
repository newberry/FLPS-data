   <p>After several years of energetic activity for the preservation of Bohemian Free Thought schools in Cicero, the Patronat Ceske Svobodomyslne Skoly Tomas G. Masaryk (Board of Trustees of the Thomas G. Masaryk Bohemian Free Thought School) is preparing for the celebration of the laying of the cornerstone for a new building which will become the permanent home of the Bohemian school and also the meeting place of numerous Bohemian organizations in Cicero. Next Sunday, therefore, will be a joyous day not only for the Patronat, but also for our organizations, our school children, and the Czechoslovak settlement of this growing suburb. The new school building, the erection of which is advancing so rapidly that the building may be occupied in about five months is located on the southwest corner of 57th Avenue and 22nd Place, Cicero, Illinois, on a site measuring 52 x 125 feet. The structure itself will be a two-story building, 48 feet wide and 62 feet long. The interior of the building will be practically arranged so as to meet every school and organization requirement. On the first floor there will be two classrooms, measuring 18 x 32 feet, a room where small meetings can be held, and a three-room apartment for the janitor. On the second floor there will be one classroom, measuring 18 x 32 feet, one large hall which may be used for lodge meetings, and a toilet room. In the basement there will be a dining room, measuring 18 x 32 feet, toilet rooms for school children, one large room which may be used as a storeroom, and a heating plant. There will be a fire escape installed, and in general, every precaution will be taken in order to make the building safe and comfortable for the school children. The construction is under the supervision of the well-known builder, Mr. Julius Kinst, and the building is estimated to cost about $35,399, including interior decorating and furniture. Mr. Frank J. Petru, a member of the Patronat, arranged a loan of $25,000, of which amount $15,000 is a direct loan; for the remaining sum of $10,000, bonds bearing 5Â½ per cent interest will be issued. These bonds will soon be placed on the market.</p>
