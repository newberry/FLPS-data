   <p>Chicago, June 24. - The Bohemian citizens and taxpayers of Chicago had a meeting at the Bohemian Turn-Hall on Taylor Street on the 23rd of June.</p>
   <p>There was an article published in the Illinois Staats-Zeitung calling all us Bohemians blood-thirsty beasts, and saying that it was only Bohemians that started the row in 1877, and that now they were starting again. We, citizens and taxpayers of this town, have been living here, and know that the trouble in 1877 was only Chicago roughs and loafers, with clubs and stones in their hands, entering shops and making the poor workingman stop and call it a strike. The police force was not strong enough to stop the loafers in their action. The next day there were a few Bohemians mixed in the crowd, but that does not take in all the Bohemians. We and thousands of other citizens stopped at home.</p>
   <p>In regard to the row at the Silver Leaf Grove, how can a newspaper like the Staats Zeitung call all us Bohemian citizens blood-thirsty beasts? Can about 30,000 Bohemians be responsible for about a dozen or more men that get in a row with loafers?</p>

   <p>We Bohemian citizens of this town have been abused several times by the Staats-Zeitung without reason, and it is time that it was stopped. There are as good and respectable Bohemian citizens in this town as there are Americans and Germans.</p>
   <p>We sign in the name of the Bohemian citizens and taxpayers of this town.</p>
