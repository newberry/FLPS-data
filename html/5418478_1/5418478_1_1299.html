   <p>The registration books of the Cook county voters have been closed. Whoever failed to register yesterday may not vote on November 7; by neglecting to register he automatically excluded himself from the ranks of citizens who will go to the polls on that day to elect new officers for our county, state, and the whole Republic.....Those who did register ought to begin now preparing the ground for the election by doing propaganda work for the candidates among their friends.....Our countrymen know all too well how strong the enemy's camp is, and that to counteract and overcome that strength we must concentrate our efforts, and pool all our Czechoslovak votes for the benefit of those candidates whose election will have a meaning. To do that we must do propaganda work among other foreign-language groups.</p>
   <p>The results of yesterday's registration were not satisfactory, and those <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>who predicted that about 900,000 or even a million voters would register for the November election, were disappointed.....</p>
   <p>The register now has 879,685 names.</p>
   <p>The registration in the purely Bohemian districts of our city, that is, in the Twentieth, Twenty-first, Twenty-second, and Twenty-third wards, was as follows:</p>
