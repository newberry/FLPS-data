   <p>Mr. James B. Dibelka, along with three other members of the Chicago School Board who were unjustly ousted from membership, have won their rights as members and have received satisfaction through the due process of law. It was announced yesterday, however, that Mr. Dibelka would resign, because he considers it not an honor, but a disgrace to sit in a meeting with such ruffians as some of the Chicago School Board members have shown themselves to be.</p>
