   <p>Perhaps never before in the history of Chicago has there been such tension between the Municipal Council on the one hand, and the Mayor and the heads of the various departments on the other. Not a meeting of the Municipal Council ends without an attack on the Mayor or on one or another of his appointees, officials whom he protects. The Council wants to force the Mayor to discharge the heads of departments who consider themselves above the alderman, who, after all, are the representatives of the people.</p>
   <p>The controversy started the day the Mayor violated his pledge and, against the will of the majority of the people, started enforcing the Sunday saloon-closing law and the ban on "special bar permits" for entertainments held on Sunday. Aldermen representing wards which have a majority of liberal-minded citizens were only within their rights when they told the Mayor that he is not an all-powerful dictator of our city. It should, however, not be forgotten that this <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>was [not] the only reason of the conflict. The other reason was that the Mayor and the heads of various departments thought they were not responsible to anybody for their actions, and that they were in the City Hall for no other purpose than to protect the interests of their political party; consequently after the Mayor got away with the Sunday-closing law, they took courage for new wilful actions. Therefore it can not be maintained that the closing of saloons on Sunday was the only action by which the Mayor incurred the displeasure of the citizens. There are also other things that have not only the liberal element of the Municipal Council, but also some of the notorious reformers, and aldermen who were never known as friends of personal liberty, in the camp hostile to the Mayor. The Sunday law was, of course, the first signal for the fight against the city administration, but that was followed by a number of deliberate infringements against existing laws, and of spiteful acts against the Council on the part of the Mayor and his henchmen; and now he has the majority of the aldermen aligned against him in a solid front.</p>
   <p>Their first retaliation on the part of the Council was their refusal to ratify <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the Mayor's nomination of the new members of the School Board, organized under the leadership of Alderman [John]Toman ; and then came a series of other rebuffs of the overbearing city administration. Considering the actions of the administration and those of the Council, it is proper to say that the Council's position is quite correct, and that it has the support of the citizens. But the question is what will be the end of that struggle? And will it not be the citizens who will be the losers, the citizens who have been a silent audience witnessing the fight between the Council on one hand, and the Mayor and his subordinates on the other. There are now about half a dozen investigations in progress. What more will happen, how many more of them will be instituted before there will be peace in the City Hall, and whether such peace is possible under the present administration are questions that are most difficult to answer. At the present time, the Civil Service Commission and the Bureau of Boiler Inspection are under investigation, and the City Council has agreed to request the Mayor to discharge two civil service commissioners and Inspector Nye. Another, and still more interesting thing occurred when the Municipal Council, quite innocently, asked the corporation Counsel whether city <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>prosecutor Francis is a regular city official or a mere employee. To all appearances, the purpose of this question was merely to decide whether or not the city prosecutor had the right to attend the meetings of the Council, and the Corporation Counsel decided that not only Francis, but all city attorneys, and all assistant corporation counsels, are regular city officials. The result of this decision was that City Treasurer Sergel refused to pay out to Francis, his salary, maintaining that the appointment of the city prosecutor as a regular city official must be ratified by the Municipal Council before his appointment becomes legal and he can enjoy the provileges of his office. The same principle could be applied in the case of all members of the city law department, but in the case of Francis it seems certain that the Council will refuse its approval, the reason being that Francis had a "black list" of participants in the recent demonstration of the United Civic Societies complied, thus making their prosecution by the city administration possible, and that is something <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>that aldermen representing the idea of personal liberty will never forget.</p>
   <p>The Municipal Council's reply to all this chicanery was a threat and declaration that it will carry on the fight to the last ditch. Now, the Mayor, instead of seeing to it that the complaints of the Municipal Council were promptly taken care of and the disorders discontinued, approved the Civil Service Commission's proposal to investigate the City Council, and voiced veiled accusations against some of the aldermen. That, of course, is not the proper road to peace. The first duty of the city administration was to investigate the complaints of the Council and do the proper thing in removing their causes wherever necessary. Instead, the administration is protecting the culprits and avoiding the main issue by threats of retaliation. If there is anything irregular or dishonest in the Council, the public should be informed about it as quickly as possible, but the existence of such irregularities is no justification for the administration's actions. In this struggle between Mayor Thompson and the Municipal Council, a large majority of the public favors the cause of the aldermen because it recognizes the fact that the steps they have taken are <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>necessary if the wilful and overbearing actions of some of the city officials are to be stopped. The principal issue in connection with this City Hall war is that it endangers the interests of the public. Many, and important improvements are to be made in the city, but nothing of any consequence can be attempted while the fight between the administrative and legislative branches of our city government goes on. The council would meet the Mayor's and his henchmen's opposition in anything it might decide to undertake. Such conditions are unique in the history of Chicago's City Hall. Ex-Mayor Harrison suggested the other day that Mayor Thompson's remedy in liquidating the streetcar strike should be used in solving the City Hall problem. The Mayor and some of his officials should be locked up together and kept on bread and water until they agree to make peace. The Council is not in need of such treatment. It is up to the Mayor and his henchmen to make a change in their attitude, and peace will soon be restored in the City Hall.</p>
