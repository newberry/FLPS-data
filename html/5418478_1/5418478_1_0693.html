   <p>Alderman Anton F. Zeman, of the 29th ward, announced that he will not seek reelection. The low payment received by our poor alderman, for which they serve the city day after day, is given as the reason for this decision. No one, however, will weep over the fading political star of Mr. Anton Zemak.</p>
   <p>Those great achievements in behalf of his countrymen who helped him to his position with their votes are very few - in fact none, for they cannot be found. The single act by which he was glorified, and which surely lost for him the vote of all conscientious Bohemians, was when he voted with the crack-brained prohibitionists in the City Council against the rights of saloon-keepers. In this way he showed himself to be an enemy toward those countrymen in his word who worked for his election and who through the high taxes they pay as saloon-keepers, helped pay his salary. The renumeration for the work done by Alderman Zeman in the City Council was almost too great and was not the reason for his not wanting to seek reelection. But he knows that none of his countrymen in the Town of Lake will vote for him and without them he cannot be elected. The statement of Alderman Zeman referring <span class="page-break">\2</span>to insufficient pay is only a subterfuge to cover the real reason for his not seeking reelection. The public does not want him and his political career is ended.</p>
