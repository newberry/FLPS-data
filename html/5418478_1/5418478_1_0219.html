   <p>The spacious hall in the Harrison High School was filled with an appreciative audience last night. There were highly artistic numbers on the program for Czech Day, as arranged by the Harrison Beseda (Harrison Circle). The Circle has a group of singers, the Glee Club, which sang Czech songs that literally electrified the audience. The group is directed by Miss Helen Frish.</p>
   <p>Mrs. C. M. Klaus delivered a short address, which was followed by several numbers for the violin played by Mr. George Hrusa, and piano accompaniment rendered by Miss Hattie Kovarik.</p>
   <p>The Czech national dance, "Beseda," was presented by girl students and was enjoyed immensely by every spectator. It made such a hit that they decided to give this dance before the assembled students of the school.</p>
   <p>Miss Milada Krametbauer demonstrated her art in several classic dances, and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Miss Florence Polak sang songs by A. Dvorak and also the "Marseillaise". Miss Libuse Parizek followed with some pieces for piano, and the pleasant evening came to a close with the singing of the "Star-Spangled Banner". All the visitors expressed the wish to see the evenings of the Circle perpetuated.</p>
