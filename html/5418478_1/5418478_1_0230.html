   <p>By sending their children to Czech classes, parents will help the youngsters as well as fulfill a patriotic duty.</p>
   <p>Carter Harrison High School, Marshall Boulevard and 24th Street, announced that classes in the Czech language will be opened at the beginning of the new school year. Students will receive credit for this modern language on the same basis as other subjects. The Czech classes are open to students enrolled in the general course. A new textbook has been published for beginners. The course in the Czech language takes two years and may be followed up by a course in Czech history; this latter is a six months' course.</p>
