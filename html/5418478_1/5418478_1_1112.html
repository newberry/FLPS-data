   <p>Attention is called to the strike of the garment workers in the English Woolen Mills in Milwaukee. The workers are fighting for a just cause--the eight-hour day and higher wages. The Czech garment workers of Chicago ought to support their fellow-workers in Milwaukee. In the event that they should learn that some of the work being done in Chicago is intended for the English Woolen Mills, they are requested to inform immediately the Czech Garment Workers' Union No. 253, 3335 W. 26th Street, Chicago.</p>
