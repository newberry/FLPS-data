   <p>The nations in Europe are fighting for both their national and personal liberty, while we here in America seem to permit the latter to be taken away from us by various and sundry "improvers," "correctors," and "reformers" without too much objection on our part. These men would like to tell us what we should eat and drink, when we should go to bed, when we should get up, etc. In brief, they, in the manner of some national quacks, would like to force a certain diet upon us which we are to follow, regardless of whether or not it is good for us. Their ideas of liberty are based on some antiquated notions of autocratic governments, which considered their authority supreme, and their subjects mere animate objects upon which to exercise their superiority. That, of course, is all wrong. The individual was not created for [the benefit of] the government; government was created for [the benefit of] the individual, whose individuality has always been distinguished here in America by the attribute of personal liberty. By using his personal liberty, he has created a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>government which will protect this personal liberty, and let us hope this will continue to be true in the future. The only liberty in which the Americans believe is the personal kind, the personal liberty of the individual. This liberty they have always considered their most precious possession, and have always known how to protect, even with their lives. There certainly is no reason why they should fail to find a way to protect it from some nondescript "national quacks".</p>
