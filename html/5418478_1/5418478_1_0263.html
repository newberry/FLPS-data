   <p>By now it is generally known that the Česko-Americká Národní Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) has succeeded in having the Chicago Board of Education introduce the Bohemian language as one of the regular subjects into Chicago high schools, and by that fact put our language on the same level with German and French. Now it is up to our parents and their children to see that Bohemian is really taught, because it will be introduced only into those high schools where a sufficient number of students enroll in the Bohemian classes.</p>
   <p>It should be unnecessary to appeal to our countrymen's patriotism in these days, and we are sure that each and every one of them will do his duty. But we want to show that the knowledge of the Bohemian language now has a practical value. High school students are required to study at least one foreign language. To take up French and German is often wasted effort, because it is practically impossible to learn a language in the short school terms. The little that the students are able to learn is soon forgotten. But a Bohemian student lives among people who talk that language at home; he hears it spoken constantly; he uses it from time to time himself; and thus everything he learns at school becomes of permanent value. And what a value it has! Our physicians, businessmen, lawyers, and artist agree on the great value of the Bohemian language because it opens new fields of activity, new spheres of marketing, not only among the Bohemians, but also among the Slovaks, Poles, and other Slavic people who can understand our language. A knowledge of Bohemian is a key to a number of other tongues and a door to a number of other nations.</p>
   <p>However, let us not forget the cultural value which the knowledge of Bohemian has for our youth. It is our aim and desire to introduce into the rapidly developing American nation the very best elements of our race, and thus gain true merit for future America. This, however, cannot be achieved if our youth is ignorant of the best that is in our character and in our history. We want to merge with America, rather than get lost without a trace.</p>
   
   <p>Therefore, let there be no Bohemian high school boy or girl who would neglect his or her own interest and not enroll in Bohemian classes.</p>
