   <p>A resolution was passed in a meeting of the Czech Democrats of Cook County, in the Briggs House last night, in which the candidacy of Carter H. Harrison for mayor, in the primary election, is heartily endorsed. The candidate is pointed out as representing true Democracy and guarding its sacred tenets under any circumstances also, "His record during his eight years' administration proves this through his many decisions in favor of the people and the taxpayers in particular." Good service rendered the immigrant population is especially set forth, as well as his independent attitude toward trusts, the street car company, the gas company, and other big capitalistic enterprises. The Czech, Slovak, and other Slavonic voters are called on to fall in line for the man "who will be a mayor for the people, and not a mayor for the gas company."</p>
