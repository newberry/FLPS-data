   <p>It is well known that the New England States in American life have always demanded preference. Whatever issue may be before the public, one always has to heed what the "Original States" have to say. However, when real sacrifices are needed they responded differently.</p>
   <p>For instance, in the first days after the declaration of War, the number of volunteers from our neighboring town, Gary, Indiana, was larger than that of Maryland, Vermont, and Delaware taken together. This proves conclusively that whenever anything is to be gained the New England States are in the front. When anything is to be parted with, there they modestly retire.</p>
