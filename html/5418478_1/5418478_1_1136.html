   <p>It is sincerely to be regretted that the decision of the Federal arbitrating commission, which had the task of arbitrating the differences between the ninety-eight railroads whose tracks run west from Chicago, and their engineers and stokers has turned out to be so unfavorable to the employees. It is to be regretted for two principal reasons; first, because the work of the railway engineers and stokers is very dangerous and full of responsibility, and is entitled, therefore, to high wages and good working conditions; second, because the decision will strengthen the bias of the American workingmen against the arbitration method of adjusting differences between employers and employees. Thus, for instance, we read in one of the radical papers the following sentence: "It was a good warning to all workingmen who are in favor of arbitration commissions." Of course, the decision in question does not prove that the principle of the arbitration of employer-employee disputes is wrong, especially when a man like Charles Nagel, who is <span class="page-break">2</span>known in St. Louis as an enemy of workers' unions, as a reactionary, and as a man who serves the interests of big capitalists, was made the "impartial" arbitrator of the commission.</p>
   <p>President Wilson was right in telling the leaders of the railroad Brotherhoods who asked him to remove Nagel, that they were too late in making their protest, that they should have made it immediately, when Nagel was nominated for that commission. The whole affair should be an example to labor. Anyone whom they appoint to membership on an arbitration commission as their representative, should be known as an energetic, able, and trusted fighter for the interests of labor, and the "impartial" member should be one whose past life, public and private activities, family life, give the assurance that he will use his vote only in support of justice and right. If our labor organizations keep the case of the engineers and stokers in mind, the idea of arbitration will be furthered. However, nobody can deny the fact that there is the danger of a strike when the agreement expires in a year, and the engineers and stokers will not agree to a new arbitration, in the event that their demands are not granted.</p>

   <p>There is no telling what would be the results of a strike involving 65,000 engineers and stokers who run all the railway engines on lines going west from Chicago. It may be safely said, however, that it would be the biggest and toughest fight between capital and organized labor that this country has ever seen.</p>
