   <p>Rumor has it that the State's attorney, together with the sheriff and the county board, intends to extend the enforcement of the Sunday closing law over the entire area of Cook County. Communities such as Cicero, Lyons, and Stickney will certainly not be elated over this prospect; their local governments are, we are glad to state, by far too liberal4minded to lend themselves to the prosecution of violators. The season for picnics is only half over. Many clubs and societies, depending on profits made at their picnics, would consider it a heavy blow to their main source of income if the blue law were forced upon them.</p>
