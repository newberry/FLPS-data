   <p>An indignation meeting will take place today in the Pilsen Park pavilion. A large number of our Czechoslovak citizens are protesting against curtailments of personal liberty and are preparing to voice their indignation in this meeting which promises to be well attended. As a special attraction, the program will include a debate between Alderman Anton J. Cermak who will speak for the preservation of personal liberties, and Alderman Lyle who will defend prohibition. Other matters such as high taxes, will also be discussed in this meeting. Czechoslovak taxpayers and citizens are urged to come in great numbers.</p>
