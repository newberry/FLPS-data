   <p>There are two names that will forever remain entered in bloody letters in the history of ship catastrophes of the year of 1915, this year full of horror, sorrow, and misery: "Lusitania" and "Eastland". The first denotes the utmost in barbarous warfare; the other, the utmost in barbarous greediness of capitalism. Both these catastrophes have profoundly shaken human souls all over the world, in spite of the fact that people's feelings are deadened by the news of the terrible events taking place day by day, hour by hour, on the bloody battlefields of Europe. In both of these catastrophes hundreds of innocent, helpless human beings were sacrificed to the insatiable, bloodthirsty god Moloch, but the "Eastland" catastrophe is much more tragic and shows our civilization in a much more repulsive light than the "Lusitania" disaster.</p>
   
   <p>When the "Lusitania" was leaving New York harbor last May, it carried, in addition to some fifteen hundred or more passengers, among whom were about two hundred Americans, a big load of ammunition in its cargo. She belonged to a nation which is at war with Germany, whose submarines have been waging a destructive campaign against the shipping of all Germany's foes. At first, the submarines governed themselves according to the rule which required the giving of a warning to the people on board. But when the British Admiralty--interested much less in the saving of human lives than in the cargo aboard the ships--offered prizes to vessels for the sinking of submarines, the submarines changed their tactics. They started sinking enemy vessels without warning. All this was well known to the American passengers, most of whom were going to England to negotiate new contracts for delivery of ammunition against Germany. Not only was all this well known to them, but they had also been warned that the "Lusitania" would be sunk. Now, we do not wish to discuss the question whether Germany had the right to sink the "Lusitania" or not. All we wish to do is point to the fact that there were about one hundred American citizens who were on their way to England on a mission inimical to Germany in its nature, even though, formally, strictly neutral. Furthermore, they were in a position to avoid the threatening danger.</p>
   <p>But just the same, the sinking of the "Lusitania" created a situation that threatens to put us into a terrible war with Germany. The United States Government maintains--with full right--that the lives of American citizens must be safe on the seas, that is, insofar as their safety depends on human actions. Germany must not be tacitly conceded the right to change at will the international laws, to violate the rights of neutral states with the excuse of the exigencies of war. But if we are to protect and defend the safety of our citizens aboard ships against a foreign nation so emphatically that we are almost ready to wage war because of the loss of lives of some hundreds of American contractors, then it would seem infinitely more logical to protect the lives of our citizens against pirates who ply their trade right in our midst, to protect their lives against criminals, as the owners of the "Eastland" have proved to be.</p>
   <p>The thousands of men, women, and children going out for recreation, presumably in absolute security, had not been warned that the ship might be attacked by some uncanny, eerie horror; the "Eastland" was not sailing into enemy waters; did not carry any war contraband in her cargo. The simple, harmless excursionists had no greedy aims on their minds when they were boarding the ship that was to become their grave. But, nevertheless, their doom was more certain than that of the passengers of the "Lusitania".</p>
   <p>Fifteen years ago, in Bar Harbor, the "Eastland" had had the same misfortune that cost some fifteen hundred lives last Saturday. The mere accumulation of passengers on one side of the vessel was enough to cause it to keel over. Anybody who knows anything about ships and sailing will tell you that such an accident is caused by faulty construction of the ship, and this was the case in this instance. According to the law, the center of gravity of a fully loaded ship must be seventeen inches below the water level. But in the case of the "Eastland", the center of gravity was only two inches below the water level. It is easy, therefore, to understand why the ship keeled over so readily, particularly since the Government inspectors, now accused of accepting bribes from the owners of the "Eastland", had issued a license for the steamer permitting it to raise the safe number of passengers more than two hundred. This same vessel, in Cleveland, prior to its arrival in Chicago two years ago, was forbidden to carry passengers at all; such was the opinion of authorities concerning it in a city which is not so completely dominated by money interests as Chicago.</p>
   <p>All that, of course, was very well known to the owners of the "Eastland," who collected dividends from this deathtrap, and who alone are responsible for the terrible disaster that has brought sorrow and distress into hundreds of Chicago homes. Their responsibility is clear but here in America, alas, that does not necessarily mean that they will suffer the punishment demanded by the outraged public opinion. Of course, there will be strict and severe investigations, hearings, adoption of resolutions, proposals, suggested laws; but there is little hope that the real culprits, the owners of the vessel, and the company sponsoring the excursion which forced its employees, on pain of discharge, to participate in the excursion, will ever be punished.</p>
   <p>In fact, already, while many, many of the victims are still buried in the dismal hull of the ship, attempts are being made to whitewash the real perpetrators of this crime. State's Attorney Hoyne has tried to secure the documents necessary for the investigation. But, to the great astonishment and surprise of the authorities and the public, it has become known that the Chief of Police had passed on these documents to District Attorney Clyne, that is, to a Federal official. It is quite evident that this is an attempt to protect the Federal inspectors responsible for the condition of the "Eastland".</p>
   <p>Many other nasty things are coming out into the daylight. For instance, the son-in-law of the chief inspector of ships in Chicago, Erickson, was appointed chief engineer on the "Eastland" immediately after the company owning the ship had been given permission to take on board several hundred passengers more than safety would permit. This is a clear case of criminal graft accepted in spite of the risk of hundreds of lives which, as it happened, now really have been lost.</p>
   <p>Everybody will understand the reasons why we call those who attacked and sunk the "Lusitania", barbarians. But before we cry out demanding their punishment, let us get rid of worse vermin right here at home. The war will end one day, and there will be no sinkings of "Lusitanias" in peace, but catastrophes such as that of the "Eastland" will recur with the same dreadful regularity as peace-time catastrophes in mines, on railroads, in factories, if we do not put a stop to the savage greediness of big business that values dividends above everything else, and hundreds of human lives not at all.</p>
