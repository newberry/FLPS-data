   <p>P.1--The behavior of the pocket-picking, riffraff which traverses our Pilsen district on street-cars is growing more daring and more shameless by leaps and bounds. The day before yesterday our countryman Bedrich Holy, 172 Thirteenth Street was riding on the platform of a car. Suddenly a few boys, strangers, set upon him, beating him and going through his pockets, After they had got his small change, which luckily was not much, they threw him from the car.</p>
   <p>Mr. Holy will carry the memento of this adventure for a long time. It seems strange that the employees of the street-car company did not try to protect the victim.</p>
