   <p>The most important thing for us Czechs in tomorrow's election is to see that Hugo Pam, who is a candidate on the Republican ticket, be elected as a Judge of the Superior Court. He is to us the best known of all the candidates. His father was a Czech, and came from Pilsen [Bohemia]. Here he settled among Czechs.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hugo Pam has many personal friends among our countrymen who heartily recommend his election. If Mr. Pam is elected, we will have in the Superior Court a distinguished friend who will be of much benefit to us there.</p>
