   <p>It is no sheer accident that in the American press some papers are in open sympathy with Germany; they are those who are the most clamorous in their demands for armament of the Army and Navy, and for compulsory military service. We have two examples of this kind right here in Chicago: The Chicago Daily Tribune, and the Hearst papers. They know that with the fall of Germany, the movement for "Preparedness" must become meaningless; the scarecrow of German aggressiveness is the main trump in their game. Besides this, they are openly proclaiming their admiration for the German system in which the people are wheedled into giving up their personal liberty, and sacrificing public welfare for the interest of the state. This is an ideal system indeed in the eyes of the ruling classes, and the political czars, but the liberty-loving man will oppose with all his strength the dictates of such regimentation. In this adoration of the German system, the Czech Socialists stand right behind the Tribune.</p>
   <p>The Socialists, of course, reject with indignation any insinuation linking them with the Kaiser, but their actions do not correspond with their words. In a meeting of last Monday, the speaker proclaimed in the main address: "In vain did the Socialists urge America to starve out the belligerents by prohibiting the export of foodstuffs." Well, they asked for nothing else but what the agents of the Kaiser sought to bring about, and what Carranza proposed to do in his country after having reached an understanding with the Kaiser. It is obvious that the object of the action was not the starving out of the belligerents, but of the Allies, who alone could be hit by the embargo. The latter has become a law, but the situation has not changed; it only developed into a general disorder in transportation and the clogging up of railroads and seaports on account of the U-boats danger. The Socialists have asked for all of this for the purpose of "starving out the belligerents," never minding the Allies, upon whose victory hinges the freedom of our people. We cannot conceive of a more brutal admission of anti-popular sentiment.</p>
   <p>Still another gem occurs in the speech: "America sympathizes with the Allies because it does business with them." Well, according to this, the monster gathering of the Czechs which burst into a storm of ire against the Austro-Hungarian monarchy when the declaration of war against Servia was mentioned, did so "because the Czechs did business with the Servians." What nonsense! The sympathies of the American people for the cause of the Allies are based upon standards of morality, and not upon matters of commerce. In fact, America fears today the competition of the Allies, especially England, more than a commercial race with Germany. The firm Hatfield and Schwab, blast furnaces, serve as an example.</p>
   <p>The speaker continued in his muddled address: "We stand united behind our people, and this was openly proclaimed by comrades, F. V. Krejci, Nemec, and Smeral." One feels like spitting out at the mention of such words, for everybody knows that the three prominent comrades are nothing but paid police detectives today. Everyone must have asked himself a thousand times: how the Pravo Lidu (People's Rights), published in Prague, Bohemia, manages to appear regularly without being molested by the censor, while the editors of other papers in the old country are being railroaded to prisons and sentenced to death. The Pravo Lidu is the only paper spared from persecution, its staff enjoying liberty, and even exemption from military service. People ask themselves these questions and supply the proper answers at the same time. Only the Czech Socialists of America do not seem to see the light, on the contrary, they repeat in open, meeting the words of three "comrades" who are traitors to their nation.</p>
   <p>Everybody is free to form his own opinion about this critical time, but it is incomprehensible to us how the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Czech National Association) can receive in their midst people of the caliber just mentioned, people who make no secret of their status as employees of foreigners, of our enemies. There is only one city in the United States where the Socialists still play first fiddle, and that city, Cleveland, is a slacker in our national movement. Collections there lag behind those of other cities, and whenever patriotic men start action, the "comrades" invariably impede it. The Prodana Nevesta (Bartered Bride) was given for the C. N. S. (Czech National Association), and Czech business men contributed $400 in commercially ineffective ads in the program, just to do their bit. What happened? The Socialist printing concern grabbed $200 of the amount, comrade Cimler, director of the printing concern, and at the same time, the secretary of the Czech National Association, Cleveland branch, took $100 in commissions for the soliciting of the ads, so that a bare $100 was left for the patriotic purpose.</p>
   <p>No wonder then that Cleveland appears in the light of a straggler. Whatever so-called patriotic enterprise is initiated in Cleveland, there lurks monetary profit in the background. Similar experiments have been tried in Chicago also. The Socialist party is a leprous sore upon the body of our people. This will become a glaring fact in the light of history. It is imperative to show the door to this handful of traitors, and drive them out of our national life.</p>
