   <p>P.4 - This year, as in other years, our patriotic youth took it upon themselves to decorate their breasts with green ribbons, shamrocks, and other symbols of the Irish people on the occasion of St.Patrick's Day. Although in most cases it was done in a jocular manner, nevertheless it was a sad manifestation. None of us should make sport of the struggle of the Irish, of the patriotic feelings of the Irish, or their love for their mother-country, but we should take them as an example for ourselves. But to decorate ourself with Irish emblems, to make it appear that one comes from the Emerald Isle is foolishness and nonsense. Our Bohemian nation with its culture, its maturity and history surpasses by far the Irish nation; and our children, American born perhaps, have no reason to be ashamed of their Bohemian origin and to try to pass themselves off as Irish.</p>
