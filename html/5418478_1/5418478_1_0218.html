   <p>Bohemian Made Easy, formerly used as textbook, is sold out, and Morffil's Mluvnice Jazyka Ceskeho (Grammar of the Czech Language) is more suitable for the needs of a philologist than for the average student with everyday requirements. Mluvnice Ceska, by Dr. Jan Gebauer, recognized as the best Czech grammar, is the foundation of Professor Nigrin's textbook.</p>
   <p>The manual begins with instruction on the phonetics of the Czech language, a highly important item which hitherto has not received due consideration. The second part of the book is devoted to composition. Though this chapter lacks completeness, it offers valuable hints and suggestions. A preface by A. R. Nykl, captioned "Slav Nations and Their Tongues," will surely be of interest to serious students.</p>
   <p>The book will find an appreciative welcome wherever time is available on the students' programs. It may be bought at the office of the Czech Literary Society, which deserves unstinted praise for its efforts.</p>
