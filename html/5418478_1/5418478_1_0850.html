   <p>Yesterday afternoon at three o'clock, at the behest of the Česko-Americká Narodní Rada (Bohemian-American National Council), and of its untiring chairman and founder, the well-known traveler, writer, and national workov, Mr. E. St. Vráz, a protest meeting was called at the pavilion of the Pilsen Brewing Company at which the Slavs, and first of all the Bohemians, were to voice a protest against Professor Rosse's assertions regarding the Bohemians.</p>
   <p>Professor Rosse, who heads the United States National Sociological Association, just lately has written a number of articles appearing in the Century Magazine which are, in the true sense of the word, an insult to all immigrant members of Slavonic races.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>It was up to the Bohemians to protest against his assertions, and they did so in so dignified a manner as to surpass the expectations of Mr. E. St. Vráz, who had issued the call for this meeting.</p>
   <p>By three o'clock the attendance was so large that there was not an empty seat in the huge auditorium, and many of those who came were obliged to return.</p>
   <p>They have something to regret, for they missed witnessing the spontaneous demonstration of enthusiasm we are capable of developing whenever we halfway make up our mind to do so.</p>
   <p>This we showed yesterday. We should be glad to see such a display more frequently, especially on occasions of such importance as was yesterday's event. We showed our strength, self-confidence, and keen interest when it came to the point of combating statements and assaults aimed against all immigrants.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>We were especially gratified to see that yesterday's protest meeting was attended by members of all classes of our countrymen, no matter of what political or religious conviction they may be.</p>
   <p>Of all Slavonic nations, however, only Bohemians took part in the meeting. This they did because they are aware of the injustice and wrong they suffered at the hands of an individual who, as a professor of the University of Wisconsin, is presumed to be a representative of American science.</p>
   <p>In addition to the Bohemians, only Americans were present; men who, because of their long contact with Bohemians, their experiences and special studies, appreciate us as people devoted to duty and working not only for economic, but also spiritual progress.</p>
   <p>There were there to show their interest and prove that they will always stand <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>behind such a people as the Bohemians are.</p>
   <p>Such men are in principle opposed to any laws against immigration and to the tendency to calumniate nations which form the bulk of immigration.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order shortly after three o'clock by the chairman of the Narodni Rada, Mr. E. St. Vráz, who said that the reason for calling the meeting is too well known to make its restatement necessary. Since it is the custom among the Slavic people to honor the out-side visitors by giving them preference, he introduced as first speaker Miss Grace Abbott, the chairman of the Immigrants' Protective League and a well-known Hull House worker.</p>
   <p>Miss Abbott began by saying that she was glad when she received the invitation to this meeting, because it gave her an opportunity not only to attend, but to declare openly her opinion about immigrants, especially the Slavs, of whom the Bohemians are the best known to her, because of her experiences and contacts <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>with them.</p>
   <p>In the statements of Professor Rosse about the Slavs she sees only prejudice against the immigrants, a prejudice which, although not justified, is rather common among Americans.</p>
   <p>This prejudice is that much more to be condemned, because it is being used as a means of propaganda in a book for which its author claims consideration as a scientific work.</p>
   <p>The Professor states in his work that the Slavs are unclean, filthy, disorderly, and have many other untoward qualities. Such qualities are, however, not typical of Slavs, for we find them among individuals of all nations; not even the Americans can be excluded from this accusation.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>A nation should never be judged by a few individuals. But if it is, such individuals must not be held responsible for something that is due purely to conditions and circumstances brought about in this particular case by America itself, where the minimum wage has a good deal to do with the problem which Professor Rosse attempts to solve.</p>
   <p>Professor Rosse has judged the immigrants very unjustly and today even the Americans are ashamed of his assertions. Faults and weaknesses can be found in every nation, but those faults are not a sign of weakness in the whole nation.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian nation has brought to America many good and beautiful qualities of which it should not rid itself during the process of assimilation to American conditions, because these qualities are beneficial also to America.</p>
   <p>The speaker sees in America a great future for any nation which can preserve <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>its national and racial individuality. And one of the nations best able to do this in America is the Bohemian, to which Miss Abbott herself pays her respects.</p>
   <p>Her simple and sincere address was often interrupted by applause which, at the close of her address, burst into a real storm of enthusiasm, clearly showing the deep gratefulness of the Bohemian people to a non-Bohemian for whom prejudice is not sufficient grounds for berating a nationality.</p>
   <p>Here Mr. E. St. Vráz thanked Miss Abbott in the name of all those present, and introduced the next speaker, a well-known friend of the Bohemian people, Professor Miller, who is active at the Olivet College.</p>
   <p>The speaker pointed out first of all that Professor Rosse violated the principal rule which every sociologist must follow; he should not have criticized from the standpoint of outward appearance, and especially in the case of foreigners; <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>and he did not touch upon the inner person, upon the spirit of the criticized people. A true and serious sociologist does not work in that way, especially when he himself is publicizing his work as scientific and authoritative.</p>
   <p>Professor Miller states that he is glad he was able to be present at this meeting, because he knows foreigners, and especially the Bohemians, through frequent personal contacts; that he gladly journeyed to Chicago, and immediately looked up Professor Thomas, who is active at the University of Chicago, and asked him for his opinion about Professor Rosse's work.</p>
   <p>Professor Thomas said that the work is not a scientific one, because it is not founded on truth, and that he will soon publish a work in answer to Professor Rosse's statements. The speaker expects to do likewise.</p>
   <p>These works will be the answers to the erroneous assertions of Professor <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>Rosse.</p>
   <p>Professor Miller added that the Bohemians are winning recognition in the field of arts and sciences in America. The Slavs, and particularily the Bohemians, cannot therefore be considered here as an undesirable element.</p>
   <p>He ended his speech which was filled with friendly references to our nation and expressed a truly sympathetic feeling for us, with the Sokol salute, Na Zdar! (To Success!).</p>
   <p>His brilliant address was rewarded by a storm of applause. Mr. E. St. Vráz thanked him and then urged the audience to seek for an expression of feelings about the wrong and insult we as Slavs have suffered. We must be heard particularly in this instance, because this insult was noticed even by the Americans.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>It must not be said that this mass meeting was called without justification, that nothing really happened to the Bohemians to complain about. The speaker goes on to say that Professor Rosse, in a letter to the Narodni Rada, states that Bohemians have no right to complain, because he places them on the same plane with the Germans; that he admits their primacy among all Slav nations, a statement which he claims will appear in the August number of the Century magazine. He further writes that he cannot help it that the publishers printed the last four chapters first.</p>
   <p>Mr. E. St. Vraz, the chairman, remarked that even if Professor Rosse should now write a favorable article, he always would be against him.</p>
   <p>The next speaker was Dr. Rudiš-Jičinský, who picked the Professor to pieces with his satiric remarks. He said that the Professor himself is a foreigner; that he threw all the Slavs into one basket, and now is surprised that we are knocking one another on the head. And why should we not, when we Bohemians know how to <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>do that capitally among ourselves? And we might have fared better, perhaps, with the protest meeting if we had waited until the learned Professor publishes his next articles, so that he could be cleaned up all at once.</p>
   <p>After that Dr. Rudis-Jicinsky spoke of the work done in America by immigrants to whom America is indebted for all that she is today.</p>
   <p>Mr. John A. Červenka spoke next, saying that the insulting article written by Professor Rosse put him in such a state of mind that he was hardly able to read. He became nervous reading one insult after another heaped upon us; and protest we certainly should when we think of our mothers and wives. Mr. Cervenka considers the letter sent by Professor Rosse a capitulation.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Červenka had finished speaking, Professor J. Zmrhal said that the meeting was a test of the temper of the people, and that the success of the gathering is a testimony to the maturity and self-assurance of our people, <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>who will not stand for being belittled and insulted even by a learned professor.</p>
   <p>If the Professor sees faults in our immigrants, the nation is not at fault. The responsibility lies in the deficiencies and faults of our social order.</p>
   <p>Mrs. L. Veselský was the next speaker. She represented the Bohemian-American women, and very pointedly spoke of their skill in culinary and household arts. In their homes Professor Rosse surely would not find the filth he wrote about; and if he were to sit at a well-laden table of a hospitable Bohemian family, and eat the food, he would change his views about the Bohemians' cleanliness.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Veselský also mentioned the educational and humanitarian work performed by Bohemian-American women; their toil for all America and its future development.</p>
   <p>After a short pause in the program, Professor Miller and Miss Abbott left the <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>auditorium, and the audience paid their respects to them by rising.</p>
   <p>Then Dr. Jaroslav E. Salaba Vojan pitied Professor Rosse, as the author of the published articles, and as a teacher in a university of a State which was built with the help of Bohemians. Mr. Karel Jonas, onetime vice-governor, lives in Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>Representing the Česko-Americká Tisková Kancelář, (Bohemian-American Press Bureau), Mr. James F. Stepina followed in the line of the previous speakers and blamed the Century Magazine, a monthly which is read by the so-called American aristocracy, who like to boast of their ancestors as far back as three or four hundred years.</p>
   <p>If we were to investigate their family tree, said the speaker, we would find there many names of men with criminal records, men who were forced to flee from Europe to save their lives. These are the men who organized colonies in America.</p>
   <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>
   <p>The speaker went on to say that the Slav nations, and the Bohemians in particular, show very little of the criminal in them; he was certain that the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada took upon itself the responsibility of informing the American public about the facts in this serious matter.</p>
   <p>Judge Joseph Z. Uhlir then spoke in English. He criticized Professor Rosse severely, and asserted that a professor of such an outstanding university should not be tolerated as a teacher. He urged all those present to join the very worthy body of Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada.</p>
   <p>With a few well-chosen words Mr. E. St. Vraz then closed this most remarkable mass meeting.</p>
   <p>A resolution was presented just before the close of the meeting expressing sharp criticism of Professor Rosse's articles, and informing him of the trend <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>of this most austere gathering. The resolution urged the Česko-Americká Narodní Rada to secure capable men, who, with the aid of publications, would inform the American public about the Slavs in general, and make it better acquainted with the Bohemians in particular.</p>
