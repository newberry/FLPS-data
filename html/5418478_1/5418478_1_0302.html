   <p>The Crawford District Bohemian Settlers Educational Society, which was organized last year in March and endeavors in every way possible to promote the growth of that quarter, at its last meeting decided upon the praiseworthy step of founding a Saturday and Sunday school and for that purpose has joined the Association of Bohemian Liberal (Free Thought) Schools. Quarters for the school already have been found and registration of pupils will be held in the society's hall at 2702 So. 43rd Avenue, next Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock.</p>
   <p>Parents who want their children to master their mother-tongue in speech and writing, will welcome the new school with pleasure and will appear in large numbers with their children for registration.</p>
