   <p>The Chicago Association of Law and Order is preparing a petition asking Congress to pass a law which will make Chicago police enforce the prohibition laws. The Association charges that whisky is being sold publicly in all Chicago saloons, and that our police are aware of that fact. The laws which the Association is desirous of having enacted would make prohibition agents of all Chicago policemen and thus save our Republic from the danger of excessive wetness. Also a special Congressional committee is being planned which would investigate Chicago enforcement conditions. The proposal to send such a commission to Chicago is particularly inviting. The Congressmen would thus learn where they can get something more substantial than "one half of one per cent" in case it should become necessary to leave Washington for that particular purpose. Also Chicago policemen would welcome their change of status to that of prohibition agents. They would be busy sampling liquor, an occupation of many advantages over that of catching thieves and robbers. So, all in all, our policemen and our criminals should be looking forward to the future with agreeable expectations.</p>
