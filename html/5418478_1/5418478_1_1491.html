   <p>Further on officials of West and North Townships. J. Soukup- soundly defeated by the Bohemian vote. A. B. Chladek elected. The city Council elected is composed of 3 Socialists, 7 Republicans, 6 Democrats and 2 Independents. The Bohemians of the 6th Ward performed their duty. The Socialists cast more than 12,000 votes.</p>
   <p>The battle is over, we and many others shout today and now again we may be more at ease. Yesterday, a decisive battle was fought and with the partial results thus far apparent we can be satisfied. The participation of the voters this year was considerably greater than last year and the election as a whole had more life in it. In the whole there were more than 60,000 ballots cast.</p>
   <p>Workingmen of all nationalities, but especially Bohemians, made of yesterday a holiday and worked in all ways possible for our just cause.</p>

   <p>The chief struggle was for the various City Offices and was decided in favor of the Democrats, who succeeded in electing the Mayor, the Treasurer, the City Attorney and the City Clerk with a considerable majority of votes. The remaining Democrats, with the exception of the North-town, will be victorious. In the West town the election ticket of one Soukup was defeated, also working against him were all the Bohemians. Mr. Adolph Chladek is again elected to the office which he previously held.</p>
   <p>The election judges in several wards permitted disorders and in the 7th ward the Irish riff-raff endeavored to prevent the voting of working men. It is unnecessary to add that Bohemians were unusually active this year: Many Bohemians worked with great diligence from morn till night passing out specimen ballots of the workingmen's party.</p>
   <p>The South-town results were as follows, for Assessor--Drake, Rep; for Collector--Reese, Rep; for Supervisor--Page, Rep; for Clerk--Schorek, Rep.</p>

   <p>The West Town results were as follows:- for Assessor--Amick, Rep; for Collector--Dumphy, Dem; for Supervisor--Ward, Dem; for Clerk--Chladek, Dem; The North Town results were: for Assessor-- Chase, Dem; for Collector-- Niesen, Dem; Supervisor--Loftus, Dem; Clerk--Noyes, Dem.</p>
   <p>During yesterday's election, not all Bohemians worked with us. Some of them worked for the election of either Republicans or Democrats not through honest choice but because they were well paid. So far as we know a certain "Koukal" from 18th Street vote for the Republican Party after he received $1.00. A certain Vaclav Vtak or Hoffman, Fr. Hezonck, J. Roth and others in the 6th Ward worked against the election of the workingmen's candidates. Tomorrow or the next day we shall publish the names of all those who worked for our side and the names of all who were against us. Any one having reports of this nature should not forget to send them in to us.</p>
