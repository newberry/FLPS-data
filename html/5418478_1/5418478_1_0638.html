   <p>Well, the first dry Sunday is over. All saloonkeepers obeyed Mayor Thompson's decree and kept their places closed so the Mayor will have no opportunity to take away licenses, as he no doubt had hoped to do. Saturday before his departure he advised the Chief of Police that he did not wish to have the transgressors arrested, but wanted to have a list of those who disobeyed his ordinance. In case of arrest the offenders would have to be arraigned in court and, in accordance with the law, the first offence would result in a $200 fine, and the second in the loss of the license. But Mayor Thompson would not give the saloon men an opportunity to seek justice in a court of law because he knows that no jury in Chicago would find them guilty. For that reason he is prepared to use his right to decide about the licensing of saloons, and revoke the license of saloonkeepers who are guilty of disobeying his ordinance. And he would do this the very first Sunday the ordinance was in force.</p>
   <p>The liberal-minded people of Chicago are at a loss to imagine just what it was <span class="page-break">\2</span>that made Mayor Thompson proceed in such an inconsiderate way against the saloons. His statement that he did not know until now that the law concerning the closing of saloons on Sundays was in force and that now, having learned about it, he proposes to enforce it in Chicago, is ridiculous. Every Chicago boy knew about that law, and it is impossible that a man running for mayor of Chicago, and elected to the office of mayor, would not know anything about that law and would have to be told about it several months after his election.</p>
   <p>The only way to explain Mayor Thompson's act is to assume that he had some special political aims for the achievement of which he needs the support of the prohibitionist and blue-Sunday population of rural Illinois more than that of the liberal-minded people of Chicago. Some believe that he aspires to the membership of the National Republican Committee for the State of Illinois; others go so far as to claim that he wants the Republican nomination for president. We shall soon learn more about it, and about whatever success he may have achieved in it.</p>
   <p>What we are interested in right now are the consequences, financial and economic, <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the enforcement of the law until the time when it can be repealed by the State legislature. The law was passed seventy years ago but was never enforced in Chicago. But a repeal can be voted only by the legislature which will meet after the 1916 elections, and which will not start functioning until after the beginning of 1917. That is a long time during which the dry Sunday will cause a great deal of damage which will be difficult to repair.</p>
   <p>It is remarkable that Thompson was considered a liberal-minded man among the liberty-loving people of Chicago. How he could have gotten that reputation is one of the mysteries surrounding his person, character, and future plans. No doubt he had very clever campaign managers who succeeded in describing him to liberal-minded citizens as a liberal, and at the same time, to prohibition fanatics and blue-Sunday mongers as their own man, all, body and soul. There is one thing quite certain. While the United Civic Societies have not been backing him any more than Robert Sweitzer [German], Chicago saloon men were working for him to the last man, and greeted his election with much jubilation.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>This is true not only of our Bohemian saloon men but also of the Germans whose countryman, Sweitzer, ran against Thompson.</p>
   <p>An old saloonkeeper, alderman and German, Haderlein, had this much to say about it: "The North Side Saloonkeepers' Association, composed almost exclusively of Germans, holds its monthly meetings in the Turner Hall on Paulina Street and Belmont Avenue. Its April meeting fell on the day after the spring election in which Thompson came in with a majority of 150,000 votes. There was great elation about it in the meeting, but I warned my colleagues even at that time against praising the day before sundown. This was because I had been following 'Big Bill's' campaign most carefully and found that he had preached prohibition and blue Sunday most ardently in Lake View, Hyde Park, and Austin, while promising liberal administration in the Stockyards district and when talking to Negroes on the South Side. He went so far as to arouse their hopes that they would be able to shake dice and shoot craps without being disturbed. I talked about this with saloonkeepers, my old colleagues in business, and they laughed at me on the side, and were telling each other <span class="page-break">\5</span>that there must be something wrong in my Bavarian noodle. They were convinced that Thompson is an enthusiastic sportsman, endowed with a capital thirst, and that there is no reason for them to be afraid of such a man. But I kept on insisting that saloons will be closed in six months, and now you see my fears were justified."</p>
   <p>In order that the blow which the Mayor has given to saloons may be lessened, it will be necessary for the Municipal Council to take immediate steps. The license fee will have to be correspondingly lowered, at least down to $750 a year, and the Mayor must be legally deprived of the right to revoke saloonkeepers' licenses at his own discretion. Chicago is the only city in Illinois whose mayor issues and revokes saloon men's licenses without consulting his aldermen. The Council must rescind the right it has given the mayor; to that end no new ordinance will be necessary. It cannot be expected that the Mayor will try to switch now. The wets have "his number," and he cannot expect any support from them whatever. Therefore he will have to stick to the drys and blue-law mongers, to all the hypocritical fanatics to whose influence he has <span class="page-break">\6</span>yielded. These will do all they can to make all Chicago dry by next spring, and if they should not succeed in this, at least to give Thompson a substantial majority in the City Hall. The liberal element can, of course, shatter these plans easily enough, as long as it keeps united and stays on the job.</p>
   <p>The dry-Sunday law will materially damage about eighty-five per cent of the saloons. The remaining fifteen per cent will hardly be affected. These are located mostly in the Loop and near large factories. The other saloons had, on the average, twice as much business on Sundays as on weekdays. It was Sunday that kept many of them out of the red. With the Sunday business gone, many of them will have to close up. The effect may not be so noticeable at the next term, November 1, because the saloonkeepers will still be hoping that some way may be found to bring about the reopening of business on Sundays. Should this hope prove idle, the decrease in the number of licenses may go into the hundreds, and, perhaps, thousands. The city will lose many thousands of dollars of income. Then Chicago will feel the "blessing" of blue laws and their enforcer, "Big Bill" Thompson.</p>
