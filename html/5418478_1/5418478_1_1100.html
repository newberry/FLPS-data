   <p>Organized labor, which has come to the realization that the only protection workers have from exploitation by the capitalists is co-operation, united action, common demands, and unity in the conduct of the bitter struggle has a new enemy in the so-called Taylor System which is being generally introduced now in large industrial establishments. The principle on which the system is based is one which, if adopted, threatens to do away with all the advantages organized labor has so far succeeded in obtaining.</p>
   <p>in order that the system may be successful it is necessary for the employer to deal with individual workingmen, and not with their organization. Taylor himself admits that labor organizations are the worst enemies of his system, and that their opposition must be overcome before the System can become fully effective. Therefore, in running a factory by his system, the first objective is to destroy the solidarity of the workingmen. Individual workers who do an especially large amount of work receive an extra reward, while those who do not show the inclination to deliver all that is in them are simply discharged. Thus, one worker is made to compete with and become the foe of another, and the conviction that all of them have the same interest is to be disposed of; one man is to be played against the other and all are put in a race against the weaker ones. Then the unorganized, upset, confused workers become an easy prey of capital.</p>
   <p>It is easy to understand that trained men, skilled artisans, are in a better position to protect themselves than common laborers. In the first place, skilled men have the best organizations, while common laborers are either unorganized or their organizations are weak. The principal aim of the Taylor System is, therefore, to make skilled workers unnecessary and thus destroy their organizations. Modern manufacturing methods do not require as highly skilled workers as were needed in former times, but even now a worker must have a certain amount of training to do his work satisfactorily. The experience and knowledge accumulated by such training and the years of doing his work give a workingman a certain amount of independence, which protects him against undue requirements and unfair treatment on the part of the employer. It is therefore the purpose of the Taylor System to replace these independent workingmen who are able to defend themselves, and all experienced artisans, by common laborers, by men entirely dependent upon the employer's good will and who, therefore, will be willing to do whatever they are told.</p>
   <p>In order to achieve this purpose, Taylor has divided the whole manufacturing process into so many single and simple operations that the employment of trained men will be unnecessary, or, at any rate, not so essential, and, in a short time, a common laborer will be able to do the work that a trained man used to do formerly. This change, or adjustment, requires a large amount of equipment, various adaptations, and reorganization, all of which again cannot be done in a short time. And that is the reason why the Taylor System has not yet shown a wider distribution, a more decided success. Taylor is replacing trained workingmen by experts who, so to speak, become the brains of the factory, while the workingmen are mere tools and have to do just exactly what they are told to do, and how to do it. Men who aspire to decent wages are gradually replaced by cheap, common labor, thus making the employer's profit greater because his expenses are smaller. When a trained man loses a job in his own field, he must start looking for new employment under exactly the same conditions as an untrained man, and, likely as not, he will be doing the same work he was doing before, but for less pay.</p>
   <p>The detrimental effects of the Taylor System will not be fully apparent until it is in quite general use. As it is now, a discharged trained man has still a possibility of finding work in another factory, though it may not always be easy to find or obtain. Since, however, industry is being steadily concentrated into a smaller number of very large factories, units, the ground for an efficient, all-round introduction of the Taylor System is being prepared. Hence it is up to workingmen to get prepared also.</p>
   <p>An excellent illustration of the way in which the Taylor System works is in Henry Ford's great automobile manufacturing plant in Detroit. When Ford, some two years ago, loudly proclaimed to the whole world that every employee in his plants will be getting at least five dollars a day, he made nothing else but a veiled announcement that he had introduced, to some extent, the Taylor System. It is well known that Ford does not recognize any unions in his shops. In Ford's factories, the employees are divided into classes, exactly in accordance with their productive capacity, and paid accordingly. Every worker is an object of careful attention on the part of his foreman, who makes a record on separate slips of the amount of work done by each man. When he sees that a man's productivity is growing, the man is advanced into the next higher class. Since there is a piecework system in all Ford's shops, a man's productivity is reflected exactly in his pay. In a higher class, a worker gets a better price for any certain piece of work, and it is only natural that every one of them is trying to do as much work as possible, in order to be advanced into a higher class and get better pay for whatever he does. A man who is not able to earn five dollars a day is simply discharged. Therefore, all men who stay in Ford's employ are, without exception, first-class workmen.</p>
   <p>Taylor has said that his system can be successful only where there is a great deal of labor available, and Henry Ford has made sure that this condition shall prevail in his plant. His announcement that every worker would get at least five dollars a day attracted to his factories multitudes of men, from whom he has been able to select the most able, most fit ones. When the truth about the five dollars a day was revealed, the number of applicants probably diminished, because, more recently, Ford announced that he would employ all prisoners released from the Michigan state penitentiary. By this, he again tried to secure the halo of a philanthropist, cleverly keeping quiet the fact that he expects to increase his profits by that move.</p>
   <p>That the application of the Taylor system in Ford's plants has been most profitable is proved by the fact that during the first year his output increased with the same number of men employed. Ford, of course, will never admit that he had introduced exploitation of his employees according to the Taylor System, and will always maintain that he is a benefactor of his workers with whom he shares his profits. Even the workers do not seem to notice that they are working under the Taylor System. And when other manufacturers follow Ford's example, he will have the advantage of being able to get rid of all artisans, trained men he had been employing, and replace them with unskilled labor. He will be able to start a still more efficient exploitation of the human material, because the Taylor System opens an unlimited field in this respect. It is up to the workers to recognize the danger inherent in the Taylor System and organize an energetic opposition to its adoption by industry.</p>
