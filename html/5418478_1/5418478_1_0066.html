   <p>An excited crowd, consisting mainly of Czech fathers and mothers, protested against the dismissal of one of the teachers in the General Custer School, 14th Street and Oak Park Avenue, Berwyn, Ill. The teacher in question is Miss Meisner, who is of Czech descent. She has served in the Custer School for over eight years, and is well liked in the community. She has not been reappointed for next year; to date the school board has not advanced a single valid reason for her dismissal. The meeting resolved to do everything possible to secure the reappointment of Miss Meisner.</p>
