   <p>The City Council in its meeting last night voted 44 to 22 to accept the majority report of the committee on elections, and Felix B. Janovsky thereby became alderman of the Twenty-ninth Ward. Thus, was decided the contest of former alderman Matthias Mueller against Mr. Janovsky. Mr. Mueller is a Republican, Mr. Janovsky, a Democrat. After a recount of votes, it was found that Mr. Mueller had twenty votes more than his Democratic opponent, who after the first count, had a majority of ten votes. The contest was taken before the committee on elections and referred to a sub-committee, composed of Aldermen Anton J. Cermak and Bauler, Democrats, and Alderman Snow, Republican. Alderman Snow disagreed with the findings of the sub-committee, which found that Mr. Janovsky had a majority of twenty votes after several ballots were thrown out.</p>

   <p>The committee on elections, as a whole, accepted both the majority and minority reports of the sub-committee. During the voting, no little surprise was created when during the roll call four Republicans voted with the Democrats for Janovsky.</p>
