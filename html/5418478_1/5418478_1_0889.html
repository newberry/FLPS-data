   <p>P.1--A moment has arrived, when all the Slavonic nationalities in the United States have to join in a firm protest, rise in unity and without delay, in order to thwart the plan of the U. S. Census Bureau which aims in obliterating their names from the list of acknowledged nations, and in subordinating them to the countries of their respective emigration. The census which is to be taken in April this year is not to recognize any Bohemians, Poles, Slovenians, Slovaks or Croatians but to recognize only Austrians, Germans, Hungarians etc. These plans were not revealed until Saturday night, during a discussion by Mr. Hotchkins, director of the first census--district of the State of Illinois, and which have been approved by the congress. Strange to say, nobody has called our attention to this fact as yet. We hope, however, there is sufficient time left to effectuate a change. It is not known upon whose suggestion congress acted when it decided not to include above names into census as has been done on former occasions. It appears that influence has been exerted by diplomatic circles of Germany and Austria-Hungary, and possibly also by the Jews, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>who do not want to see their Mosaic religion identified with nationality, desiring to be recorded as belonging to the country from which they came. But it was easy to comply with the wishes of the jews, without at the same time touching on the sensibilities of the other nationalities.</p>
   <p>It is to be noted that the Irish shall be carried in the census as an independent nation although they do not use their own language, but the language of the English. The Bohemians lost their independence much later than the Irish. They had been promised the crowning of the emperor of Austria as Bohemian king, though their hopes have so far not materialized. The Poles have decided already to file a vigorous protest for their protection through the Polish National Alliance, and the Bohemians shall certainly not stand back. Congressman Sabath will have ample opportunity to inform congress of the struggle the Bohemians lead for the existence of their nation, the perpetuation of their glorious history, and of the pronounced repulsion they sense against being called Austrians. The differentiation as approved by Congress for the census has no political meaning and no scientific significance either.</p>
