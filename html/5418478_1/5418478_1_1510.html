   <p>At a joint meeting held by the three Bohemian Taxpayers' Associations in the Berwyn Sokol Hall [Berwyn, Illinois] last Saturday night, the long-desired unification of the three Bohemian taxpaying bodies became a reality. The new organization thus formed is called the Berwyn Improvement Association. [Translator's note: See also a previous article in the Denni Hlasatel, August 12, 1922.]</p>
   <p>This meeting was especially well attended, and there were a few invited guests among whom were Mr. Frank J. Petru, president of the Cicero School Board; Mr. Krcek, president of the Taxpayers' Association [of Cicero]; and the state corporation counsel, Mr. Reeve....Their brief talks were to the point, and were listened to attentively. The introduction of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>aged and white-haired Mr. Svoboda, who more than a quarter of a century ago worked in the Bohemian Improvement associations of Chicago, and his sincere utterances, made a deep impression upon all those present.</p>
   <p>If doubts existed about the feasibility of merging the three taxpayers' bodies into one, they were quickly removed by the simple but heartfelt remarks made by these men. When the time arrived to vote for the proposition, all the members of the three organizations voted for it....The officers of the newly formed organization are the following: Mr. Vaclav Feres, president; Mr. J. F. Vojacek, vice-president; Mr. Karel Larsicek, secretary; Mr. V. Hemer, financial secretary; Mr. J. Horejs, treasurer. The appointment of committees and the discussion of current business were deferred until the next meeting of the Association which will be held next Thursday in the Sokol hall. Twenty new members made application to be admitted into the Association, and will be inducted to-morrow. All our countrymen in this vicinity are cordially invited to attend tomorrow's meeting.</p>
