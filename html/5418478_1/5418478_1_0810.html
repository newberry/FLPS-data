   <p>The motorious Staats-Zeitung used to spit fire against anyone who would have called the conduct of Germany by its right name, especially the conduct of Germany toward the United States. That paper has always considered the interests of Germany in preference to those of the United States.</p>
   <p>The Staats-Zeitung has calmed itself to a certain extent, and bridled its frenzied outbursts of sentiment since the disruption of diplomatic relations between Germany and the United States. Since the declaration of war on Germany, the paper has changed its attitude. It now prints editorials in the English language, and in them "begs" for justice before the eyes of the public. This is to prove that German obstinacy and defiance cannot reach up to the welkin.</p>
