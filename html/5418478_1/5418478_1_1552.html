   <p>The Czech-American citizens will soon have an opportunity to vote for a number of good Czech candidates for city and county offices. They should not miss the opportunity Tuesday next. It is probably not necessary in some of the Wards to urge those citizens to vote, who regard election day as of not more importance than any other. The Czech vote of the whole city, however, is of the greatest importance as there will be a representative of our race on the ticket for one of the highest offices. Mr. Josef Siman is a candidate for the office of city clerk. He should receive the vote of every Czech, regardless of party affiliation. The agenda of the office are independent of pronounced political sentiment, and so the Republicans, Democrats, or Independents, among the Czechs, should unite their forces for Mr. Siman. None of our voters should take the attitude that his vote can be neglected when there is the opportunity for one of our people to represent us in a high office.</p>
   
   <p>Strict attention should also be paid to the election in the diverse Wards, settled by our people. The Tenth Ward is one of them. It is known as the birthplace of the Czech Democratic party branch and can boast of an efficient and honest candidate for the office of alderman, Mr. Frank Klaus. He has held the seat for the last three consecutive terms. His faithful service has gained for him not only the esteem of Czech voters but of those of other descent also. He has even won the support of organizations that formerly opposed him.</p>
   <p>No one doubts the success that will come next Tuesday to Alderman Otto Kerner of the Twelfth Ward, the day should bring a brilliant victory, if the voters will show their appreciation of the services rendered during many years of activity as one of the foremost members of the city council. Though in the prime of life Mr. Kerner has accumulated broad experience in public life, especially as assistant commissioner of Public Works. This fact should prove highly beneficial to the Twenty-fourth Ward voters.</p>
   
   <p>Felix B. Janovsky is candidate for alderman in the Twenty-ninth Ward, our Town of Lake; the hard fight expected to take place there ought to end with his victory. Mr. Janovsky is of Czech extraction, and has an excellent record as a result of his activity as an alderman. The voters of the Eleventh Ward, according to all indications will elect Edward F. Cullerton. He has no opponent, and if he had, his popularity would win victory for him.</p>
   <p>The United Societies are distributing a list of preferred candidates (given in this issue). These are sure to stand up for personal liberty and deserve the confidence of our liberal voters.</p>
   <p>There will be a mass-meeting held in behalf of Alderman Kerner, in Rohe Hall, California and Ogden Avenues, in which County Judge Scully, A. Cermak, bailiff of the municipal court, Miss Margaret Haley, John Fitzpatrick, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor, Michal Zimmer, and others will speak.</p>
   <p>The last meeting of this campaign will take place in Pilsen park, 26th Street and Albany Avenue. The meeting will be held in behalf of the re-election of Alderman Kerner. - Roger C. Sullivan, State's Attorney Hoyne, Sheriff Traeger, John A. Cervenka, Anton Cermak, Mr. Dibelka and others are to speak.</p>
