   <p>The revolution in our public life caused by the War, compels us to count with every single unit of our resources and to use the opportunities offering themselves for the perpetuation of our national life in America.</p>
   <p>One of the most important components of our strength is the education we are giving to our future generation. We point with particular pride to our Czech classes in Harrison High School, - and today in Morton Park also, - which are maintained by the city, and in which the students of the Czech language receive full credit for it just as for any other tongue. The language of Komensky and Palacky has been placed on par with French German, and Spanish, This makes us rejoice, but we have, alas, not learned to appreciate this achievement. It shall be the duty of all of our papers to call the attention of the public to the great opportunity offered for students of Czech descent to learn the language of their fathers. We can do a bit for our nation by helping the number of students to double.</p>
