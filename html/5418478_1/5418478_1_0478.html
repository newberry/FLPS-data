   <p>As our readers know, a determined fight is being waged by our Berwyn countrymen against the fanatics of prohibition. The Fourth and Fifth Wards are overwhelmingly Bohemian, and there are many Bohemians in the other three wards. It is, therefore, not surprising that the end of the "blue law" regime is in sight.....</p>
   <p>We regret, however, that among us there are men who are trying to persuade their neighbors to abandon this important work and to support with their votes the temperance rulers of our town. There are not many of them; in fact, there are only a very, very few, but even these few prove that not all of us know enough about our own interests.....</p>
   <p>Let us all unite behind this movement to liberate Berwyn from its "sabbatical" (sic) rulers by next spring, when important elections will be held.....</p>
