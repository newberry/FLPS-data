   <p>Every Bohemian voter, man or woman, should attend the polls tomorrow and vote for worthy candidates. Especially does it apply to the Twelfth and Thirty-fourth Wards, where they should vote for the candidates of the Democratic party, countrymen Novak and John Toman, with whose election both of these wards will secure good representation.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen in Cicero should be mindful of the fact that they have the opportunity to elect their countrymen to the most important town offices. If they win this election they will have good positions secured to them for some time, but if they do not take advantage of this opportunity they will show that politically they still are weak, and that they do not know how to work in harmony, and the future political conflicts to obtain equitable representation will be much more difficult to win.</p>
