   <p>Three occurences have roused as never before the entire Czech population of Chicago. They were the failures of the Tuma bank, the Dubio bank, and the house of Pitte. The total of the money involved amounts to one million dollars, representing the hard earnings of our less prosperous fellow-countrymen. The chances of a restitution are slim indeed, only a small percentage of the amount, if any at all, is expected to be rescued. In every case, the cause of the break down must be assigned to unsavory practices, perilously close to plain stealth, and not to a typical catastrophe as a result of any general financial crisis; even a well conducted concern may become a victim of the latter.</p>

   <p>The tragedy in these three cases is the distrust which they create in the mind of the public, thus damaging the good name of the honest institutions. The latter are the sufferers although it is utterly unreasonable thus to draw conclusions which cast doubt on honest business.</p>
   <p>To date, honesty has been a privilege and the rule in the transactions of our people. Shady manipulations are exceptions. This fact ought to serve as a guide in the business of the Czech community.</p>
