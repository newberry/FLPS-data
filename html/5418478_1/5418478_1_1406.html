   <p>Tonight two important meetings will be held in the Twelfth Ward in behalf of the two Bohemian candidates for the office of alderman. Both should be well attended by the Bohemian public which undoubtedly is keenly interested in having the Ward represented by Bohemian aldermen. One of the meetings will be held at the well-known hall of Mr. Certzinger at 27th and Troy Streets....and both will be attended by our new Senator J. Hamilton Lewis.... The second meeting will be held in the Douglas Park Auditorium at Kedzie and Ogden Avenues.....</p>
   <p>It is the duty of all our countrymen of the Tenth Ward to participate in the coming election next Tuesday. It would be all wrong to say that Mr. Frank Klaus cannot be defeated, that it is impossible that this Ward would elect a Republican. Such an attitude is just what the Republicans base their hopes on. Mr. Klaus will again address his constituents tonight at 8 P. M. at the Bohemian-American Hall on 18th Street and Center Avenue.....</p>
