   <p>Czech classes in Chicago high schools have always been considered achievements of great value, but that does not mean that we know how to appreciate them.</p>
   <p>Only recently we received a letter from one of our readers calling our attention to the comparatively small number of students from Cicero and Berwyn enrolled in the Czech class at the J. Sterling High School. Shortly thereafter, the Czech public was informed that the Czech class at Harrison High School had to close because of insufficient attendance.</p>
   <p>It seems that we often fight for recognition or an opportunity only to prove later that we did not deserve it.</p>
