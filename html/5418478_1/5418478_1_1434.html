   <p>P.1--A multitude of old and tried Republicans have declared themselves decidedly for Judge Edward F. Dunne in the present campaign and are working energetically for the election of this man as mayor of Chicago. No one, not even the most fanatical Republican, dares to criticize, censure, or abuse them for it. Every one feels, be he Democrat or Republican, that Dunne is in every respect a more desirable candidate than his Republican opponent, and that by his election the interests of the city will be much better served.</p>
   <p>As a judge Dunne gained a fine name for himself. He was always on the side of right and justice, always defending the weak and oppressed against the powerful privileged class. He never became the instrument of big capital against the working-man; he never issued an injunction against striking workers. His hands are clean in every respect. The interests of the people have always been above his own.</p>
   <p>Such a man is well fitted to be at the head of a ticket backed by a real Democratic platform of which Chicago Democrats may be proud. The majority <span class="page-break">2</span>of Bohemian-Americans have always been Democrats, though we have often had cause for grumbling and disatisfaction. This year, however, we can be satisfied with the Democratic party. Its platform expresses principles that even the most radical Democrat must agree with, and the candidate for mayor is a capable, tried man, so sincere and with so clean a record that we should seek in vain for a better.</p>
   <p>Among us Bohemians Judge Dunne has his most enthusiastic friends, who admire him regardless of party affiliation. The principle of public ownership, the benefits of which, for our city, we all recognize, will be efficiently put into practice if Dunne is elected mayor.</p>
   <p>Our compatriots in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth wards will have the opportunity to welcome Judge Dunne among them to indicate their sympathy and also to listen to his convincing words.</p>
   <p>A big Democratic meeting will be held in Thalia Hall, at Eighteenth and Allport Streets. In addition to Judge Dunne, the following persons will speak: Clarence S. Darrow, George P. Foster, Fred W. Blocki, candidate for city <span class="page-break">3</span>treasurer, and William B. Moak, candidate for city attorney. The Bohemian speakers will be Messrs. Joseph Kostner and Stanislavhalik.</p>
   <p>In the eleventh ward the Democrats will gather in a big meeting in Pulaski Hall, 800 Ashland Avenue, where in addition to Judge Dunne the following will speak: Samuel Alschuler, Joseph Medill Patterson, Lawrence <span class="gap">[gap]</span> McGann, Capt. A. C. Anson, candidate for city clerk, and Edward F. Cullerton, candidate for alderman from the eleventh ward.</p>
   <p>In the twelfth a big Democratic meeting is to be held in Novy's hall at Twenty-second and Troy Streets. Judge Dunne will also appear there to explain his viewpoint. The best of the above-named speakers will be there, and Messrs. John Straka, Adolf J. Schinagl, and Anton J. Cermak will speak for the Bohemians. All meetings are scheduled to begin at 8 p.m.</p>
