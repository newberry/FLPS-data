   <p>It would be most desirable to learn the truth about the income of the "greatest modern evangelist," Billy Sunday. He will not think of revealing it; there is the income tax, you know. But it would be of even greater interest to speculate as to what makes for the size of his income. This would no doubt lead to the conclusion that it is partly the stupidity of the people he befuddles and partly from people who pay him for the befuddling of others. Such Billy Sunday-treated human material is bound to be a real boon to the eyes of big capital.</p>
