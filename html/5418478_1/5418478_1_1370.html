   <p>The voters of the Twelfth Ward, the largest Czech ward in Chicago, do not doubt, true enough, that the coming election will send Joseph I. Novák to the City Council again; but to insure this, all Czech voters should concentrate on that goal. The Twelfth Ward is decidedly Democratic and overwhelmingly populated by Czechs, so that we should be able to send one of our countrymen to represent us. There is a danger of split votes, for three candidates are in the field for the office.</p>
   <p>Alderman Novák has been representing us up to the present time. He has proved himself a man of experience and efficiency. Our men and women should take this into consideration when they go to polls.</p>
