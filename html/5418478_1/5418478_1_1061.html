   <p>All Bohemian bricklayers are to report at the Bricklayers' Hall at Peoria and Monroe Streets today, November 9. Take along your wage book and your union card, and be sure to vote the Reform Ticket. If we win, we shall get a Bohemian business agent. Do you remember the way a non-Bohemian agent dealt with you when you applied for your union card?</p>
   <p>We shall also try to take away the automobile from our president. Only its repairs cost us thousands of dollars (sic) a year, and with present public transportation facilities, an automobile appears to be quite superfluous. You will receive your ballots in the Hall. The balloting will take place from 9 A. M. to 5 P. M.</p>
   <p>Vote the following ticket: The names of eight candidates follow:</p>
   <p>(Signed) The Committee.</p>
