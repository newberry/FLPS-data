   <p>The Bohemian Republican Club, "Lincoln", held a meeting yesterday in the "Ces. Ang. Svob Skola" (Bohemian-English Liberal School) which was well attended. The subsidiary committee reported that it was making every effort to have the various Bohemian Clubs support the nomination of a Bohemian as a candidate on the township ticket. The committee was directed to make every effort to conclude a meeting with the committees of various Bohemian Clubs, so that there might be some definite candidate placed before the membership at the next meeting. This club does not intend to make any recommendation by itself, as the membership feel that it will be much better if the delegates of all the clubs work together in the selection of a candidate.</p>
   <p>There was selected three members as delegates to the convention of Republican Clubs at Springfield. About ten new members were accepted and many countrymen presented themselves for the purpose of obtaining Citizenship Papers. After some further debate the meeting ended. The next meeting is to be held March 9th.</p>
