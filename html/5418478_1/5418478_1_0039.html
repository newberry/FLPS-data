   <p>In view of the fact that the proposed plan for the erection of four supplementary high schools for Cicero, Illinois and vicinity was defeated at the polls on February 4 by an overwhelming majority of votes, and further, because we realize that the present J. Sterling Morton High School located on Austin Boulevard needs an annex, we issue this call to all the voters of school district number 201, which includes the communities of Cicero, Berwyn, Stickney, and Lyons, to come to the polls on March 4 to cast their ballots for the proposition that a bond issue of $25,000 be permitted for the erection of the necessary buildings which are to become an annex of the present J. Sterling Morton High School.</p>
