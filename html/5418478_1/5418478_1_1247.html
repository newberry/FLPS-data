   <p>Rarely has the interest of citizens been so aroused as it is now by the election which is to be held next Tuesday, and which will decide whether or not the proposed new constitution of the state shall be approved. If ratification depended on the vote of the citizens of Chicago and Cook County alone, there would not be the slightest doubt about the outcome of this election, and the proposed new measures would be defeated by an overwhelming majority..... Other counties also show great dislike for these measures, but it is not certain whether their opposition will be strong enough to defeat the proposition. It devolves therefore upon our Czechoslovak voters to do their duty by coming to the polls without fail and voting "No" in the interest of all citizens.....</p>
   <p>The Ceskoslovenska Demokraticka Liga Okresu Cook (Czechoslovak Democratic League of Cook County) also warns its members to vote against the proposed new constitution, and gives reasons for its opposition to it as follows:</p>
   <p>If you wish to maintain equality between yourselves and the citizens living outside of Chicago and Cook County; if you wish to have just representation in legislative and other governing bodies; if you do not wish to put Chicago and Cook County at the mercy of a pack of crooked politicians from the downstate counties; if you desire to pay just taxes and no more--if these are your desires, then vote against the proposed new constitution which will be presented to you and recommended by the downstate politicians and representatives of large corporations.</p>
   <p>Resolution of the Chicagsky Distriktni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku</p>
   <p>After due consideration of all matters pertaining to the issue....the executive committee of the Chicagsky Distriktni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (Chicago District of the Bohemian Catholic Alliance) arrived at the conclusion that the unfavorable features of the new constitution far outweigh the favorable ones; that is, any good which might possibly accrue by adopting the measure would be negligible; therefore, if it is not permissible to vote on the measures separately, and the document is to be accepted or rejected as a whole, it must be rejected at the special election to be held on December 12, 1922.</p>
   <p>The resolution made by the Chicago District Alliance.....bearing upon the proposed new constitution is literally as follows:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, the proposed constitution of the State of Illinois does not contain the previously adopted proposition concerning the rights of initiative and referendum which the delegates to the constitutional convention should have considered and embodied in the new constitution; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, the County of Cook is limited to one third of its representation in the state senate without regard to the number of inhabitants of that County; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, the reading of sections of any kind of bible in public schools and without any explanations, as permitted by the new constitution, would surely lead to religious quarrels and disputes which would especially endanger the peace and the quiet of the citizens; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Cook County would be limited to only two members of the judiciary of the Supreme Court of the State of Illinois without regard to the number of inhabitants of the said County; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, the tax provisions in the new constitution are unjust to a great majority of the people of the state; be it therefore</p>
   <p>Resolved, That all voters of this state of Illinois, by their votes on December 12, 1922, fully reject the new constitution.</p>
   <p>"For the Chicagsky Distriktni Svaz and the resolutions committee:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Karel Radous, chairman;</p>
   <p>"Mr. Vaclav Jedlicka, secretary."</p>
   
   <p>The Last Appeal of the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers</p>
   <p>On December 12, 1922 the voters will decide their own fate and the fate of their future generations. On that day they will measure their strength with the strength of all the reactionary elements; it will be a contest between the progressive citizens of the state and the reactionary ones. The newly proposed constitution of the state of Illinois is at the root of this struggle. It contains and hides within itself a curtailment of all those liberties still enjoyed by humanity. Instead of recommending the improvement of the constitution, a thing so badly needed at this time, the voters have been presented with something worse; that is, a proposition which, if accepted, would make it possible for a few favored individuals to rule over the destinies of a great mass of people, thus virtually bringing these masses back to the Middle Ages, to the age of the czars. One of the most reactionary of the reactionary provisions made in the proposed new constitution is the introduction of the reading of the Bible in the public schools. The reactionary elements in their arrogance and [boldness] do not pay any attention to the Constitution of the United States, which, at the time of the first session of the congress of the United States on March 4, 1789, said in article I [of the Bill of Rights]:</p>
   <p>"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...." Of course the reactionaries abuse certain of their privileges by imposing a duty upon us by means of the state constitution and by the legalization of a certain kind of religion. The progressive public must not permit this to happen, just as we would not wish to suggest to them or to deny them the exercise of their religious convictions. Let this exercise, however, take place in their own privately endowed institutions. Let us, the freethinking people, equally tenacious, defend our own freedom of conscience against those who would dare to tamper with it. We know from experience and from our own Czech history what it would mean if we adopted this new constitution; we know how demoralized our children would become. Let us stand firmly as a solid group against all sectarianism, error, and falsehood. By your vote you will say on December 12: "No, we do not desire your yoke, no matter how pretty it may look."</p>
   
   <p>The State Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers did all that was in its power to call the attention of our people to this evil; it was the Federation that did so in time. It stood and always will stand as a sentinel, guarding the rights of man and in this it asks all of you who are freethinking people to aid us in defeating this measure. Our last call to you today is: Let us not be conquered!</p>
   <p>For the Statni Svaz Svobodomyslnych v Illinois, (State Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers of Illinois)</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Musil, president;</p>
   <p>Frantisek Strunc, secretary.</p>
