   <p>The Mayor announced at the Council Meeting yesterday, the appointment of the new members of the School Board as follows: Thomas Brennan and John McLaren are reappointed; Miss Mary E. Burt, to replace Kozminski; Donald Morrill and D.R. Chmeron named in place of Beal and Forche; Dr. F. J.  Jirka, named in place of Frank Wenter, resigned; Dr. Jirka, is a countryman of ours, quite well-known because of the large practice he has among us.</p>
   <p>Dr Jirka is offered the opportunity to gain the grateful recognition not only of his own countrymen, but of all others who are against the teaching of German in our Public Schools.</p>
   <p>The Board--at least so it seems to us,--will now be more American than German and as soon as the German Language comes up for discussion, we believe that Dr. Jirka will interpret the wishes of the majority of Bohemians.</p>
