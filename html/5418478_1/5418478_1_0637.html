   <p>Many people say: "Why get so excited about the closing of saloons [on Sundays?] It is not a question of life and death for our city and the majority of its population if a few hundred barrels of beer more or a few hundred barrels of beer less be consumed. True enough. But we declare: It is not merely a matter of closing saloons; it is not merely a matter of drinking on Sundays or going thirsty. It is the question whether or not a handful of fanatics are to rule the majority of the people, deprive it of its rights, impose on it their will, and make the majority like it when it is being called a mob of degenerates and a cancer on the body of human society. If the fanatics get their way now, soon they will be still more arrogant, still more presumptuous. It is therefore necessary that all liberal-minded citizens quickly stop our fanatics and all those who have become their tools.</p>
