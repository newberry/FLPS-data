   <p>The executive committee of the Matice Vyššího Vzdělání (Center of Higher Education) makes the following fourteenth annual report: ….The Center was able to extend loans totaling $1,900 to thirteen students. Originally $2,725 was appropriated for eighteen students. In these serious times, however, some of the young, ambitious men decided to give their services to Uncle Sam and therefore relinquished the money offered to them.</p>
   <p>The students were placed in schools in the following states: New York, 3; Nebraska, 3; Iowa, 2; Missouri, 2; Illinois, Ohio, and Texas, 1 each.</p>
   <p>The students are paying back their loans very conscientiously and are highly satisfied with the system…..</p>
