   <p>There is not the slightest doubt that the Bohemian Wards will again give a majority to the Democratic party, and its standard bearer, Carter H. Harrison. Bohemians have always been Democrats in a majority, and have always inclined in favor of Harrison. But the Democrats will not have it so easy at next Tuesday's election. Merriam is a strong candidate, one of the strongest the Republican party has been able to put up in many years. Four years ago, conditions were exceptional, and Busse secured the office in an exceptional manner, but not because of any special strength. In order that the Democrats emerge from next Tuesday's election victorious, they must use their full strength, not one adherent of their party should remain away from the polls.</p>
