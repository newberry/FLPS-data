   <p>Yesterday's Record-Herald, under the heading "Mrs. Ella Flagg Young Speaks," carries a noteworthy article for us Bohemians. From this flattering report we have selected the following:</p>
   <p>"The end of the school semester in the Howland School was celebrated in festive style by the presentation of six performances of two plays depicting scenes from the life and history of the Bohemian people. Five hundred of the sixteen hundred boys and girls attending the Howland School are of Bohemian origin. This year's June festivities at this school, which is a pioneer of work and play of this nature, are comparable to a kind of gift by the Bohemian children to their non-Bohemian fellow pupils. This gift consists of two plays based upon Bohemian ideals, embellished with dances and costumes of the old native land. Taking part in these plays were more than six hundred boys and girls. As a result of this, not all of those participating were Bohemians. Many non-Bohemian children assisted and worked hand in hand with their friends of foreign origin.</p>
   <p>"The first play, "Zlaty Pramen," (The Golden Spring) was in one act, and the story upon which it was based was translated from the Bohemian language by Tana Vojan. The principal of the school, Mrs. Amelia Dunna Hookway, dramatized the story, and in addition to the dialogue and songs, the children learned the "Beseda," a Bohemian national dance, so as to give the entire production a somewhat picturesque atmosphere.</p>
   <p>"The second play was called "Slepy Kral" (The Blind King). This play was interspersed with many songs and pompous marches, pictures, and important happenings of Bohemian history of the fourteenth century. The travels of the blind King John of Luxemburg among his subjects, Libuse's (A Bohemian Princess) great efforts for the emancipation of Bohemian womanhood, and other highly dramatic events were portrayed in settings of picturesque luxury.</p>
   <p>"Mrs. Ella Flagg Young was present at one of these performances, and at its conclusion she addressed the young actorsâ€¦.Among other things she said, "In regard to these plays and singing in connection with school work, I would say that your children will master their regular school work in half the time if school work as a whole affords them some enjoyment."</p>
