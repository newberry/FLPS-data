   <p>After a long period of inactivity, the Bohemian-Democratic Club of the Eighth Ward again held a meeting, in the Bohemian-English Liberal School Hall, under the chairmanship of Citizen,"Krize".</p>
   <p>In spite of the fact that the attendance was small, a lively debate took place, having for its subject the activities of the alderman of the mentioned Ward. Several speakers publicly denounced Alderman "Dvorak" and it was pointed out that all promises made by the Alderman before election had come to naught, and that the Bohemian voters of the Eighth Ward have benefited very little by being represented in the City Council by a Bohemian. The majority of those present did not agree with the above contention.</p>
   <p>It was announced that Alderman Dvorak intended to seek the nomination in the spring election, whether the citizens of the Eighth Ward wanted him or not, and that it is necessary to prepare now for a stiff election battle if the citizens of the Ward expect to put another candidate into the field.</p>
   <p>After a sharp debate it was resolved that the chairman appoint a committee to make all necessary arrangements for the spring elections. A committee was also appointed to call upon and remind the Secretary of the Central Democratic Committee, not to forget to pay the Judges and Clerks of the last election, most of whom have not yet been paid for their services.</p>
