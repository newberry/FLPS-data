   <p>The Honorable Adolph J. Sabath, of Chicago, today placed before the Congress a resolution in which he declared that whiskey is a very essential remedy to combat influenza, which is rapidly spreading. He proposes a ninety-day suspension of the national prohibition law, which requires a special permit and reports from pharmacists, doctors, and others with reference to its use as a medicine. The purpose of this resolution is to make it possible for anybody to get his prescription and his whiskey for medicinal purposes without any delay. An amendment to the prohibition law to permit the production and sale of beer containing not more than three per cent of alcohol and of wine with a maximum content of nine per cent of alcohol was also proposed by Congressman Sabath.</p>
