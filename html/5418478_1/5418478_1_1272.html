   <p>The Spolek Ceskych Pravniku (Bohemian Bar Society), in a resolution signed by Mr. Josef C. Pisa, president, and Mr. Frank H. Bicek, secretary, recommends to all the Czechoslovak voters in the Nineteenth Senatorial District to vote for the Czech lawyer, Mr. Albert B. Holecek, at the Tuesday election. Mr. Holecek, who is running on the Republican ticket, is a candidate for the office of state senator. The resolution mentions Mr. Holecek's unsullied character and recognizes his abilities and his professional and civic reputation.</p>
   <p>Cur Czech lawyers are convinced that both the Czechoslovak people as a group and their own profession will gain a representative in Mr. Holecek, a representative of whom they may be proud. For this reason, they recommend to all Czechs and Slovaks to place a cross in front of Mr. Albert Holecek's name next Tuesday. The name can be easily seen. It is placed <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in the first column marked "Republican," and is the tenth in a group of other candidates. By voting for Mr. Holecek the Czechs and Slovaks will prove that they are intelligent Czechoslovaks and good citizens who are interested in the welfare of the whole community. The ballot will not be spoiled by this act, but utilized for the best interests of us all.</p>
