   <p>Our fellow citizens of the Twelfth Ward have every reason to be proud of their representatives in the City Council, Alderman Otto Kerner and Joseph L. Novak. This has been pointed out repeatedly by our metropolitan press and by the Municipal Voters' League as well.....</p>
   <p>We advise our voters to refuse to sign petitions for any independent candidates.....To do otherwise would be to work against the best interests of the Twelfth Ward.</p>
