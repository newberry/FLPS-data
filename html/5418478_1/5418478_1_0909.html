   <p>P.4--In the present strike the American press has almost without exception taken an attitude favorable to the employers; it prints colored and garbled news in order to incite the public against the strikers and urges the people to deny their support. It is obviously necessary in such times as these for the laboring classes to establish an organ, printed in English, which will acquaint the public with the real state of affairs. It is clear that the union men would have to set up a vigorous agitation for this organ and become subscribers themselves. This would be the answer to the attacks, open or covert, direct or insidious, launched against labor organizations by the capitalistic press.</p>
