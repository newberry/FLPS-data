   <p>In the coming campaign in which a sheriff of Cook County will be elected, we of Czechoslovak extraction must appear to the last man and do everything in our power to elect a man of our kind, Anton J. Cermak.....We doubt that there could be one among us who would not wish our nationality to be represented by a man with so honorable a public standing as Mr. Cermak. By concentrating our voting power upon him, we shall demonstrate that we can be united in this matter, just as we are in fullest harmony in the fight for our cause. The election of Mr. Cermak would also mean a manifestation of loyalty on our part for President Wilson, the greatest protagonist of democracy in the world....Mr. Peters, the Republican candidate is of German descent....</p>
