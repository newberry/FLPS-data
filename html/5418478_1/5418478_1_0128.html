   <p>Mayor Thompson is an able man, a man of good and sane judgment, and, we hope, also a clever politician. Therefore he should think twice before disregarding Bohemian demands, whether they concern the "Kaiser" article of Mrs. Young or any other important matter. He may not always receive such large majorities as he did at the last elections in April, and it may just so happen, that it would be the Bohemian votes which would save him--if he should get them.</p>
