   <p>Under this name was completed the reorganization of the joint Committee of Sokols and Citizens working against the use of the German language in the Chicago public schools. Everyone can become a member of the Bohemian-American National Union, who is not indifferent to the efforts outlined here as well as those who are merely interested in public affairs. Yesterday's meeting was attended by several new delegates from various Bohemian societies, especially Catholics; there were turned in many signed resolutions against the continued teaching of the German language in the public schools.</p>
