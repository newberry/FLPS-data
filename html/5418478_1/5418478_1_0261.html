   <p>Mr. Frank Morse, superintendent of the Carter H. Harrison High School where the Bohemian language is being taught  in day classes, is planning to organize an advanced evening course in the Bohemian language. We hope that his experiment will be found of special interest to our public.</p>
   <p>This new course would consist of lectures in English on Bohemian history and literature, and the reading of the best Bohemian books in the original. There would also be training in writing Bohemian papers and essays. Instruction of this kind should be particularly useful to our ladies, physicians, lawyers, and students who desire to perfect themselves in the Bohemian language and learn to know the spirit and beauty of the creative literary work of our nation.</p>
   <p>Since, however, this course, so useful to so many of us and most creditable to all of us, will be organized only if there is a sufficient enrollment of students, we urge all our public to take advantage of it in large numbers and thus assure its existence. Applications will be received at the Carter H. Harrison High School, 24th Street and California Avenue, Thursday and Friday, October 1 and 2. Let's all try hard and see to it that this course becomes a reality.</p>
