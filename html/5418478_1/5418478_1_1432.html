   <p>p.2.--Our countrymen will surely remember the Benes case in which the defendant was found guilty by the jury of murder committed against his wife, and sentenced to death on the gallows. Immediately after the trial vigorous action was taken to change the sentence which would have hurt the children of the unfortunate couple and destroyed the good record of the Chicago Czechs in respect to the criminal law. That agitation met with success. Benes was granted a new trial, he pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to jail. It was due to the assistant State's Attorney John R. Newcomer's efforts that Benes was rescued from the ignominious fate upon the scaffold; he was the prosecutor in the case and it rested with him whether Benes should live or die. He himself, however, went before Judge Kersten of the circuit court, smoothing the path for a new trial, which the court granted upon his recommendation. Mr. Newcomer is now a candidate for judge of the municipal court.</p>

   <p>We have been receiving numerous communications from diverse political parties and factions announcing their intention to support Mr. Newcomer. We cannot but approve of their intention. If a man has manifested his good will toward us, why should we not reward him in the same manner? Mr. Newcomer's qualifications are generally recognized, and taking everything into consideration he is the only Republican candidate who merits our support.</p>
