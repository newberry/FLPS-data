   <p>The Ladies, who arranged the ball, as well as the public which attended it, enjoyed themselves very much.</p>
   <p>The hall, was held in Kounovsky's hall, corner 23rd street and Sawyer avenue, for the benefit of the striking coal-miners. The Committee should be fully satisfied with the results, as the net profit of the ball was quite large, amounting to $125 which was turned over to the administration of this proper place. The success of the affair is all the more gratifying because none of the so called elite Bohemian society attended and all the money was donated by the calloused hands of working people and small businessmen.</p>
