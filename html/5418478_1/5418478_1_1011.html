   <p>p.4--We have persistently been pointing to the lack of consideration of the street car company shown to the population of "Bohemian California" south of Twenty-Second street, and especially in the neighborhood of Twenty-Fifth street and Lawndale avenue.</p>
   <p>We have been expecting the people to rise in protest against the car company which is treating us in a manner it would not dare employ in other districts of the city.</p>
   <p>As no loud action has been taken we thought that the company had already made preparations for redress, and that on Lawndale avenue there are more cars in operation now than the usual two pitiful ramshackle carriages. But we have convinced ourselves that this is not the case.</p>
   
   <p>Not only has the service not improved, but things have gone from bad to worse. Formerly there were at least two cars working days and Sundays; now the company sends out two cars mornings and evenings, during the rush hours, but only one between, and one car only on Sundays.</p>
   <p>Obviously the company would like to dispense with the car-line altogether, if it were not afraid of losing the right of way. But according to all indications the company need not fear anything even in this respect. Nobody files a complaint against it even now, when the time is ripe for action, and so probably no one would complain even if no cars were being operated at all. And, may be, that would do better. The time spent on waiting could be better used for walking the short distance.</p>
