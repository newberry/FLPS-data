   <p>A movement was started some time ago for the purpose of creating an interest in the teaching of the Czech language at the J. Sterling Morton High School. The result proves that if good will and a sincere effort are shown, much may be accomplished.</p>
   <p>The school board resolved, some time ago, that the Czech language be taught in high school. That much is certain, and there need be no fear that the school board will reverse the decision to which it agreed, at the behest of the Czech citizens.</p>
   <p>With reference to this the only question to be answered was when this teaching would begin. Later, at the suggestion of the school principal, it was decided to start after the summer vacation--that is, on the first day of the September term, immediately following the Labor Day holiday.</p>
   
   <p>The principal is of the opinion that it would not be advisable to begin the instruction in the middle of the semester, because of the many arrangements which he has to make, and also because it takes time to secure a teacher.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. J. Kubec told us that a number of teachers had been recommended, and the principal will choose one in a short time, but he requires that the teacher be qualified to teach other subjects so that he can be paid a suitable salary. Without doubt a teacher with those qualifications can be secured without great effort, and if it is not possible to begin now with the teaching of the Czech language, we shall have to be satisfied that the promise will be kept, and that the Czech class will attend lectures next September.</p>
   <p>This matter of teaching the Czech language should not be forgotten; and the greatest interest should be awakened among the citizens, so that when the Czech lectures begin the attendance be commensurate with the interest displayed.</p>
   <p>That is the only way to prove that our countrymen of Cicero and Berwyn do want the Czech language taught and that there are enough students in the two communities to make the teaching of the Czech language worth while.</p>
   <p>Mr. Slapak, chairman of School District No. 99, has a plan which should create the necessary interest. He intends to arrange a lecture about the Czech nation for the benefit of the student body of the high school.</p>
   <p>This matter of a Czech lecture is being worked upon with enthusiasm, and we will soon be able to announce the date it will take place.</p>
