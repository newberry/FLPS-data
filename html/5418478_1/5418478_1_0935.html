   <p>Although it is not the real "Prussian Schulverein" which exists within Chicago, it is a variety, a society organized more than half a year ago for the purpose of having Prussian and Austrian-Germans, in Bohemia and outside of Bohemia, support both materially and morally in the Germanization of everything which is not German. It is a society of immigrant Austrians, or in other words an "Austrian Society," which really issued the proclamation for the "Germans" to quickly and plentifully collect two-dollar contributions, because in Bohemia, "oppressed" countrymen are in need of a great deal of money and a great deal of encouragement to carry on the work with which the entire "Germanic Culture" is so concerned.</p>
   <p>So that our countrymen will know from the ground up what this famous "Schulverein" really is, we say that the task of this refined society is to force themselves boldly into Bohemian cities; to denationalize Bohemian children; as for instance, turn the children away from their mother tongue; encourage in them a hatred toward it, and everything which carries the name Bohemian; to teach them to deny their native origin; to deny the language of their mother and father. In this manner the children are to be brought up <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>as traitors to their own nationality and join the ranks of the greatest enemies of the Bohemian people. The Bohemian child who enters the "German Schulverein" school will not and cannot learn. Everything is explained to him simply in the German tongue, about which the child has not the slightest idea; he doesn't understand a word and therefore cannot do well. The result of the teaching is that the child knows neither Bohemian nor German. Formerly we had no "Schulverein" and we learned German. For Bohemians to learn, for their own use and not for the convenience of the Germans, so much German as is necessary is their own affair - and let the Germans worry about again learning Bohemian. It is known that the Central Alma Mater in Bohemia and Moravia is working ardently in opposition to the "Schulverein." The influence of this genuine Bohemian patriotic society is a thorn in the eyes of the obstinate Germans and of the Bohemian traitors and renegrades. The Germans, being unable to battle effectively with the "Central Alma Mater" because of their greatly and continually dwindling means, have turned to the American "Austrians" for their financial support in the fight. As a result we have the "Austrian Society."</p>
   <p>For us American-Bohemians this fact is of great significance. Thus far we don't care about our particular national interests here in America, whereas <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the Germans in addition to supporting everything that concerns the local German element are helping to their utmost the struggle of their patriotic overseas-countrymen. Isn't this so?</p>
   <p>Under conditions such as exist among us we would not be surprised in the least if the "Austrian Society" mustered among its members several Bohemians also. The unknown attracts Bohemians, always and everywhere.</p>
