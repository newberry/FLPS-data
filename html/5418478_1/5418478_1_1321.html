   <p>.....The Czechoslovak Democratic campaign committee, which consists of a great many representatives of our local Bohemian societies, is making extensive preparations for next Sunday. On that day there will be two gigantic meetings of our Democratic voters. The meetings will be preceded by automobile parades and will, in fact, indicate the feelings of our Democratic voters. One of these meetings will be held in the great hall of the Sokol Chicago at 2:30 P. M., while another one will take place in the Sokol hall at Honore and West 48th Streets, in the heart of our Bohemian Town of Lake district. As already mentioned, great preparations have been made for both of these meetings, which at this time promise to be something magnificient. The greater part of the work for both meetings has fallen to the Lawndale Automobile Club which has undertaken the arrangements for the parades. The officials of that organization request every countryman of ours, who owns a car, to take part in the parades.....The cars should be decorated so that the parades may be as colorful as possible. The parade [to the hall of Sokol Chicago] will begin at 1 P.M. in front of the <span class="page-break">2</span>building which houses the Automobile Club and which is located at 23rd Street and Lawndale Avenue. After the parade, the cars will park in front of the Sokol Chicago on Kedzie Avenue....as regards the meetings themselves their order will be about as follows: The opening of the meeting will feature music and other entertainment; then will follow the introduction of the candidates, the speech by Mr. Anton J. Cermak, the next president [translator's note: Please note that the editor used the word "next"] of the County Board of Commissioners. The speech by Mr. Josef Mendl, the next County Commissioner, will be followed by more music, entertainment, and speeches by other candidates. We are certain that both halls will be filled to capacity by our Czechoslovak Democratic voters, both men and women, for never before have our people shown so much interest in the primaries. The primaries will take place on Tuesday April 11, 1922 and will give splendid proof of our political consciousness and development.....</p>
   <p>Meetings for Cermak and Mendl will also take place tomorrow in the 12th ward. The first one of these will be at Lawndale hall, 1912 South Trumbull Avenue; <span class="page-break">3</span>another one in the Pope public school at 19th Street and Albany Avenue. The speakers in both places will be Messrs. Adolph J. Sabath, Otto Kerner, Michael Rosenberg, and J. Cepak.</p>
   <p>There will be another meeting in the Sokol Berwyn on 27th Place in Berwyn, Illinois tonight at 7:30 P.M. This will be attended by a great many Czechoslovak Democrats and furnish proof that our Berwyn citizens do not lag behind Chicago Czechoslovak Democrats in their effort to support the candidacies of our countrymen, Messrs. Anton J. Cermak and Josef Mendl.</p>
   <p>All friends of Mr. Albert B. Holecek, who is a Republican candidate for the office of State Senator from the Nineteenth Senatorial District, were extremely pleased with the success of the meeting which was called in his behalf on Tuesday evening in the spacious hall of Mr. Kafka, 26th Street and Avers Avenue ..... The attendance was so large that a great many of our countrymen, who came late, were unable to get in. All the Republicans of the thirty-fourth ward are determined to go to the polls on Tuesday in order to place a cross in front of the name of Mr. Holecek.....</p>
