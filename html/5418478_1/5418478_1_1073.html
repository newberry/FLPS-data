   <p>All of us have repeatedly had occasion to observe the malicious actions of those obnoxious spirits that are wont to attack the Denni Hlasatel and the organization whose members it employs. Now the Ceska Ustredni Unie Tiskarskych Remesel (Czech Central Union of the Printing Trades), rises in protest to defend itself and its employers. Circulars, in which the attitude of the organization shall be duly explained, will be sent to all Czech associations, trade unions, etc. This will help to stop the abusive and malevolent eruptions of those evil-minded elements who try to enhance their interest by inciting unrest among our workers, by subversive methods, and prevarications.</p>
   <p>The circular runs in essence as follows: "Our's is an association as esteemed as is yours, and in the first place a unionized one, which closes its contracts on the basis of set rules, and therefore, should <span class="page-break">2</span>merit the support of your association and of the Czech public in general. The undersigned union furnishes help to the Denni Hlasatel, to the Svornost, and to the printing shop of Mr. Svestka; it is exclusively Czech, one reason more for its right to the good-will on the part of Czech associations. Our organization was founded because we felt that the dues and emergency payments to the international unions, could be put to better use by directing them into the channels of an organization composed of our own kind. We have gone through the experience of being dependent upon the decisions of organizations foreign to us and of humiliation from societies we hardly knew; we, therefore, arrived at the conclusion that a body governed by Czechs only, would be the right union for us. The way Czech union men are being treated by the officials of the organizations of other nationalities is well known. One example of the treatment accorded to Czech union men is presented in the recent strike of the garment workers' union. Similar occurrences prompted us to found our own organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Today, after an existence of several years of our union, we can safely claim that the financial condition of the individual members is much improved over that of former years, and the contracts with our employers have been renewed. Those are reasons that speak for themselves.</p>
   <p>Besides this, we have been making every effort to aid our fellow-workers in distress; at the same time, we allowed no opportunity to pass without doing our bit in the field of nationalistic endeavor. We assure your society that the contracts entered into with our employers are of more benefit to us than those closed with any others. In closing we are entreating your organization to lend your support to us by patronizing the printing concerns for which we work.</p>
   <p>Signed: Frank Sramek, president.</p>
