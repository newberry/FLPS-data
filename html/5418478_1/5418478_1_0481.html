   <p>large numbers of our countrymen who live in the 34th and 5th Wards, will vote in Tuesday's election. In addition to filling the offices of mayor, aldermanic, and other city offices, the important question of whether or not the undignified method of renewing saloonkeepers' licenses in that part of the city which formerly belonged to Cicero shall be continued.</p>
   <p>Many Bohemians are settled in this part of the city. In this whole district, the saloonkeeper is required to secure the signatures of a majority of the citizens residing within half a mile of his place of business before he can have his license renewed. This is because in this section an ordinance is in force from the time when the district still belonged to Cicero, and was only sparsely settled. This ordinance has been the source of much difficulty, not only for the saloonkeepers, but for the citizens as well.</p>
   
   <p>Twice each year, the saloonkeeper had to seek signatures to his petition, thereby disturbing the quiet of the people's homes. But that was not all. After the saloonkeeper, came the prohibitionists, questioning each signer as to whether he really signed the saloonkeeper's petition, and police also came to officially ascertain the legality of the signatures.</p>
   <p>In order to do away with this unnecessary annoyance to the citizens, and in order that this district might be governed by the ordinances and regulations in force throughout the rest of Chicago, an election will be held in that section next Tuesday. According to the ordinance, upon which the annexation of the above mentioned district was carried out, the question, "Shall an ordinance be accepted whereby power to issue licenses in that district will be granted," must be submitted to the voters for decision. Our countrymen, as is understood, will vote for the issuance of licenses, and will mark a cross after the words: "For Dram Shops." In that way, they will signify that they are for the principles of personal liberty.</p>
   
   <p>They will make sure that their neighborhood is governed by the same laws as are in force in the rest of Chicago. They will make provisions so that neither they nor the saloonkeepers will be unnecessarily annoyed before each license period expires.</p>
   <p>Every citizen living in the indicated district should clip the specimen ballot found on page nine of this paper, and mark the ballot he receives next Tuesday accordingly. This special ballot will be issued in the 27th, 28th, 29th and 30th precincts of 5th Ward, and in all precincts of the 34th Ward lying west of 40th Avenue, and in all parts of 16th, 29th, 30th, 35th and 36th precincts of the 35th Ward which lie east of 48th Avenue.</p>
