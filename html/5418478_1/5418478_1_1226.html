   <p>Thousands of handbills hearing this slogan are being scattered broadcast in Chicago by the National Socialist party. A mass meeting will be held at Pilsen Park, Twenty-sixth and Albany Avenue, Monday night to protest against Austro-Servian war. The anti war agitation is being carried on by the Daily Spravedlnost a Bohemian Socialist newspaper published at 1825 South Loomis Street. Ex-Congressman Victor Berger, Ludwig Vahlteich a member of the German parliament in 1880, and John J. Jelinek editor of the Spravedlnost, will speak.</p>
   <p>"The socialists are against war" explained Mr. Jelinek. "The workmen of Europe will bear the expense of the war. They must have help and their widows and children must have food and clothing. We are meeting to protest against the war and to take up subscription for the workmen in Europe.</p>
