   <p>The clerks employed in paint, hardware, and furniture, stores of Bohemian California, recently requested that they be given Sundays off. The employers gladly agreed to this. Now it depends on the public in order to maintain this deserved advantage to the salespeople, to buy their needs from these stores on Saturdays, when the stores will remain open until ten o'clock in the evening. Sunday closing of these stores will be effective Sunday, June 9. There is no doubt that our countrymen, who welcome every improvement offered the workingmen, will be willing to do all in their power to see to it that Sunday closing of these establishments will become permanent and general.</p>
