   <p>Vokoun's malicious circular, as published in the Tribune, Narod, and other papers, and which is wholly unfavorable to our entire nationality, was answered by a gigantic indignation meeting held by Chicago's liberal-minded, Bohemians.</p>
   <p>The meeting was held in the hall of the Bohemian-American Liberal School on 18th St., which is the center of our nationalistic societies. The large hall was filled to capacity, both gallery and main floor. The meeting was called to order by our well known countryman Jan Pecha and he was elected permanent chairman. The stage was occupied by representatives of various Bohemian societies. Mr. Pecha explained, in words of great feeling, the purpose of the meeting.</p>
   <p>A resolutions committee was appointed to work out resolutions in protest against the accusation of Bohemians by the English press.</p>
   
   <p>The following resolutions, as worked out by the committee, were read to the gathering, and accepted:</p>
   <p>Whereas, the Bohemian people of Chicago and the fraternal benefit societies organized among them have found out that the Chicago Tribune, prompted by persons more or less known, accuses us of organizing societies professing to be atheistic, and accuses us of degeneracy and the practice of suicide on masse and individually, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, in a massmeeting, held in the Bohemian-American Liberal School, 400 W. 18th street, attended by a large portion of our people, there were presented figures, statistics and records, proving that the accusations as published in the Tribune are absolutely and unconditionally wrong; and further, it was proved by testimony in said meeting that no societies for the practice and support of suicide are, or ever were, in existence among us, and the accusation in this respect is false; further, we make it clear that our societies are not atheistic but that they are fraternal benefit societies having nothing in common with beliefs or religion; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, by us gathered in meeting, that we condemn and damn the degenerate and treacherous person, or persons, who gave these false and malicious reports to the Chicago Tribune, and be it further</p>
   <p>Resolved, that a copy of these resolutions be given to the public press.</p>
