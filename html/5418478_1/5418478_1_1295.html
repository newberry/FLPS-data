   <p>Every Czechoslovak man or woman who is a citizen and resides in the Nineteenth Senatorial District realizes that it is high time for this District, so thickly populated by thousands of Czechoslovaks, to have a representative in the State Legislature [who is a Czechoslovak]. These Czechoslovaks have settled, built, and developed many new sections of the District and are entitled to have their own representative in the Senate. It must be an honest countryman [of ours] who is well qualified [for the office] as well as energetic.</p>
   <p>These qualities are concentrated in the person of Mr. Albert B. Holecek, who has been nominated for the office of State Senator on the Republican ticket. Every one of us will therefore do his best to help him get elected. That little cross placed in the little square in front of his name will accomplish great things. It will help the citizens of Czechoslovak origin to obtain a senator for their District, and the whole District will profit thereby.</p>
   <p>By strong and friendly teamwork the Czechoslovaks will elect Mr. Holecek, thus proving their civic intelligence and their racial consciousness. They will always be able to point with pride to their man, who will work for them in the true Czechoslovak spirit, helping the weak and the oppressed, fighting extortion and parasitism, defending the rights of men, and frustrating the designs of the fanatics who are for prohibition and against the foreign-language groups. The workingmen and the small taxpayers of our District will have their best defender in Mr. Holecek. His origin is the same as theirs; he knows all their hopes and is fully qualified to realize them.</p>
