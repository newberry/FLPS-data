   <p>p. 4--A few days ago we called the attention of our readers to a letter which was sent to the local German newspaper, the Abendpost in defense of Bohemians. The author is Mr. Anton Martinovsky, 897 South Ashland avenue. The German paper published the letter but immediately afterwards printed a goodly number of communications from Germans who vilified the Bohemian writer and Bohemians in general. This was not enough. Certain obscene expressions incorporated in some of the letters were omitted by the Abendpost, and so the writers turned on Mr. Martinovsky with private letters containing the most insulting remarks, signing their full names and addresses, thus giving Mr. Martinovsky the evidence necessary for a libel suit if he had not preferred to keep aloof from such action.</p>

   <p>But it is gratifying to find that not all Germans are insane enough to foster such hatred against us, for some of them even wrote letters to Mr. Martinovsky in which they commended his attitude. One of these, signed John Fried, 1043 North Central Avenue, Austin, Illinois contains the following passage: "I admire a man who has the courage to stand up against the fanatical idolaters of Kaiser Wilhelm. He who desires to write about you Bohemians or about other nations must first be sufficiently well versed in his subject. I myself lived in Prague almost four years, and I learned a little of the language. I am convinced that all the disturbances in that city are provoked by the riotous behavior of the Germans. The German students ought to know that the Bohemian people have for many years been taken advantage of by the Germans, and that an unjust government has supplied the finishing touches. "The remainder of the letter proves the writer to be well informed.</p>
