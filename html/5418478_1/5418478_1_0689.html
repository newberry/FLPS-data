   <p>A meeting of the Czech Tavernkeepers' Association for the purpose of discussing the Sunday closing law was held yesterday in the hall of the Bohemian-American Free Thought School on 18th Street. The Association had publicly announced the reason for the gathering and had invited every innkeeper who intends to join in the fight against the menace of prohibition. Every saloonkeeper is certainly acquainted with the extent of the Sunday blue laws, and has completely realized what the consequences would be if the antiquated laws should be revived and enforced.</p>
   <p>An unusually large number of tavernkeepers, over two hundred, of Czech and other nationalities, made their appearance. Many who did not belong to the organization applied for membership, paying the five-dollar initiation fee and subscribing to the regular monthly dues of $1.50.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by John Cervenka, president of the Association, who declared that the reports gathered by the first district of the Chicago Barkeepers' Association will be submitted to the meeting to serve as a basis for united action. The Association, Mr. Carvenka continued, has been in existence for twenty-five years, yet many an innkeeper ascribed only little value to it, not grasping its importance to the trade.</p>
   <p>One of the primary objects of the Association is protection against the police, whose arbitrary actions are a daily occurrence. In such cases the organization stands behind its members to the limit. The rules forbid the members to serve liquor to intoxicated persons. Sometimes a tavernkeeper is ignorant of the actual age of a young man; when trouble results, a lawyer is furnished. Flagrant violations of the rules, on the other hand, are punished by expulsion from the Association. One rule directs the members to refuse to serve liquor to habitual drunkards who neglect their families. The rules are in no way at variance with the one o'clock closing law; the organization will not protect violators of this law. The Association does not inveigh against laws on which men of sound judgment can agree.</p>
   <p>Many are the victories won by the Association, among them the abolition of the billiard and bowling alley tax and the prevention of an increase in the Government tax to fifty dollars and the final settlement at twenty-five dollars. Numerous readjustments in favor of the saloonkeeper were effected without the latter's knowledge of the forces responsible for the action, for which the Association deserves unstinted praise.</p>
   <p>An energetic drive is now under way to secure the close co-operation and sincere efforts of the tavernkeepers. They must join the forces whose aim is to combat the sinister elements that are trying to bring the United States under the control of prohibition. Should these elements succeed in subduing our Chicago, the rest of the cities all over the country would easily fall prey to them. Mr. Cervenka appealed to the assembly, asking that they give their wholehearted support to the Association, and he closed with a resounding "Na Zdar!" (Good Luck!)</p>
   <p>Attorney Jos. Smejkal addressed the group, pointing out the fallacy in the reasoning of many members who had always looked upon the organization as a mere sham. No Czech tavernkeeper has yet been arrested for a violation of the new ordinance, true enough, and not one has stood before the judge.</p>
   
   <p>The first case of this kind will come up in court on December 16. The tavernkeepers' league will take up the defense, and the cost will be paid by the members. In every municipal court there will be a lawyer engaged by the league. Every member arrested will refuse to plead guilty, but will demand a jury trial. The first district has engaged ten lawyers for a fee of ten dollars per day to defend all the members brought before the court. The colored tavernkeepers--sixty in number--were refused membership, but were promised aid in case of arrest.</p>
   <p>The Czech Tavernkeepers' Association draws about fifty per cent of its members from other Slavonic groups such as the Poles, Croatians, Slovenians, etc. About seven hundred dollars was collected at the meeting, and sixty-four new members were secured. Everyone who attended the meeting left with high hopes and a smile of encouragement.</p>
