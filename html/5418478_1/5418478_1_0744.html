   <p>The horizon of every man in public office can be easily gauged by the manner in which he shows his appreciation of the good will of, and of the confidence placed in him by his constituency. Particular tact in regard to this is required in Chicago, a preeminently cosmopolitan city, the heterogeneous nationalistic elements of which are entitled to a representation on the School Board. There is a very large number of Czech and Slavonic voters here who were instrumental in the election of Mayor Thompson two years ago.</p>
   <p>The Mayor, nevertheless, did not deem it proper to appoint a Czech to the Board. One member, Mr. Antony Czarnecki, is a Pole. Other nationalities are represented in larger numbers. The neglect exists; it borders on political backwardness on our part perhaps, but we do not regret this <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in the last analysis. The present administration of our city is so bad, its conscience is burdened with so much glaring mischief that any closer contact with it would harm us rather than do us any good.</p>
