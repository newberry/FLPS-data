   <p>No better method for the dispossession of undesirable tenants can be found than that offered by the Smolik's Landlords' Association (not inc.). The main purpose of the Association is to cause the removal of the undesirable tenants without the loss of much time and expense. We write notices to vacate free of charge, and advise you about all property matters. D. C. Jones, and a Bohemian lawyer, Otto Kerner, are legal representatives of the Association. Membership fee is only one dollar a year. The main office, with Frank J. Smolik in charge, is located at 1852 South Centre Avenue. (Racine Avenue now.)</p>
