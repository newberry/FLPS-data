   <p>Children who leave the public schools these days should not be saying good-by to schools forever, especially in cases where the parents have enough means to support their children in further studies.</p>
   <p>The education which the parents are able to give their children is the only permanent thing they can give them, no matter how rich they are, and that education will be of immense value to the children some day in the future. Where the parents are in favor of having their children go back to school, the children should be happy to take advantage of their parents' generosity and be grateful to them, if for nothing else than for the chance of remaining for a few more years--children, youths.</p>
