   <p>The former representative and councilman, and at present chief clerk of the Magistrate's Court, Anton J. Cermak, is named the main conspirator by the prohibitionists, because he frustrated the passage of the latest blue law, and "Tony", as his colleagues call him, is not ashamed of this new nick-name. "I have not yet been called a 'a gray wolf,'" he declared yesterday in the City Hall, "but by and by, I shall surely turn gray, and then, if any charitable neighbors want to call me a wolf, then they can. They do not appear to have forgotten the fact, that I, as alderman, with several colleagues, discovered the flagrant violations of the tax-laws, and therefore have earned the ill will of the reform party's representatives. But this is not going to cause my hair to turn grey."</p>
