   <p>… .The majority of the residents of Cicero are Czechs. This was the keynote of the speech which Mr. Frank J. Petru, newly elected member of the Cicero school board, delivered at the last meeting of that body presided over by Mr. Jan Slapak.</p>
   <p>Mr. Petru said: "There are eleven schools in the town of Cicero with 123 school teachers. And now I should like to know why there is not one single school teacher of Czech descent. There are only two teachers of Polish descent. Seventy-five per cent of Cicero voters are Czech…."</p>
   <p>The school board members knew no better answer than the excuse that Czech teachers did not care for positions in Cicero. This was refused by Mr. Petru who pointed out that a Czech teacher, Miss Marcella Cervenka, applied for one of three positions open in Cicero but was not considered. Mr. Petru demanded <span class="page-break">\2</span>that something be done about these conditions which have been the "stormy petrel" of many discussions. "There should be at least fifty school teachers of Czech descent in this town…." he shouted with resounding emphasis.</p>
   <p>The other members of the board sat staring and were evidently baffled. The attending citizens, however, rewarded Mr. Petru with roaring applause.</p>
