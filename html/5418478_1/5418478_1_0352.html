   <p>The result of Saturday's balloting concerning the $600,000 bond issue for the erection of four new high schools did not surprise our Cicero citizens, for it was a known fact that such an issue would become an [additional] burden, and the majority did not consider it of utmost importance. The Cicero polls were well attended by the voters, while in Berwyn, not enough interest was shown in this important question. The results of the voting are as follows:</p>

   <p>The total number of votes cast was 4,611 against the bond issue and only 1,858 for it. In every Bohemian precinct of Cicero, there was a great majority of votes against the issue.</p>

   <p>By this defeat, the question of the building of the four high schools will undoubtedly be settled for a long time, and the school board will probably be compelled to consider the other plan as recommended by various organizations before the election. This second plan consists of widening the J. Sterling Morton high school so that it would satisfy the needs [for additional school buildings], but even in this case, it will be necessary to ask the voters to permit another bond issue.</p>
