   <p>Yesterday afternoon the Bohemian Democratic Clubs held a meeting on the premises of Citizen Sidl. Citizen J. Panoch was chairman. The committee on by-laws read a report on proposed changes, among which was a proposal to change the name of the organization to "Central Bohemian American Democratic Club," to be made up of the Delegates from various Bohemian Ward Clubs. Each ward club to be entitled to five delegates chosen by itself.</p>
   <p>Then followed considerable debate in regards to the laws, which were finally accepted; but immediately were brought up for reconsideration and final action posponed until after election. In the meantime, the various ward clubs are to be advised of all proposed changes and asked for their recommendations in the matter which is to be taken up again after election and either accepted or thrown out.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to call a meeting of the leading Democrats of the 8th ward, where there are already two Bohemian candidates, for the purpose of straightening this matter out, as with two candidates dividing the support there would not be much hope of any success.</p>
