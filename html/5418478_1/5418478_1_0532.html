   <p>During the last two days Chicago has been rejoicing over the regulation issued by Secretary of the Treasury Mellon permitting the manufacture of medicinal beer and wine. But the pleasure was of short duration. It was taken away by the Attorney General of the State of Illinois, who declared that he would not permit the sale of medicinal beer and wine, basing his decision on the search and seizure law passed by the State legislature. His declaration was the topic of many heated discussions, as the result of which the waning joy started gradually to return, owing to the fact that many prominent lawyers and experts voiced the opinion that the law in question was unconstitutional and could not stand against the last Governmental regulation.</p>
   <p>While these opinions were being voiced, F. Scott McBride, the Illinois State superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League, was severely criticizing the Federal Government for loosening up the prohibition laws. He declared that in regard to the question of medicinal beer and wine, the campaign for such beer and wine <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>by people engaged in illegal traffic in alcoholic beverages, proved that the real purpose of the agitation was not to make beer and wine available as medicines but to cause a general slackening of the regulations in regard to the sale of all intoxicating beverages.</p>
   <p>Of course, the point of view of lawyers and legal experts upon this matter is different. Most of them are of the opinion that a Federal law has precedence of a State law in validity and interpretation. They are convinced that the State search and seizure law is unconstitutional, or at least out of place and cannot be enforced as far as its application to physicians is concerned, because it prohibits them from prescribing beer and wine to patients for whom these beverages are an indispensable medicine. They also say that the whole State prohibition law is unconstitutional because, on the one hand, it permits the prescription of whisky as a medicine, while, on the other hand, it prohibits the prescription of beer and wine for medicinal use. These same legal authorities call the Illinois prohibition law farcial, saying that it makes the same impression as would be made by a cotton-growing state which would <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>prohibit the use of cotton underwear, or, perhaps, a vegetarian legislature which would prohibit the use of beef broth or meat by patients who need them for recovery. They say further that the whole State law and its drastic enforcement is far from the intentions of the legislators, whose only purpose was to limit the sale of whisky, beer, and wine, and not to prevent a sick person from getting what has been prescribed for him by his physician, and what he needs to regain his health.</p>
   <p>Lawyer Levy Mayer, talking about the Federal and the State prohibition laws insofar as they concern medical prescriptions, said there was a definite conflict between the laws. He thought that in case of such a conflict the Federal law must prevail. Of course, whether it will or will not prevail in this specific case is up to the United States Supreme Court to decide. Another question, and one of great interest and importance, is whether the State legislature has the right to stop a physician from prescribing anything he considers as medicine for his patients in any particular case. His personal opinion is that the decision of the State legislature would not be tenable in any such case.</p>

   <p>Lawyer Colin C. H. Fyffe says he is convinced that the Federal Congress and its enactments have priority over those of any state legislature, and that in the cases now under consideration the State law can be declared invalid. Also he is of the opinion that no state legislature has any right whatever to tell a physician what he may or may not prescribe for his patient. He believes that a law of this kind is too drastic for enforcement.</p>
   <p>Lawyers Thomas D. Nash and Otto Baer thought that the State of Illinois could not be deprived of its medicinal beer and wine. Nash said that the State contradicts itself when it permits the sale of medicinal whisky and prohibits the sale of medicinal beer and wine. He is convinced that such a law would be declared unconstitutional by any court of law. In such a case the Federal laws and regulations would remain in force until the matter was decided, one way or the other, by the United States Supreme Court, or until the State legislature passed an entirely different law. That being the situation, Attorney General Brundage would have to issue a permit to release wine and beer for sale as medicine, no matter what his personal attitude toward that matter should be.</p>
