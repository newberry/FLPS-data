   <p>The Czechoslovak taxpayers, together with taxpayers' associations of the Twelfth Ward, called a mass indignation meeting for yesterday afternoon. The main feature on the program was a debate between Alderman Anton J. Čermák of the Twelfth Ward and his colleague, Alderman John H. Lyle, of the Thirty-second Ward. Both debated the question of prohibition, a question which at the present time promises to become a campaign issue of national importance. Therefore it can be understood why the debate attracted such a large number of listeners. The Pilsen Brewery pavilion was filled to capacity. Čermák and Lyle are, above all others, the proper persons to engage in a debate of this kind; the former has for many years been a champion of personal liberties; the latter is well known as a mouthpiece of the drys, not only within the City Council itself, but wherever he happens to be. The meeting was presided over by Mr. Hanus with Mr. J. Liška as secretary. Alderman Čermák opened the meeting and introduced Alderman Lyle who was to prove that the prohibition law met with an undeniable success.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lyle, who is an attorney, is a good speaker, but nevertheless his talk was very disappointing to everybody who listened to him, and his audience was aware that he is supposed to be one of the most ardent Prohibitionists. He defended an issue, which in spite of all its moral and humane punctilio is basically fanatical and bad. Lyle's task therefore, was extremely difficult. Since prohibition, which was forced upon the people of this country, cannot have a logical basis, it must needs have a recourse to sentimentality. Lyle tried to show that while saloons were in existence, the people who frequented them spent all their earnings in them; spent more than they could afford, causing suffering in the family. He tried to show that prohibition lowered the percentage of crimes, taught people how to economize, and that its good fruits will be borne by the next generation. He likewise endeavored to argue that taxes are not higher as a result of the prohibition law, but because public life has been corrupted by politicians who are in the service of rich corporations to whom they sell their privileges at the expense of the common weal....At the end of his speech he paid a doubtful compliment to the assembled citizens: "Either respect the law as good American citizens or go back to the country you came from." These words evoked a storm of protest.</p>
   <p>To these shallow arguments, it was an easy task on the part of Alderman Cermak to answer. Mr. Cermak overturned them one after another, and in many instances he did not spare the horses. First of all he showed that prohibition does not render people more moral but, on the contrary, it degrades them. It lowers the respect for all law and incites citizens to circumvent it. People today do things which in times past they would not have thought of doing. Crime is on the increase, not on the decrease. After eighteen months of prohibition in the city of Chicago alone there were more hangings than for the entire decade preceding the prohibition. The people of this country did not desire prohibition, at least not such stringent measures as are prevalent today. But the people were not given an opportunity to vote on the question generally.... It is therefore very incorrect to make such wholesale assertions as were made by the speaker....Mr. Cermak finished by saying that the right to protest against excessive legislation rests with every citizen, and that consequently such a citizen cannot be accused of disloyalty to the constitution. When we had more liberal laws which were not pleasing to the members of the Prohibition party, no one asked them to leave America and "go back to the country you came from". When the time arrives again to vote on the issue, there will be enthusiastic citizens who will vote it out of existence, even those who inhabit Mr. Lyle's own Ward.</p>
   <p>This was the tone of the whole debate; the listening public heard the debate calmly rewarding especially Mr. Cermak's refutations with unstinted applause. If there were some of us who were a bit more enthusiastic than others they must remember that in their zeal they ought not insult an educated person and a public official, especially one whom we have invited to come into our own midst; we should use tact and civility. For when we criticize fanatics we ought not fall victims to fanaticism of another kind.</p>
