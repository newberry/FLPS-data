   <p>In the debate on the authorization of President Wilson to declare War on Germany, Senator John Sharp Williams delivered a brilliant address in which he especially emphasized the urgent necessity of declaring war on Austria also, and the ultimate elimination of the houses Habsburg and Hohenzollern as ruling powers. The Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Czech National Alliance), in order to point to the imperative necessity of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy, sent the following telegram to Senator Williams:</p>
   <p>"Congratulations to your correct declaration that the United States must perpetuate the war until the guaranty is given that the Hohenzollern <span class="page-break">2</span>and the Habsburg dynasties shall not rule over Germany and Austria-Hungary any more, and also, until Turkey is driven back into Asia. Austria is equally guilty with Germany, and the partitioning of Austria is unconditionally necessary for democracy. Austria is an artificial state, and has no right to exist. It should be broken up into an independent Czecho-Slovak republic, a free Jugoslavia, and a free Hungary.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian National Alliance in America.</p>
   <p>Doctor Fisher, president."</p>
