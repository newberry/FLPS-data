   <p>Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, a well-known Czech Congressman, has proposed a new prohibition law, which would allow the manufacture and distribution of beer with an alcoholic content of three per cent and wine with a nine per cent content. Should this proposal become a law, we could somehow reconcile ourselves with Prohibition. But there is very little hope for its acceptance, for Congress is fanatically possessed and will not become cool-headed until the ice-cold shower comes--at the next November election.</p>
