   <p>The Democratic Women's League, together with the Twelfth Ward organization, held a great mass meeting in the Pilsen Park Pavilion, at 26th Street and Albany Avenue, last evening. The meeting was held in the interest of the Democratic candidate for alderman, Mr. Joseph I. Novak, and from the enormous attendance at this meeting one may judge that the election of Mr. Novak to the city council is more than assured.</p>
   <p>The spacious pavilion in Pilsen Park could hardly accomodate all the guests who came to hear the well-known political workers and speakers who were scheduled for the evening. All of them came except Senator Lewis, who had been hurriedly called to Washington and therefore could not be present.</p>
   <p>Besides Sheriff Michael Zimmer, John A. Cervenka, Mr. John E. Traeger, and the candidate himself, Mr. Joseph I. Novak, the following also spoke: Miss Zdenka Novotny, Mrs. Emma Hrisny, and Mrs. Anna Zenistek.</p>
   
   <p>There was also a colorful program of entertaining features, for which the arrangements committee is to be given full credit. Everyone went home quite convinced that Mr. Joseph I. Novak is the outstanding candidate of the Twelfth Ward, and that therefore everyone will cast her or his vote for him.</p>
   <p>Other ward meetings have been held in the interest of Mr. Joseph I. Novak, and all of them have met with pronounced success.</p>
