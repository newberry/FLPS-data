   <p>If Ch. R. Walleck is to be reappointed to the School Board it is necessary that all resolutions for this purpose adopted by our societies, clubs, lodges, and committees, be forwarded, in English, to Mayor Harrison. It will not suffice to simply have them published in the Bohemian newspapers. The mayor must be informed that Bohemians want the reappointment of Ch. R. Walleck and this can be accomplished only by sending the various resolutions adopted to him, in the English language. All societies which have not done so as yet should hurry and send these resolutions, in English, either this week or next week. The address of the mayor is as follows: Hon. Carter H. Harrison, Mayor of Chicago.</p>
