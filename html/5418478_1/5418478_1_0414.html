   <p>Yesterday's annual meeting of the Sdružení Svobodomyslných Skol (Federation of Czech Free Thought Schools), held in the Ladimir Klácel Hall, was noteworthy because two university professors were present, namely Professor Thomas from the University of Chicago, and Professor Miller from the University of Michigan. They attended the meeting on the invitation of Mr. F. J. Beneš. They were accompanied by Mr. Palda, who introduced them to the numerous representatives gathered at the meeting. Both professors expressed their great interest in Czech matters and said they took great interest in the study of the Czech language and history. Professor Thomas said that he will participate in this year's sokol excursion to Bohemia, and that he expects to remain in Bohemia for a longer period of time for the purpose of study. At the same time, he said that he expected to reach some sort of an agreement with the [Chicago] Daily News in regard to sending reports of his travels through Bohemia. Both speeches were received with enthusiastic applause.</p>
