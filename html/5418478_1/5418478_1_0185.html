   <p>A meeting of Bohemian Catholics was held in the school hall of St. Procopius Church, 18th and Allport streets, yesterday to protest against the bill for free text books to the public schools, and the bill denying to Colleges with small endowment the right to grant degrees.</p>
   <p>Resolutions were adopted and a committee was appointed to call on members of the Chicago Board of Education and members of the Legislature and ask the defeat of the bills.</p>
   <p>There was a large attendance at the meeting. It was called by a committee composed of the Rev. Procopius Nauzil, the Rev. John Ocenasek and the Rev. Charles Kohlbeck. Among the speakers were Theodore B. Thiele, Albert Janda, Casper Stech, the Rev. Valentine Kohlbeck and Theodore Thiele.</p>
   
   <p>The speakers contended that if the school Board could furnish the rich people with free text books, the money should be used to equip school buildings where the Bohemian children would be benefited by them. At the present time, a number are unable to attend school on account of the limited accomodations. The bill, restricting the right to give to colleges having $100,000 or more endowment, would destroy several Catholic institutions, it was stated.</p>
   <p>The committee appointed to work against the bills was composed of ex Alderman Frank Meek, J. Joseph Malcak, and Frank Suhrada.</p>
