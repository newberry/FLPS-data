   <p>The last week of the great election campaign will be marked by a great deal of propaganda work in our Bohemian wards. There will be a large number of Democratic meetings held during these days, a circumstance which shows unmistakably that the Bohemian citizens, both men and women, are genuinely interested in seeing Mr. Robert H. Sweitzer elected mayor of our great city.</p>
   <p>These political activities will be inaugurated today by a number of meetings; there will be a number of large demonstrations during the next few days, in which various Bohemian Democratic organizations, candidates, and many other excellent speakers will participate.</p>
