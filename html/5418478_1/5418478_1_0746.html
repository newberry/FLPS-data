   <p>Our "Mister Mayor," William H. Thompson, has not named one single Czech to the office of member of the School Board. This is not surprising. On the contrary, we would have been surprised if the Mayor had acted justly and impartially. He is not a sincere American, neither a sincere Chicagoan, nor a sincere Republican. He is merely a politician; he is a "Thompsonite," leader of the political clique by the support of which he is striving to keep in the foreground of political life. It was this clique which he had in mind when appointing members to the School Board. Czechs do not belong to this clique, which is the reason why none of them were appointed.</p>
