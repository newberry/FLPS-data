   <p>There are only a few days left before election. Bohemian citizens should not forget that their votes will be necessary to elect the Bohemian candidates to the city council in the Tenth, Twelfth, Twentieth, and Thirty-fourth wards.</p>
   <p>In all these wards we have good Bohemian candidates, and there is no reason why a Bohemian voter should not give them preference when it is certain that Bohemian candidates are better qualified for office than non-Bohemian candidates.</p>
   <p>These Bohemian candidates will be your friends even after election, whereas an Irishman knows you only up to the time when you cast your vote.</p>
   
   <p>Can anyone presume that in an equal contest between a Bohemian and an Irishman, an Irishman would cast his vote for a Bohemian?</p>
   <p>It is known to everybody how it looks when a countryman runs for office in the whole city or county. In all the wards where the Bohemian voters do not predominate, the Bohemian candidate lags far behind the other candidates of his party, even when he is the most competent of the candidates on the ticket. If he has a Bohemian name, he could never expect to receive as many votes as his opponents. Without a favorable political wave, and the unstinted support of our countrymen, our candidates on city and county tickets would fare very badly.</p>
