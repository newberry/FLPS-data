   <p>Although the present representative of the nineteenth senatorial district has been in Springfield for twelve years, there are only a few people in that large district who know his name. Our countrymen, as much as they may be active in politics, know absolutely nothing about him. They have never had the rather dubious honor of being asked by him how he could best represent them, in the state legislature, so that the whole district could profit thereby. It is only at election times that he is seen at political meetings, and he believes that by appearing there he has discharged his political obligations. Because of this fact residents of the entire district were extremely enthusiastic when they learned that the young and energetic lawyer, Mr. Albert B. Holecek, had received the nomination on the Republican ticket.</p>
   <p>Mr. Holecek, who grew up in the district, knows its needs and will endeavor, to the best of his ability, to make it thrive. Splendid progress has been made during the past few years in the Thirty-fourth Ward, in the Lawndale, <span class="page-break">2</span>Crawford, and Merigold districts, and in Cicero and Berwyn, Illinois, but that progress is entirely due to the industry and enterprise of the inhabitants of those districts. Citizens and taxpayers know that much more could be accomplished if more work were done in the proper places. Mr. Holecek, who is intimately connected with the most important taxpayers' and citizens' organizations in the district, knows that his contacts are going to be more intimate when he is elected senator. Every request of the citizens will be willingly heard by Mr. Holecek who will do his utmost to see that such requests are complied with. It is only by such co-operation that the district can be truly represented in the state senate. To make this possible all good citizens of the district, no matter what their political party may be, must vote for our countryman, Mr. Albert B. Holecek.</p>
