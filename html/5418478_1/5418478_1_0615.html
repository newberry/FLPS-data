   <p>A meeting of officers and representatives of Bohemian associations was held last night in the Pilsen Park pavilion. The meeting was called for the purpose of making preparations for a huge parade of protest against the action of Mayor Thompson [in closing the saloons on Sunday]. The parade will take place November 7, that is, a week from next Sunday.</p>
   <p>The meeting was attended by about seven hundred delegates and officers of Bohemian organizations and was presided over by Mr. John A. Cervenka.</p>
   <p>After the discussion of various proposals offered by those present, a committee was appointed [composed of seven men and two women] which will work out a plan of action.</p>
   <p>The meeting expressed full confidence in the secretary of the United Civic Societies, Mr. Anton J. Cermak, and nominated a resolutions committee which was <span class="page-break">\2</span>charged with the drafting of a resolution containing a proper expression of that confidence. This resolution will be published in all our newspapers.</p>
   <p>It is unnecessary to say that the meeting properly condemned Mayor Thompson's action. No effort will be spared to give a forceful expression to this condemnation by the largest possible participation of Bohemian organizations and Bohemians in general in the parade. So far fifty associations have promised to participate, and it is desirable that all others indicate their agreement to participate in this great demonstration.</p>
