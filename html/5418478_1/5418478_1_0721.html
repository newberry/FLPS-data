   <p>When John D. Shoop, superintendent of the Chicago schools, was asked last night whether he is willing to take steps to remove the obnoxious article about the German Kaiser from the school books, he answered that nothing could be done. "We cannot be sentimental in this matter," he said.</p>
   <p>This comes from Mr. Shoop, who has been assuring parents of Czech school children for the past two years that a new school book would be published, in which no more praise is to be given the Kaiser. Mr. Shoop is collaborating with the seven loyal members of the School Board who have been appointed by Mayor Thompson, who controls these eight men. The Mayor's attitude towards the War is sufficiently known and sheds the proper light upon the further utterance of Mr. Shoop in regard to the issue. "We do not want to hurt the feelings of anybody." He failed to explain whose feelings he meant. He amplified his statement by using the excuse that there was not enough money on hand for a new edition. Such an excuse as this has never been offered in complaints up to date.</p>

   <p>The School Board closed a contract with the P. F. Pettibone Company on June 2, for forty thousand school books for the price of only $4,000. Mayor Thompson created a position on the School Board which pays $4,000 to his protege, Morton McCormick. Another forty thousand school books could have been bought for one year's salary.....</p>
   <p>Besides the Czechs, other nationalistic groups such as the Poles, Italians, Greeks, and French, will make efforts to have the pernicious article which is poisoning the minds of our children removed. It will be one of their first actions up for consideration in the meetings to be called soon. Not only parents of school children are to be invited, but all the newly enlisted soldiers as well. Of the latter, it is expected that they will give vent to their resentment of the article that praises the very man whom they are to fight at the risk of their lives. The meeting will surely bring results. The Czech National Alliance, the Polish Alliance, and similar organizations of other language groups are preparing a monster protest against the behaviour of the School Board. Each part of the city is to be organized in order to effectively combat the few loyal friends of the "Chicago Kaiser."</p>
