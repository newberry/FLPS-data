   <p>The State Utility Commission has been requested many times to arrange for the establishment of a station of the Burlington Railroad in our Plze≈à (Pilsen) District. Promises were given, true enough, but nothing was done up to this day. An ex-Senator, a certain Mr. Forst, informs us that a hearing concerning the issue has been postponed until next Monday. The aldermen of our Czech Wards are expected to be present there. We earnestly desire that the question be solved finally in favor of the populace of the district.</p>
   <p>The station is an urgent need for our people from the country, who are forced to use this road in order to arrive in the Pilsen settlement where they have much business to transact. It is also much wanted by Chicagoans who wish to get to the Czech district by a direct route. The railroad company is obstinately resisting the demand of the Czech settlement. The Utility Commission will have to exert pressure to bring it to terms.</p>
