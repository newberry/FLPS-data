   <p>The Immigration Commission in Washington has just completed a report on the Chicago public schools and from this report it appears that Czech children, that is, children of parents born in Bohemia, are numerically in third place among immigrant nationalities. According to the report 235,452 children attend the local public schools, and of these, 76,887 are of native-born parents. Immediately following, are German-born children, of whom there are 38,155; then follow 17,778 Swedish children; 16,163 Czech children; 16,021 Russian-Jewish children; 10,565 Irish children; 10,170 Italian children; 7,463 Polish children; 6,423 Norwegian children; English, Canadian, German-Jewish, Danish, Scotch, Dutch, Polish-Jewish, French, Russian, Hungarian, Lithuanian, and Slovak. According to the report, Czech children are by far more numerous in the public schools than are Polish children, but, nevertheless, the Polish language is taught in the local high schools. These figures will be a <span class="page-break">\2</span>convincing argument that the Czech language should also be taught there. As has been mentioned, these figures are concerned only with the children of foreign-born parents. There are also many thousand Czech children not included in this report whose parents were born in this country.</p>
