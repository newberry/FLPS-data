   <p>Extensive and intensive propaganda for the introduction of national prohibition has set in all over the country; the measure is proposed to last for the duration of the war, for it is considered by some as a matter of expediency. The degree of acuteness of the situation can be gauged by the fact that the caucus of the Democratic congressmen has decided for prohibition, advancing as the main reason the large quantities of corn saved by using it for food, instead of for the manufacture of alcoholic beverages.</p>
   <p>The advocates of prohibition do not consider the loss of work for many thousands of people and the dissolution of many industrial and commercial organizations that would inevitably follow prohibition. The liquor tax <span class="page-break">2</span>would replenish the funds that support our government. We are not surprised by the attitude the caucus has taken, for many congressmen come from southern prohibition states.</p>
