   <p>Yesterday's meeting of the Bohemian-American National Union was fairly well attended. In the absence of the regular chairman the meeting was presided over by Citizen Sinkula and after the acceptance of the minutes of the previous meeting the incoming communications were read. Some organizations, especially the C. S. P. S. (Czecho Slovak Benefit Societies), returned the resolutions unsigned, with the added comment that they did not wish to meddle in political affairs; other nationalistic societies and the Catholic societies returned the resolutions signed. A communication from the Bohemian-American Sokol referred to a certain member as not being authorized by it, to be a member of the Bohemian-American National Union, was tabled, because of the fact that anyone is eligible to membership in the National Union who subscribes to it's aims.</p>
   
   <p>The committee on Agitation Among other Nationalisties handed in a very favorable report, new delegates were welcomed and given copies of the resolutions for the purpose of obtaining signatures thereto.</p>
   <p>A committee was elected to make preparations for a mass meeting of all nationalities interested in the protest against the compulsory study of the German language in our public schools.</p>
   <p>For the purpose of joint conference other nationalities, especially the Scandinavians, Poles, Italians, French and Americans will be invited to attend.</p>
