   <p>The students of the Harrison High School, of which a considerable percentage are of Bohemian descent, are happy, because a fond wish of theirs has come to a happy culmination--they are moving today from an addition to the Farragut School into the new and beautiful edifice at 24th Street and Marshall Boulevard.</p>
   <p>The new school is indeed a palace which any university would be proud to occupy. Inside and out the building is perfect, and it contains everything that is necessary to induce a student to perform better work.</p>
   <p>Our Bohemian children attending the Harrison Technical High School will take advantage of the new facilities for education and character development which the school will offer.</p>

   <p>These students will strive for higher attainments and self-betterment, and they will endeavor to make themselves adherents of this great American nation, and still conduct themselves in a manner which will carry credit to the nation from which they are descended.</p>
