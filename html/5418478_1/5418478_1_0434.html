   <p>The Patronat Svobodomyslnych Ceskych Skol v Ciceru (Trustees of the Bohemian Free Thought Schools of Cicero), after many years of peaceful work, is undertaking a difficult task--the erection of a new building for the Bohemian Free Thought schools, the urgent need of which requires quick action. More than six hundred children, pupils of the Bohemian Free Thought school, are anxious to find out whether there is a possibility of learning the language of their parents in a regular school building, and not at places where the children suffer both moral and bodily harm.</p>
   <p>In the name of these children, the Patronat Svobodomyslnych Ceskych Skol v Ciceru is urging all friends of the Bohemian language to contribute toward the building fund in order that this project may be financially secure. We ask all the Bohemian organizations--they will receive our letter with the request for monetary help--not to lay this letter aside with the remark "Zase zebrota" (More beggary), but to help us to the best of their abilities.</p>
   
   <p>This project is for the benefit of our Bohemian children. It is for a new school building from which they cannot be ousted by any of the Cicero School Board moguls, as happened some time ago. At the same time we urge the organizations to send delegates to the meetings of the Patronat Svobodomyslnych Ceskych Skol v Ciceru regularly and to participate in this gigantic work which is ahead of us. Furthermore, we ask the Bohemian societies of Cicero to appoint the greatest possible number of collectors from their ranks and report their names to the secretary of the building committee.</p>
   <p>For the building committee of the Patronat Svobodomyslnych Ceskych Skol v Ciceru: Jan Sebek, chairman; Vaclav Kesl, secretary, 5321 West 25th Place, Cicero; Frantisek Suchy, treasurer, 5522 West 24th Street, Cicero, Illinois.</p>
