   <p>The following proclamation is directed to all the Bohemian Catholics and especially to the branch offices of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliances of Bohemian Catholics of America).</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as all others of our Catholic fellow citizens are doing their utmost to swell the ranks of their young people, and to increase the numbers of their adolescents who require a higher education, it would be an error on the part of our Bohemian Catholics were we to overlook the many possible ways and means by which we might encourage and compel not only our youth but also the parents of these, our young people, to turn their attention to this phase of our cultural life. If we omitted to do so, it would mean that we have no feeling for higher education. At the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>same time we do not wish to take it for granted that all of our countrymen are so wide awake regarding the necessity for higher education, and so enthusiastically committed to its pursuance, that any encouragement on our part would be unnecessary. If other foreign language groups find it necessary, we find it doubly so, for only then may we be entitled to representation in all of the important branches of American public life--when we have enough educated people among us to fill these posts. Our significance in American society will be in direct ratio to the higher education of our youth.</p>
   <p>We gladly admit that our sympathies for higher education are on the increase, judging from the perennial increase in the enrollment of our Czechoslovak students in our one and only Czechoslovak institution of higher learning--the Kollej Svateho Prokopa v Lisle, Illinois (Saint Procopius College of Lisle, Illinois), but we are also of the opinion that the increase thus far is not only not commensurate with the number of our countrymen in America, but like wise it is not representative of the present economic <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>security and social position of our people. And if it is asserted that many of our young people are enrolled in other institutions, such other institutions are either non-Catholic or foreign to our cultural interests. Neither one nor the other can bring us the desired results. If we expect to be of use to our nationality and have faith in this country we must bend all our efforts to give both a Catholic and a national education to our youth. This may be accomplished only in the Saint Procopius College.</p>
   <p>One may debate this statement and reach convincing proofs. There are some among our countrymen who either believe or who have been led to believe that, outside of the Bohemian language, our college at Lisle offers few subjects available in some of the institutions in the old homeland. The Czech students in our college are preparing for the public life of America, and receive training in all those subjects which are necessary for such a life. In addition to that it is expected that they become ardent Bohemian-American patriots.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>It goes without saying that the highest encouragement and counsel concerning all higher education of our youth may be given to our Czech settlers by our priesthood; and there can be no doubt about it that our priesthood is doing it. And yet, there are places which their voices cannot penetrate. It is in such places that our laity may work to good advantage. It is to these laymen that we are now directing our words in behalf of our nationality and our holy faith in the hope that they will use their eloquence during this month of May. Should they be successful in securing for us new applications for admission to the school for the ensuing scholastic year of 1922-1923, we ask them to be so good as to mail the names of the candidates to us. Not that the respective candidates could not do it themselves, but we wish to know how active our laymen are in this respect. We are always glad when we notice such activity, and the general Bohemian public will likewise be pleased to learn from our official publication of the Svaz that our people are active workers. It would please us very much to be able to announce at the expiration of the month of May that we have received many new applications for admittance to the Bohemian <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>college of Saint Procopius at Lisle.</p>
   <p>Below is an outline and a program of speeches and activities which are to take place in the halls of our parishes from May 21 to May 28, 1922: 1. A main address concerning the need for higher education. 2. Whereever possible, speeches by the students themselves will be given. 3. Writing assignments, having higher education for their theme, will be made in the higher grades of all of our parochial schools. 4. The best examples of such written work will be read aloud in classes. 5. Free debates and discussions concerning certain problems of higher education will be held.</p>
   <p>The above program will be carried out only in those places where the local priest assumes responsibility therefor, probably only in those parishes where higher educational classes obtain. In other parishes it will be left to the discretion of the parish priest who will be governed by such conditions and circumstances as arise in every parish.</p>
   <p>Hoping that each of us will give his very best service, we submit the above <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>ideas to our general Catholic public, and to our branch offices in particular, and bid Godspeed to the work.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku v Americe.</p>
