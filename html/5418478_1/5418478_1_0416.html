   <p>One of the best attended meetings of the Vojta Naprstek school patronage was held last evening in the upper hall of Sokol Chicago, on Kedzie Av. The reasons for the large attendance of the meeting were very weighty, not only because it was the annual meeting and election of officers was on the program, but because at this meeting, it was to be definitely decided as to when construction of the new school at 25th St. and Homan Av. is to be commenced.</p>

   <p>The meeting was called to order, at eight o'clock in the evening, by the chairman, Mr. R. Dusil. The secretary Mr. Otcovsky, read the minutes of the previous meeting, which were accepted as read. Bills were ordered paid and of the communications read, the one from the Association of Liberal (Free Thought) Schools was noted by the proper officers. The secretary then read the report of the committee for the New Year's Day celebration, in which he announced, that the receipts on that occasion amounted to $228.16 with disbursements of $113.10, resulting in a net profit of $115.06. This report was accepted and thanks voted to the committee. Mrs. Mazacova, for the Dobrocinny Krouzek Kalifornskych Dam (California Ladies Benevolent Circle), announced they are turning over for the benefit of the school, $300.00 from the proceeds of the masquerade <span class="page-break">\3</span>ball, given by them, and any further profit realized will be included in the final report. The women were thanked for such profitable work and the gift was accepted with expressions of gratitude. Then followed the reading of the names of newly elected delegates and of the amounts of the contributions sent in by various lodges. All newly elected delegates were then welcomed by the chairman.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the Board of Directors Mr. J. A. Jurena, then read a report of the activities of that body, pointing out, that all preparations for building have been completed and it is now up to the delegates to decide when construction of the new school shall start. From the report given by Mr. Jurena, we find the total assets of the Patronage amount to <span class="page-break">\4</span>$11,172.76, of which $11,100.00 is loaned on notes, leaving a balance of $72.76 with the treasurer. Because the largest part of the loaned amount is with the Kedzie Building &amp; Loan Association, a summary of about one hundred paid-up shares with that society was also read. Mention also was made of directors' meetings, where the bids of various contractors were discussed. The relatively low bids were given consideration and the directors strove to recommend Bohemian firms exclusively. According to the bids approved and received, the cost of construction will be about $25,011, and out of this sum, Mr. Jurena, announced for the directors, there is a possibility of saving about a hundred dollars. The report was accepted and then other matters of the evening were taken up.</p>

   <p>The chairman Mr. Dusil, made a summarized report of the activities of the past year, referring to the dispute about the construction of a building to cost more than $20,000. He gave the reasons why he protested against the construction of so expensive a building. This, of course, caused a short debate. Mr. V. Roubal, a former member of the Board of Directors, replied to the chairman's protest. However, at the request of the majority of those present that old wounds be not reopened, the debate ceased and the matter of bonds for the officers was taken up. Attention was called to the fact that the secretary of the Board of Directors was bonded for only $1,000, as against a bond of $5,000, for the bookkeeper, although all money passed through the hands of the former and not the latter. Consequently, according <span class="page-break">\6</span>to a motion made and carried, the bond of the secretary will be raised to $5,000, and the bookkeeper's reduced to $1,000. The bond of the chairman, $2,000, and that of the treasurer, $10,000, will remain as here-to-fore. With the completion of this matter, the most important business of the evening was taken up, namely, the election of directors. To the Board of Directors, which consists of nine members the following named persons were elected: Messrs. Dusil, Rys, Topinka, Otcovsky, Zednik, Sus, Stepanek and Mmes. Hrychova and Mazacova. Mr. Dusil was elected president. Mrs. Brychtova was named vice-president. Mrs. Stepanek was elected secretary. Mrs. Kar. Janecek was reelected bookkeeper and Mr. J. A. Jurena was reelected treasurer. The arrangement committee was appointed by the chairman <span class="page-break">\7</span>and is composed of Messrs., Rus, Zeman, and Mmes. Benes, Fencl and Rak. The auditing committee also was named by the chairman as follows: Mrs. Soucek, Mr. Vasak and Mr. D. Novak. Mr. Topinka and Mrs. Brychtova were elected delegates to the Association of Liberal (Free Thought) Schools.</p>
   <p>with this, the elections came to an end and on the motion of Mr. Topinka, it was decided by vote to begin building at once, the awarding of contracts to be left to the decision of the directors. This body will hold its meeting on Monday, at which time contracts will be signed and soon after that construction will begin. The new building of the Vojta Naprstek <span class="page-break">\8</span>School, upon its completion and dedication, will surely be the pride of all progressive Chicago Bohemians and those of Ceska Californie (Bohemian California) in particular. After the reading of the receipts of the evening $279.06, and disbursements of $157.25, the meeting was adjourned at a late hour.</p>
