   <p>Our Bohemian public, and our workingmen first of all, will back up to the utmost the striking employees of our surface car companies and elevated railways. Our workingmen will help as much as they possibly can to see that the men on strike get the fulfillment of their demands, and thus become assured of working conditions that will enable them to live like human beings, take proper care of their families, and improve living standards for themselves and those who are dependent on them.</p>
   <p>But right here we should like to address a request to the streetcar employees. We would ask them to begin at last to consider our Bohemian, Polish, and Slovak people who use the streetcars as equivalent to the public in the high-toned sections on the South and North Sides, so that there may be no more <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>complaints of a malicious and overbearing attitude toward people who, while not able to speak the English language correctly and fluently, are wide-awake workingmen and women, and, in case of necessity, will prove their mettle much better than many a "real" American. We hear many a countryman complaining of this or that abuse which he had to suffer at the hands of streetcar employees. But every one of the complainants is prompt in adding that he is too good a member of the working class of people to permit the matter to influence his friendly attitude toward the strike and the strikers.</p>
   <p>This strike will teach the streetcar employees to be good members of the brotherhood of workingmen, whose principles they will also follow after the strike is over, and which they will make evident in a decent treatment of immigrated workingmen who, in spite of their lack of knowledge of the English language, are brothers of all men in America who, like themselves, have to hire out their strength and skill for wages to capital.</p>
