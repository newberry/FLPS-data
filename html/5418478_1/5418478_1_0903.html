   <p>P.4--Some good advice on how to defeat the high cost of living comes to us from Governor Hadley of Missouri. That gentleman suggests raising cows and chickens, as he himself is doing, to eliminate the necessity of buying meat.</p>
   <p>While we dutifully acknowledge the suggestion given by this official, we offer for the sake of completeness an additional idea. We believe that to keep body and soul together a diet of Bohemian pheasant, Strassburg pates de foies gras, and Russian caviar would suffice.</p>
