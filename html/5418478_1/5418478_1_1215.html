   <p>Never before has May first, the holy day of international labor, been celebrated in a time more portentous than this year . . . . .</p>
   <p>The joyful celebration will reach a climax in Russia, where the peoples threw off the shackles of despotism, introduced a real government of the people, and are beginning to devote their time and energies to social rearrangement in a manner which will no doubt stimulate other nations to follow example . . . . .</p>
   <p>If the people of Austria and of Germany would succeed in attaining self-government, like the Russians, we could have peace at this very moment.</p>
