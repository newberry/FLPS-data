   <p>How sad is the present-day standpoint of the American workingmen. During the present period of strikes, conflict plays the chief role among the workers. One worker opposes another, as though he were an enemy, even though both are working for one purpose, for a living. Frankly, we must admit that the strike-breaker does not seek the opportunity to work for adventure; he is driven by the desparate struggle to live for a crust of bread, by anxiety for his family and children, who in many instances may be sick or dying at home of hunger and cold. His fellow-workers look upon him as upon a mangy goat. The question of strike-breakers is an important problem which will have to be solved by union labor. To increase wages and shorten the hours of labor seems to be the principal aim of Unions today. That is as it should be, but it apparently they have neglected to add a sufficient number of new workers, each time the period of labor is shortened, to balance the number of man-hours involved. Consequently the workers must expend greater effort in less time. In reality they have gained nothing. Unions will be obliged to care for the unemployed workers in order to accomplish their purpose.</p>
