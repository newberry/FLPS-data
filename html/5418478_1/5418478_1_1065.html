   <p>The Reply of Mr. A. Uzlik to Mr. Balvin and to the Anonymous Writer of "Who is damaging the Labor Movement" In the first place, Mr. Balvin, I am not an organizer of the Industrial Workers of the World and I did not arrive among the Czechs in the last fourteen days, for I have lived among them eighteen years and I have been active in the labor movement during this entire period. I never sought to gain personal or selfish advantages and my aims always were to aid and not to hinder this idealistic movement.</p>
   <p>I am a member of the working class and I can never advocate ideas which are injurious to this class. One of these is the idea being spread <span class="page-break">2</span>by Socialists, that only through political action can workingmen triumph. Every strike lost is an opportunity welcomed by them to confirm this false view.</p>
   <p>If the strike is won and higher wages obtained, they maintain that it means nothing because the capitalists will get it back through higher prices. The result of this false viewpoint is that these people endeavor to use every strike for the benefit of their political party. They are active in the union movement only for those reasons. The rottener the union organization, the better it suits their purposes. That's why they stick so tenaciously to the American Federation of Labor. At the last convention of the American Federation of Labor, eighty Socialists were present and they all voted for Gompers. In the Chicago Federation of Labor, not one Socialist protested against the acceptance of the agreement with Hart, Schaffner and Marx and to the last one they all voted for it. I have never knowingly lied <span class="page-break">3</span>and I again assert, that every accusation brought against Mr. Balvin, can be substantiated by any delegate to the conference. I was chairman of the last two meetings of the conference and know whereof I speak. Neither Trautman nor I forced ourselves among you. Trautman and Haywood were invited by the strikers to take charge of the strike. I was asked by Trautman, because he did not know the Czech language and thought that I would be of assistance in many respects. Your insinuation that we were more interested in the assessments than in the members, I reject as a common barefaced insult. We urge no one to become a member of the Industrial Workers of <span class="page-break">4</span>the World. We are open and above board, and say only what we think and nothing more.</p>
   <p>In so far as the anonymous article is concerned, in which I am censured for my membership in the American Federation and in the Painters Union, it will not dissuade me from my intention to point out the wanton corruption within them. That I write to newspapers which you proclaim as non-union is only your fault, not mine. When I sent you a communication for publication, you returned it to me. If your paper is so strictly a labor paper, why did you accept a full page ad from the ultra-capitalistic Tribune? In that advertisement the reading of the Tribune, which in the year 1886 recommended lead pills and strychnine for striking labor, <span class="page-break">5</span>was recommended to workingmen. It was not Hlasatel which was breaking the strike, but the corruption and unfitness of the Garment Workers' Union and the Federation of Labor, as you yourselves have acknowledged and to whom you are giving such stout aid.</p>
   <p>We have enough laws, more than are needed, but what we need is someone to enforce them. Inspectors allow themselves to be bribed, but labor organized into the right kind of unions will see to it that every work-room, every factory, every mine is safe for the health and life of the workers. Labor organized into an industrial union, will be the political power which will enforce these various laws for the safety of the workers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Labor will not allow itself to be murdered any more, as happened at the Cherry mine and other places. Being aware that it has the support of the entire force of the working class, organized into one union, it will never work where it constantly sees death before it. Labor in the present day craft unions has no power,no resistance, because every trade is for itself and the result of all this is strikes lost, and broken and the workingmen delivered to the mercies of more brutal treatment than before. Here is where you gentlemen of Spravedlnost should do your duty and criticize everything that is not fair; pay more attention to the struggles of workers in the factories, meanwhile, uncovering corruption in the labor <span class="page-break">7</span>movement, because that is far more important than to call attention to corruption in politics. Every strike lost indicates weakness, and lack of confidence of the workers in themselves, but every strike won means a step forward, an inclination to further struggle. Every raise in wages and shortening of hours of labor means better conditions for the workers.</p>
   <p>If Soravedlnost will work in this manner, then will it have the right to call itself a labor paper, but not before.</p>
   <p>Be consistent in the principles of Socialism and no one will criticize you. Aiding Rickert and others in their work and keeping Bohemian workers <span class="page-break">8</span>on strike, in order to help traitors, was certainly miserable conduct for a "labor" paper.</p>
   <p>I have read carefully every attack upon my accusations, published in that paper, but nowhere, I say, nowhere, did they disprove anything I charged and even if the writer of the anonymous article claims that Spravedlnost did not proclaim the first agreement with Hart, Schaffner and Marx as a big victory for tailoring workers, still he cannot erase it for it is printed there in large letters.</p>
