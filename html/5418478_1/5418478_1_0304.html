   <p>Chicago's Bohemian Sokol societies met at Pilsen Hall last night in order to make arrangements for a publicity campaign. The Bohemians demand that their native language be taught in schools of those districts which are largely populated by the Bohemians. A committee composed of V. Donat, Cyril Fiola, Joseph Dusek, Frank Chyna, and John Klaus was entrusted with the designing of a petition which will be submitted to the Chicago School Board at its next session. According to the demands of the Bohemian people, the petition will require that in schools which are attended by at least 50 percent of children of Bohemian descent, the instruction of Bohemian should be seriously considered by the Board.</p>
   <p>It was rumored that the entire Bohemian population of Chicago is giving its support to this movement. Mass meetings to further the cause are supposed to take place throughout Chicago within the next few days. The Bohemians insist that they have as good a right to their demands as has the German element of this city.</p>
