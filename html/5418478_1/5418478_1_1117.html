   <p>The news that the Sdruzeni Ceskych Krejcovskych Kontraktoru (Bohemian Tailoring Contractors' Association) has agreed to stop work in their shops and thus help in ending the strike in the near future has been received with a great deal of enthusiasm by the striking workers. Although some contractors were against this agreement and declared they would continue working for firms affected by the strike, the men on strike are confident that these contractors also will be made to stop working if the majority of other contractors will follow that policy. The men believe that contractors who refuse to stop working will provoke a strong feeling against themselves on the part of the public, which is overwhelmingly in sympathy with the workers. There are very few contractors who would want to hear the anger and loathing of their neighbors by helping the manufacturers to subdue the workingmen. The majority of contractors sympathize with <span class="page-break">2</span>the workers and not many of them will want to continue working under police protection in the neighborhood of honest and peace-loving people.....</p>
