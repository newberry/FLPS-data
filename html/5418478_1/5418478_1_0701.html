   <p>The liberal community Svobodna Obec is arranging this year, as in previous years, their special lectures in the hall of the Bohemian-English school. These lectures will be held every Lenten Sunday for the followers of free-thinking ideas, for the purpose of strengthening their consciousness that blind faith in erroneous public worship and oral prayers is only treachery and poison to the heart; that the real God is a sense, the known laws, the truth and the love of humanity.</p>
   <p>We suppose the welfare of humanity is more dependent upon good sense than upon errors, upon light rather than darkness, and that should be sufficient motive for everyone who has not yet joined, to join one of our lodges now, which are always open to progress and education.</p>
   <p>The speaker of the liberal community Mr. Frank B. Zdrubek chose this year a very interesting theme, "Saviors of the Nation," which he will develop very accurately, as always.</p>

   <p>The community Svobodna Obec is working not for profit, but for recognition, and its only objective is to spread the light before these people who are still blindfolded.</p>
