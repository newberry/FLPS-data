   <p>The Czecho-Slavonic Taxpayers' Association of Cicero invites the public to attend the meeting which will be held at 5504 West 23rd Street, May 6, 2 P. M. New members will be introduced there. The membership fee is 25 cents and the monthly dues are only 10 cents. However small these amounts are, they enable the Association to obtain considerable results concerning improvements within the community. Much has also been accomplished in the direction of national endeavor.</p>
   <p>Two lots have been purchased for the Czech Liberal (Free Thought) School, and five thousand dollars expended for the amelioration of the grounds around it. The Association has supported the Sokol (gymnastic society), <span class="page-break">\2</span>and also the Czech Workingman's Home in every way. These are good reasons why the Cicero Czechs should take an active interest in this taxpayers' body.</p>
