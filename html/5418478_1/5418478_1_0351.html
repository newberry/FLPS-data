   <p>assessments of properties.</p>
   <p>A lively debate followed his report, and it was suggested that the school board work hand in hand with the town council in order that correct assessments of properties be made. It was agreed that a committee be delegated to interview the board of review on October 10 to discuss the correct increase of assessments. The meeting adjourned before midnight, after being admonished by the president to attend the next meeting in an equally large number, and not to forget to come to the banquet which the Spolek has arranged for Saturday, October 21, in the Karel Jonas Sokol hall.</p>
