   <p>The Conference of the Women's Missionary Society, which was held Tuesday, at the First Reformed Church at Hastings Street, can be called a great success. Although the weather was bad, in the hearts of the hundreds present the sun was shining. All were gathered together to listen to reports in the interests of the mission. Three meetings were held, one in the morning, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. The speakers were well prepared. The great work of the mission, domestic as well as foreign, was discussed seriously.</p>
   <p>The speakers were, among others, Dr. Steunenberg of Roseland, Mrs. John S. Bussing, Mrs. Allen, Miss O. H. Lawrence and Dr. Ida Scudder. The first spoke on "The Returning Influence of Mission Work." Mrs. Bussing, Mrs. Allen, and Miss Lawrence spoke on "The great need in America, as well as in Foreign Cohntries, for the teaching of the Gospel." Dr. Ida Scudder (a name very dear amongst Dutch circles), gave a touching message about mission work in the Dutch-East- Indies.</p>

   <p>There were representatives of eleven cities, and everyone returned home satisfied, with the wish in their hearts, that this conference will be followed soon by another.</p>
