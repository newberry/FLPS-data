   <p>Two years ago Messrs. Christ Kriusenga, H. Van der Ploer, and John Broekema planned to start a club of old Dutch settlers who arrived in this country before the year 1870.</p>
   <p>Their purpose was to give a dinner every year at a local club, and then to revive the experiences and struggles of these pioneers. Their plan was a great success.</p>
   <p>Last year this scheme was carried out again with such great success that all people present decided to establish a permanent club, with a meeting every year.</p>
   <p>A committee was chosen for a year with Dr. D. Birkhoff, as President; Mr. Sietse de Vries, treasurer; Mr. J. Tillusacher, secretary. After a year another committee will be chosen.</p>

   <p>The plan to take as members only people who settled in this country before 1870 has been changed. All Dutchmen, who are American citizens, of good conduct, and who have lived here for at least 15 years, can become members.</p>
   <p>For the third time this celebration will take place on December the 6th, our Santa Claus day, at the Bismarck Hotel. We are expecting a large crowd. The speakers will be Dr. D. Birkhoff, Mr. A. Klooster, Dr. Hagens, Consul General Geo. Birkhoff, Jr., and Dr. N. Boer. Undoubtedly it will be another great success.</p>
