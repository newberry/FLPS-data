   <p>This organization celebrated last Thursday evening, its annual feast in the church on 14th Street, a feast that will long be remembered. Everything went unusually well. The church was filled by those who were interested, and no wonder! This organization does something and does that something well. It numbers twenty-nine members and at least two hundred beneficiary members. Anyone can be a beneficiary member, who pays at least $1 per year. That this organization of young girls can and will work and is true to the motto, "He who gives to the poor, loans to the Lord," has been proved during the past year by the setting aside of $25, for the foreign mission. And this year it has set aside $200, for the same purpose. The donations pay for the support of two Indian children in the mission station, Rehoboth, N. M. That is indeed an example worthy of following. The administration of that Society consists of the Rev. E. Breen, Honorary President; H. Bos, President, Miss Annie Mensinger, Vice-President, Miss Nellie Huiner, Secretary, Miss Dina Balk, Treasurer, and Miss Hatty Balk, Librarian.</p>
