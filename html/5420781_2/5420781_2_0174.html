   <p>That the Jewish mission of the Christian Reformed Church in Chicago is making progress, can be seen by the resistance shown last Monday. While the consistory was in session, the church and mission house was attacked by a number of Jewish boys. They hurled a number of empty bottles against the buildings. Some of the bottles went through the windows of the church.</p>
   <p>The police were called and the meeting was resumed.</p>
