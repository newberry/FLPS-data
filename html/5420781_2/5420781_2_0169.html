   <p>The well known William Jennings Bryan, is busy nowadays awakening the Christian part of our people to the religious character of the teachings of the public schools. Bryan declares that the teaching of the Bible had to make way for the teaching of evolution.</p>
   <p>We do not plead for the restoration of the Bible, but for strict neutrality as far as religion goes. His speech on this subject recently, has cut deeply, so deep in fact, that in the Legislature of the State of Kentucky, a bill was prepared, which would make the teaching of the evolution theory a law violation punishable by a fine of from $50 to $500, or a sentence of from 10 days to one year in prison. Different leaders, men of schooling among them, presidents of universities, have disapproved of this bill. They all Bryan backward and ignorant.</p>
