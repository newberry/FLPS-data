   <p>The Hollanders, who visited Mt. Auburn Cemetery on Decoration Day, were all well pleased with the place set aside for the Dutch, and the satisfaction showed not only in what was said, but was proved by four persons who signed contracts for the purchase of a lot. A large number visited the place, and witnessed the turning over of the three lots by the Company to the six congregations on the West side; as a burial place for their poor.</p>
   <p>A short and fitting speech was given by Rev. Van der Noald in English and by Rev. J. O. Vos in the Dutch language, when accepting this gift.</p>
