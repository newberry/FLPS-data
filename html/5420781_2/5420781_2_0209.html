   <p>Last Sunday was a solemn day for the Northwestern Reformed Congregation. The Reverend P. Braak, the mission teacher, who had worked among us for about three months, bade farewell to the congregation. He has gone to Lynden, Washington, where he was sent by the Board of the Home-Missions.</p>
   <p>After a cordial address by the departing minister, the congregation, in appreciation of his work, sang while standing up the last verse of Psalm 134: "Dat's Heeren Zegen op U dall !" ("May God's Blessing Descend Upon You!")</p>
   <p>The Board of the Home Mission received three requests for the services of the Reverend Braak. One from the Northwestern Reformed Church, one from Lynden, Washington, and one from Indiana. The Board decided to send him to Lynden, where he himself had founded a congregation some time ago.</p>

   <p>This Congregation at present numbers about sixty families.</p>
   <p>There is no need to say that the Northwestern Reformed Congregation was very sorry to see Reverend Braak leave.</p>
