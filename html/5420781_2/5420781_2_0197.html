   <p>The missionary conference held last week, in the church of the First Reformed congregation of Englewood, was a real success. The meetings, especially the evening sittings, were well attended, and we are convinced that in many people the conference has awakened a new enthusiasm for the mission.</p>
   <p>The morning sessions were under the leadership of Mr. H. Stuit, and the evening sessions under the direction of Mr. Teninga. The speakers were Reverend M. Flipse, Reverend W. Van Kersen, secretary of the Board of Foreign Missions for the Western District; Missionary R. L. Scudder of India, Reverend H. P. Schuurmans, Missionary A. Pieters of Japan, and Mr. W. T. Demarest, secretary of the Board of Domestic Missions.</p>
   <p>Missionary Pieters emphasized the influence of the missions in the far East, and said on that occasion, that the annexation of Korea by Japan was for the good of the missionary work and benefits the Koreans in a spiritual way, because by annexation this land has been opened to Christianity.</p>
