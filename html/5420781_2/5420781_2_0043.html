   <p>In comparison with other groups, the Hollanders in Chicago have made for themselves a good record in the recent American Red Cross campaign. Although more committees could have been appointed, those that were appointed did very good work, for which the president, Dr. J. A. Riedel is very thankful. The churches in particular did very good work.</p>
   <p>The First Reformed Church of Chicago for example brought in $200.00. Pretty work... The total of the five churches plus the gatherings of other committees amounted to $600.00. Among the busy workers the pastors deserve honorable mention...Dr. Riede said that the results are above expectations.</p>
