   <p>Today (Thursday) the inauguration of the church building of the Reformed Congregation of Summit will take place. As people know this new church is a neat, artistic building, which is a credit to the architects as well as to the congregation.</p>
   <p>The solemn inauguration services will take place in the afternoon at 2:30. The Rev. J. Steunenberg of Roseland will be the principal speaker with an address in the Dutch language.</p>
   <p>In the evening at 7:30 a service in English will be held, at which the speakers are the Reverends J. Fan Peursen and C. S. Nettinga.</p>
   <p>That the church will be filled to capacity on this occasion needs not to be mentioned for the prevailing interest is very great.</p>
