   <p>One of the regulations of the immigration service specifies that the immigrant must have in his possession, upon entering the country, a sufficient sum of money to make it reasonably sure that he will not soon become a public charge. This regulation is being strictly enforced and the new Commissioner of Immigration at Ellis Island, Mr. Williams, has stated that twenty-five dollars is the lowest sum qualifying a single immigrant for admission. Considerably more is required in the case of an entire family. Many Dutch in America are expecting relatives or others from the Netherlands. They will perform an act of kindness to their friends if they inform them beforehand that this rule is now enforced at Ellis Island. The immigrants may be able to pass every physical and mental test, and yet if he cannot produce twenty-five dollars, which is the minimum requirement, he is scheduled for deportation on the next out-going ship. Those who desire more specific information may secure it from Rev. Sydney Zandstra, missionary of the Reformed Church in America at Ellis Island. His address is Lodi, New Jersey, and he is at the service of all Dutch immigrants and their friends. Signed: J. Brownlee Voorhees, Corresponding Secretary of the Board of Domestic Missions of the Reformed Church in America.</p>
