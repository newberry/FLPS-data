   <p>Roseland, Pullman, and Kensington all border on Lake Calumet. The Governor of the State of Illinois, Hon. Len Small, has signed the law which will make Lake Calumet, a world port. Mr. Benton Kleeman is the sponsor of this law, which, with the help of Speaker Dahlberg, after years of struggle, was signed by the Governor.</p>
   <p>Both Mr. Kleeman and Speaker Dahlberg are Roselanders and Hollanders. We hope that they may see the fruits of their labor and see world ships sail into Calument Harbor.</p>
