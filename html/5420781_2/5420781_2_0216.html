   <p>Last Friday, April 15, we received notice, that our beloved missionary, Dr. Otte was very sick. A second notice followed, in which it was stated that he had fallen a victim of the"Plague".</p>
   <p>Dr. Otte was not an old man. He was only 49 years old, his work was blessed and he was the founder of two hospitals. Of those,he was the inspiring and managing power. The ten thousand patients are regretting his loss.</p>
   <p>His widow and children are plunged into the greatest sorrow, all of our sympathy goes to them.</p>
   <p>The Mission in Amoy,is grieved over the departure of the man, who was such a inspiration in their work and the Reformed Church mourns the loss of one of its most renowned missionaries.</p>
