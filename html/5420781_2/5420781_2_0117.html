   <p>Next Wednesday evening, August 31st, the Chicago Section of the General Netherlands' League will hold a general meeting to celebrate the Queen's birthday. Because last year the hall had been too small, this time a larger one has been rented.</p>
   <p>The Queen's birthday is for our Dutch people a day of national rejoicing. It is a pity that we have been unable so far to make of this day a General Netherlanders' Day. It could be celebrated by all the Netherlanders irrespective of political and religious affiliations. The time for it has come now. The only thing we need is a good leader, who knows how to present this fact.</p>
   <p>But in the meantime, let us make use of the opportunity offered by the General Netherlands' League, and spend the evening together at Pilsen Hall, Ashland Avenue and 18th Street.</p>
