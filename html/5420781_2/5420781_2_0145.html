   <p>The Third Christian Reformed Congregation, of which Rev. J. J. Weersing is Pastor, has held a campaign to gather funds for the expenditures that must be made in connection with the building of a new church, and the placing of an organ. Although the full quoto was not reached, the collections were exceptionally good. Monday evening $1,547.00 and Tuesday evening $405.00 were contributed, for the building fund and Thursday evening $1,781.00, for the organ.</p>
   <p>This congregation has already built a parsonage and, in that way, will soon have a beautiful group of buildings.</p>
