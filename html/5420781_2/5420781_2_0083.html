   <p>The Dutch society, Excelsior, celebrated its 30th anniversary on March 31. Because of a slight illness, Mr. A. Heis, first president and organizer of the society, could not be present, and for that reason Mr. I. Emmering, their first secretary, took the floor and pictured briefly the history of our society's life. There is evidence that the society is in a prosperous condition. There were some recitations, but Mr. T. N. Huizenga, agent of the Cunard Line, is deserving of most of the praise. It was a fine advertisement to those who also have decided to make the planned excursion under the leadership of Mr. Huizenga. Truly, this evening will not be forgotten very easily.</p>
   <p>We enjoyed his beautiful film showing a trip through Europe under the direction of the Cunard Line with views of London and Paris and a trip along the Rhine including scenes of Schweringer, Olkmaar and Volendam.</p>
