   <p>The West Side Reformed Congregation welcomes seven new members this week, two by confession and five by letter. This brings the total of members to seventy-three.</p>
   <p>When through the initiative of some Hollanders residing in Cicero, the West Side Reformed Congregation was organized on December 28, 1911, thirty-three members joined the church. The membership was increased during the first year of its existence by forty people. Surely sufficient proof that there was indeed need for a new congregation in that neighborhood.</p>
