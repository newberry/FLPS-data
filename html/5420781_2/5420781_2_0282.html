   <p>We announce with pleasure that Queen Wilhelmina has appointed Mr. C. Van Ryn van Alkemade as Vice Consul of the Netherlands.</p>
   <p>The Dutch population of Chicago is increasing steadily, and it is therefore just that we should have a Vice Consul, besides the Consul General Birkhoff.</p>
   <p>Mr. Van Ryn van Alkemade's address is 69 Dearborn Street, where the Vice-Consulate is established.</p>
