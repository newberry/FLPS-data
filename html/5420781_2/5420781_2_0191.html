   <p>We understand that the First Christian Reformed Congregation of 14th St. holds this week, on Wednesday evening, February 5, a meeting in order to determine what to do in connection with the sale of church properties, and the purchase or building of another place of worship.</p>
   <p>There is a rumor that the congregation is planning to buy the properties of the German Zion's-Church, at the northeast corner of Ashland Avenue and Hastings Street. Concerning that, the Rev. C. A. Koenig, pastor of that congregation, writes in the January number of the Evangelische Gemeindeblatt, a German ecclesiastical monthly for Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <p>"People are wondering at present if it should not be better to sell our church properties, and go where 'Israel's hosts do not push us aside.'"</p>
