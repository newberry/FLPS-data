   <p>We were requested to announce that on May 14th, there will be offered to the Committee and delegates to the Presbyterian Synod to be held at Des Moines, Iowa, an honor dinner. The delegates will be in Chicago next week.</p>
   <p>The dinner is important for us, because many Dutchmen will also take part. As we all know, much work is being done lately for the unification of the Reformed (Dutch Reformed) Church with the Presbyterians and some of the delegates labor especially for that purpose. And that is especially the reason why they wish to honor them with a dinner on their trip through Chicago.</p>
