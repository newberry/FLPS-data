   <p>The Daughters society of the First Christian Reformed Congregation of 14th Street, is again ready to take up their annual collection at the homes of the members, for their two Indian Children whom they are supporting. They are Clarisa Pierson and Edward Breen.. This society can indeed be called a Missionary society. Within the past year they have collected more than $300 for school and mission.</p>
   <p>This year they hope to surpass this figure and expect that the members of the Congregation, show their appreciation by lending them their strong support.</p>
