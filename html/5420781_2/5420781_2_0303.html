   <p>Many of our Holland people who came here when they were young, or were born here from Holland parents are nearly all lost in the American pot of assimilation. Many of them are strangers to the so beautiful Holland language, of the characteristics common to them and of the ways of the Holland nation, although they feel, sometimes unconsciously, are inner love for Old Holland, through coming in contact with something intimately Dutch in the midst of their busy American life. One of these is our friend Mr. Holgar De Roode. Born in Holland, from a noble family he came here as a very young boy. At the age of 15 he studied the prosperous insurance business in all its branches, at which he worked for half a century. For ten years he was general manager at Chicago, of the Providence, Washington, and other insurance corporations.</p>

   <p>In 1902, he published a pamphlet entitled, "Some Facts for Investors in Fire Insurance Shares", that in insurance circles was a recognized as an authority. Mr. De Roode is one of the past presidents of the well-known, Holland Society, located at Chicago. Outside of his knowledge of the all important insurance business, he practices fine arts, and counts his friends among the most famous teachers and musicians of the land. In the spring of 1921, Mr. De Roode paid a visit to France, England, Germany, and the Netherlands. He left Chicago in April and saw it again early in December. In london he met several times the Netherlands ambassador, Mr. R. de Marees van Swinderen, who represented the Netherlands during the administration of Theodore Roosevelt who is also of Holland blood.</p>
   <p>When he was in Holland and admired the portraits of Frans Wals, he saw a tablet of which he wrote down the inscription. This tablet came from an Old Man's Home of which a certain Van Mater was director in the year 1723. Because of the age of the verse he thought it appropriate to copy it for me and herewith I give it to you:</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>O happy he, who, on world's ragged seas</p>
   <p>Courageously endures calamities -</p>
   <p>Yes happy he who counts no perils, knows no fright</p>
   <p>But lives his aging years in sweet delight.</p>
   <p>Upon a quiet road, midst grace and careless ease,</p>
   <p>Abiding death with a kiss of glorious peace you taste his bliss so sweet.</p>
   <p>You old and happy folk,</p>
   <p>Who in this home sustained, of cares not known nor spoke,</p>
   <p>But laughed and cried, made light of mortals strife</p>
   <p>Acknowledging thanks with a most blessed life.</p>
   <p>To the Fathers good and just, who with a noble heart</p>
   <p>Sustained your tottering feet, to God your soul impart.</p>
   <p>Your years enumerate, your life ebbs gently out,</p>
   <p>And creeping to the grave you pass the human route.</p>
