   <p>The girls society of the First Christian Reformed Congregation, on 14th Street, decided on their last meeting to appropriate $200.00 for the support of two Indian Children at Rehobot, their names being Clarisa Pearson and Edward Breen, whom they decided to care for permanently.</p>
   <p>They also will donate $10.00 to the Home Missions, $10.00 To Median Missions, $50.00 to the Christian School and to spend $25.00 for the purchase of new books for the society. This society was fortunate this year to receive $259.60 from their sponsors, while the advertisements in the program of the recently held entertainment brought in the sum of $85.00.</p>
