   <p>On August 31, the birthday of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, the Roseland division of the General Netherland Union will give an exceptionally interesting program at Palmer Park, 111th Street, and Indiana Avenue. The Dutch Tri-Color, which is honored by all nations, will wave next to the American Tri-Color.</p>
   <p>Small courageous, God-protected Holland was the only nation, worthy of mention, which had the courage to oppose the war God of this age of civilization and may God keep her firm in the times of popular perplexity as at this hour. Holland, courageous, charitable, richly represented in Roseland. Seventy-three years ago, a few Hollanders settled on the prairies of Illinois. Those few multiplied to a population of about 10,000. Most of them are alike as to religion, honoring the God of Heaven in nine churches.</p>
   
   <p>They built two schools in which they taught their children to be genuine American citizens, who, worship the God of Creation and turn their backs to Darwinism. Not alone do the Hollanders speak through their churches, but the well-known "Ave", is witness to their thrift and adventure, testifying to their clean and well located stores.</p>
   <p>Roseland was insignificant without the Hollanders, and America became what it is, not because of Johnny Bull, nor of the glory of Marianette, but of the world famed quality and sacrificing ability of the stubborn Dutchman.</p>
