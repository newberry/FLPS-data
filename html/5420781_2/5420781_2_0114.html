   <p>The meeting convoked last week by the Chicago Section of the General Netherlands' League to celebrate the birthday of the Queen of Holland was in every way a great success.</p>
   <p>The hall was beautifully decorated and the attendance was good. The speeches were listened to with the utmost attention, and everybody went home satisfied.</p>
   <p>The meeting was so successful on account of the cooperation given by the music-corps "Harmonic" and by Mr. and Miss Rynberk.</p>
