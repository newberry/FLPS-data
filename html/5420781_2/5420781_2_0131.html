   <p>The Chicago Division of the "General Dutch League," held its annual general meeting, last Wednesday, as advertised. The attendance was fairly good, although it could have been better. Even though the number of those attending was not large, their spirit for the worthy purpose of the League was much greater and each of those present showed by word and deed that they had resolved to work continuously to achieve that purpose. Two officers had to be chosen, a President and a Vice-President. For President H. Berends was re-elected and for Vice-President, the Rev. E. Breen, in place of H. U. Masman, the retiring member. The report of the Treasurer showed a net balance of $8 for the year. The report of the Secretary was very encouraging. From that we report the following: It is nearly two years since your reporter came from Michigan to Chicago. In Michigan he was a member of the Grand Rapids division, which formed a part of the "Western Branch D", of the "General Dutch League". When he arrived here, he found no division, and he felt as though he were missing something. Through correspondence with the Board of Directors he saw the possibility of organizing a independent division for Chicago. He spoke about that with some of his friends, with the result that on May 29th, a meeting was held for that purpose in Ruehl's Hall. On this first meeting, nineteen persons showed their readiness to become members of the new division. Although the necessary twenty members to form an independent <span class="page-break">2</span>division was not reached, there was no doubt that on a following meeting there would be more than enough. For this reason it was resolved to meet again in the near future. On June 8th we met again, this time in the hall at 535 Blue Island Ave. Three new members joined and so our membership rose to twenty-two, and our infant was born on June 8th, 1905. A Constitution and by-laws were made up, and the name, "Division Chicago of the General Dutch League" accepted. It was decided to hold another meeting as soon as possible and this took place on June 21st. On the occasion of this meeting we gained another new member, and a permanent Board was chosen consisting of the following gentlemen: Berends, Masman, Jacobsma, De - Boer and Holstein. Since that time, proceedings have gone on in the regular way. The Board has met seven times. On August 31st, (Queens Day), a general meeting was held in which all could participate. This meeting was well attended and could be called very successful. In the press, the Board defended the language and the honor of our Nation, as, among others, in a Dutch paper, that had the temerity to say that "the Dutch language was a luxury," in the Chicago Daily News, which declared that The Hague was the capitol of the Netherlands. Regular correspondence was had with the central Board of Directors. It recognized us as an independent self-supporting division and served us by giving help and advice. so for my report. Let us prepare, with the greatest of effort, to carry on as good citizens of the United States, those ideals, the American life by which our nation is known. And this we cannot do except by working in unison, strong efforts, <span class="page-break">3</span>and true perseverence. When we do this, we can extort respect from our fellow -citizens, and they will also recognize us as a nation, and why not? Our past is glorious, but our present, also is not to be overlooked. To mention only a few things for instance: Our artists Mesdag, Bosman, Israels. Are they not famous? And are not our Dutch engineers being given preference in foreign countries? For example: De Ryke, in China. and what is the reason that we should not be able to do something here? Why is there no course at the Chicago University in Dutch history and literature? Why could not a Dutch Chamber of Commerce flourish here as well as elsewhere? Why... but I end with the wish that we all have the feeling that we can amount to something here, if we insist. The "Division" now has a total membership of thirty. The number should be three hundred. Apply for membership to the Secretary, H. Jacobsma, 620 W. 14th Place - Chicago.</p>
