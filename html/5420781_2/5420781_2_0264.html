   <p>John R. Dos Passos of New York, thinks that suffrage has to be separated from citizenship. Strangers must be naturalized without giving them the right to vote, or other words, he only likes to give suffrage to strangers, who by the time of their arrival in America, have full command of the English language.</p>
   <p>In this manner only people who are born in America, and immigrants from Great-Britain and its colonies would be able to get the right to vote. All the others, also people like Mr. Nelson Morris, now deceased, and other prominent manufacturers, could become citizens, pay taxes, and assist the welfare of this country, but they could not secure the voting franchise.</p>
   <p>If this would pass, the seat of government should properly be in London, with a branch-office at Newport.</p>
