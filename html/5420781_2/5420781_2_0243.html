   <p>Mayor Busse refused to listen to the petition from some inhabitants in the neighborhood of Madison and Jefferson Streets, to forbid the religious meetings, which were held there during the last couple of days in the open.</p>
   <p>"If you people can stand the electric pianos in the saloons," the Mayor said; "than I do not understand, why these religious meetings are bothering you". And that was the end.</p>
   <p>We think the Mayor is right.</p>
