   <p>Dr. Wm. D. McMillan, assistant professor of the section of Astronomy at the University of Chicago, declared last week in a lecture that according to his opinion Adam and Eve have never existed and that biblical history has therefore simply to be looked upon as an anecdote and to be bracketed with the mythology of the heathens, as for instance that of Greece.</p>
   <p>The doctor said that it was impossible for him to accept the bibical history regarding the first human couple as the truth because it is in conflict with the evolution dogma which is recognized by <span class="page-break">2</span>science. According to the evolution dogma, he said, it is impossible that the human race commenced only 3000 years ago.</p>
   <p>What a little knowledge possesses the egotistical human being!</p>
   <p>If it is true what the professor said about the human race only existing 3000 years according to the Bible, then he must have never read the Bible. This year, according to the Jewish race, is the year 5674, and according to the best historians, 5917. According to these records the human race has existed for nearly 6000 years, and not 3000, as the professor claims, according to biblical history.</p>

   <p>But those two or three thousand years do not change the matter. When will the time come that people will be convinced that the God of heavens, who provides for all the universe, has the power to create that same universe, in a twinkling of the eye, in a form and condition as if it had already existed millions of years?</p>
