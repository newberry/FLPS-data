   <p>On Monday night, December 12, Jakob Bos died at the home of his daughter and his son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. N. Roelfsema, of 1811 Laflin Street. The old gentleman had buried his wife less than a year ago, after being married nearly fifty-eight years. Mr. Bos had been indisposed for the last two months, but only for the last eight days before he died was illness considered serious. Four children, Mr. Henry Bos, Mrs. Mary Tibma, Mrs. Minnie Roelfsema, and Mr. Herman Bos, survive him, and thirteen grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p>
   <p>The funeral service was held on Wednesday morning, December 14, in the First Christian Reformed Church on 14th Street. The interment was at Forest Home Cemetery. The Reverend S. S. Van der Heide conducted the services.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bos was born on January 10, 1841, at Meeden in the province of Groningen, the Netherlands. In 1872 he came with his wife and three children to America and settled in Chicago. It was just after the big fire, when hands enough <span class="page-break">2</span>could not be found to rebuild the city. Of the three children whom they had brought from the old country one preceded Mr. Bos into eternity, and here in America their marriage had been blessed with two more children.</p>
