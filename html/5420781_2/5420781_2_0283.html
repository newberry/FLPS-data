   <p>The Dutch East Indies section of the General Netherlands League requests photographs of places into which Dutch life has been transplanted, or where one finds particular manifestations of the industry, the science, or the art of the Netherlands.</p>
   <p>In order to fulfill the purpose of these photographs, it is recommended that the senders, as far as it is in their power, explain the pictures by written comments. Wherever possible, illuminate the photograph with interesting details and brief statistics,--in short, with everything necessary to enhance the appreciation of the picture exhibited.</p>
   <p>The Dutch East Indies section of the League will make lantern slides of these photographs and will deliver propaganda lectures illustrated by the slides in order that people in the Dutch East Indies may become acquainted with Dutch life <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in foreign countries,--in this case, in America.</p>
   <p>The Chicago section of the General Netherlands League is backing up this affair and will gladly take care of all photographs received; it will send them later on to the Dutch East Indies.</p>
   <p>Send your photographs to the office of Onze Toekomst or to Mr. H. Jacobsma, 1449 West Fourteenth Place.</p>
   <p>For the Chicago section of the General Netherlands League,</p>
   <p>The Board of Directors</p>
