   <p>There is hardly a country in the entire world, whose citizens are more cosmopolitan than Holland. The growth of the overseas trade and colonization, as history will tell, without doubt the main reasons that a large number of Hollanders, large in proportion to the population of the Motherland, are spread over the entire world. No matter where you go, to South America, China, to British India, Russia, or anywhere else you will find this small nation represented. Yet you will find those places no Holland colony as you would find an Italian or British.</p>
   <p>The Hollander who settles himself on foreign soil becomes a personality. He adjusts himseld to the customs and unites himself with the people of the land that he wishes to make his own. He is enabled to do that by the training received in his youth. From boyhood he has accustomed himself to look outside of the borders of his own small land into the world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>He was trained in languages and trade and in the habits and temperament of other people. This makes it easy the first step in his foreign so-journ and whereas that is still much to learn, the foundation is laid. As a result of these factors and possibly some others which are in close relation with the unique character and habits of the people, there are no close ties between the Hollanders abroad and the homeland, which almost entirely disappears in his children. Wherever they settle they make good industrious citizens, who honor the laws of the land. Yet there exists a tie to hold them even if it is not the language itself although there are in the United States, 26 Holland newspapers. Even if they like to read the news in the Holland language, everybody reads the American daily newspapers besides.</p>
   <p>It is their born love of freedom and their unconquerable wish to make their own way and be ruled by those whom he himself elects, and his deep rooted respect for law and order. Is it a wonder then that so many Hollanders who left their place of birth, settled in the United States of America with people whose ideals are so much like their own? And is it a wonder that when the call came to defend that country against force in the Great War, <span class="page-break">3</span>that cooperation, unity and loyalty was assured, by this scattered population?</p>
   <p>And now again have those ideals, so dear to every Hollander emerged victorious, but even now we are not finished with our task. The big victory in which we all rejoiced, must be made a complete success and therefore we must still cooperate with the government, whose protection and freedom we enjoy and help it to overcome the post-war obligations...</p>
