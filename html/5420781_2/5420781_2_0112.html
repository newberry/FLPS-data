   <p>On April 1, Alva lost Den Briel. (Den Briel was the first town to surrender to the conqueror, Alva). Yes sir - it was 350 years ago that this feat was accomplished, but that day will forever live as one of the weightiest and most touching happenings in the history of the Netherlands. No - in the history of the entire world! In the Netherlands, this week is one of celebration. The Tricolor and Orange will wave from balcony and tower, because the Netherlands never forgets its history nor the deeds of God. They do not forget how, with a strong hand and mighty arm, they were liberated from Spain, and placed in the row of world powers, and made their fathers looked up to by all the other powers. That is why the Netherlands celebrate.</p>
   <p>Is it a wonder that the ring of our men's societies decided not to let this happening go by unnoticed. And do you not say with me that the entire Dutch population of Chicago joins in the plan to celebrate this important happening, Thursday evening, in the Church of the First Christian Reform Congregation, at 71st Street.</p>

   <p>That is the central point. Everyone can get there from Roseland, the West Side, and even outside of the city. Preparations are made to receive a large crowd. Dr. Jan Van Lonkhuizen will be the main speaker. Just the man for such an occasion. The music will be furnished by the Roseland Orchestra. It will be a genuine Holland-American evening. It is our duty, as descendants of a people great and strong through fearlessness, and as American citizens of Holland blood, to attend.</p>
   <p>No one should say, "What do I care about Holland and what do I care about Den Briel." We care for Holland very much, and we care about Den Briel. That will be clear to us at that meeting. It is not a shame, but an honor to be a descendant from the Cradle of Liberty.</p>
