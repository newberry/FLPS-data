   <p>At the meeting of the Second Christian Reformed Church at Englewood, last Thursday, April 14th, Dr. Oltmans of Japan, and Mr. Gelmer Kuiper of Grand Rapids, were speakers. And at the request of the Mission Society for Men of the First Christian Reformed Community, representatives of both Reformed Churches,and of the Christian Reformed Church at Englewood, held a meeting Monday night in the basement of the Church at 71st Street to elect representatives for the Laymen's Missionary Association Conference, which will be held at the end of this month, and,if possible, for the General Congress of this organization, to be held in May.</p>
   <p>The President of the above mentioned Mission Society for Men gave an explanation of the purpose of the Laymen's Missionary Association. It proved, that the vestry of the First Reformed Congregation had already selected Dr. Nettinga, to represent that congregation at both, the Conference, and the Congress.</p>

   <p>The people present decided to nominate further as representatives: Dr. J. Brinkman, G. J. Haan, and Mr. L. Holstein.</p>
   <p>Shortage of space prevents us at this time to say more about the motion of the Laymen's Missionary Association, but we are hoping to find later an opportunity to do it.</p>
   <p>We heard that nearly all congregations of the Christian church are participating in this matter.</p>
