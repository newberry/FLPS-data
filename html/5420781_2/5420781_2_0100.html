   <p>The festive meeting of our Netherlands' Society, "Eendracht Maakt Macht" (In Union is Strength), celebrated the closing of the season, and it shall be remembered by all the people who were present, for a long time. The Society had many friendly meetings, but at this one it seemed, everyone did his utmost to make it a wonderful success. A good program was carried out. The plays satisfied the guests so well that it would be unfair to mention anybody in particular.</p>
   <p>The only exceptions were the songs, and instrumental performances of the ladies. Agnes and Frances Bloemsma, Kathrine Glatt, Elizabeth Hartle, Mr. Mammoser-Zuurbier, and Elizabeth and Arnold Buskens played the guitar, the mandolin, the violin and the piano cleverly and duets and quartets received great attention and applause.</p>

   <p>The Feast-Committee deserves thanks for the excellent arrangements which required considerable preparatory work.</p>
