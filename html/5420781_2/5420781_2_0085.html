   <p>The recently organized society of Netherlanders, so by descent or by birth, called the Chicago Knickerbocker Club, met last week Thursday, at noon, at a plentifully supplied table at the Illinois Athletic Club, where the members were the guest of F. Posthuma, vice consul of the Netherlands. The host was well satisfied with the attendance, because, as he said, of the twenty-two invited, twenty-three were present. Prof. E. D. Dimment, president of Hope College at Holland, Michigan was present as a guest of honor. Vice Consul Posthuma is thought to have found his number (23) because of the remarks he made after the speech of the guest of honor. After the partaking of the well selected food, the program of activities was handled in a most businesslike way. The new organization shall be known as the _________________________ Chicago Knickerbocker Society. The By-Laws, proposed by a committee, were adopted with few changes.</p>
