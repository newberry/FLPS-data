   <p>Labor Day, observed on the first Monday in September, originally set apart as a festive day, a day for workmen's pageants and the displays of labor unions, is fortunately being used more and more by our Dutch people to hold important meetings and national Christian festivals.</p>
   <p>This year we are to have two of these celebrations. The League of Christian School Societies and the Young Men's Association will hold their national convention this time at Palos. The program proves that this national convention will be inferior in no respect to that of last year. Learning by experience, the organization has certainly improved.</p>
   <p>In Riverside Park a general mission festival will be held of which the program may be found in this issue. The Men's Mission Association of the First Reformed Congregation on Hastings Street was the prime mover of this celebration.</p>

   <p>The program is proof that it is under good management.</p>
