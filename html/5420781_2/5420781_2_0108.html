   <p>The division Roseland of the "General Dutch League" gave an entertainment Thursday, March 29, in the "Leandia Hall" with great success. More than two hundred persons were present and the program was liked by everyone. Every time the opportunity presents itself the Dutch American again feels that he has not forgotten the land and people and especially the language which he formerly called his own.</p>
   <p>And why should he forget them? He cannot know the history, the quality of the people, and the Dutch national institutions unless he is proud of them. The division expects to raise its membership to two hundred names.</p>
