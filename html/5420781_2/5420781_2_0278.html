   <p>The London correspondent of the "Tel" had an interview with our ambassador, Mr. Cremeron on his stop over at the Netherlands. As is known he left his post at Washington for his health... "What is America's attitude towards the Netherlands?" asked the correspondent,"During the war, it was not very benevolent." "Very friendly." was the answer, "The Americans are business people and are anxious as soon as possible to revive former commercial relations."</p>
   <p>The fact that the United States has sent Mr. Philips as Ambassador to Netherland is proof of the great interest, the Americans have in Holland. He was assistant Secretary of State and is a wise and strong personality.</p>
