   <p>A party of about 20 Dutchmen (mostly from Roseland and a few from Englewood). which departed a couple of weeks ago for Canada, to make an enquiry about the condition of the soil there, returned last week.</p>
   <p>As we understand it, their report is not as favorable as the one of the Hollander, who visited Canada about four weeks ago.</p>
