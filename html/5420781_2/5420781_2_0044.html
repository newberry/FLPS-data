   <p>In the coming roll call of the American Red Cross, the members will be recruited according to their nationality, All the Netherlanders who become members in the November roll call or renew their membership, should state their membership in favor of the Netherland group. It is for the call of our Netherlanders in America of great importance that their participation in the American Red Cross should also be written in favor of them. We therefore urge all Netherlanders to make use of this opportunity and to show how great is the interest of the Netherlands in the Red Cross.</p>
   <p>Let us all work together to give a good testimonial for this worthy cause in behalf of the Netherland people.</p>
