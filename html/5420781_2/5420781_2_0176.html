   <p>Next Monday evening, March 17th, the Christian Recite-Society "Izak da Costa" will give a public performance in the church building of the Christian Reformed Congregation at 14th Street.</p>
   <p>We mention this particularly, because the society has made good progress since its existence. On this occasion a program will be given which is well worth hearing. Three competitions (compositions?) have been announced.</p>
   <p>At the meeting a collection will be taken in behalf of the supplementary-fund of the Ebenezer School.</p>
