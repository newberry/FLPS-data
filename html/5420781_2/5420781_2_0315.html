   <p>Mr. Schuitemaker of Friesland, the Netherlands, had the pleasure on the evening of March 5th, to address a gathering of Friesians, who had come from all parts of the city, to the K. P. Hall. Those who had never been in Friesland had the pleasure of seeing the Freisians skating as only they can do it, through the medium of motion pictures. Skating races and sailing parties were in order besides other sports of Freisian life.</p>
   <p>D. Driebergen is president of the "Freisian Society", which is located in Chicago under the name "Uten thus," (Outdoors and In-translated).</p>
   <p>H. Brilsma is secretary and Piet de Painter is treasurer. The hall was full and the proceeds were planned for the "Holland Home."</p>
   <p>(P. S. The Friesic language is one of the oldest in the world and is the mother of the German language.)</p>
