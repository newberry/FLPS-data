   <p>Aneta tells us: In connection with the reception, which our navy received in Japan, the Aneta office of the Hague, asked the Japanese Ambassador to Holland, concerning his opinion regarding the relations between Japan and the Netherland Colonies. We asked Mr. Kantaro Aschiai, if the banquets which took place, would have to be regarded as meaningless international formalities, or that there was really talk of friendship. His answer was thus: The Japanese, and first among them the merchants, still know that the Hollanders for a long time were the only Westerners, who had regular relations with Japan, and that the Japanese, thru the Netherlanders, came first in contact with Western civilization, who among other things taught them medical knowledge and about world commerce. No wonder that the Holland fleet is looked up to in Japan and that they indicated their feelings by giving them an especially hearty welcome. Added to this is the fact that in the last years the already lively trade with our colonies was made broader, and the Japanese wish that these economic relations would become still closer. In the signing of peace, the ambassador does not expect a reversal of these <span class="page-break">\2</span>relations, but the reverse. When we hinted as to the distrust, that many in our colonies and in the Netherlands have, about the purposes of the evermore powerful Japan, Mr. Kantoaro Aschiai said that there is no reason for distrust. Japan wishes without any ulterior motives to keep good relations with Holland and its colonies. The just appointed Ambassador, Mr. Philips, also granted an interview to a representative of the Aneta office about the commercial relations of his America and our overseas colonies.</p>
   <p>The Ambassador gave as his views, that an entirely new era starts for American-Dutch Indies relations on economic grounds, now that the war is ended and the United States has emerged from it stronger, commercially. Before the war America's commercial fleet was insignificent, so that very little was exported and they busied themselves mainly with raw materials such as flour and other foodstuffs. During the war many ships were built for transports and the carrying of arms and ammunitions, but which now will be used for the export trade, as well as the ships still building. There is now in America a new spirit, not of isolation, but one that calls for expansion in world commerce, instead of staying within their own borders. The colossal strength of American industry has grown up with that spirit. America can supply the world markets with many products of industry and in return receive in trade <span class="page-break">\3</span>such articles as she herself does not possess and which other parts of the world can supply. We do not have to worry about the high tariff so said Mr. Philips as he viewed them, as of a fiscal nature. Now as far as the relations with our colonies goes, the Ambassador expects a quick development, for not only are the colonies easily reached from America, but the American people also get along well with the Hollanders. He predicts then a lively attendance at the coming feasts of the Pilgrim Fathers. The Ambassador hopes that many Americans will visit our country on this occasion.</p>
   <p>When we spoke of the opinion in America about us in connection with the antipathy, which existed in many countries who participated in the war, his excellency answered that our country suffered no more of that, than the rest of the neutrals, but that in America the feeling was not as high as in the other mentioned lands. However, there is now nothing left of this animosity, if it ever existed. The American industrialist and trader is anxious, as soon as possible, to do business with the Netherlands. Some technical obstacles, which are still in the way of the regular trade must be credited to circumstance, that the United States officially is still at war with Germany.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Every part of the American people is striving for normal conditions to better their positions as far as trade is concerned, then before the war. In this connection, Mr. Philips said it was a lucky thought to send a committee to America. Whether or not they succeeded he was unable to say, but was sure that many American Business men were glad to learn more of the Netherlands trade and industry conditions. We are of the opinion that the people of America interest themselves more with Holland, than do the Hollanders with America. His excellency spoke with sympathy of the Holland Ambassador, Mr. Cremer, whom he gives credit for furthering peaceful relations during his stay at Washington. Also about the Netherlands, Mr. Philips had a good word to say. In the short time of his stay in Holland, the population had already given him the impression, which he had expected, an impression of prosperity and influence, and of good will to less prosperous countries, and hospitality toward strangers. With pleasure he starts his new task.</p>
