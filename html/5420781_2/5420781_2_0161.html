   <p>Catholic colonization in the United States began in 1840, when Father Theo Van den Brock, a Dutch Dominican, after a missionary career of seventeen years among the Indians of the Middle West, returned to the Netherlands, where he published a booklet on Conditions in America. This booklet explained what bright prospects were in store for colonists of the type represented by the thrifty and hard-working people of Noord Brabant and Limburg especially. The result of his efforts was, that in March, 1848, he set out from Rotterdam with three shiploads of Catholic Hollanders. The vessels bore the names, "Maria Magdalena, America, and Libera." All who accompied him settled in the Fox River Valley, a very fertile and beautiful area, but at that time an uncultivated and uncivilized, part of Wisconsin, between Lake Winnebago and Green Bay.</p>

   <p>This region at one time, 1630-1675, the missionary field of Fathers Marquette, Menard, Allones, Andre and Silvery, became the territory of these settlers. Many Catholic Dutch colonies followed those of 1848, and they have, after years of privation and thrift, established many prosperous settlements. The Fox River Valley, called, "The Heart of the State," still remains the center of Dutch Catholic colonization in the United States.</p>
   <p>ORGANIZATION OF DUTCH ROMAN CATHOLICS IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
   <p>Although the number of Dutch Catholics in the United States is comparatively small, (about 40,000) and as they are scattered throughout nearly every State of the Union, there exists no National Society among them. In the Fox River Valley, however, they have many local societies among themselves for religious and social purposes.</p>

   <p>In June 1907, a league of Holland and Belgian priests was organized in Chicago for the twofold purposes of providing for the spiritual need of neglected Dutch and Belgian Catholics and of protecting and directing their countrymen on their arrival in America. This league, known as the Association of Belgian and Holland Priests, has been affiliated with the Church extension under the name of Holland and Belgian Section of the extension.</p>
   <p>DUTCH CATHOLIC SCHOOLS IN THE UNITED STATES.</p>
   <p>The parochial system of schools is vigorous in all the Holland Catholic settlements. In the Fox River Valley for instance, their parish schools are attended by thousands of children, who are taught by three score of teachers, who have always maintained a very high standard in all branches of the school curriculum.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The Dutch language however, is not taught in any of them, with the result that of all non-English speaking people the Dutch settlers and especially their children have more rapidly learned and adopted the language and customs of the United States.</p>
   <p>It may be said that the Dutch Catholics, both at home and abroad, have at all times shown themselves strong advocates and champions of religious education in the schools; hence, in parishes where their number is insufficient to form a congregation of their own, they pledge their material and moral support to parochial institutions, irrespective of nationality, and they manifest appreciation of, as well as fidelity to the fate which their forefathers kept and cherished thru ages of oppression and other forms of adversity.</p>

   <p>There are three Dutch orders of religions in the United States, two of men and one of women. The Premonstratensian Fathers, or more commonly known as Norbertines, from their founder H. Norbert, came to the United States in November 1893, from the Abbey of Berne, at Heeswyk, Holland.</p>
   <p>In 1898, their monastery was canonically established at Depere, Wis., where about two hundred and fifty young men are being prepared for the priesthood, as well as the various other professions, Law, Medicine, Engineering and Business. The Crozier Fathers of St. Agatha, Holland, are established in Minnesota, where for several years they have laboured zealously, and successfully in the field of missionary endeavor and in the regular care of souls as priests; they also have opened a college for young men at their present headquarters at Namia, Minnesota.</p>

   <p>The sisters of Our Lady, Mother of Mercy, came to America in 1894 from their Mother-house at Tilburg, Holland. They began their first mission at Baltic, Connecticut, in the Diocese of Hartford, which is at their present headquarters. They also opened two schools and a City Hospital at Taftsville, Connecticut. Since these sisters have taken charge of missions in the Dutch East Indies, they have declined to open any more houses in the United States.</p>
   <p>There are in the United States about seventy-five Catholic Dutch congregations, and a few smaller missions. Moreover they are well represented in several other parishes, especially in Michigan, South Dakota and Montana. The Dutch priests, secular and regular, working in the United States, the Dutch number two distinguished bishops now living, namely, Right Reverend Cornelius Van de Ven, D. D., Bishop of Alexandria, La., and the Right Reverend Arthur Jerome Drossaerts, D. D., Bishop of San Antonio, Texas.</p>

   <p>Among the foremost representatives of the Dutch nation that have passed to their eternal reward should certainly be numbered the Most Reverend Francis Janssen, former Archbishop of New Orleans. The Reverend Arnold Damen, S. J., one-time professor in St. Louis University, founder and pastor of Holy Family Parish, Chicago, great orator and missionary; and the Reverend Th. Van Den Brock, O. P., pioneer missionary and pastor of the Hollanders in the Fox River Valley, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>The Dutch have at all times proved themselves very desirable citizens of our Republic, owing to their thrift, economy, cleanliness and other domestic qualities, which adopted them so beneficiently to the life in the rural communities, where they have been very successful and have attained a remarkable degree of prosperity.</p>
