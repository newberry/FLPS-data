   <p>To the Editor:</p>
   <p>Among the members of the colony in New York as well as here in Chicago the idea is being promoted of presenting our worthy and beloved Queen, on the occasion of the happy event which her Majesty is expecting and which is of the utmost importance for our entire country, with an appropriate gift. This idea has my cordial support, and I am of the opinion that to obtain the co-operation of all the Netherlanders in America I should turn directly to the Dutch press. I have no doubt that you will call the attention of your readers to this plan and will give an opportunity to those who wish to contribute to this cause to do so. A short time after the happy event takes place the sum which has been subscribed could be collected and through your [journal as] medium be turned over to me; I would send it to the treasurer of a committee to be formed, which according to the wish of various Dutch committees would consist of only a few ladies, under the leadership of Mrs. Louden, wife of our ambassador at Washington. Inasmuch as her Majesty has proclaimed her wish that the gift of the Dutch people shall be used for a charitable cause, negotiations are being carried on to fulfill her Majesty's desire. Then the proceeds of our collection will be turned over to the main committee in the Netherlands, after the deduction of the sum necessary to print a beautiful album, to contain the names of all the donors and their biographies and to be illustrated with pictures of the "New Netherlanders" and if possible with [photographs] of the present Dutch settlements in this country and of everything in connection with them.</p>
