   <p>Albert Oosterheert recently received the following letter from the Netherlands Ambassador to the United States at Washington, D. C., addressed to 1141 Edison Building, Chicago. "On command of His Excellency, the Minister of Foreign affairs at the Hague, I have the honor to present to you, herewith, a Netherland flag, which is put at your disposal by the Board of the Netherland American Chamber of Commerce at Amsterdam, out of appreciation for the way in which you have taken to heart the Netherland's interest". Indeed a well earned distinction. Mr. Oosterheert, for many years, has had the Netherlands' interest in America at heart, especially with reference to a seat of learning at Chicago University. He wrote a treatise on the Netherlanders in America and other articles, in both languages, about Netherland, for American newspapers and periodicals.</p>
   <p>Mr. Oosterheert presented the flag to the "Knickerbocker Society" of Chicago.</p>
