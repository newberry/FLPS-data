   <p>At the last held consistory meeting of the Archer Avenue Reformed Church of Chicago, the following candidates for pastor of this church were named: Rev. Carl Schroeder, Indianapolis, Indiana; G. H. Maat Ustick, Spring Valley, Illinois; and a student L. Brunsting of the theological seminary.</p>
   <p>Next Friday the congregation hopes to choose one of the two as their pastor. Despite the fact that this congregation has no pastor, there is a good deal of church activity, which is proved by the fact that a choir has just been organized, consisting of twenty-two members. They practise every Friday night.</p>
