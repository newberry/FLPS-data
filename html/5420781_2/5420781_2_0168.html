   <p>In the issue of January 31 of Onze Toekomst, my attention was called to the fact that The Story of Mankind, written by the Hollander, Hendrik Van Loon, can now be read also by the blind through its re-writing in Braille. It is important news, because such a work is not only large and expensive, but the issue of this book for the blind will be of great influence. Because of this latter fact, I wish that you had mentioned that this work for the blind can do them little or no good, but harm without end. For Hendrik Van Loon in his Story of Mankind is a blind leader. He is entirely a materialist and an evolutionist. He seeks the beginning of man, not in a deed of the creation of God, but--we know that theory--in slimy mud, out of which millions of years ago an animal appeared which became the father of all mankind. From this foolish theory, from which God is simply left out, no light can be expected that will make them see the light.</p>
