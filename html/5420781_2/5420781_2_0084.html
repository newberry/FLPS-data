   <p>The recently organized Knickerbocker Society will hold its first annual dinner on April 25, in the Lincoln room of the "City Club". Preparations are being made to make this a gala evening. After the reception of the invited guests at 6:30 o'clock, the dinner will be served at 7:00 P. M. The speaker of the evening will be Dr. George L. Scherzer, teacher at the Armour Institute, in this city. His topic will be "Louis XIV and William of Orange." There will also be other speakers, among them the executives of the club. The evening will be brightened by song and music. Members of the "Englewood Community Glee Club"are engaged for that purpose, as well as Mr. and Mrs. Van Tuyl, recently arrived from the Netherlands. Mr. Van Tuyl is accomplished violinist, and is being accompanied on the piano by his wife. The Intertainment Committee requested us to mention that many of the invited guests had not yet been heard from. Reservations should not be delayed. For, as much as we know about the program and we know the Club, a very enjoyable evening can be depended upon.</p>
