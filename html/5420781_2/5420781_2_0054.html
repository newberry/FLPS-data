   <p>In my former article I pointed out the necessity of learning the language of the land and that leaves the necessity of pointing to the importance of Americanization in relation to the home. Evidently there are many who do not understand what a line of division Americanization in the home life creates, how it is possible that the parents do not understand their children nor the children their parents. But when we speak of the possibility that parents and children do not understand each other, then we mean that there is present such a difference of opinion that it forms a division line which works unprofitably for the oneness and harmony of homelife and was many times the cause of much suffering. The fact is that our children grow up as Americans. Born here, they have no idea about the land of their parents, often times a wrong idea. Their rearing outside the home brings them in contact with American ideas which form part of their early development. The atmosphere of the American life is their own.</p>
   <p>Everything that comes against that is strange to them and when they grow up and take a more independent station in life, the mode of living, the difference of which is more clearly seen. Especially when son or daughter gets married to one entirely Americanized, so of ten is heard: "O, I dont feel myself at home there." Now what is the cause of that? Is the natural love between parent and children cooled? No, at least not in every case.</p>
   <p>But there is a difference and that difference does not unite, but spearates. What is that difference? That the parents have held fast to the habits of the land of their birth; have declared themselves many times unsympathetic towards their children about the language and habits of the new land, and have tried so little to acquaint themselves with their new surroundings. The language was possibly felt to be the sharpest stumbling block. Many a parent has showed his animosity to his children and towards the language of the land, even giving orders not to use the language of the land in the home.</p>
   <p>How many times is it said: "We must remain Dutch, our Church is Dutch and must stay so," as if in the Dutch language lay their salvation.</p>
   
   <p>If only good Dutch was used in the home, but it is mostly a provincial dialect, and it is sometimes amusing to hear children, who know how to express themselves in the English language, try to express themselves in the clumsy dialect.</p>
   <p>As self-consciousness grows, this is felt: The child feels if he wants to express himself properly he must use the language of the land and you will always find they are using it wherever they go. The net result is that they are slowly but surely beginning to look down on the language and with the dialect too learn to hate the Holland language and with the language every thing Holland.</p>
   <p>This is too bad, but it is a natural result of the course that was followed. The writer has many times heard confessions of people born here and who made a trip to the Netherlands that they had an entirely wrong impression of Holland and from whom did they get that impression? From their parents... Americanization is a stream you can not turn, you can dam it for a time but the result is that the water goes over the levies and sometimes does much damage. The damage is already large enough... What must we do then? The answer is this, that we must start with Americanization in the home. Parents must understand that they must adjust themselves to the land, that their children are Americans who feel just as much love for their land and language as they did for their birthplace and language. Only then can their children take their place with honor and influence to do the most good if they are really brought up in the language which is theirs, in which they think and in which they live. All efforts against that are bound to result in disappointment. If we love our principles let us see that they are propagated here but that they will sink with us in the grave and that only can be done by sound Americanization.</p>
