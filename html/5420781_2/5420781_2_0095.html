   <p>Carl Hansen writes an appeal to all Danish societies to unite at least once a year for the celebration of the Danish Day of Independence, which is June 5th every year. He knows that it is very hard to get the Danes in Chicago to unite; there is too much jealousy between the different societies and the different individuals. But once, in 1899, the Danes got together and celebrated their National Day in a proper manner, and the result was the biggest gathering of Danes every seen outside of Denmark, a crowd of 10,000. The Danes in Chicago ought to elect or send delegates to a permanent National Committee; this was also the case in 1899, but the president, Niels Juul, was attacked so violently in The Danish Pioneer that he gave up, and dropped the whole thing. This year it will be 60 years since the Danes got their own constitution in 1849. The occasion will be celebrated on June 6.</p>
