   <p>Our Art Institute, Michigan Avenue &amp; Adams Street, has again increased it's wealth by the addition of another attractive masterpiece. It is of the Dutch master, Jacob Maris, and is titled, "Grandmother," picturing a friendly woman with a child on her lap. Before her stands a small girl, looking at the little one with great interest. The girl who posed for this group, is now the present mayor of Rotterdam. The most able art experts here are speaking very highly of this picture. The color, the light and the grouping is excellent. Every Holland lover of art will find it worth while to pay a visit to our Art Institute to study this masterpiece.</p>
   <p>Jacob Maris was the eldest of three brothers, all made themselves famous in the territory of art. He died in 1899 at the Hague. The masterpieces of these brothers are now very scarce and are hard to find. They were nearly all bought by English and American art collectors.</p>
