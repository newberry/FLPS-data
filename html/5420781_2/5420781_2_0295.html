   <p>For this opportunity we have waited a long time. Listen!</p>
   <p>Through a special arrangement with the celebrated Verbeck Studios we are able to offer to the readers of our paper, as a special premium absolutely free of charge, a beautiful picture of Her Majesty Queen Wilhelmina, the beloved ruler of the Netherlands, our Queen.</p>
   <p>It is an exact copy of the celebrated steel engraving by Verbeck. This beautiful engraving was executed by special permission of the Queen, and the original is in possession of Her Majesty.</p>
   <p>It is the same picture, only a little different in color, of which the Chicago Section of the General Netherland's League presented copies to the Dutch <span class="page-break">\2</span>schools in Chicago, to Hope College at Holland, Michigan, and to the Theological School at Grand Rapids.</p>
