   <p>The Helping Hand Gospel Mission,850 W. Madison Street, supported by the Five Christian Reformed Churches of Chicago, has purchased a new automobile for a good cause. The auto has many seats and is nicely decorated. It shall be used mainly to hold outdoor meetings on the street corners.</p>
   <p>The young people of the five Churches donated $700.00 towards the purchase of this Gospel Wagon. In a City as ours where there is so much congestion, this is great asset to City mission work.</p>
