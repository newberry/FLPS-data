   <p>The diadem (a crown to be placed in synagogue's Holy Ark) for the Rumanian Congregation was bought yesterday through a committee consisting of A. Bernard, S. J. Wolfson, Mr. Aronstein, and Mr. Nochman. The beautiful crown cost $190, and the purchase was realized through the initiative of Mr. Wolfson, who had promised to donate $100 provided the Congregation would pay the balance. The synagogue accepted this proposal and the sale was completed.</p>
