   <p>In spite of the President's orders, not to discriminate between Jewish and none-Jewish workers on government work, and in spite of the drive to force all the idlers to do essential work, three Jewish brick-layers were fired, just because the superintendent learned that they were Jews.</p>
   <p>The three - worked on a government project a few days in different sections and the foremen were very much satisfied with their work. When pay day came, they were fired and when the three asked why? They were told, "This is the order of Superintendent Bill".</p>
   <p>The three were the only Jews working on this building,among three thousand gentile workers.</p>
   <p>The fact remains clear that the three were fired because they were Jews, as one of the three, Mr. Scap, worked the previous winter nearly the entire season at the same work, because no one knew that he was a Jew.</p>
