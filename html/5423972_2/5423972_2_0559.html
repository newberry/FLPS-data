   <p>The Jewish comrades in New York are commemorating the anniversaries of the deaths of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. Have you ever heard of the Jewish comrades in New York observing the anniversaries of the victims of Fastov, Kishenev, or Homel? Have you ever heard of them shedding a tear for the 300,000 pogrom victims in the Ukraine?</p>
   <p>When Dr. Shmarya Levin visited Chicago sixteen years ago, the German Jews lavished great honors upon him. Today they are indifferent to Dr. Levin, because they now have something [else] to occupy themselves with, i. e., relief. Seventeen years ago, the German Jews in America felt that something was lacking in their lives. They were looking for something new. As Jews <span class="page-break">2</span>they felt that their lives were empty, and they began to flirt with Zionism. Today the essential factor in their lives is "relief". For this reason, they are indifferent to Zionism today, and are no longer interested in Dr. Levin.</p>
   <p>Please realize what this means: Relief--a remedy for Judaism.</p>
