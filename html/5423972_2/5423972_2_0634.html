   <p>The reality of the American nation is one hundred and ten million people, living in this God-blessed country under a liberal constitution. The reality of the French nation is thirty-eight million Frenchmen, living on French soil under a republican form of government and the reality of each and every nation consists of the people, plus the country, plus the form of life. What is the reality of the Jewish people? The Jews live in thirty-six different countries, subject to thirty-six forms of life, to thirty-six different languages and subject to the influence of as many physical surroundings and cultural environments. If the reality of a nation consists of the people plus the country, plus the form of life, material as well as spiritual, then there is no Jewish reality at all; then the Jewish people is actually non-existent. But still the fact that <span class="page-break">2</span>thousands of our people are killed every year, not because they are human beings, but because they are Jews, proves best that we do exist as a people and there is some sort of Jewish reality.</p>
   <p>The great French philosopher, Descartes, after working very hard on the problem of humanity certainly pressed its solution into the formula cogito ergo sum (I think, hence I am). Using the same formula for a solution of the problem of a Jewish reality we might as well say, they pogrom us, hence we exist, hence we live. The Jewish hatred often finding its expression in Jewish pogroms and massacres seems to us to be the crudest form of Jewish reality, for if we were non-existent as a people we would not invite hatred, we would not be pogrommed. However, while the pogrom is the crudest form of Jewish reality it also has different forms and expressions. The Jews themselves are very seldom conscious of a Jewish reality and a great number of our people would not concede that there is such a thing at all in existence. To some of our people it is the Jewish religion either in its old shape <span class="page-break">3</span>or in its modified form, to some it is some remembrances of the past and to others it may be some abstract and vague idea, etc. The fact of the matter, however, is that while our reality is quite different from every other nation, it is not less concrete than that of every other nation. To judge from the attitude of even the most liberal and radical-minded Jews, to the problem of Judaism, one must say that the very basis of this Jewish reality and the most concrete fact about Jewish reality is Jewish blood. We know of hundreds of very liberal and very radical-minded Jews to whom Judaism actually means nothing. They are not observing Jews, they do not practice Jewish customs and of course they are not nationalistic Jews, but still they would not permit their children to intermarry. What is then the great objection to the intermarriage of Jews and Gentiles? If Judaism is nothing but some vague idea, if it is not something real, if it is not something racial, if it is not something ethnic in character, why object to intermarriage? This in itself will go to prove that blood is thicker than abstract principles. It may or may not be alright to <span class="page-break">4</span>stick to the principle that Judaism is nothing except a religious idea or an ethnical idea, but when it comes down to hard facts, intermarriage or a conscious assimilation, the voice of Jewish reality is heard and this voice is Jewish blood. Let us ignore for a moment this fact and let us see what the other elements of Jewish reality are besides blood.</p>
   <p>Let us for a moment suppose the ethnic or the racial unity of the Jews is a fable, and it is only the fabrication of God-forsaken theorists and let us even admit that we Jews care little for racial or ethnic solidarity or are not even conscious of it. The fact that the Gentile world since times immemorial considers us an ethnic or racial unit creates a Jewish reality. What else is historical reality if not the consciousness of humanity and the expression of this consciousness? The Franco-Jewish scholar, Mr. Joseph Reinach published a book entitled "The Romans, the Greeks and the Jews". The book consists of a compilation of utterances, opinions and views of great Romans, great Greeks and Jews. None of the <span class="page-break">5</span>Romans or Greeks whom Reinach quotes has ever referred to the Jews, otherwise than to members of an ethnical unit. To them, Judaism was primarily an ethnological fact. All the modern philosophers from Bruno down to Culpe and including such eminent and immortal thinkers as Wolf, Leibnitz, Kant, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and Hartman, all maintained that Judaism is primarily ethnological. The average educated Jew, whether he be Zionistically inclined or not, refers to the late Theodore Herzl as the founder of Jewish nationalism and even a historian like Gotthard Deutsch often mentions the fact that Herzl was the founder of Zionism, that is to say, Jewish nationalism with its ultimate goal of the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. It may interest our readers to learn that Baruch Spinoza who was excommunicated from the synagogue and who by his teachings was an outspoken anti-Jew, anticipated Herzl in his doctrine of Jewish nationalism and it may also interest our readers to learn that Immanuel Kant, the greatest of all philosophers, taught clearly and distinctly, that Judasim is not so much a religion, or that it is no religion at all, but primarily an ethnological fact. Schopenhauer repeated <span class="page-break">6</span>what Spinoza said about the nature of the Jewish reality, namely that Judiasm is not an abstract principle, but a matter of blood. In agreement with Spinoza he said that the Jews are a people without a national homeland and that therefore the final aim of Jewish history must be a national homeland for the Jewish people. Now Kant and Schopenhauer, the two greatest and deepest thinkers of modern times, are by no means isolated in their conception of Judiasm. We challenge the historians of philosophy and literature to show that there ever was one great poet, philosopher, or artist in Europe who has not conceived of Judiasm as of an ethnological fact and these great philosophers and artists have only expressed the consciousness and the recognition of their opinion. They have said in so many words what European humanity throughout the ages has been feeling and thinking all along, namely that Jewish reality is not spirit, principle, category, formula, but blood, race, ethnos, and the consciousness of humanity is in this case as in every other case that what constitutes historical reality. It may be that some Jews, estranged from Jewish life and alienated from Jewish practice no longer feel and think as Jews and believe that they are ex-Jews or make their non-Jewish a standard of Judiasm and say that there is no Jewish reality <span class="page-break">7</span>and that Judaism is non-existent. But suppose a colored man having been estranged from the practice of his race and having adopted white man's civilization and culture, would suddenly discover that he is a white man. Would this discovery make us believe that he is a white man? Would this admission that he is a full-fledged white man make us change our attitude to the colored race and would it make us forget the existence of the colored race? Evidently not. Now it is true that the raciality of the colored man is much more expressive than that of the Jewish because we belong to the white race and with the exception of a few biological characteristics as a result of inbreeding and ghetto life there is not much difference between the physique of the Jew and Gentile, but psychologically, however, our raciality is as striking and as expressive as is biologically the raciality of the colored man.</p>
   <p>Sometimes the people sheltering us complain about our behavior and say that even the most refined Jews and the most cultured Jews behave differently and <span class="page-break">8</span>are therefore unpleasant company. We do not speak of course of the loud gesticulating and often tactless Jew. The complaint about the behavior of this sort of Jew is often justified, but the Gentiles will often complain about the most refined Jews and say that they are not pleased with their behavior. Is there something to this complaint? Has it any justification in fact? Physically, no; psychologically, yes. Even the most refined Jew, even the most de-Judaized Jew cannot jump out of his own skin and cannot change the blood flowing in his veins and cannot change the hereditary characteristics of his mind accumulated by hundreds of generations. The Jewish mind has a mechanism of its own and works differently than that of the non-Jewish mind and what they call misbehavior of the Jew is often only this difference of mind: the different working of its mechanism. The Gentile mind indulges in epics, the Jewish mind indulges in lyrics; the Gentile mind inclines towards Bacchanalism, the Jewish mind indulges in the elegy. We Jews, the professional optimists, are roaming around in this world with a heart full of gloom. They, the Christians, the professional pessimists, <span class="page-break">9</span>they the Christians who believe that humanity is so bad that God had to die for it, they who believe that earthly life is only an episode and that this world is sin laden and fundamentally mad--they roam around in this world with a soul full of joy and fun. This striking difference of mental disposition of Jew and Gentile, due of course to certain psychological causes cannot be eliminated and cannot be wiped out and they feel these differences as keenly as we do, but are not often able to grasp its real nature and complain about the bad behavior of the Jew. No, it is not our behavior, it is our different mentality or different psychial raciality. We who are a subjective and an individualistic people may not often feel it so keenly, but they feel it very keenly and are conscious of our existence as a separate ethnic unit. It does not make any difference whether you call it group, race, nation, etc. It is a different unit and it is this difference of blood and mind that constitutes Jewish reality. In addition to these objective signs of Jewish reality there is also a subjective one too. Just as they feel keenly our existence as a racial unit so do we ourselves feel our existence mostly because it pains us. When a thoroughly assimilated Jew who does <span class="page-break">10</span>not believe in anything Jewish says to his daughter, you cannot marry a Gentile, or says to his son, you cannot marry a Gentile, he only voices the Jewish blood in him and gives vent to his instinct of Jewish self-preservation, but fortunately not all Jews are de-Judaized. Ninety per cent of our people are Jews and want to remain Jews and this will to live, will [to] survive, plus the consciousness imbedded in the heart of humanity, that Judaism is an ethnological fact, go to constitute the Jewish reality.</p>
