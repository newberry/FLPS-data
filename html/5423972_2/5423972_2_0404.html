   <p>We are grateful to Samuel E. Epstein, law partner of Alderman Jacob M. Arvey, for calling our attention to the fact that Stephen Osusky, the delegate from Czechoslovakia, who appeared to be the most prominent advocate for the protection of Jewish rights at the recent Geneva Conference, was a former classmate of his at the University of Chicago Law School. He came here for the purpose of getting an education in an American university, completing his academic and law work in 1915. "It was remarkable," said Mr. Epstein, "that throughout his course at the University he associated with Jews and created life long friendships among them. I am not surprised after such association, that Steve Osusky has remained a true friend of our people, and at the first opportunity has spoken in their behalf."</p>
