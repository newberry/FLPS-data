   <p>Amalgamated Compels Non-Union Manufacturers from Small Towns to Return to Chicago.</p>
   <p>The attempt of several clothing manufacturers to open non-union shops around or in Chicago, resulted in a total failure for the manufacturers. Most of them were compelled to discard their non-union paradise and return to Chicago, signing agreements with the Amalgamated. For the past few weeks, several firms opened small factories under Union conditions.</p>
   <p>Sam Levin, manager of the Joint Board, told to a reporter of the Forward, that the Amalgamated had triumphed in its struggle against these "smart" bosses, who ran from the union into small towns, or ran factories, in disguise, somewhere in Chicago.</p>
   <p>One of the firms that desired to uphold a non-union shop is the Crown Tailoring Co., as did Prosterman and Bronson, clothing manufacturers, and the contractor Sweznik.</p>
