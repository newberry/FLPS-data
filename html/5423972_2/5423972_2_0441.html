   <p>The Chicago committee which is preparing the reception in honor of Queen Marie of Rumania has already disbanded. They are quarreling among themselves because they cannot decide who shall have the greatest honor at the ceremonies. The "battle" broke out between the self-appointed leaders of the local Rumanian Jews who wish to invite the Queen to their synagogue, and the "leaders" of the Rumanian Christians who wish her to enter their church first.</p>
   <p>While this "battle" was raging, Judge [Joseph] David, who name was listed as a member of the reception committee for the Queen, made it known publicly yesterday that he refuses to participate in the ceremony because the Rumanian Government is anti-Semitic and because the Jews are horribly persecuted in Rumania. He also stated another reason why he refuses to permit his name to be listed on the reception committee: he is an American, and therefore, he does not want to bow before a king or a queen.</p>

   <p>Mark Weissler, secretary of the Rumanian-Jewish organization, wrote a letter to Judge David and asked him if he wished to serve on the reception committee. Judge David wrote as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir: I received your letter in which you invite me to be a member of the reception committee of the United Rumanian Jews of Illinois to greet the Rumanian Queen. In answer I wish to state that I, very positively, decline your invitation.</p>
   <p>"I decline because of the following reasons:</p>
   <p>1. The Jews are being horribly mistreated by the Rumanian Government--a fanatical, intolerant, and persecutory Government.</p>
   <p>2. I cannot, as an American citizen, pay any special tribute to a crowned ruler of any country. I absolutely agree with the resolution <span class="page-break">\3</span>adopted by the American Federatation of Labor Sunday concerning the visit of this queenly person; and am against the proposal that an American citizen should humble himself or flatter her. I, therefore, refuse to accept any invitation to greet the Queen.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>"Joseph David."</p>
