   <p>The Organization Committee of the West Side Planning Association sent out an appeal to the West Side land owners, business people, and residents urging them to protest against the plan of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company to erect freight houses between Van Buren and 26th Streets.</p>
   <p>The Organization Committee consists of Mr. Benjamin S. Meyer, President of the West Side Trust and Savings Bank; Irving M. Klein, of L. Klein General Merchandise; A. J. Harris; Pascal Skvianvana, of the State Bank of Italy, and George H. Murphy, of Murphy and Campbell.</p>
   <p>It is stated in the appeal that the Pennsylvania Railroad seeks the City's permission to give a death blow to the growth and development of the West Side. Therefore, if the residents of the West Side wish to save their property and business they should not rely upon the mercy of God, they should immediately unite with and join the West Side Planning Association in the fight against the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.</p>
