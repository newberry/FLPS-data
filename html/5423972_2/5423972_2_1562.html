   <p>One million persons have attached their signatures to a petition of protest against the rise of [the price of] sugar. There can be no question but that [the opinion of] not one million but the practically unanimous opinion of the United States is against the increase of sugar prices, yet what is the good of all this opinion, in the last analysis, when the government pleads helplessness in defeating the game of the sugar speculators. There is no shortage of the stocks of this commodity, it has been established. It is contrary to law to conspire to fix prices of a commodity. This country is a democracy and the will of the majority ought to obtain in every issue, yet though we all suffer the effects of what is virtually a monopoly, the government and, naturally, we ourselves seem to be helpless in remedying matters. Mrs. Harding helps in the sugar boycott as much as she is able, since sugar is a necessity, but sugar <span class="page-break">2</span>continues to be sold above what it is worth at the present time. Democracy apparently sometimes defeats the will of the majority.</p>
   <p>The Catholic Church is not growing weaker in this age of alleged atheism, but stronger. It is the greatest organization not merely of its kind but of any, for that matter, in the world. The one great power in Europe that is supporting the Protestant Church officially now sends its hereditary head, its king and queen, to the Vatican for a visit. England before the war did not even have a representative to the Vatican. Now the royal head of the British Empire, by his planned visit to the Pope, upsets the tradition of hundreds of years and reconciles in effect the Anglican Church, which differs very little in fact from the Roman Church, with the Roman Catholic Church. This is, if any thing at all, a victory for the Papal Power. An American President, Theodore Roosevelt, after his term of office had expired, on his return trip to America, after his African hunting excursion, visited the Pope and gave the latter the greetings of the American people, perhaps in a semiofficial tone at that. The power of the Catholic Church is immense today as in former times, though it is less apparent <span class="page-break">3</span>today. That is why there is a good deal of opposition to it in certain quarters in America. A Catholic candidate for the Presidency of the United States most probably would have as difficult a job getting elected as a Jew. Yet there is a vast difference between the relative position of the Catholic and the Jew in this country and in every country. The Jew has no world organization or even any national or territorial organization behind him. The Jew does not seek to make proselytes nor in any way to enforce his private religious opinions or customs upon others. The Jew always lets everyone alone, merely pursuing his way. Nonetheless, the Jew is regarded in many quarters as a greater peril than the Catholic, and often with the same odium as the Negro in the South, where the whites who have had a chance to get an education are often as illiterate as the Negro, who has not had the chance and has been subjected to persecution and oppression besides. Certainly the Jew, whether his qualities be likable or otherwise to non-Jews, is in no respect a menace to any group of the population. Alone among the people of the earth, without a government he may fully call his own, his allegiances among the minority groups of the population is the least questionable. He deserves a better fate than he frequently receives, at any rate.</p>
