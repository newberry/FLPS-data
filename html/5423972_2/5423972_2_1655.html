   <p>The Jewish bakery boss believes in a union of workers. We do not want or seek to break the union. All we ask in that the differences between us and our workers should be straightened out through arbitration. The Union however refuses to arbitrate. The Union wants to use its fist to compel us to agree to its unjust and impossible demands.</p>
   <p>Compare our conditions with those of the Gentile bakeries.</p>
   <p>We Jewish bakery bosses pay the highest wages in Chicago. We pay from eight to ten dollars a week more than the Gentile bakeries. The German Bakers, Local 2, asks $25 a week for the foreman, $23 for the second hand and $19 for <span class="page-break">2</span>the third hand, and this is for a nine-hour working day. The Polish Bakers Union asks the following: $26 a week for the foreman, $24 for the second hand and $22 for the third hand--for a nine-hour working day.</p>
   <p>Now listen to what the Jewish Bakers Union is demanding from the Jewish bakery bosses: $33 for the foreman, $28 for the second hand and $26 for the third hand, for an eight and a half hour working day. They also demand full pay for ten holidays when they don't bake, while no other bakery union requires that pay be dished out for not working. These demands can be found only in this bakers' union contract. The fact is that they compel us to pay more, and in reality are getting more than even their contract calls for.</p>
   <p>Listen to the way they accomplish it. There are "good" workers and there are "bad" ones. The bakery workers say that the agreement was made only for the "bad" workers. They argue that if the "bad" worker gets his full pay, according to the agreement, then they, the "good" workers, are entitled to more-- <span class="page-break">3</span>if not they will stop working, and in this way they compel the boss to pay more than even the contract calls for. As a result of these unjust demands the workers receive more pay than the agreement specifies.</p>
   <p>And now another thing: Each bakery worker has formed the habit of taking bread for himself and his family without paying for it. This amounts to between three and five dollars a week per worker. Now, figure the wages, which are above those specified in the agreement, plus the free bread that they are getting, and the result is that the Jewish bakery worker is the best-paid worker in the city.</p>
   <p>The Jewish, Polish and German Baker Unions belong to one International, yet the demands of the Jewish Bakers Union are much greater than those of the non-Jewish bakers.</p>
   <p>What is the trouble with the helpers?</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>In order to find work for the unemployed, the Union made a rule that steady workers should give a day's work every week to the helpers to work in their place. This means, that the Jewish bakery workers work only five days a week. When, for instance, a bakery boss employs seven or eight workers, he must also employ during the week seven or eight helpers. These helpers, coming to work for only one day, and knowing that it isn't a steady job, do not take any interest in their work. They work a day and are gone. Not being acquainted with the details of the work, the latter in many instances is spoiled, and naturally the result is that the bakery boss suffers considerable damage from it.</p>
   <p>When the cost of flour was only three or four dollars a barrel, the damage wasn't so expensive when the helpers spoiled the bread or cakes. But now, when flour costs four or five times as much, when the other ingredients have also gone up in price, then it becomes absolutely impossible to bear the damage which the helpers cause in the bakeries.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Another thing: The Secretary of the Union informs the steady worker in the shop that he will send a helper in his place tomorrow and the regular worker should remain at home. It often happens that the helper fails to show up, and the boss is short of help. When this helper, who is supposed to show up for work at night, does not, the other workers demand an extra hand, claiming they are unable to get through with the work. The boss gets busy over the telephone, calling for help, but to no avail. And, finally, when he gets one, the latter begins to bargain--"will you pay seven dollars, then I'll work." Many times it so happens that the boss is forced to pay from eight to ten dollars for eight and a half hours of work, although the agreement states that the helper should receive only four and a half dollars for his time. The Union cares very little about this situation. Of what concern is it to the Union when the Jewish bakery boss--"the capitalist"--suffers from damage and trouble!</p>
   <p>In many cases the helper's problem is used by the Business Agent of the <span class="page-break">6</span>Union to "fix" the boss. As stated, it happens quite often that when a steady worker becomes angry at the boss, he sends a helper in his place, so as to have the boss right where he wants him. As usual, he sends the type of helper who will cause the utmost trouble. The same is done by the Secretary of the Union, or the Business Agent, when they are in the mood to "fix" the boss or help out a novice. They send a novice to work and demand money for it. The above-mentioned miseries are only a small part of what the Jewish bakery boss has to stand from the helpers' "plague." The non-Jewish baker unions have many more unemployed in their unions than do the Jewish, and yet their unions exist and are powerful without unloading these unemployed upon the shoulders of the non-Jewish bakery bosses. The Jewish Bakers Union is trying to make the public believe that the helpers' problem is the very lifeblood of the union, but that is not true. Why can the non-Jewish bakers local unions exist and be powerful without helpers? The Jewish bakery bosses are not against the helpers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>They believe that the bakery worker must make a living and can make a living without having the boss ruined. The present system of helpers, installed by the Union, means the ruination of the bakery boss and the entire Jewish bakery industry.</p>
   <p>Last year, when we negotiated with the Union about the previous yearly agreement, the Union admitted to us the seriousness of the helpers system. Did the Union live up to its promise? No! Instead of improving the situation, they made it more and more miserable for the boss.</p>
   <p>Every day the great Gentile bakeries spread out more and more in the Jewish neighborhoods, because they have nice, uniformly made bread; they have no helpers who would spoil it. The Jewish bakeries cannot compete with the non-Jewish bakeries because every day they have new helpers. One day the bread comes out with a point in one place, the next day, in another; one day it is raw, the next it is burned, etc.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>In addition we want to make it clear that the Jewish bakery boss is not such a "capitalist" as the Union is trying to paint him before the public. The majority of them must work hard to earn a living. They work eighteen hours a day, not eight and a half hours. The same applies to their wives, who are enslaved to the business, and the Union, knowing what a "capitalist" it deals with, tries to oppress him with everything in their power.</p>
   <p>The misery which the Jewish bakery bosses have to undergo at the hands of the Union, has reached such a point that the Jewish bakery bosses can stand it no longer, and therefore we are appealing to the Jewish public for justice. We demand arbitration because we believe that our demands are right and just. We desire that other parties--not the Union--should listen to our voice. We offered the Union, before the declaration of the strike, to turn over all these misunderstandings between us and the Union, to disinterested parties. The Union however wants to call a strike.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>If the Union is justified in its demands, then why does it fear arbitration? we are against this, that the Jewish population should suffer through a bakers' strike in the bakery industry. We are for unionism, with right and justice.</p>
   <p>We demand justice and will fight for the principle of arbitration.</p>
