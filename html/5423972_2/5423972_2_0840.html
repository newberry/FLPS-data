   <p>Gangs of young Poles wander in Douglas Park, spit on the Jews, throw them off the benches, and beat them within an inch of their lives.</p>
   <p>Such was the case Sunday and also yesterday.</p>
   <p>There were no arrests made Sunday. The park police and detectives who receive salaries so that they guard and protect the lives of those who come to the parks for a bit of fresh air, were nowhere around. If they were, they ignored everything.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, the outrages committed by the young Poles reached its climax. They went around simply murdering Jews. They beat up David Levitt of 3331 Levitt St. He lay on the grass. They pounded upon him and left him lying there unconscious. A Jewish couple, whose name and address we do not have on hand, met a similar fate. Many more Jews fared no better.</p>
   <p>Instead of taking Levitt to a hospital, the park detectives took him and two Jewish boys, Morris Welner and Isadore Zevin, to the Fillmore Avenue Police Station.</p>
   <p>The Poles brought to the same station were Walter Tarzos, John Auskizski, Edward Makos, and Frank Latorski.</p>
   <p>An officer of the Fillmore Station explained yesterday to a Courier reporter that he would not be surprised if Poles murdered anyone in the Park, so enraged are they against the Jews.</p>
   <p>Those arrested, ranging in age from 17 to 21, will be arraigned in the Boys Court today.</p>
   <p>Appeals to the Captain of the Park Police to give protection to Jews in Douglas Park will be madentoday.</p>
