   <p>On Jewish Charity. (Editorial).</p>
   <p>In the last special annual issue of the "Reform Advocate" there was a discussion of Jewish charity in an article titled "Is there a Distinctly 'Jewish' Charity?" by Rabbi Julius Rappoport.</p>
   <p>The article is very interesting, especially as it is written with distinct Jewish thought, Jewish sentiment, and with genuine Jewish feeling. Rabbi Rappoport raises the question as to whether there exists a distincely Jewish charity or whether all charities are alike. There are many who contend that you cannot differentiate between one charity and another; that charity has world-wide uniformity as does science and therefore charity cannot have a national physiognomy.</p>
   <p>In a truly Jewish manner we would like to answer this question by asking, if there is no distinctly Jewish charity, how is it that Jews are building their own charitable institutions?</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The state is readily willing to accept Jewish orphans and the aged into state institutions and provide them food and shelter, yet Jews build their own institutions to take care of these unfortunates. Then to, this is not done because of a religious stand-point. There are many institutions which are not particular about serving food in a Kosher manner, such as the Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago, yet these institutions are Jewish. We feel there is a distinctly Jewish charity. By building special Jewish charitable institutions we show that we are not only interested in helping our brothers and sisters and children when they are ill or in need, but that we are interested in providing them with Jewish atmosphere, Jewish education, and Jewish sentiment. We want our charity institutions to strengthen the Jewish soul and we desire our aged to feel perfectly at home.</p>
   <p>If these facts tend to prove that there is a distinctly Jewish charity then the question arises: What is this Jewish charity and how does it differ from other charities? And, Rabbi Rappoport comes to the conclusion that it is <span class="page-break">3</span>sentiment, religious sentiment if you wish, that makes our charity institutions Jewish, for it is our religious spirit which gives our charity its high moral and ethical values. Without this spirit our institutions would be totally without soul and warmth.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Rappoport goes on to show the difference between Jewish charity and Christian charity, a difference arising from the fact that both charities have a thoroughly different physiognomy. "The Jewish spirit which drives the Jew to give charity," says he, "seems to save him who accepts it, while the Christian spirit which drives him to give charity tends to save him who gives. The non-Jew, by giving charity redeems his sins and buys a place for himself in the next world. A Jew gives charity so that his heart should not pain when he sees his fellow-man in suffering. 'Blessed are those who give,' said our wise men, 'but he who gives freely and with friendliness shall be blessed a thousand fold,' and at another time they said, "The character of true charity should be measured by the friendliness and soul- <span class="page-break">4</span>fulness with which it is given."</p>
   <p>Having made this diagnosis and concluding that distinctly Jewish charity exists, Rabbi Rappoport goes on to the "New Charity," the scientific and organized charity. He realizes that circumstances have caused organization to take place, but doubts very much whether this "scientific" charity, is at all charity in the true Jewish spirit.</p>
   <p>"We point with pride to the very fine structures we have provided for our aged and orphaned and sick. Jews should be congratulated for the manner in which they contribute. But, we quarrel with the way in which it is given. We doubt whether writing a check and sending it to a charity institution carries with it any of the sentiment and understanding that personal contact with that institution gives."</p>
   <p>Perhaps Rabbi Rappoport has carried this a bit too far and painted this picture a bit too black, but it is indeed interesting that there is an attempt to keep alive this old Jewish spirit.</p>
