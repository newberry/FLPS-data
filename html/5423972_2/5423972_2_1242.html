   <p>Recently, we are hearing too many shooting stories in Jewish life. Lately, the Jewish children have taken to the revolver in settling various disputes. And killing is no longer an exceptional thing with Jews.</p>
   <p>Every honest and loyal Jew would rather see the past when a Jew feared a gun than the present when Jewish children use guns as toys and cause death and corruption.</p>
   
   <p>The heroism - not fearing death - is not a phenomenon of courage, but of arrogance and dissoluteness. The true hero, although he does not fear death, precludes everything that will bring about death. To live, one must have the courage of the greatest hero.</p>
