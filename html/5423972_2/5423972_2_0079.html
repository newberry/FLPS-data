   <p>Many people still believe that the problem of Jewish education is a matter of schools, curriculums, system of instruction, etc. The fact of the matter is that the problem of Jewish education is primarily a problem of the Jewish family. If there is no Jewish atmosphere and no Jewish spirit prevailing in the family, no schools and no curriculums will be of any avail. A child brought up without any Jewish traditions can only acquire Hebrew as he acquires Latin. It will mean nothing more to him than the knowledge of a dead language, for if the knowledge of Hebrew alone were to make a Jewish child feel and think like a Jew, then all those non-Jewish children and non-Jewish adults who know Hebrew could be Jews, but they are not. There are hundreds of Arabic children in Palestine who speak an excellent Hebrew. They have such a mastery of the language that it is often difficult to distinguish them from non-Jewish (sic) children. They use it to perfection, but <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>still they are Arabic and not Jewish children. We know of any number of Gentile scholars who know Hebrew as well as our own Hebrew scholars, but still they are not Jewish but Gentiles, and in many cases they are anti-Semites. One must thus forget the idea that Hebrew is the essential of Jewish education. It is essential to the Jewish education, but not the sole factor of the Jewish education. The greatest factor is the Jewish family. There are tens of thousands of Jewish children in Eastern Europe whose Jewish education has been much neglected and is being neglected, but still all these children will grow up to be devoted Jews. There are millions of Jews in Eastern Europe who know little about Hebrew and less about Jewish history and literature, but still they are good Jews, because they have Jewish traditions, because in the families where they have been brought up there prevailed a Jewish spirit, a typical Jewish atmosphere. When the Jewish family is no longer Jewish in the sense that it does not continue Jewish traditions, then the children of that family will not grow up to be and upon reaching the age of maturity they will not be animated by Jewish sentiments and no amount of Jewish education will change their state <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of mind. We do not under-estimate the educational and moral value of the Jewish school. We know that it is absolutely essential to a Jewish education, but it would be shortsighted to imagine that the Jewish school will do much good if there is no Jewish atmosphere prevailing in the family. The sooner our educators understand this the sooner all those concerned with the Jewish education will begin to lay stress on the value of Jewish traditions and Jewish atmosphere in the family, the better for them and the better for the Jewish children.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately the Jewish family in America is not the same that it has been in the Old Country. For one reason or another it has lost its traditions and the new surroundings and new conditions of life have greatly contributed to kill its original atmosphere. The old piety is gone, the old respect for age and learning is gone, the old naivate is gone, and the old valuation of matters Jewish has gone. To revive the Jewish education and to place it on a solid basis, so that it will be productive of results, necessitates the moral reconstruction of the Jewish family. Before the parents will be <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>willing to give their children a Jewish education, they must first be willing to be Jews themselves. Before they continue Jewish traditions they must first keep up with Jewish traditions themselves, and we therefore believe that a sort of a Jewish revival is necessary before Jewish education in America will see better days and better results.</p>
   <p>How this revival is to be brought about is not for us to tell. The leaders of the community, rabbis and laymen alike, when assembled in conference to discuss this all important (sic) matter might find ways and means how to construct the Jewish family morally and spiritually, that is to say, how to bring the adults nearer to Judaism. When the adults will be brought nearer to Judaism, then the Jewish educational problem will be very much simplified. A Jew who is conscious of his Judaism, and proud of his Judaism, will be ready to make all sorts of sacrifices to give their (sic) children a Jewish education, and then there will be plenty of money to start new schools and to improve and better the old ones.</p>
