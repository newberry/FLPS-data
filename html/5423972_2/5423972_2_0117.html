   <p>Dr. Joseph Klausner, Professor of modern Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, whose Jesus of Nazareth has recently appeared in English translation, deserves worthy American disciples. It is regrettable that the general public, Jewish and Gentile, lay and clerical, should first learn about Klausner's book through such a man as Rabbi Wise. Whatever a Jew may think of Klausner's treatment of the difficult problem of Jesus and the modern Jew, he is bound to feel that his views are the result of deep research and profound reflection. But it is a far cry from the quiet methods of the scholarly Klausner to the rhetoric of Dr. Wise.</p>
   <p>Dr. Wise is either fortunate or unfortunate--depending upon one's point of view--in that he is regarded by the city editors as good "copy". Two weeks ago he saw fit to introduce Klausner's book to his congregation. The inevitable result was that on the following day the newspapers devoted an eight-column, screaming headline to the sermon, and the [New York] world featured the <span class="page-break">\2</span>story on the front page. "'Jews Must Accept Jesus,' Rabbi Says," was the way the World put it; "'Nazarene not a Myth and His Teachings Must be Adopted by Hebrew,' Wise Adds," read the sub-head. The first paragraph stated: "Standing before a crowded congregation yesterday Rabbi Wise of the Free Synagogue declared that, contrary to Hebraic teachings, Jesus of Nazareth was not a myth, but a man; and that the Jews must accept the teachings of Jesus."</p>
   <p>We have had the "Jesus cult" with us for some time. This is not the first time Rabbi Wise, as well as the other Reform rabbis, has availed himself of the opportunity to utter opinions regarding the personality and teachings of Jesus and the relation of the Jews toward Him during the Christmas season. Dr. Alexander Lyons had done the same thing time and again during the past two decades. Rabbi H. G. Enelow published a book in 1920 entitled A Jewish View of Jesus, The Jew, with an introduction by Dr. David Starr Jordan. Back in 1875 the late Joseph Jacobs issued anonymously As Others See Him, an imaginary story supposedly written by a Jewish scribe in Alexandria in the year 54 A.D. Last spring this <span class="page-break">\3</span>book was reprinted, and Dr. Wise delivered a sermon on the subject matter in Jacobs' book. "I find in Jesus," declared Dr. Wise, "a great, dominant, changeless, Jewishness from the beginning to the end. No one is as completely and truly Jewish as Jesus. Because Christians affirm the Christ, shall we Jews deny Jesus? Jesus was a Jew; Jesus was a man. As Jew, as man, we Jews glory in the humanness and the Jewishness of Him who was most human and most Jewish."</p>
   <p>Sixteen years earlier, Claude G. Montifiore published The Synoptic Gospels, wherein he showed that many Gospel teachings were derived from Hebrew sources. At the same time he urged modern Jews to incorporate certain Gospel doctrines into the Jewish religion. The publication of Montifiore's work called forth Ahad Ha'am's famous polenical essay, "Between Two Stools," which is probably the finest modern presentation of the fundamental differences between the Jewish and Christian Weltanschauungen. Mr. Montifiore's book was followed several years later by the two volumes Studies in Pharisaism and the Gospels by Israel Abrahams of Cambridge which are a permanent contribution to any study on the subject. Even among the Yiddish writers there are to be found some whose view of Jesus is similar to <span class="page-break">\4</span>that of Wise--Dr. Chaim Zhitlowsky, for instance.</p>
   <p>Now what is it all about? What did Klausner set out to show in his book? The central problem of any study of the life of Jesus, says Klausner, is this: We are face to face with three important facts. In the first place, Jesus was born a Jew; He lived as a Jew; He died a Jew. In the second place, the disciples--His thirteen original disciples--gradually deserted the Jewish religion. In the third place (and this is the core of the matter), the overwhelming majority of the Jewish people utterly rejected the teachings of Jesus during His lifetime and have since then refused to accept any part of the Christian religion. How is this fact to be explained?</p>
   <p>The tradition Christian explanation is that the Jews hardened their hearts against the benign teachings of Jesus, just as God had hardened the heart of Pharaoh against the pleadings of Moses. In other words, in the drama of Salvation, the Jews (it was God's Will) played the parts of villains. Another explanation offered is that Saul of Tarsus, afterward known as Saul the Apostle, introduced Greek and <span class="page-break">\5</span>heathen elements into the Judaic teachings of the Jews, and, thereby, created a Christian religion which the Jews found unacceptable. Klausner rejects both hypotheses. It is not necessary to argue with Jews that the ancient church teaching that the Jews, out of pure spite, rejected Jesus Christ is absurd. Nor is it reasonable to suppose that Pauline Christianity could ever have come into existence unless there was something in the very essence of Jesus' teachings which made such a development possible--if not inevitable.</p>
   <p>It is not correct to say, as Wise so confidently asserted, that Judaism teaches that Jesus was a myth. Not at all. Maimonides, for instance, distinctly asserts that Jesus lived, and that He was an Adam Gadol, a great man. The historicity of Jesus is taken for granted. Certain scholars have advanced the theory that Jesus is a myth: for instance, Arthur Drews and Ernest Haeckel. Jews have never troubled themselves on this point. It no more matters to the Jews whether Jesus really lived or someone else was the author of the teachings attributed to Him, than whether Shakespeare wrote the plays which go by his name. The important thing is that the <span class="page-break">\6</span>teachings of Jesus are very real, and someone, by whatever name he may be known, undoubtedly inspired them.</p>
   <p>Nor is it a novel doctrine that Jesus was a Jew by birth. The disciples of Jesus were Orthodox, pious Jews. The disciples confined their efforts to Jerusalem. The teachings of Jesus spread among the Palestinean Jews, Hellenized Jews, and Gentiles. The conservative faction, or Judaeo-Christians, was led by James, the brother of Jesus. They insisted that proselytes must first become Jews before accepting the Gospel of Jesus. Not only must the proselytes be circumcised, but they must also bind themselves to observe both the written and oral law. Had not Jesus himself said: "Until heaven and earth shall pass away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law till everything in it be done;" and "He who relaxes a single one of the very least of these commandments and teaches men, so shall he be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven". And "Ye worship that which we know not; we worship that which we know; for Salvation is from the Jews." The Judaeo-Christians continually lost <span class="page-break">\7</span>ground, and in time played no part in the history of Christianity.</p>
   <p>Quite different was the attitude of the Palestinean Jews who lived in a heathen environment, in Alexandria, where many heathen had become proselytes. The Palestinean Jews in Alexandria conceived of Judaism as a universal religion opposed to idolatry and emphasizing monotheism. The Gentile Christians went further. Never having been Jews, they refused to see in Christianity a variety of Judaism; they considered it a new, distinct religion of Salvation.</p>
   <p>No Jew has any quarrel with Christians who profess to see in Jesus the fountainhead of their religion. It is their own concern. But it is more than presumptuous to preach a "Jesus cult" to Jews because they have felt instinctively all these centuries that there is nothing in common between Judaism and Christianity. To speak of Jesus independently of the Christian religion as it has developed throughout the ages, is to be devoid of historic perspective. Jesus and Christianity are one and indivisible. To accept one means to accept both.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>Klausner almost admits this much. "What," he asks in the concluding chapter, "is Jesus to the Jewish nation at the present day? To the Jewish nation. He can be neither God nor the Son of God; neither can He be to the Jewish nation the Messiah, Prophet, Lawgiver or the Founder of a new religion; neither is He a Pharisaic Rabbi. But Jesus is, for the Jewish nation, a great teacher of morality and an artist in parable." Fate has spun a story around the death of a Jew called Jesus--a legend and a myth. The story without the legend has no significance. To tear out the myth of Jesus is to tear out the heart of the Christian religion. Once upon a time Jesus belonged to the Jewish people. He no longer does. He cannot be reclaimed to the Jews unless the Jews are willing to embrace Christianity. It is too late--eighteen hundred years too late!--to ask the Jews today to "accept" Jesus. Let the Christians do it first!</p>
