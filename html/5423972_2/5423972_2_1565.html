   <p>The hearing regarding State Auditor Russell's demand that a receiver be appointed for the 16th Street Bank was held yesterday before Judge Fell.</p>
   <p>The State Auditor based his demand on the fact that $175,000 would be required to reopen the bank, and since the depositors had not as yet raised that sum, a receiver should be appointed.</p>
   <p>William Cuneo and Daniel Yuretz, attorneys for the defense, asked Judge Fell to give them a few days to raise the necessary sum.</p>
   <p>Judge Fell gave both attorneys time to make good their promises. Mr. Yuretz claims that $150,000 will be raised by the depositors. About 1,000 depositors held a meeting yesterday at the Lebavitcher Congregation, 15th and Clifton Park, where they subscribed to $10,000 in cash.</p>
