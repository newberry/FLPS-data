   <p>We are informed that the Sinai Congregation has resolved to abolish all the Hebrew prayers with the exception of Sheman and Borchoo, from their ritual. This congregation worships according to Minhag Einhorn, but from time to time new reforms are introduced. So has the reading of the weekly portion of the Torah been cut down to only a few verses which are selected by the Rabbi ad libitum and neither the three nor the seven yearly cycle is strictly followed.</p>
