   <p>Dr Stone, a well-known Chicago clergyman, claims that eighty per cent of all Jews are infidels. He learned this news from the Protestant synod in Chicago. From which sources have the Protestants of Chicago learned what percentage of the Jews are believers and what percentage are not: From the missionaries, from the converted Jews who want to impress their bosses, the clergymen, with their importance. This is their source of information. Dr. Stone thinks as a Christian clergyman because Christianity differentiates between believers, infidels, heretics, heathens, and pagan but Judaism does not differentiate that way at all but says, "A Jew who has sinned is still a Jew". There are no infidels among Jews. If Dr. Stone is worried so much about infidels, let him first look around and see how many infidels there are among Christians. Not eighty but ninety-seven per cent.</p>
