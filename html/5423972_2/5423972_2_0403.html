   <p>The shy personality that is Benjamin Nathan Cardozo was in Chicago this week to receive an honorary degree from the University of Chicago, and incidentally to address the alumni of the Law School of that institution.</p>
   <p>We Jews have often been accused of being too social-minded, as contrasted to the rugged individualism of what we hope, indeed, is a past epoch. Yet it is an accusation in which we can indeed glory, for it is increasingly in evidence that our sole hope of escaping a glorious smashup lies in just that social- mindedness. As Justice Cardozo reminded the alumni, if the law does not keep pace with the peace, then the people may do without the law. When special interests are being made to account for trusteeship, it is well to remember that fact when the cries about "unconstitutionality" rend the air.</p>
