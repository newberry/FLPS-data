   <p>The first collection of Ma-oth Hitim [practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy] was made yesterday. Five congregations contributed $685--a very fine start. It has been estimated that 10,000 pounds of mazoth [unleavened bread] will be necessary to supply the needy.</p>
   <p>The committee will accept contributions at Congregation Anshe Knesses Israel. Applications for mazoth will also be accepted there. Needy persons are asked to present their applications as soon as possible.</p>
