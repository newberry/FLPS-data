   <p>A few members of the Workmen's Circle have written and some have telephoned Mr. Cohan, editor of the Forward and writer of this article, concerning the question of the immigrants and their American born children. Most of them inquired about the open forum which the Forward will conduct.</p>
   <p>The debate is free to everybody, but there will be some limitations. Preference will be given to members of the Workmen's Circle.</p>
   <p>School teachers and social workers particularly interested in the Jewish School movement of America, are welcome to participate in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the discussions.</p>
   <p>People who wish to submit arguments on the negative side of the debate will receive prompt attention.</p>
   <p>This debate will be conducted along non-partisan lines, and with the aim of giving the public an opportunity to get acquainted with both sides of the question.</p>
   <p>Let us return now, to the theme of last Saturday. The discussion concerned the assimilation of the Jewish-American children with their foreign-born parents. All sorts of plans were recommended to accomplish this result. According to the author's viewpoint, these solutions will have an opposite effect.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Instead of welding together these two generations, it will only put a big wall between them. As we have already noticed, the Yiddish as it is spoken in the Jewish-American home, cannot serve as mortar between children and parents.</p>
   <p>Parents must acquaint themselves with the now unfamiliar problems of the American life to which their children belong. If they do not do this, instead of helping their children to understand and to know themselves, they will only aggravate the situation.</p>
   <p>We are recommending here that the older generation should strive to get closer to the children and become familiar with their spiritual interests, ambitions and tastes, in order to get acquainted <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>with the world that surrounds and influences our youth. The effect of the Jewish School movement directly or indirectly is not a help, but a hinderance.</p>
   <p>The question is not so much how we teach Yiddish to the American youth, but rather the nourishing of a spiritual development to envelope the child and the parents in closer understanding.</p>
   <p>The term "Yiddish Culture," has a strange and odd meaning. It is closely linked with a special sort of Yiddish culture for which a certain group in Poland is working now. To this group belongs the Jewish speaking Socialistic movement, representing a minority. The kind of cultural Judaism which dominates there, is the so called Zionistic culture with which we are not concerned here.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Is the Jewish culture, as taught in the American Jewish Schools, closely welded with that of the European schools?</p>
   <p>It is impossible to force upon our children a brand of European culture.</p>
   <p>Those children who are attending college or high school or even those who are in the higher grades in grammar school are already familiar with American culture. Only one out of a thousand is perhaps acquainted with Yiddish culture. The foreign parents and the Yiddish instructors who think they can read and understand the thoughts of the younger generation are mistaken.</p>
   <p>The students themselves are imparting a Yiddish culture which is strange even to the teachers.</p>
   <p>It is not only a question of language, but of every cultural ideal.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>On all sides we hear complaints made by teachers that their students are very cynical towards them as well as towards the Yiddish studies. This is not because they despise it, but because the spiritual world as represented in the American Yiddish school does not appeal to their intellect.</p>
   <p>Comrade Gelber of Weika, Texas, suggests that the Workmen's Circle should not send out Yiddish lecturers, but should send English speakers instead, since the young Jewish generation does not understand Yiddish, and is not interested in Yiddish speeches.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gelber thinks that Jewish speakers are needed for the older Jews who are unable to understand English.</p>
   <p>The speakers should have a complete understanding of American life.</p>
   <p>However, should a competent European speaker arrive here, he should be heartily received and welcomed.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>It is absolutely essential to have lecturers who are Americanized and who know the English language and understand the life of the American Jewish children. Lecturers who are familiar with the American culture could wield a powerful influence upon their listeners.</p>
   <p>Competent Jewish lecturers who are able to talk about American topics that are of interest not only to the members of the Workmen's Circle, but also to the Jewish public in general, are of importance to the movement. Unfortunately the number of such speakers is very limited.</p>
   <p>Such speakers could acquaint the older Jews with their adopted country and with their children's country. They could also help the children <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>to understand their parents.</p>
   <p>Concerning English lecturers, Mr. Gelber recommends that it would be of great benefit to the old as well as to the new generation, if Mr. Norman Thomas would be signed for a lecture tour. He would add zest and vigor in this order and it would attract the young as well as the old generation towards this movement. This would be a good start towards attracting the youth into this movement. Tours for other speakers may be arranged later.</p>
   <p>The young generation and the circumstances that embrace the Workmen's Circle in particular have long ago outlived the old systems in policy and essence. The educational committee is suffering from deterioration and stagnation.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>Comrade Gelber advises that we Americanize this order, and rejuvenate the movement.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gelber is not the only one who holds that opinion. The question is a very urgent one; the sooner the old methods are revised the faster a new life will spring forth, a life which will be nearer to our present environments and conditions. It will be better for the Workmen's Circle and for the Socialistic movement.</p>
   <p>We are considering the reasons why the children are becoming estranged from the Workmen's Circle. We also hear about older members of the order, who lost interest because of their American children and their youthful influence upon them. The parents became so Americanized that they have severed connections with the party.</p>
   <p>We are not speaking of members who turned conservative, but of those who were at one time staunch radicals.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Maybe these people developed along those lines by coming into close contact with American life and culture, but they are still Socialists at heart.</p>
   <p>We are not merely concerned about what language they speak. There are a good many such comrades who are conversing in Yiddish at home, but on the outside speak English.</p>
   <p>The Workmen's Circle is one of our greatest accomplishments. We are very proud of it. We all want to see it bloom and expand, not only with our generation, but also with the generations to come.</p>
   <p>My interest in the life of the Workmen's Circle is a very deep one. (Mr. Cohan's opinion)</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>The theme is not nearly completed. There are numerous important points to be discussed. But, these articles will suffice as an introduction to the subject.</p>
