   <p>The South Side ladies tailoring employers, who are determined to destroy completely the Union, woke up to the fact that they could not do away with it entirely, so they have undertaken to organize a company union of their own scabs. They promised these scabs many good things which they know they can't fulfill. On the other hand the scabs do not expect anything.</p>
   <p>These very bosses, who are Jews and belong to various synagogues, advertised in the Daily News for help preferring Gentiles. One of the employers of the Custom Ladies' Tailors submitted this advertisement.</p>
   <p>The South Side bosses who combat the Union are greatly mistaken when they think that by such methods, they will win their struggle.</p>
   
   <p>Jewish employers and Jewish workers should better understand each other and the bosses should not have admitted any anti-Semitic advertisements which defames the entire Bosses Association.</p>
