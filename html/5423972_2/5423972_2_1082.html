   <p>There is a large collection of Oriental Jews in Chicago who mix or assimilate very little with the other Jews. This is mostly on account of the difference in language, not being able to converse with one another, there cannot exist anything in common between them.</p>
   <p>The modern Zionist is compared to the legend of Elijah, the prophet, whose aim was to unite the Jews of the entire world. The leaders of Zion here in the city have arranged a meeting for the purpose of getting better acquainted with one another. Mr. M. Abrams, secretary of the Executive Committee, Knights of Zion, will be the honored speaker, and will speak in the Hebrew language. A Zion council of each Chicago Gate is being represented by three delegates. This meeting is for the sole purpose of Zion propaganda in the city.</p>
   
   <p>This will be a local undertaking and will work hand in hand with all local Zionistic activities where it is needed most.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Saul Silber of Ahavah Sholom and Mr. Max Shulman will speak on the question of getting the Persian and other Jews united.</p>
