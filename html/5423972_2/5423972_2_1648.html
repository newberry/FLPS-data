   <p>Very often the question of the small businessmen arises, the retailers of various products, the "small" and "medium-sized" storekeepers, and their "state of slavery". They go about their business, opening very early and closing very late. They keep their stores open at all hours of the day and night, every day of the week, so that they may serve their customers at any time. Often a movement has been started to find ways and means of lightening their burden; which day should be their Sabbath; which evening should they have for rest; when should they be able to spend a few hours at home with their families, or go to a meeting or an entertainment, the theater, or visit friends, or receive friends in their own home.</p>
   <p>On one occasion it so happened that an undertaking in this field proved to be somewhat successful. The Butchers and Grocers Association of Chicago succeeded, <span class="page-break">2</span>for several years, in carrying through their plan to close their stores at noon on Thursdays, and all day on Sundays. Certain organizations of clerks succeeded in working out a schedule for their work--even though their employers did not approve it--allowing them certain times during the week when they could be at home with their wives and could become better acquainted with their children.</p>
   <p>Also in the sphere of Jewish business, it has already happened that clothing stores, shoe stores, and the like, have managed to have their stores close at definite hours, thus enabling both the clerks and the proprietors to have some free time to spend with their families.</p>
   <p>But the Jewish grocers have no day, no night, no Sabbath (Saturday), and no Sunday; and oftimes even on Jewish holidays, as on general holidays [observed <span class="page-break">3</span>by the American people], they are also chained to their business. And not only are the hired clerks affected in this way, but many times we find that father, mother, and children old enough to help in the store, are all enslaved to the store from early morning until late at night, and have no time, at all to refresh their spirits with a little amusement or fresh air. They do not even have an opportunity to attend a movie. As for the younger children, they roam the streets and the alleys without any parental supervision; there they learn such "nice" things that their parents will certainly be "proud" of them in the years to come. The youngsters become truants because their fathers cannot take the time to handle them. Everything goes to ruin and sooner or later all suffer the consequences.</p>
   <p>Should you ask a grocer how much his stock is worth, how much does he owe the wholesaler, does he make a decent living from his business, does he save anything for his later years--he will not know what answer to give. Do you know <span class="page-break">4</span>why? Because he has no books; he has no time to keep track of his stock; he does not know where he stands in his account with the wholesaler. Ask him whether he is making money or losing money, how much do his customers owe him--he doesn't know. He is too busy in the store and too hard-driven by his work to know anything. Finally, should you ask him, "Does the store belong to you or to the wholesaler? Or perhaps you belong to the store?" he would still not know what to answer!</p>
   <p>Now let us get down to the point concerning the remedy for these Jewish grocers. First of all he should keep the store entirely closed one day a week, and have the day completely to himself. Let him fulfill his obligation to his wife and children at least one day a week, let him also take stock of his business that he may know his exact standing therein. Let him close his store, four times a week, let us say, at 7 P.M., on Fridays at 6 P.M.; on Saturdays let <span class="page-break">5</span>him be closed all day and open in the evening from 6 to 10, and on Thursdays also until 10 P.M. Of course a week before Passover or other holidays he should keep open later every day.</p>
   <p>If the grocers should thus organize their work they would derive many benefits. They would have time to keep books and would know more about their business and their standing. Then they would have time for themselves, for their wives and children, and for their friends.</p>
   <p>However, one swallow maketh not summer, and a grocer cannot be so ambitious as to wish to be a civilized being on a par with others. For, to attain that you must be organized and demand support and friendly aid from the whole community, that is, the customer must also help. The Jewish grocers must all unite, and no one should remain aloof. Everyone must be loyal to the organization and follow all rules in regard to the time the stores should be kept <span class="page-break">6</span>open or closed. Everything should be conducted by the officers which such an organization may elect. The grocers should form a strong solid chain without a single weak link, for a chain is no stronger than its weakest link. No one should be envious of another, and no one should act the smart aleck and ridicule the rest. United we stand, divided we fall!</p>
   <p>Organize yourselves properly and make your organization strong that no one may flaunt any of the rules that you may formulate. Demand of all the Jewish women of Chicago, your customers, that they give you the right to live as respectable human beings, that you may spend some time with your families, and lead the life of a respectable man and a respectable Jew.</p>
