   <p>The late Dr. Zamenhoff, the inventor of the universal language "Esperanto" announced some time ago, that at first he planned to suggest that Yiddish be the universal language, but as a Jew he feared the world would laugh at him for suggesting the language of the Jew, spoken by Jews the world over.</p>
   <p>The particular reason, that Yiddish is spoken by Jews in every corner of the globe, was sufficient guaranty to Dr. Zamenhoff that the Yiddish language possesses the basic qualities, which are necessary for a universal language. But even Dr. Zamenhoff never dreamed that the Yiddish language would become a sort of medium between the English, French and Germans.</p>
   <p>A Jewish soldier, in the English trenches on the battlefields of Northern France, tells how he is able to converse with prisoners of war and wounded <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Germans in the vernacular Yiddish. The conditions of the prisoners in general and the wounded in particular are miserable enough, but it is much worse when the enemy speaks in a foreign and incomprehensible language. Here in such a circumstance, the Jew comes forth with his vernacular language as an encouraging prophet.</p>
   <p>And the Jews in the British and French trenches, through their knowledge of Yiddish, are able to fulfill a highly humanitarian mission in the very midst of death and destruction.</p>
   <p>This is where Yiddish serves its purpose.</p>
