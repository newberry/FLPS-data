   <p>The Chicago Rabbinate triumphed yesterday when they prevented the delegates of the Order B'nai Abraham from departing for their convention in Buffalo on Saturday afternoon as was previously planned. The departure was deferred until Saturday evening.</p>
   <p>Brother Jennessey, chief leader of the Progressive Order of the Western Star and a delegate to the convention of the Order B'nai Abraham, declared in a speech that the lodges will not permit any rabbi to show his authority in matters pertaining to the lodges, and as a matter of "principle" the delegates would leave Saturday--in order to show the rabbis that they should not interfere in other people's affairs again. Brother Barnett, however, defended the rabbis and declared that it would be a disgrace to Chicago Jewry to leave on Saturday afternoon. After considerable deliberation it was decided that the delegates should charter a Saturday evening train.</p>
