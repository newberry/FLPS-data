   <p>Our beloved Chicago is a merry little town. For every hundred marriages there are twenty-five divorces. Every fourth man and every fourth woman of Chicago have gone through the divorce court. To get a divorce in Chicago is as easy as falling off a log.</p>
   <p>Once upon a time girls got married because they wanted a home, a husband, and a family. Today, they get married because they want to have a good time, to go to cabarets, and to spend money freely. If the husband cannot afford it, the young woman rushes to the divorce court, complains that he was cruel to her, enacts a comedy, and gets alimony and a divorce. Really, why should a young woman who wants a good time, assume duties and responsibilities when she can get alimony and be free from any responsibility?</p>
   <p>The mothers are to blame for this. It is their fault that their daughters are <span class="page-break">2</span>wild. It is the mothers who take father's hard-earned money and give it, on the sly, to their daughters for powder, paint, lipstick, and silk stockings, and permit them to lead a life of irresponsibility, indifference and freedom from obligation.</p>
