   <p>Today, in the Downtown Auditorium Hotel, the National Convention of Lithuanians in America will be opened. It is to last three days and was called for the purpose of aiding Lithuania at the Peace Conference to be recognized as an independent country.</p>
   <p>The convention will voice a protest of local Lithuanians against the Poles who are trying to absorb their country besides continuing their pogroms on Jews.</p>
   <p>Laporte, a prominent Lithuanian recently returned from Europe, will <span class="page-break">\2</span>tell of Jewish conditions. The Lithuanians invited Judge Mack and Adolph Kroiz and also requested all Jews to go to the Auditorium tonight, for they too are victimized by their common foe, - the Poles, - who wish to absorb Lithuania, Ukrainia and the Jews living there in order to secure greatness and power for themselves.</p>
   <p>On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday all meetings will be held at the Morrison Hotel.</p>
   <p>They plan to carry on an active campaign against this absorption by the Poles.</p>
   <p>S. Geguzis is president of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. The lawyer Francis Bradchulis, Dr. K. Drangelis, and Stanley Kadus are <span class="page-break">\3</span>the other officials of the convention.</p>
