   <p>Trade unionism does not create, or dares not create, any racial or religious discrimination. The principle of trade unionism is to embrace and unite all workers under one banner, regardless of what race or religion the worker adheres to. Trade unionism struggles for amelioration of the lot of the working class, materially and morally, Trade unionism protects the gains of the working class.</p>
   <p>What difference does it make whether the workers are Jews, Germans, or Irish? They are all equally exploited, suppressed, and robbed of their human rights, and it is in their interests to be united because it is better to fight with united forces against this exploitation.</p>

   <p>And yet in reality it isn't so; practically in every trade, where Jews and Gentiles can be found, an anti-Semitic spirit prevails. Not only does the anti-Semitism prevail within their hearts and minds, but they also expose their Jewish enmity by practical tactics. This we know has occurred, and is still occurring in the carpenter's trade and in other trades where this Jewish hostility has caused the Jewish workers trouble. Not only were charters revoked from independent Jewish locals, but hundreds, or perhaps thousands, of young men are exposed to hunger and want due to this disgraceful anti-Semitism.</p>
   <p>For the past few months, similar Jew baiting is appearing among the bakers. The Baker's Union considers itself as the most radical union in the country, and their constitution is supported by the Socialist platform, and yet an anti-Semitic spirit prevails there in full swing.</p>

   <p>Do not the Jew and the German work equally hard and bitter in the bakeries? Aren't, then, their afflictions to both common? Yet, the German workers stepped out with disgraceful accusations against the Jewish workers, and have attacked the Jewish workers with all sorts of slanders.</p>
   <p>It is understood that their false accusations do not hold any ground. The Jewish workers are as loyal to the union as the Germans. They have, also, fought bitterly in order to improve the baking trade, perhaps with more devotion than the Germans. There is no reason to hold any prejudice against the Jewish workers, with the exception that the Germans instinctively hate the Jews.</p>

   <p>Recently the Jewish hatred has been greatly dispersed. A few German Baker Locals made a proposal to call a special convention of all baker locals to treat this cursed Jewish question. This proposal is the most disgraceful ever made by an international body.</p>
   <p>The proposal, for the special convention, will be put up to a referendum vote to all members of the Bakers' Alliance. It is needless to remark that the Jewish workers, as well as the more enlightened German workers, will apply their entire energy and work to vote down this vile, anti-Semitic proposal.</p>
   <p>Who will triumph by these animosities and quarrels? There are no two answers to this question. It is clear to all, that as soon as workers create ill-feeling among themselves peace and unity can no longer continue, so it follows that the bosses profit by this. They (the bosses) are impatiently awaiting such good and suitable moments in order to intensify exploitation.</p>

   <p>As war requires unity in the rank of an army in order to combat the enemy so do the workers in a trade require unity in order to protect their interest and to combat their common enemy - their boss.</p>
