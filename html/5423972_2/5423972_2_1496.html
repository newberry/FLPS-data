   <p>The religious year of 5638 draws to an end. It may therefore be proper now, at the closing of the year 5638 of our religious calendar, to review what we have accomplished in this year, and how the ensuing 5639 will find us.</p>
   <p>Our Jewish community of this city seems to be not in a position to act unitedly and in harmony in any general movement which concerns our race and religion. Since the great Fire has dispersed the members of the various congregations into different parts of the city, there seems to be a general disability in congregational matters. There are members, for instance, living miles away in the northern and western parts of the city, who belong to a congregation in the southern part. They had joined that congregation many years before the great fire; they have relatives and friends in the burial ground of their congregation, and stand in friendly connection with the other members. They cannot, therefore, resign their membership there and join another congregation which is nearer to their dwelling-place. They continue their membership by paying their dues, but cannot take any active part in the management <span class="page-break">\2</span>of their congregation. The synagogue is too far from their house for them to be able to attend service. They seldom even can attend the business meetings of the members. Hence, no energetic united action can be accomplished. The few members living near the synagogue are those who take the most active part in congregational labors,and cliques and clans are a national consequence; damaging the religious principles for which a congregation should work. If a quorum of members are "drummed" together for a meeting, they invariably vote according to the biased opinion of the few leaders.</p>
   <p>Again, the Sabbath is the best business day in the week. The gentlemen have therefore no time to attend service. But the Sabbath is also the best day for shopping, and the ladies who must attend to that important affair are compelled to have their housework done in the forenoon, and thus they have not time to attend the services at the synagogue. Thus, the ministers officiate before a <span class="page-break">\3</span>few old ladies, who are the judges of his work, and whose judgment influences the actions of their husbands and sons at the congregational meetings.</p>
   <p>There is not a respectable man but he belongs to two or three lodges of our secret orders. The meetings of the lodges are considered of greater importance than those of the congregation. They are certainly of immediate practical significance, inasmuch as the sick-benefit and the endowment funds are connected with them. There is a great deal of charity and benevolence shown by our Orders. But these Orders have no specific religious character. The pre-occupation with lodge affairs absorbs a great deal of the interest due to specifically religious congregational matters.</p>
   <p>Our Jewish educational matters have fared none the better during this year. Positively nothing has been done for the instruction of the children of poor parents - nothing by the community, although, perhaps something by a few isolated individuals.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Our charitable institutions? We have no hospital, no orphan asylum, no home for the aged and infirm of our poor brethren. We have a relief society and a few ladies' societies partly co-operating with it, partly working for themselves. A few occasional applicants have been assisted, a few poor families have been helped to food, fuel, clothing, and in cases of sickness. We have done what our means allowed us to do - the means of the charitable societies, namely.</p>
   <p>Our young men's culture and social affairs have been thriving much better. The young men's societies have had literary gatherings, social entertainments, and meetings for mutual improvement.</p>
   <p>As to the social standing and achievements of our community during the passing year, it is not different from that of other communities.</p>
