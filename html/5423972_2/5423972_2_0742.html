   <p>We wonder whether the Jews on the North-West Side of Chicago are quite God-forsaken. They are seventy five thousand in number and form by no means the poor section of the community, but still they are indifferent to the most outstanding, philanthropic and charitable problems of their neighborhood and are quite indifferent to the fate of five thousand Jewish children who are roaming around in the streets after school-time, or who visit missionary houses because there is no center for Jewish children where they can pass their free time as can the Jewish children of other sections.</p>
   <p>There is some sort of a center on the North-West Side--we refer to the Jewish Educational Alliance--but this center looks like the philanthropy of the North-West Side Jews. It is indeed a match to their philanthropic genius.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The Jewish Educational Alliance, on the North-West Side, is working with a budget of eight thousand dollars a year and if not for the superhuman efforts of its able superintendent, Miss Matilda Finkelstein,--this shadow of a center for Jewish children would have been out of existence long ago.</p>
   <p>Are the North-West Side Jews altogether God-forsaken? Have they no heart for the fate and future of these five thousand children in their neighborhood?</p>
   <p>While there is no center for Jewish children on the North-West Side worth mentioning, there are a number of missionary houses, the leaders of which are only too eager to accomodate the Jewish children and to do everything in their power to make them visit the missionary houses. There are, for instance, gymnasiums and swimming pools in these missionary houses while there is none in the Jewish Educational Alliance. These houses, where the minds of hundreds of Jewish children are being poisoned, can easily compete with the Jewish Educational Alliance in its present shabby shape.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The parents of these children, mostly working people, engaged in the struggle for existence during the best part of the day, cannot possibly take care of their children and only in too many cases, it is immaterial to them whether the children spend their time in a missionary house or somewhere else.</p>
   <p>Are not the Jews on the North-West Side in honor and duty bound to place the Jewish Educational Alliance on such a basis that it be at least in a position to compete with the missionary houses and are they not in honor and duty bound to provide for the children a place where they can spend their time after school? Of course, they are; but it seems that they do not know what Jewish duty and what Jewish honor is. Their attitude to the problem affecting the elementary Jewish interests of their own neighborhood, is a shame and a disgrace. What holds good of the attitude of the North-West Side Jews to the Educational Alliance also holds good to their attitude to the proposed Jewish infant home. The leaders of the movement for a Jewish infant home are campaigning for the last two months to raise the sum of one hundred <span class="page-break">\4</span>thousand dollars to build the home. Of course, the home is supposed to be not only for the North-West Side Jewish children but for the entire city of Chicago, but since it will be located on the North-West Side, it stands to reason that the Jews of the North-West Side will profit by it most, and what is the result of this campaign? The Jews on the West Side have contributed their share towards the fund of the Jewish infant home, but not so the Jews of the North-West Side. The Jewish business men of Milwaukee Avenue alone, prosperous and wealthy, could easily finance the hundred thousand dollars needed for the establishment of the home without injuring themselves but not one out of ten has so far done his duty. They all rely on the Jews of the other parts of the city.</p>
   <p>We could single out many other facts which will indicate the indifference of the North-West Side Jews to the vital and philanthropic problems of the neighborhood, but these are two demonstrations, we think are sufficient to convince our readers that the North-West Side Jews do not do their duty as Jews. Whenever it comes to representation on bodies dealing with communal <span class="page-break">\5</span>affairs, the North-West siders are the first to lay claim on adequate representation though by their achievements they do not deserve much recognition at all. There are a few noble minded philanthropic Jews on the North-West Side who carry the philanthropic burdens of the entire Jews in the neighborhood but the rest are indifferent and engaged in making money. We repeat that this is a shame and a disgrace and unless the North-West Side Jews begin to perform their duties as Jews they will earn the disrespect of their fellow-Jews.</p>
