   <p>The by-products, such as Matzoh-Meal, Matzoh-Farfel, Matzoh-Cake, etc, are wrapped in separate cartons.</p>
   <p>Jacob Redelheim, who is a member of the "Organization of Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada - Agudah," is a capable shrewd business man and devotes his entire time to the factory.</p>
