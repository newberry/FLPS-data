   <p>At one time, all the Jews knew what Judaism meant. Even if they were not familiar with the writings in Jewish books, they knew what the Jewish laws and traditions were. But as time went on, the Jews "progressed" a great deal, and today there are Jews who know much less about Judaism than a "Sabbath Goy" in the Old Country did. The freedom that Jews enjoy today throughout the world means--in many cases--freedom from Judaism.</p>
   <p>If there have ever been categories and types of knowledge--today we have categories and types of ignorance. I felt inclined to classify this phenomenon in the life of our people, and started to study the ignorance prevailing among the Jews and to divide the different kinds of ignorance into specific groups. I believe that you will be interested in the results of my "findings".</p>

   <p>The "most modern" Jews in Chicago--and I believe that this is true all over America--are those whose Jewish vocabulary consists of two words: gefullte fish and Mazel Tov (good luck or congratulations). They picked up the word gefullte fish in vaudeville shows, and Mazel Tov from their Gentile friends, who associate with Jews.</p>
   <p>A second category of "modern Jews in Chicago" knows more about Judaism. Their vocabulary consists of five words: gefullte fish, Mazel Tov, Yom Tov (Holiday), kosher ham and--Ganef (thief).</p>
   <p>A third category--somewhat old-fashioned--have a large Jewish vocabulary: gefullte fish, Mazel Tov, Yom Tov, kosher ham, kosher hot dogs, Mitzvah (good deed, or act of faith, or commandment), Cholent (food roasted in a covered pot), sacramental wine, Shul (synagogue), noodle soup, and Simhah (festival).</p>
   <p>A fourth category has a really extensive vocabulary and brags about its "knowledge". Its vocabulary consists of the following twenty-five words: gefullte <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>fish, Mazel Tov, Yom Tov, kosher, trefa, Mizvoh, Cholent, Mashkeh (liquor), Ganef, noodle soup, Simhah, Shabas, Palit (escape), pinochle, Hazir (pork), Behama (dumb animal), Lathen (to steal), potato pancakes, sacramental wine, onions, Mazoth, and Mazah balls.</p>
   <p>The "scholars" know a great deal more. They know what the following words mean: Shaytel (wig), Davnen (to pray), Tefilin (phylacteries), Nezuzah (religious symbol nailed on doorpost to guard the home against evil), Mazah Farfel (ground Mazah used in soup), cheese Blinzes (pancakes), Havdalah (prayer to indicate that the Sabbath is over), Kidush (prayer over the wine recited on Friday evening before the first Sabbath meal), Kalah (bride), Hasanah (wedding), Mehutan (very close relative of either bride or groom), Hasan (bridegroom), Shoteh (simpleton), etc.</p>
   <p>They have learned these words and use them at the wrong time. Recently I happened to interview a young Jewish man from the South, who presented himself as a great connoisseur of Judaism. He was full of Torah (Knowledge). I <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>listened to him use his knowledge of Yiddish and I was reminded of Sholom Aleichem's celebrated writings.....When he spoke of real estate, the young man remarked boldly, "And the Hasanah (wedding) was complete." When I asked him what a real-estate deal had to do with a wedding, he answered, "Well, isn't the closing of a real-estate deal a wedding?" He knew that Hasanah meant "wedding" in English, but he also believed that wedding had another meaning, i. e., the closing of a real-estate deal. I spoke to him a little more and found that he was familiar with the word Tisha Be-Av [Editor's note: Fast day in commemoration of the destruction of Jerusalem]. But he thought that Tisha Be-Av was the day on which a mother-in-law paid a visit to her daughter and son-in-law. When I explained the real meaning of Tisha Be-Av, he said angrily, "That's all bunk; I know better".</p>
   <p>In the course of my talk with the young man, who claims to be a scholar, and who sometimes delivers a sermon when the rabbi is either ill or on vacation, I learned a great many new Hebrew words. That is to say, I learned, for the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>first time, how a great many Hebrew words were interpreted by a modern American "scholar":</p>
   <p>Tisha Be-Av--the day when the mother-in-law pays a visit.</p>
   <p>Simhath Torah (Festival of rejoicing over the Torah)--the day when the mother-in-law leaves.</p>
   <p>Kidush--highball.</p>
   <p>Havdalah--the last drink before the party breaks up.</p>
   <p>Minyan (the prescribed number of worshippers for a public service)--a meeting of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>Halel (special Hallelujah prayer)--surplus stocks and dividends.</p>
   <p>Leshana Tovah (A Happy New Year)--a good balance sheet.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Hurban (reference to the destruction of the Temple)--bankrupt.</p>
   <p>Miese Mashkeh (poor liquor)--castor oil.</p>
   <p>Bahur (young man)--a policeman or a good pinochle player.</p>
   <p>Zaroth (worries)--a large bill from a department store.</p>
   <p>Rishuth (injustice)--a slip of a motorcycle cop.</p>
   <p>Yeshuah (salvation)--bail.</p>
   <p>Kinim (lice)--small change.</p>
   <p>Trefa (nonkosher)--"moonshine".</p>
   <p>Had Sholom Aleichem spent his life in America, he would have given a great deal of his time to the new Jewish philology of the American scholars and <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>would have compiled an American-Yiddish dictionary worth reading.</p>
   <p>The thousands of American Jews who do know something about Judaism and have a Yiddish vocabulary, should thank the vaudeville shows, where they often hear Jewish words spoken by their Gentile friends, and also their grandpa and grandma. If it weren't for these educational agencies, thousands and tens of thousands of American Jews would not even know what gefullte fish meant.</p>
