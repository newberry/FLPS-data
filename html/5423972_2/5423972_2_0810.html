   <p>It was cheerful and lively on Twelfth Street yesterday. It was quiet in Douglas Park. The news, printed in various newspapers, that the Poles were preparing to attack the Jews in Douglas Park proved to be false. The whole thing ended differently from what we expected. Douglas Park was flooded with flowers and "compassion-tags" for the pogrom victims of Pinsk--but there was no "pogrom" on Jews.</p>
   <p>Thus the entire day was spent by Jews, and also by some Gentiles, in purchasing tags. The large crowds in Douglas Park felt certain that nothing would occur. The Poles were not so foolish as to come into a Jewish district, to attack Jews when there are so many Jewish heroes who would sacrifice themselves for their race.</p>
