   <p>In advance of the Jewish Community in Chicago was the meeting held yesterday afternoon in the chambers of Judge Henry Horner for delving into conditions of our people in Eastern Europe, especially in Poland, and thereby formulate definite steps to be taken against Polish pogroms.</p>
   <p>The majority agreed that Jews must act now. We cannot make the situation for Polish Jews any worse than it is at present.</p>
   <p>After short addresses by Major Davis, Max Adler, Judge Horner, Dr. S. M. Melamed, Adolph Kurtz, Henry Grineboim, Rabbi Aphriam Epstein, Judge Hugo Pam. Rabbi Saul Silver, James Davis, Charles Rubin, Dr. Joseph Shtoltz, Mercy I. Berger, S. J. Rosenblott, Max Shulman, and N. D. Kaplan, the conference decided to form a committee which should prepare and organize an effective protest-movement, one that would make an impression and stir the American people and its allies to take the proper action for the aid of the unfortunate Jews.</p>
   <p>The committee appointed by chairman Adolph Kroiz, will get in communication with Jewish leaders of New York, and together they will prepare the necessary materials regarding the pogroms. In a short time they will have the results of their labors, so that the protest movement may immediately assume a definite form.</p>
   <p>The first step will be to organize a huge protest meeting in one of the largest halls in the city.</p>
