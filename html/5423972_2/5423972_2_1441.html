   <p>The Rev. Dr. Hirsch, who was present made a statement to the Board to the effect that the present way of our Sabbath services was very unsatisfactory to him and that he was averse to officiate to such an extremely small number of worshippers as are now present at the services on Saturday mornings.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gatzert moved to amend, that the Committee on Public Worship, be authorized to engage any competent person as Reader, until the next annual meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. Spiegel offered an amendment to the amendment that the committee be allowed to expend the sum, not exceeding $5,000 for that purpose...which was, after a short debate, put to a vote and adopted.</p>
