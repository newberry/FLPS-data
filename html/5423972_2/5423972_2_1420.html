   <p>Our contemporary the Inter Ocean of last Monday contains a not very savory onslaught on the Russ-Polish people who attended the jargon performance of Sunday evening last, entitled "The Female Russian Slave." The writer of that item did, undoubtedly exaggerate the story of his "odor" experience. While it is true that this class of people are not the most refined, the majority being poor peddlers, etc., but their deportment is no worse than some of the public places where other nationalities congregate where the neighborhood is made unsafe and crime and iniquity stalk under glaring electric lights. The Russo-Polish denizens are at least sober, industrious and law-abiding citizens.</p>
