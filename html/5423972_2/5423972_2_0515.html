   <p>A bill aimed at the Ku Klux Klan is now in the process of becoming a law in the legislature of Illinois.</p>
   <p>The Ku Klux Klan has been so discredited by recent events that it is easy to conclude that no need exists for legislation that shall make its activities more harmless. The fact of the matter is, however, that it is a sinister force, working in the dark, and one that today actually determines the actions of governors and national representatives in Congress. Only the fullest alertness will defeat its program of expansion, at the expense of the liberties of America. A bill, similar to the one now discussed for passage in the state legislature, if passed and made law in the states now dominated or threatened by domination of the Klan, would put the latter out of business. The Federal government is lukewarm on the subject and the states must each legislate to protect themselves. We need no Fascists in America and legislative action should be aware of the danger, if it wishes to preserve the interests of the people at large and of the founders of the Republic.</p>
