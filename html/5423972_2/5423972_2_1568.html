   <p>The decision of the United States District Court has ended the hopes of the Chicago straphangers for a five-cent streetcar fare. For a while, there seemed to be considerable hope of achieving this goal, thanks to an order of the Illinois State Commerce Commission.</p>
   <p>The Federal court has, naturally, decided the case from a strictly legal point of view. The court had to consider the claim of the streetcar company that with a five-cent streetcar fare, it would be unable to earn any profits and would be unable to give its shareholders a "legal" dividend. The city administration could not prove that this claim of the streetcar company was untenable.</p>
   <p>The general public, who do not understand the fine technicalities of the law, <span class="page-break">2</span>will be disappointed in this decision. The general public knows only that a short time ago, the United States Supreme Court declared that a State Commerce Commission has the right to fix streetcar rates, and now the U. S. District Court says that the commission has no such right.</p>
   <p>The net result of all this is that the five-cent streetcar fare will remain a political issue in Chicago. It will remain a political football, which is regrettable from any point of view. The Chicago public is entitled to demand a fair streetcar fare, and a fair streetcar service. This tangle between the court and the commerce commission makes the prospects of a just settlement more remote than ever. Meanwhile, the politicians will use it for their own purposes and the people at large will continue to pay the high streetcar fare, which is, in any case, too high.</p>
