   <p>The Chicago Polish newspapers, of all denominations, from the most reactionary to the radical Dziennik Ludowy, published yesterday biting reports and articles about Jewish protests against Poland's outrageous pogroms against Jews. More poisonous than the rest was the Dziennik Narodowi.</p>
   <p>This Polish paper devoted many columns to filthy attacks on American Jews and prominent non-Jewish Americans for not keeping quiet about the Polish atrocities.</p>
   <p>"Propaganda by Jews is full of hostility and falsehoods," was the screeching seven-column front page caption in red of yesterday's issue of Dziennik Narodowi. A sub-title over the first two front page columns of this paper <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>stated, "Charles Hughes, in the service of the Jews." The attack on Mr. Hughes, a former Republican candidate for President, was made for the reason that he dared, at the huge protest meeting in Madison Square Garden, New York, denounce the pogroms and demand that America put an end to Polish horrors.</p>
   <p>In giving the report of the New York meeting and of Mr. Hughes's address, the "honorable" editor of the Polish newspaper wrote:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Hughes certainly received his information from Jewish provocative newspapers, ignoring entirely official reports of the American Commissioners in Poland, who explained that the rumors of pogroms are absolutely false."</p>
   <p>Regarding the protest meeting in Boston which sent an appeal to President Wilson, asking that the slaughter of Jews be stopped, the following <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>reactionary remarks were made:</p>
   <p>"President Wilson knows the true situation and will pay no attention to this scheming protest."</p>
   <p>On another page the Dziennik Narodowi elaborated on the Mourning March held Wednesday, May 21, in Chicago. Over half a page is devoted to this demonstration, every line of which is written full of enmity.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Narodowi simply defends the "unknowing" Jewish masses led astray by Jewish leaders who would have them believe there are pogroms in Poland.</p>
   <p>"No Jewish pogroms occurred in Poland, and we know that as well as the Jewish leaders in America," cried hysterically the Chicago Polish newspaper, explaining that all these protests against Poland are a conspiracy <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to keep Poland from obtaining the German province which it now demands, and that it also is an obstacle to hinder Poles in their fight against Russian Bolsheviks, to whom the Jews of America and those of Poland are so attached because of the Trotskys, Bronsteins, the Goldfeins, the Hirshes and other such true Russians.</p>
   <p>As "proof" of the conspiracy, they state that very little is mentioned about pogroms in Rumania by American Jews who speak only of Poland.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers, at the meeting in the Auditorium, mentioned in the Polish newspapers, is also listed the name of "Rabbi Samuel Fellows."</p>
   <p>The Polish newspaper has made a rabbi of the noted liberal Christian Spiritual leader.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>At the close of the "report," so full of filth and lies, the paper gives a list of Jewish stores in the Polish neighborhoods of the Northwest Side, which were closed Wednesday, and invited their worthy readers to boycott these or even do worse.</p>
   <p>In the Dziennik Zwiazkowy (one of its editors is the Jewish Pole Nathan Kalman), Zlatnitzki devotes an open editorial on "War Against Jews."</p>
   <p>"The Jews have turned their cards," Says Mr. Zlatnitzki's organ. "They have declared themselves the foes of Poland. The Poles will certainly profit by this in the near future. In the meantime, we Poles in America must guard well the saying "Kin to kin."</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Ludowi, the Polish Socialist newspaper of Chicago, is in accord with the other Chicago Polish newspapers in these anti-Semitic barkings. But as it is fitting for a "radical," it expresses itself <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>in a more "delicate" manner.</p>
   <p>This is what the Polish Socialist newspaper says about the protest meetings against Polish horrors.</p>
   <p>"It is to be regretted that the worthy speakers have not mentioned why Jews are so persecuted since the first century in various lands. Possibly there are just reasons for such discrimination against shop-keepers who have no conscience, especially so in Poland, where some of them seek to create a kingdom within a kingdom and thereby receive special privileges. No cultured person would agree to pogroms, but these persecutions are related differently by the Jews from what they actually represent."</p>
   <p>So speaks a Polish editor, Anti-Semitic like the rest of his fellow Poles.</p>
