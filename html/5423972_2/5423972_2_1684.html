   <p>As soon as the Butcher and Shochets' Union announced that each butcher boss would have to sign the agreement and pay $5.00 for the rent of the union sign, then 75 butchers signed. The bosses who decline to sign, state that the union demands that the shochets receive wages in addition to the 15Â¢ charge for each job. The union's business agent, Mr. Etkin denies this.</p>
   <p>The Butcher and Shochets' Union has decided to sign no agreement with the Association of the Butcher Employers, but that each of the latter must sign himself, and in addition, pay a $5.00 rental for a union card which is to be a guaranty of a union shop.</p>
