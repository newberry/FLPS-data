   <p>A bomb exploded yesterday morning in the barber shop of Morris Schochet, 1115 South Crawford Avenue, nor far from the Fillmore Avenue police station. The explosion was heard for quite some distance, and the front of the barber shop was damaged considerably.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schochet recently settled with the Union and cannot understand who set the bomb. He suspects it to be the work of the Master Barbers' Association as a result of its displeasure with him for settling with the Union.</p>
