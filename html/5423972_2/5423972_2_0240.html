   <p>The Chicago Orthodox Rabbinical Association issued the following appeal yesterday to the Jewish public:</p>
   <p>Among all good tidings and hopes appearing at present in the Jewish World, we were also fortunate enough to bear witness that, among us in Chicago, signs are beginning to show the revival of Judaism. The Jewish bakers of Lawndale District have determined to return to our Sabbath, promising that they will no longer violate the laws of the Sabbath, nor do any baking on this sacred day.</p>
   <p>We appeal to our sisters and brothers of Chicago, especially to the Jewish grocers, to support these pioneers wishing to observe the Sabbath. Help them as much as possible in their business and make it easier for them to observe this great gift which God has given to us and to the entire world. We urge all bakers to get together and extinguish the Gehenna fires from <span class="page-break">2</span>the Jewish baking ovens on the sacred day of Sabbath. The rabbis will discuss this in the synagogues this coming Saturday. May God bless all of you.</p>
