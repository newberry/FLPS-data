   <p>The Jewish butcher shop is the beginning and the ending of the knowledge of an average Jewish child of what constitutes Kosher, and this is the real reason why most of us have so little respect for the word. If the average person had a deeper knowledge of the real meaning of the word "Kosher" and also its past value to the Jews, not only would he have a greater respect for it, but its meaning would spell science and wisdom. The correct English meaning of the word "Kosher" is "healthful." The opposite word to it is "Trefah" which means "Deleterious," that is, harmful to one's health. To illustrate: fat ("hele") of the ox is "Trefah" and is prohibited as food. Those of us who have eaten the particularly prohibited part of the fat, know how hard it is to digest; consequently, we know how dangerous it is. The fat of the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>fowl is very easily digested, in fact, it is healthful; therefore, it is absolutely Kosher and may be eaten. The yolk of an egg containing a droplet of blood is Trefah and is prohibited as food. The droplet of blood in the egg denotes a beginning of the process of hatching. Who of us does not know that an egg that is in the process of hatching is not fresh?</p>
   <p>Blood in general is strictly prohibited as food. Two reasons are given for it: one is based on the supposed spiritual value of blood, that is, the spirit of man is flowing in his blood, Therefore, from a moral and spiritual standpoint, it is not right to use blood as food. The other reason is that from a physical standpoint, blood is considered unhealthful. When an animal is killed, the arterial or fresh blood runs out through the open arteries; the blood that remains is venous, full of carbon dioxide and other badly poisons, therefore, it is not healthful <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>or "Trefah." This mode of reasoning was based on true scientific knowledge of the general circulation of the blood, which was proved to be correct many centuries ago by Dr. Harvey, of England, in 1628. By salting and soaking the meat in water this injurious venous blood is extracted and the meat becomes healthful and fit to be used as food. Of course, we have different ideas on this question today, but in those days the explanation of the Rabbis was quite plausible.</p>
