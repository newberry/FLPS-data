   <p>Chief or Police, McWinney, responded to the accusations, which were made against the Jewish district by the Chicago Tribune, that the Jewish district is a nest of gambling dens and houses of ill-repute.</p>
   <p>The Chief declared that he always ignores newspapers who continually seek sensation. In his opinion, if good police work is to be achieved we must not permit ourselves to be misled by newspaper reports, which, for sheer personal advantage, make an elephant out of a mouse and vice versa.</p>
   <p>When a newspaper or private citizen becomes aware of crime, it should be their first duty to convey the information to the police and not to publicize it, so that the criminals will have no opportunity of covering the crime in such a manner that they will be able to evade the law.</p>
   <p>As is already known, the Chicago Tribune, after its employee shot and seriously wounded the Jewish young man, Alexander Belford, created a rumpus, to the effect that the Jewish Ghetto is contaminated with gambling houses and houses of ill-repute and instead of helping to bring its employee, who shot an innocent young man, to the law, it intended to avert the public opinion from the gun battle, <span class="page-break">2</span>by creating sensational stories of indecency prevailing in the Jewish district.</p>
   <p>The Chief of Police stated that according to his information, and he holds that he knows more about such things than anyone else, the Jewish Ghetto is absolutely pure of houses of prostitution. The Jewish cleanliness of the family, the unity of the Jewish family, the chastity of Jewish daughters make them keep aloof from ugly places. The Bureau of Personal Service works very diligently in the Jewish Ghetto, and whenever there is even a suspicion of indecency, the Bureau is always on the spot and with the aid of the police the truth or the falsity of the suspicion is immediately settled.</p>
   <p>People live more sociably and friendly in the Jewish Ghetto. When a new neighbor moves into the district, his friendship is immediately sought. They are eager to know who the new neighbor is, whose country man he is, and what sort of business he is engaged in. This eagerness leads to the discovery of the new neighbor's character. And if the new neighbors are undesirable, it is soon revealed to the public. The Ladies Aid Society is summoned, letters pour into the Courier, the police are informed and the group is forced to move.</p>
   <p>About gambling the Chief of Police said that if all other districts were no worse than the Jewish Ghetto then no publicity about gambling would be necessary.</p>
