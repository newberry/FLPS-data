   <p>An appeal from the United Hebrew Trades to the Jewish Workers of Chicago. We have gone through a year of suffering. The lamentations of the workers and their families still ring in our ears. There was great misery among the unorganized workers. These men began to understand that the trust magnates were responsible for their sufferings. They realized that under the present conditions they must organize themselves.</p>
   <p>In order to carry on the work which was started by the Jewish workers, it was necessary to organize a body that would centralize and establish a great and powerful army to spread the sentiment of class struggle. Such was the P. A. G. of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades laid the foundation for the Jewish labor movement in Chicago. If you will read the statistics, you will discover how many organizations have been installed by this federation workers of Chicago, we must start a new movement in Chicago for next year. The shops now have a little more work. The sweat shop is taking on a greater form, and we must prepare with more power to free the workers.</p>
