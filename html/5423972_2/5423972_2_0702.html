   <p>Henry Ford and his anti-Semitic hirelings are still busily engaged in a campaign of slander and malice against the Jewish people, and they are trying their utmost to poison the mind of the American people against us. We understand that Henry Ford is distributing his Dearborn Independent in four-hundred-thousand copies every week. It is true that the number of subscribers to his papers is a rather limited one, but Henry Ford can afford to spend a million dollars a year on anti-Semitic propaganda, and he thinks he does it best by sending his sheet to every man of some standing throughout the country. We understand that every official, every judge, every legislator, congressman, senator, university professor, etc., receives Henry Ford's sheet week by week, free of charge. It is true that not every reader of the Dearborn Independent can easily be "convinced" of the truth of Ford's charges against us because in most cases the charges are refuted and are known to be refuted long ago, or they are of such <span class="page-break">2</span>nature that no intelligent man, who can do his own thinking, will believe that these charges are true. But many men and women, who know nothing or next to nothing about matters Jewish, could be made to fall victims to this poisonous propaganda. In many cases people are prejudiced against us and believe everything they are told about the Jews.</p>
   <p>It is obvious that we have to do something to counteract the effects of this criminal conspiracy against the Jewish people. We have reason to believe that the leaders of American Jewry are now convinced of the necessity of taking some definite action in the matter, and we know it to be a fact that every Jew in this country is convinced that something must be done to paralyze the activities of Henry Ford and his hirelings. But we are not convinced of the fact that the American Jewish leaders agree on a uniform program of work. Some of them think that one statement to the public press concerning these charges will do; others think that a series of articles in the most influential papers of the country will be sufficient to counteract Henry Ford's anti-Semitic <span class="page-break">3</span>propaganda; still others come with propositions of mass meetings, of protest meetings, or of anti-Ford demonstrations, etc.</p>
   <p>In our humble opinion, the Ford propaganda cannot be made ineffective by one statement to the press, or even by a series of articles. After all, Ford is not the only one in the country to be busily engaged in anti-Semitic propaganda. There are hundreds of others who are doing just the same dirty work, though on a minor scale, and it would be all wrong to concentrate our fight against Ford only. While concentrating our offensive against Ford and his hirelings, we may do something to paralyze anti-Semitic propaganda in this country, but we will do nothing in the way of making an end to the anti-Semitic propaganda of the minor anti-Semites, whose work is nearly as dangerous as that of Henry Ford's.</p>
   <p>We think that it is our duty to organize a good and general offensive and to fight on the whole battle line, to fight all the enemies simultaneously, and not to concentrate our energies on combating only one anti-Semitic chief. To <span class="page-break">4</span>this end we need not a weekly, or a daily, as many propose, but we need a good Jewish press bureau to supply the entire American press with Jewish news of general interest. It is not necessary at all that the Jewish press bureau be partisan or that it do propaganda work. If it only succeeds in spreading interesting and genuine Jewish news, and just makes the public at large acquainted with Jewish conditions everywhere, it will prove to be the best sort of counter propaganda we could do.</p>
   <p>The main charges of Henry Ford are that we control everything, seek to control everything, look for world domination, undermine governments, etc. If the public at large will learn that the majority of Jews consist of hard-working people, that they prove to be everywhere second to none in their loyalty to their countries, to their governments, and that they form everywhere a conservative force for the good of the country and for the good of humanity, then the charges of Henry Ford will be refuted--not by sermons, but by facts.</p>
   <p>The peoples sheltering us know us very little, and, therefore, are inclined to <span class="page-break">5</span>believe everything they are told about us. Our only task is to inform them about our life and about the conditions of the Jews everywhere, and then they will convince themselves how idiotic, and how stupid the charges of Henry Ford and his friends are.</p>
   <p>A Jewish press bureau, we think, is the only way and the best method to counteract the effects of the Ford propaganda, and the quicker we establish such a press bureau, the better for us and the better for the public.</p>
