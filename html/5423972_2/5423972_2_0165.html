   <p>Now it is no longer a question of whether or not the slaughterers should pluck the chicken they kill. The late Rabbi Zwi Simon Album (may his memory be blessed) long ago decided that they should not. The question now is, who shall stand the expense of plucking.</p>
   <p>The butchers claim that their profit is only ten cents per fowl and they state that they can prove the justice of their claim. On the other hand, a certain rabbi claims that the butchers are making sixty cents (?) per fowl. Whichever it may be, the public should know what is really going on.</p>
   <p>We suggest that a committee of citizens and representatives of the butchers and the slaughterers should come together and institute order in this matter, so that the housewife who buys a fowl should not have to pay ten cents in addition to the ten cents she is paying for slaughtering, or she may feel <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>herself compelled to give up the entire thing and may begin to use non-Kosher poultry.</p>
   <p>To pay twenty cents for slaughtering and plucking a fowl is a crime that cries to heaven. The housewives should strike against it.</p>
