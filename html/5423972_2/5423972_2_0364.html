   <p>Today is the feast of Purim, which is celebrated by the Jews upon the 14th day of the month of Adar, according to the Hebrew calendar. It is celebrated only in a social way now, as orthodoxy has given way to reform. It is not a great many years since Purim was celebrated in the synagogues with most impressive services. The press of business interests has caused almost total cessation of such religious observances, the festivities being now confined to social amenities, principally masked balls.</p>
