   <p>The Chicago Jews are really fine, likeable people, as fine and likeable as they were in the old country.....The Chicago Jews are not fanatics; on the contrary, they are very liberal people. For instance, a Jew who lives in the Lawndale district is a member of an Orthodox synagogue, but as soon as he moves to the North Side, he becomes a member of a Reform temple. Many Chicago Jews are not particular about their articles of faith, and they are not fanatical adherents of a certain set of principles. However, there are a few principles in which the Chicago Jews firmly believe. These principles are:</p>
   <p>1. That every dead body must be brought to the synagogue and a funeral oration must be delivered; otherwise the soul of the dead person will not go to heaven by express train.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>2. That weddings and wedding suppers must be held in a Down-Town hotel; otherwise the newlyweds will be unhappy.</p>
   <p>3. That the newly arrived immigrants, the greenhorns, have no brains, and that all wisdom is lodged in the Chicago Jews.</p>
   <p>4. That Shnevr Zalmen [J. Loebner] fights the world every Wednesday, with his Galician Jews.</p>
   <p>5. That during the rending of the Torah, one should chatter and gossip.</p>
   <p>6. That by giving to charity, one becomes poor.</p>
   <p>7. That every Reform rabbi is an educated man.</p>
   <p>8. That the editor of a Jewish newspaper is a public errand-boy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>9. That with his twenty-five or fifty-dollar donation to the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization], he [the Jew] is making the Jewish people happy, he is building Palestine, and fulfilling all of his Jewish duties; he thereby deserves a million dollars' worth of publicity and ten million dollars' worth of Paradise.</p>
   <p>10. That it is better [to have] money without a man than [to have] a man without money.</p>
   <p>If my dearly beloved Chicago Jews will ever get rid of these superstitions, they will really become civilized.</p>
   <p>Will we ever live to see that day?</p>
