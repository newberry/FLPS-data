   <p>In Chicago there are about two hundred thousand Orthodox Jews and they are all fast asleep.</p>
   <p>The majority of Jews in Chicago are Orthodox and they are doing as much as nothing to propogate their ideals and traditions.</p>
   <p>Chicago has the strongest Orthodox group in America, and when one observes how this strong group administers its affairs, one is overcome by a feeling of despair. There is no authority in the community; there is no feeling of responsibility; there is no sincerity, or inadequate sincerity, and the whole standard of life is ridiculously low.</p>

   <p>The Chicago Jews are surely proud of their recent accomplishment for the Keren Hayesod [exchequer for the World Zionist Organization]. They have good grounds to be proud, if they compare their present activity with that of last year. But, after all, what does the sum of fifty thousand dollars amount to for a community of two hundred thousand people? The Chicago Jews are charitable. Among the Orthodox Jews in Chicago there are some millionaires, and the number of those who possess a half or a quarter million dollars is legion. Yet, is the sum of fifty thousand dollars for the greatest and noblest of all Jewish causes a large sum? This proves one thing, to wit: that their standard is very low and that they see no further than their noses.</p>
   <p>The Orthodox Jews in Chicago could have given a half million dollars for the Keren Hayesod without becoming any poorer. They could have spent fifty thousand dollars on a decent Kehilah [organized synagogue] organization without becoming any poorer. They could have maintained with their own means another ten <span class="page-break">\3</span>first-class Talmud Torahs (Hebrew Schools) without becoming any poorer.</p>
   <p>It cannot be said that the Orthodox Jews in Chicago are niggards. They are not. It cannot be said that they are halfhearted. They are not. And it cannot be said that they are not devoted to everything that is Jewish. They mean well with their people and with their Judaism, but they are great sleepers. By the time an Orthodox group gets ready to do anything, by the time it formulates its plans, and by the time it realizes its plans, endless time slips by and then not all is done well or properly.</p>
   <p>One good thing can be said about the Reform Jews. Whenever they undertake anything, they do it well and thoroughly. They have system in their work; they are methodical in their work, and, above all, they do the work. But our Orthodox Jews, and especially the Orthodox leaders, do not do their work thoroughly, and what is still worse, they do nothing. They have pocketsful <span class="page-break">\4</span>to one hundred thousand dollars per annum, and the sixty thousands dollars for the maintenance of the Hebrew Theological College is being contributed by a handful of Orthodox Jews. Thus, if the Orthodox Jews in Chicago want to accomplish something, they can. But they are sleeping, and while asleep, they are digging a grave for the Orthodox Jewry in the second largest Jewish community of the world.</p>
   <p>What has become of the United Rabbinate?</p>
   <p>What has become of the Union of Synagogue Presidents?</p>
   <p>Why are the leaders of the Chicago Orthodoxy sleeping?</p>
   <p>How long will they still sleep?</p>
