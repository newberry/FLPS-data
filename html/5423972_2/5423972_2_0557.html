   <p>The statement made by a Catholic prelate to the effect that the Pope "feels" that the anti-religious Campaign on the part of the Bolsheviks is influenced by Russian Jews and that the Jews of America should therefore exercise their influence upon their "co-religionists" in Moscow to stop the persecution of Christian clergymen, is full of venomous anti-Semitism and Jesuitical hypocrisy, which calls for a sharp reply of protest.</p>
   <p>Actually, there is little difference between the Pope's "appeal" to the American Jews that they influence the Bolsheviks to stop persecuting the Christian Clergymen, and the demand of the Polish anti-Semites that the rabbis of Poland be interned as pawns for the exculpation of the Catholic clergy in Moscow. Both aim to make the Jews of the whole world responsible for the acts of the Bolsheviks in Russia.</p>
   <p>The "Holy Father" in Rome has already evinced his anti-Semitic inclinations by his position against the Palestine Mandate. The statement he now makes puts him on an equal footing with the leader of the Warsaw "Rozwoy" [?] by whom he was, for some good reason, intimately befriended when he was papal ambassador in Warsaw.</p>
