   <p>In a sermon entitled the "God of Israel," Dr. Emil G. Hirsch yesterday declared that all people are chosen in a certain sense and the Jews seemed to be chosen for ignominy and suffering. He discussed the attitude of the prophets of old and came to the conclusion that a majority of the writers of the Old Testament were impressed more with the universal brotherhood of mankind than with any sentiment that the Jewish race was singled out to receive the blessings of God.</p>
   <p>"Two years ago," said the speaker, "when the horror of Kishineff startled civilization I read in the organ of the Congress of Religions 'Kishineff is the necessary result when some claim to be of a chosen race.' Two weeks age that same doctrine was announced from a pulpit when we expressed our rage and horror at the outrages perpetrated upon our people because it was said that they believed themselves of a 'chosen race.'</p>
   <p>"Do you deny the doctrine of selection? There are many before me who see opportunities <span class="page-break">\2</span>which it is impossible for others to appreciate. Do you deny that we have chosen ones? How many Edisons, Dantes, Esculapiuses have lived in the history of the world? Possibly one in a generation is worthy of memory in the coming ages of civilization.</p>
   <p>"Or suppose we consider the nations. How is it that Greece casts the glamor of beauty upon all her works; how is it that the Romans' civic regulations have come to be considered the foundation of legal procedure; what of the versatility of the Italians; the profundity of the Germans; the melancholy of the Russians? The climate of Italy is practically the same as that of Greece and yet we have the Romans borrowing their ornaments from the Greeks suffering for lack of the judicial temperament of the Romans.</p>
   <p>"We are all chosen for certain roles in the drama of life. The Jew is chosen for suffering and he shares with women the power to suffer and not succumb. He wears the crown of thorns until the time shall come when butchery and savagery are not necessary in the great plans of life. We are chosen for a different purpose than Russians and Germans, but we are equally chosen for a purpose.</p>
   <p>"You who criticize the Jew for his clannishness and call attention to the fact that <span class="page-break">\3</span>Jews play cards with Jews and Jews dance with Jews. Tear down your own exclusiveness; get away from the seclusion of your clubs and societies. It is only because the Jew is forced to be clannish that he is apt to associate more with those of his own race than with the rest of his neighbors.</p>
   <p>"Many modern scholars have sought to show that the God of the Old Testament is a national God and that of the new is a universal God," said Dr. Hirsch. "I, for one, can see that at one time the ancient Hebrews worshiped a tribal God. There are fragments of this idea remaining even to the present day, just as traces of former geological periods are found in the shells and fossils in rock strata.</p>
   <p>"In one chapter of Isaiah is found an intense tribalism, but who points to this fact and declared Isaiah believed in a God who favored a certain race above all other forgets that, in all probability, that particular passage was not written by the prophet, but is found in that collection as a bowlder may be discovered in a country free from rocks, a relic of a former religious age. So in the Pentateuch we find the story of the ark, with all the marks of tribal feeling and racial dogmatism. Unforunately this was formerly incorporated in the ritual of the Jewish faith, but was later eliminated under the influence of enlightened criticism.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"This tribal feeling is pointed to in many pulpits and the Jew is condemned on this basis. He who points to the existence of such passages and thereon bases his assertion that the God of the Old Testament is a national God, and he in the New Testament a universal Father, forgets the discrepancies which exist in the New Testament with regard to the very character and opinions of Jesus himself. According to one gospel Jesus is intensely national in his feelings. He would not throw pearls before swine, and by this he evidently means the non-Jews. In another gospel he is represented as being filled with conviction of the universal brotherhood of mankind. In still a third he is made to retain some of the prejudices of race, while at the same time exhibiting that feeling of sympathy for all which endears him to the heart of the writer. Peter is the advocate of nationalism, Paul gradually becomes the exponent of universalism."</p>
