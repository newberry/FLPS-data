   <p>It has often been claimed that the Encyclopedia Britannica is not always true to its mission; that its information is often inconsistent with historical facts; that some of its collaborators hold their own opinions, their own sympathies or antipathies higher than the truth.</p>
   <p>That this assertion is true can be seen by its biographical sketch of Newton D. Baker. So erroneous, so dishonest and false was its information concerning the former American Secretary of War that thunderous protests were raised last year throughout the country, demanding that the article on Mr. Baker be removed from the Encyclopedia.</p>
   <p>But never has this assertion been so boldly confirmed, never has its information proved so partial, so abominably false as in the case of its information <span class="page-break">2</span>concerning the Jews in Poland.</p>
   <p>In its latest edition, which contains events from 1910 to 1921, under the caption "Jewish Question," written by Jeffry Drage, vice-president of the English Royal Statistical Society, the following information on the Jews in Poland is given through the Encyclopedia. (We have not as yet seen this new edition. We take the contents from the Friday issue of the New York World.)</p>
   <p>"One of the most important questions which should be considered by the new Polish State is that of the Jews. The large majority in Poland are Eastern Jews who are in language, in religion, and in customs different from the rest of the population. Their language is Yiddish, close to a German dialect; their clothing is characteristic to themselves proper, and their wrong habits and low standard of conduct is neither European nor modern.</p>
   <p>"The Eastern Jew is, in essence, a businessman or an agent, but not a producer.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The shop owners in the cities are mostly Jews. They are a race for themselves. Hated and despised by the rest of the population, they are devoted to their religion, which is a primitive type of Judaism.</p>
   <p>"The Czarist government has driven them from Russia. These exiled Jews formed a party to help Russia. They established a Jewish press which had openly opposed Polish autonomy. Prior to the War, the Poles attacked the Jews through boycotts, the only means with which one subjugated race can fight another.</p>
   <p>"During and after the War the enmity against the Jews enhanced, first, through the fact that in the German occupations Jews became loyal allies of the Germans; second, through their affection for Bolshevism. The results of the latter were that in 1918 and 1919 from two to three hundred thousand Jews were killed. The Jewish press has greatly exaggerated this.</p>
   <p>"They form a large mass of filth and utter destitution. They traffic in all <span class="page-break">4</span>sorts of illegal and intriguing businesses. They are devoted to their primitive religion. If they become rich they lose all sense of compassion for their brethren. Nobody who knows Poland is surprised by the Polish demand to get rid of this corrupt influence.</p>
   <p>"Neither the Russian "black hundred", nor the German anti-Semities, nor the anti-Semites of Austria, of Hungary, and of all other countries have ever dared to heap upon the Jew more aspersions, more lies, than does this article in the Encyclopedia Britannica.</p>
   <p>The New York World reports that the New York Jews are embittered against this article; that they repudiate all statements as false and calumnious; that they ask: Why is the language of the Jews in Poland, their religion, and their customs so peculiar? Is the standard of the Poles, which have led to the plundering of Jewish wealth and to outright murder, both European and modern? Is not a businessman a producer? And since when is the type of Judaism to which the <span class="page-break">5</span>Polish Jews are devoted more primitive than the type of Christianity to which the Poles are devoted?</p>
   <p>We do not believe that by merely asking questions and answering them or by flinging back the vile calumnies have the Jews in the English-speaking countries done their duty. We believe that never before have the Jews in England and America been confronted with a greater duty than the one of taking their stand for the protection of Jewish honor and for the protection of the existence of millions of Jews at the present moment.</p>
   <p>It should not be forgotten that these accusations against millions of Jews, instigating Poland to get rid of them, are not published in a magazine nor in a newspaper, which can be answered in like terms, but they are published in an encyclopedia. Yes, in the largest encyclopedia, from which millions of people in the English-speaking countries take their information today, tomorrow, next year, and fifty years hence. If such an article is to remain in the <span class="page-break">6</span>encyclopedia, it will mean generations of weeping; it will mean a frenzied racial hatred for all time to be; it will mean pogrom and massacres not only for the present, but for generations to come. And the Jews in the English-speaking countries cannot, should not, and must not justify themselves by merely answering and repudiating these accusations in some magazine or newspaper articles.</p>
   <p>A protest must be raised--an open protest to have these disgraceful calumnies removed from the encyclopedia. Let it cost what it may. A protest to the governments of England and America, if necessary; a protest in court; a protest to arouse public opinion in the two countries of democracy and justice against injustice.</p>
   <p>A protest to have these disgraceful, vile, and mean accusations removed from the encyclopedia is now the duty of English and American influential Jews.</p>
