   <p>Not only I but all Keren Hayesod workers in Chicago are very much disappointed in the Agudas Achim North Shore Congregation, of which Dr. Sonderling is the rabbi. We thought that when the congregation would be united, it would be able to raise at least ten thousand dollars for the Keren Hayesod under the leadership of Dr. Sonderling, with its own strengthened forces, but it seems that it did not do anything at all. It is true that the new congregation has its own problems to solve, but which congregation is free from worries and problems? Is this a valid reason for not doing anything for the Keren Hayesod? The leaders of the old Agudas Achim Congregation always worked and contributed to the Keren Hayesod. Our mutual friend, Mr. Isidor Lieberman, is an experienced public worker who has always done whatever he could do for the Keren Hayesod. Why have they laid away their weapons this year and deserted? Why?</p>
