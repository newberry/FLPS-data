   <p>A New York jury, before whom the question was considered whether the popular trashy play by Sholom Ash, "God of Revenge," is moral or immoral, issued a verdict that the play is wholly immoral and must not be produced. The New Yorkers are not Puritans and are liberal-minded when dealing with such questions. Once again in thirty years they have condemned a play as immoral, and the yellow comrades [by yellow comrades the writer is referring to the writers of the Jewish Forward] who consider this play as a literary masterpiece, because it fits their paper so well, will be unable to claim that homicide on literary justice has been committed. The Italians who still remember the immoral stories of Boccaccio are also not Puritanical; yet they tabooed that filthy play because they have literary taste and can distinguish between literature and psychological pornography. The New York <span class="page-break">2</span>decision against Sholom Ash's filthy play deals a death blow to all Yiddish trashy literature which is patronized by the Bintel Zeitung [sarcastically meaning the Forward].</p>
