   <p>Report of Appointed Building Committee.</p>
   <p>A few days ago your Board held a meeting....At that meeting the necessity of a change from our present quarters was fully discussed. It was shown that under present circumstances, our congregation could not possibly grow for the reason that there are no available pews which can be offered to members. It was also thought by many of the members of our Board that our congregation would hardly be doing its duty to the cause of Reformed Judaism if it would not take proper steps to accomodate all who might wish to join our ranks.....After due deliberation it was decided that prudence and good judgement dictated not the erection of a new building but the enlargement of our present structure.</p>
