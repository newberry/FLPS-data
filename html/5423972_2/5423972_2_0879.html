   <p>Poles in Chicago, who are fundamentally no better than those in the Old Country, in spite of the fact that they live in America and have had the opportunity to learn of local democracy, freedom, tolerance, and justice administered to citizens, have declared war on Jews of this city. To defend the Jewish bloodstained hands of their brothers in Poland, they issue one statement after another, saying that falsehoods are being fashioned regarding pogroms. They demand, therefore, that the people pay no attention to protests of Jews against bloody Poland and the Poles.</p>
   <p>Poles in Chicago wish to duplicate here the situation in Poland concerning Jews.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>They fear to make pogroms; first, because Jews here can match their strength in fight; second, because American authorities would not permit incitement. They, therefore, advocate the boycott. Their newspapers ask Poles not to buy from Jews.</p>
   <p>The newspapers of the Polish priests, of Polish bankers, of Polish Socialists, and of Jewish traitors, have all united in hurling pitch and brimestone upon the Jews, and preach of boycott on Jewish stores. Poles should not dare buy from Jews whether it be clothes, shoes, hats, furniture, groceries, bread; in fact, they should buy nothing at all from them.</p>
   <p>One of the above newspapers, namely, the Dziennik Narowdi prints <span class="page-break">3</span>in Friday's issue, May 2, the following:</p>
   <p>"The excitement against Jews in Chicago, because of their anti-Polish demonstrations, is tremendous. Especially is the excitement noticed against the tactlessness of those Jewish merchants who carry on their business among Poles, and have, as a sign of protest against Poles, closed the doors of their stores.</p>
   <p>"We call to your attention the fact that Poles must consider the doors of these stores as being forever closed. Because there, they were made to understand that they are not wanted.</p>
   <p>"In every corner of Chicago there was talk and great excitement yesterday (Thursday) concerning Chicago's Jews.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"The Polish press understood its position and is, with the exception of Dziennik Ludowi, which constantly defends the Jew, agreed and strong against Jewish aggression."</p>
   <p>And in the same Polish newspaper, on the same day, it is stated:</p>
   <p>"At the huge Jewish and anti-Polish meeting in the Auditorium, Wednesday afternoon, we were informed that Jews undertook to publish a weekly in the Polish language.</p>
   <p>"There was a long debate about its name, and finally the Polish enemies decided to call this weekly Vomitor, or Janitor. As first editor of the paper, they unanimously elected the noted <span class="page-break">5</span>Jew of Chicago's Polish colony, Isheiha Shwartz (Black), who fabricated, with the full consent of our enemies, articles already in his pocket for the first edition.</p>
   <p>"On this same huge anti-Polish meeting, Jews also decided to print a summons to all Polish merchants and manufacturers to advertise their business in the Vomitor and to support this paper strongly.</p>
   <p>"Those not advertising therein will be denounced in an outspoken article."</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Chicagoski prints cartoons portraying Jews in hideous forms, as bloodsuckers. Friday's cartoon shows in the right hand corner a lean miserable cow, labeled "Poland." Beneath, a barking <span class="page-break">6</span>dog, labeled "Pogrom Echoes!" At the left, a running Jew leading by a rope a tied calf. On his back is a sack labeled "Commerce." He carries in his left hand a flask labeled "Industry," and in his right hand, the Polish eagle, labeled "A Voice in Siam." He runs crying, "Great Heavens!"</p>
   <p>The title of this cartoon reads: "They have milked the cow dry, took the calf, and raised their voices on us in America."</p>
   <p>Another Polish newspaper prints an advertisement which reads:</p>
   <p>"You already know who Jews are and why they make protest demonstrations. Therefore, stop making them rich. Patronize only the industry and <span class="page-break">7</span>commerce of Polish stores, so that Poland, you, and your children may be better off. With Polish money in Polish hands, it is best to buy in the Polish warehouse "The Progress," 1165 Milwaukee Ave."</p>
   <p>The Courier was prompt Friday morning in devoting two entire columns on the front page to present the slanders and incitements of the local Polish press against Jews, thinking the Polish press would stop at that. It appears, though, that they have assumed a martyrdom attitude against Jews, and what remains for us, is to wake local public opinion. Every provocation in the mentioned newspapers must reach the authorities, and let America know the type of people Poles are.</p>
