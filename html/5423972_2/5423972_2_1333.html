   <p>The Jew a foreigner? No, he is an American, with title clear to 250 years of Americanism.</p>
   <p>In the first of twelve or more Chicago celebrations of the 250th anniversary of the landing of the first Jews in America at New Amsterdam, Dr. Emil G. Hirsch last evening spoke these words as the keynote of an address at Isaiah Temple, St. Lawrence Avenue and 44th Street. The walls of the temple were covered with American flags. A large crowd breathed affirmative response to the sentiment that because of their Judaism American Jews are better Americans.</p>
   <p>The Jews of Chicago in unison with the whole body of 1,250,000 Jews all over America will to-day and to-morrow continue the celebration of their colonial Americanism. Dr. Hirsch is down for several addresses. Sentences from his address last evening are as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"They say only a few Jews came then. How many colonists came in the Mayflower? When the puritans came there were 10,000,000 Calvinists in the world, but not more than 3,000,000 Jews. The little band which came was proportionately greater.</p>
   <p>Gained By Commerce</p>
   <p>"They say the Jew has been a trader. What of it? America understands that commerce has made possible the better things.</p>
   <p>"The German Jews came in the '40's in large numbers, like an orphan to a mother, and how could they help but love their Mother America?</p>
   <p>"Was there ever a class in this polygot America to which the public schools have been more dear than to these German Jews? The Jews have not set up little sectarian schools.</p>
   <p>"There has not been in America a Jewish vote. The Jews, excepting a few foolish ones, do not make use of their Jewdom in politics.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"More than 6,000 Jews, twenty per cent of the total number in America, shouldered a musket to put down slavery. In one of our Chicago cemeteries there is a monument to Colonel Speigel, whose body lies where it fell under the flag of his country.</p>
   <p>Every City A Palestine</p>
   <p>"Judaism and funamental Americanism are one. The puritans were Old Testament Christians. The reformed Jew can say that every American city is his Palestine."</p>
   <p>The endowment of Jewish lectureship in universities was recommended by Dr. Hirsch in an editorial in the Reform Advocate, which will appear to-day. He proposes that Chicago Jews can contribute to this instead of to the monument for which the national celebration committee is working.</p>
   <p>Before the North Chicago Hebrew Congregation, at La Salle Avenue and Goethe Street, Dr. Abram Hirschberg, in an address entitled "The Day We Celebrate," declared:</p>
   <p>"It is high time for the Jew to cease to be the cringing, sychophantic seeker after Christian favor and social recognition.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"When we consider that John Jacob Astor, the founder of the family which now occupies such a prominent position in social life did not hesitate to work for the Jew, Hayman Levy, at $1 a day, it seems a strange perversion of history to see his posterity refusing to rub shoulders with people whose patrimony far antedates their own."</p>
