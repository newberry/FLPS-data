   <p>The Chicago Tribune, which is now burning with wrath because we ignored the gun battle in which one of its employees shot and seriously wounded an innocent young Jewish man, came out with a new accusation against the Jewish ghetto.</p>
   <p>Until now, the Chicago Tribune claimed that the Jewish public built houses in such a fashion that they could be easily burned in order to collect insurance; that the doctors in the Jewish districts are only out for money; that gambling houses are so crooked in the ghetto that the Tribune receives letters urging them to send men with guns to put a stop to it. Now, that it is full of wrath, it started publishing stories, telling how the ghetto district is full of houses of ill-repute, or as the Tribune expresses it, "There is no doubt that, in the ghetto district, there are many houses of prostitution, some are perfectly open, others concealed, and others are protected by the police."</p>
   <p>Knowing that this accusation is false, as are all other accusations made by the Tribune against the Jewish district, the Jewish Courier turned to the Chief of Police, Mr. John McWiney, with the demand that an accurate investigation be made in the Jewish district.</p>
   <p>The Courier, in demanding the investigation, states in its letter to the Chief of Police, that this infamy upon the Jewish district covers the Jews with shame; that these accusations are completely false, and that a law-abiding, honest and decent community is obligated to prove the falseness of the above mentioned claims.</p>
   <p>The Courier, which has always helped to cleanse the Jewish ghetto from this undesirable element, will, together with the best citizens of this district, cooperate in every possible manner in this investigation.</p>
