   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>I have arrived in this country only two months ago and am, of course, still a greenhorn. Yet it certainly struck me funny when while visiting a synagogue last Passover, I observed that young and even old Jews applauded a cantor. I was astounded when I saw that. It is a disgrace to applaud in a house of prayer. A synagogue is not a theater. Such desecrations would not be permitted in the old country. It would be advisable for our synagogues to forbid applause in houses of worship.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>A. Scheikewitz.</p>
