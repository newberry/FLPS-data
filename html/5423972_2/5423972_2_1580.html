   <p>The Chicago clothing industry enjoyed exceptionally good business last year. The income was nearly one hundred and fifty million dollars. The industry employed 60,000 workers.</p>
   <p>Chicago-made clothing is being sold in every state in the U. S. A. and Canada. Before the war it was also sold in foreign countries.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the unions which always operate in the interests of the clothing workers, the employees last year were paid better wages than ever before.</p>
