   <p>The missionaries around Throop Street are very busy, but the Jews pretend not to be interested at all in this affair. Hundreds of Jewish children and Jewish mothers become the prey of missionaries, but a city of Jews sees this and keeps silent. The Association of Synagogues has already done something about this tragic condition, but it cannot do much alone because it is as yet too weak. Other Jewish organized bodies and groups should help in this struggle against the missionaries, who now constitute a real danger to the Jewish neighborhood. I have not heard up to now that the Association of Rabbis has done anything about this. I have no doubt that it can do something, because no synagogue will refuse to take part in this fight if it is asked to do so by the Association of Rabbis.</p>
