   <p>Go to the polls today and vote for any candidate you please, but do not forget that the important thing is that you should vote. If the Jews will not make any use of their right to vote, then they should not complain if Ford or any of his henchmen obtain political power.</p>
   <p>Do not forget, on this occasion, to give your vote to our representative in Washington, Congressman [A.J.] Sabath, who has served well America and has served well the Jewish people. He is the only man in Washington who is influential enough to fight successfully against the anti-immigration bills, Congressman Sabath deserves that we should send him back to his seat in Washington.</p>
   <p>Before you go about your business tomorrow do not forget to go and vote.</p>
