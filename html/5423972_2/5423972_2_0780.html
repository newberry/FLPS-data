   <p>Can Jews ruin the world? This question will seem very funny to the reader. First, why should Jews desire the destruction of the world, and second, how could they possibly accomplish it? There are thirteen million Jews among fifteen hundred million non-Jews. What can thirteen million people, not nationally organized, do to the world?</p>
   <p>Jews are peace-loving people. The ideal of everlasting peace is as old as the Jewish nation itself. Peace is our motto. If there is in this world a peace-loving nation, that nation is the Jewish because we do not have and never have had any imperialistic ambitions. We do not strive to convert the world to Judaism, nor do we want proselytes. We are not imperialistic and the question, "Can Jews ruin the world?", is not in order here.</p>
   
   <p>But when Christian Europe delivers ten million Jews to pogromists, criminals, and robbers, and when Jews see that none come to their aid while they are driven and desperate, then the question, "Can the Jews ruin the World?", assumes an entirely different aspect. What a million embittered and desperate persons may do cannot be foreseen. The tormented and persecuted Jews in Eastern Europe may be driven to such a stage of desperation that they may in such a moment say: "Let my soul perish with the Philistines". [Editor's note: Idiom implying if I have to die, the Philistines shall die with me.] In such a moment, Jews may ruin the world, that is, the present form of civilization.</p>
   <p>On one thing we must be quite clear: Should Jews in Eastern Europe know definitely that they must perish, they will not drop into the great abyss alone. They will say, "Let my soul perish with the Philistines".</p>
   <p>Several times in the history of the world, we have settled our account with our tormentors. To the gruesomeness and brutalities of the ancient Romans we retaliated with Christianity. Christianity is no more and no less than Judaism's act of vengeance against Rome. Today all historians admit that Christianity caused the downfall of Rome and put an end to Caesarism.</p>
   <p>Socialism, as introduced by two Jews, Karl Marx and Ferdinand La Salle (sic), is Judaism's act of vengeance against Prussian Junkerism and the Christian reactionary forces in Europe which tormented Jews unmercifully. Ultimately these two Jews, Marx and La Salle (sic), broke the power of the Hohenzollerns and the Prussian Junkers. When Wilhelm II was dethroned, he was replaced by Herr Ebert, a student of Karl Marx. German anti-Semitism was the work of a bitter combination: Junkerism, Militarism, and Kaiserism. Two Jews shattered this power. The "sun" of German freedom began to shine when the spirit of these two Jews became the ruling power. Two Jews annihilated a world--a world of Junkerism and Kaiserism.</p>
   
   <p>Where the oppression of the Jews was most severe, as in Russia, Jewish vengeance was greatest. We must understand Bolshevism from our attitude toward the world. To the Russian world, it was as though we said, "Let my soul perish with the Philistines"--and up sprang a Trotsky, a Litvinoff, and other Red leaders.</p>
   <p>Just as Christianity was a Jewish act of vengeance against Rome, so Bolshevism is an act of vengeance of tortured Judaism against Tsarism and its allies. A single Trotsky holds the world in his hands, and threatens to annihilate the whole of our present civilization--our present world. This does not mean that Jews are Bolsheviks, just as the facts presented here regarding the Christian forces do not mean that Jews are Christians. Whoever plans to annihilate us with the sword, we destroy with the spirit. We did away with the Caesars of Rome, with Tsarism and Kaiserism which were a political extension of Roman Caesarism.</p>
   <p>In the darkest days of our history we did not suffer as much affliction and suffering as we do now in Poland. Polish pogromists, the product of Polish Clericalism and Feudalism, tax our patience to the limit while Jewish blood is shed and the world looks on in silence.</p>
   <p>If Poland continues her policies of pogrom and bloodshed, she will drive the Jews to desperation, and will wrest from their despairing and embittered souls the following words: "Let my soul perish with the Philistines". That will mean the end of Poland. Not one but twenty Trotskys will arise, and the end of Poland will have arrived, the end to the entire Christian-Slavic civilization.</p>
   <p>Poland, by its pogrom tactics, forces anarchism and nihilism upon the Jews, and gambles not only with herself but with the freedom of all of Eastern Europe, and that of the world. Poland breeds new Trotskys, these new Trotskys will ruin the world. Pogroms in Poland will mean Poland's ruin and the end of world peace.</p>
