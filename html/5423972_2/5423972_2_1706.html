   <p>With ratification of the agreement between the I. L. B W. U and the association, the dress and shirt workers will have control practically of the entire trade. In all there are about 100 dress and skirt manufacturers in Chicago, the two associations which signed the agreement have a total of 65 member firms. Yesterday afternoon the Union received 26 applications from independent manufacturers, who also accede to all the demands of the union. There remain only about 9 or 10 firms which are stubborn. Against these the fight will be maintained.</p>
