   <p>The Russian Government has issued recently edicts concerning the Jews which practically force them to leave the Empire. Though Western Europe has remonstrated, unofficially, the Emperor will not modify his harsh orders, for there is no doubt that they represent the wishes of his Slavonic subjects. The latter, especially the peasants, are not smart enough to cope with the Jews, who form the trading, shopkeeping, money-lending class, and who hold mortgages, drawing heavy interest, on a large percentage of the cultivable land of Russia. It is true that the repressive European legislation of centuries, which kept the Jews from being landowners and forced them to be traders and money changers, was one of the causes which so sharpened their faculties as to give them advantages in business over other races, but the indebted Russians are in no mood to philosophize on that point.</p>
   <p>The question which is interesting Western Europe and this country is; "What is to become of these refugees?" England does not want them, for they underbid other workingmen and deprive them of labor. They are not a specially desirable acquisition for this country, because in their thoughts and ideas they are Orientals rather than <span class="page-break">\2</span>Occidentals. It takes a long time for them to form the faintest conception of the principles on which Western Governments are based. In religious matters they are orthodox to the extreme and are inclined to look upon the Reformed Jews who have abandoned so much of the old ritual as worse even than the Gentiles.</p>
   <p>It is the very orthodoxy on their part and the fact that they believe firmly that some time the Messiah will come and that he will gather them together at Jerusalem, which suggested the idea that the best thing which these Russian Jews can do is to return to Judea. Nothing ought to please them more. There is abundant room there for a large number of them. The present population of Judea does not exceed half a million and the country will support with ease four times that number. It was fertile once. It would be so again if cultivated decently and if the old irrigating channels in some sections were reopened. The Jews were farmers of old and would become so again in spite of their long separation from the soil. Even if these exiles from Russia had not the money with which to buy the land they needed, they could obtain it without difficulty from their wealthy and sympathetic brethren in other countries.</p>
   <p>It is to the interest of the Turkish Government that the waste places of Judea should <span class="page-break">\3</span>be made to blossom like the rose, because it would add to its revenues. And while that government might look with distrust on Christian settlers as the cause of future trouble, it would have no such feeling regarding the Jews. Mohammedans and Jews being both Unitarians or monotheists, the former have always gotten on better with the latter than with their Christian subjects in Europe, Asia, or Africa.</p>
   <p>But even if the Sultan should object it is easy enough to bring him to terms. If England, Russia, and the other leading European Powers and the United States were to insist that the Jews should be allowed to settle in Judea, should be permitted to cultivate in peace the lands which they might buy, and should be treated no worse than his Mohammedan subjects, he would have to submit. His tenure of office is not a stable one. Whenever he opposes himself to the wishes of all Europe he will have to move. Therefore, if he were asked to make these concessions in favor of the Russian Jews, he would make them and he would be compelled to keep his promises.</p>
   <p>The exodus of the Russian Jews will begin soon, so that if that human side is to be turned in the direction of Jerusalem, no time should be lost in taking the necessary steps. Otherwise Germany, France, England, and then the United States will have to deal with an army of immigrants.</p>
