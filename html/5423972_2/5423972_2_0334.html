   <p>The comments in the daily press a few days ago regarding the Jewish butchers who sell kosher (?) meat, aroused some stir in the Polish-Russian community on the West side. These people were directly interested in the matter. It concerned them most, hence they upbraided their butchers.</p>
   <p>The intention of the latter was to raise the price of their meats, of course knowing that those whose religion is only the meat and kitchen will pay any price for it rather than eat "Trefa," and from that point they desired to take advantage over their customers. While we have nothing to say against any business man who desires to gain the largest profits out of his goods, this step of the butchers should be condemned by every right and just thinking Israelite. We only wonder that the better element of the Russian Jews have not raised a protest against it by a public demonstration.</p>

   <p>There must be a conspiracy among the Shochtim and butchers, else the step would not have been taken. Some people seem to think they are still in Russia and they can extort the carupka tax, and that the rest will submit to it without any protest. Such a thing is an outrage and an infringement upon personal right. The rabbis who preside over the Russian Jewish congregation are in a great measure to blame for it and deserve the severest censure from the public, they ought to have stepped in energetically and opposed the measure, but it seems that they are also hampered.</p>
   <p>Their most influential members are the kosher butchers (?) and what can they do? It is time that this matter should be investigated.</p>
