   <p>The milk drivers and other employees of the Western Dairy Co., 1443-49 Edgemont Ave., celebrate Purim each year. At this year's festival they raised $75, of which $40 will go for Moes Chitim (money to provide the poor with food necessaries for Passover), $25 for the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities, and $10 to the Unemployment Fund. Mr. H. Dick, president of the Western Dairy Co., paid five dollars for having been bestowed with the honor of bringing the money to the office of the Jewish Courier.</p>
