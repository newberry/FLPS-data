   <p>Local 12 of the Novelty Leather Workers Union has celebrated a great victory.....</p>
   <p>The gains are: a 44 hour week, wages to be paid on a weekly scale rather then on piece work basis, a raise for one class of workers from $23 to $35 per week, and a raise for a second class from $21 to $32 per week.</p>
   <p>These conditions have been won for 98% of the trade, only two shops remaining outside the agreement: The Columbia Legging Co. and the Western Legging Co. Strikes will be called in these two shops.....</p>
   <p>Mr. I.Gordon is the President, Sam Polensky is the business agent of Local 12.....</p>
