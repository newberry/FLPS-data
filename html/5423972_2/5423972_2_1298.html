   <p>"Stoning of the Jews on the West Side in Chicago is worse than the crimes which are committed against them in Russia, for we are in a more highly educated nation," declared Dr. Emil G. Hirsch at Sinai Temple yesterday. "The attitude of our society circles is the worst form of tribal morality. Tribalism recognizes the right of the individual of other tribes to live, but in these days the Jews are not supposed to have any right to live. To my mind the worst feature of this is the nonresisting attitude by which so many of the Jews encourage this position. The Jewish women's clubs would rather listen to a women with blue eyes and a curved nose. Yet in spite of this adulation the Jew is excluded from society and from the clubs. So far as the Jewish women are concerned, I might seriously consider the advisability of being baptized in order to qualify myself to speak before our race's women's clubs."</p>
