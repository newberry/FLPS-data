   <p>Jewish memorial day, a day set apart by the Jews of the west side for the commemoration of the massacre of thousands of their brethren in Russia, was celebrated in Chicago yesterday and should forever live in the hearts and in the memory of the Jews of two nations.</p>
   
   <p>Prayer for the living and lamentation for the dead mingled with fierce shouts for revenge and the stern call for justice in every Synagogue of the ghetto. Pockets that held but pennies were emptied and hands that toiled a day for a dollar were unclasped that all might go to help the unfortunate numbers of their race.</p>
   <p>And certain it is that the day will not soon be forgotten by the hundreds who crowded the Synagogue at 307 Maxwell Street, for it came near being the last. The congregation of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol B'nai Jacob worships there. The temple was filled to its very doors. The lower floor was a mass of men. The balcony was crowded with women. Suddenly there came a shout that developed into a roar. Panic seized the men and women. They rushed to the door. Their way was blocked but it made no difference. Women fell to the floor and came near being trampled upon. For a moment is seemed that death must certainly be the portion of some. And it would have been but for the reassuring voice of Rabbi Epstein. "Be calm; be calm," he shouted in the language they knew better than any other. He stood before them with hands uplifted. It was a stern voice and one that carried to the farthest end of the building. Every man and woman halted. It was for a moment only, but it was sufficient to save many lives. The women who had fallen struggled to their feet. Those who stood near the door turned to gaze into the face of their rabbi. "There is no danger," he continued, "unless you trample upon one another. You are safe if you will be calm." The people were reassured. They did not know why they were trampling upon one another. They looked about them to learn the cause of the panic. They could see no trace of flames. They could hear none of the sounds that told of a storm. Slowly they sought their seats and when they sat down they discovered the cause of their fright.</p>
   <p>A man had been overcome by the stories of suffering in Russia. He had fainted and had been carried out. It was the sight of four or five men rushing to the door that started the stampede.</p>
   <p>It was a wonderful day in the ghetto. There were no Russian Jews, no Roumanian Jews, and no Hungarian Jews. They had forgotten the land of their birth and gathered to pay honor to those who had been killed. Every street corner was the scene of a meeting. Every man who had any reputation as a speaker called upon the masses to contribute that the condition of the survivors might be bettered. And every man who had any money in his pocket gave a part. But the most wonderful meeting was held at 307 Maxwell Street. The congregation there is composed of Russian Jews. Many of them left the scene of the massacre only a few years ago. Some of them had relatives in that district and did not know their fate.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Epstein was the first speaker and he spoke in the tongue they had learned as children. He told them of the purpose of the meeting. He told of the patience and good qualities of the Jews. He described their lot in Russia. He did not speak in generalities. He spoke as one who was living the scenes of years before. He recalled instances that all remembered. And as he proceeded the tears sprang to the eyes of those that listened.</p>
   <p>Horrors of the Massacres Told</p>
   <p>....."And perhaps there is a young man in this audience, who does not know the fate of his parents," he said. And a wail from a young man told there was. Every eye was filled with tears. A sob came from every throat. Men did not think it mean to weep. Even the rabbi was sobbing and at times it was impossible for him to speak. But from him there came no word that could be construed into a threat. He asked for patience. Alderman Harris followed. "The streets of Russia run red with the blood of Jews," he said. "There are 15,000 dead and all because they were born Jews.and followed in the footsteps of their fathers. They are dead, but there are thousands of our brothers who live and who must be assisted. Will you give? There are thousands of fatherless and motherless children in Odessa. They must receive our first attention. There are thousands who are without a business. There are laborers without arms. Will you give?"</p>
   <p>Contributions Are Generous</p>
   <p>The members of the First Roumanian Congregation, Fourteenth and Union streets, also held a meeting. A committee was appointed and its members will visit all members of the congregation and solicit funds. The members of the Bicker-Cholim lodge held a meeting in the Masonic Temple. They too will solicit funds. Another meeting was held at the Synagogue of the Austria Galician congregation, 410 Morgan Street. Dr. M. Ehrichs, Rabbi Fisher, and H. Rice were the speakers and men and women wept as they were told of the Horrors of Russia.</p>
