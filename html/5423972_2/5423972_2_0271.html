   <p>Among the people there is the belief that among us is found the Thirty Six Holy Ones or Saints on whose account we are all permitted to live. This belief must have come from the strong trait of justice that is sown in the depths of the soul of the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>The Jewish masses that have in the span of hundreds of years absorbed the higher learning of truth and justice have with this standard measured all phases of its surrounding life. Observing how all of existence is contrary to his deep rooted moral convictions, there grew before him this definite question: How is it possible to have such a contradiction in the modes of life against the nature and order of world justice? How can the world be governed unless sinful people are punished?</p>

   <p>The inability to answer these difficult questions gave birth to a belief in the Thirty-Six Holy Ones. There are to be found on the earth thirty-six concealed holy or great men, who possess justice and live their lives in accordance with their high principles. Because of these few people the world lives on. Without their patronage the world would long since have come to an end, for the Great Creator would have destroyed and annihilated his own creation.</p>
   <p>These chosen ones traverse our streets, unknown to us, and accomplish their good and holy deeds quietly. Through accident we become suddenly aware of the lives led by these personalities.</p>
   <p>In our sinful country there also are a few of the Thirty-Six. We do not know them, they are hidden from us because of their good deeds. Only accidentally do we hear that in our midst we had one of these noble personalities.</p>
