   <p>For many years the Jewish workers have carried on a great struggle against each other on account of political phenomena in Jewish life, which was chiefly that they could not agree upon the question concerning nationalism. And the question of Zionism created enough ill felling among the Jewish workers. Many days and years were spent in disputes as to whether or not a Socialist could be a Zionist.</p>
   <p>The strongest argument against the Zionist workers was, "How will you carry on the class struggle and realize your Zionist ideal? You must eventually unite with the Zionist bourgeois. How will you adhere in your class struggle? The argument was very sharp, and it was almost impossible to give any answer which should really solve the class struggle in the Zionist movement.</p>

   <p>It is astonishing how the ways of proletarian Zionists and the other Zionists are proceeding separately in two parallel directions that even a blind one can see now, that the Poale Zionists carry on their class struggle in the realization of the proletarian Zionistic ideal.</p>
   <p>If the civil (bourgeois) Zionists seek to solve the Zionist question, they must approach the civil elements of each country. If the proletarian Zionist, the Poale Zionists, seek a way to realize their Zionism, they must approach the working class, and through their support, they will attain the basic aim.</p>
   <p>If the Jewish worker in general would cast away his pre-war dogmas and closely observe how Zionism is carried on, we would not have so many party controversies; <span class="page-break">\3</span>worker would no longer combat worker; Jews would establish one big party, one organized Jewish working class that would carry on its class struggle against all oppressors, and it would also influence its fellow workers of the other nationalities.</p>
   <p>There is still time for the Jewish workers to see how absurd all arguments were against proletarian Zionism on account of the class struggle. Any other proletariat in the world does not illuminate so strongly its class psychology than the proletarian Zionist in his manner by realizing his Palestinian thought. If the workers, in general, have representatives in the Government who are responsible for war and other bourgeois acts, this can not be said about the proletarian Zionist.</p>

   <p>They, the proletarian Zionists do not do not take advantage of the methods applied by bourgeois Zionists; they have no representatives in the Zionist Cabinets, and are not responsible for any political acts of the general Zionists. The Russian Poale Zionists took a step further by declaring that their class interests are so different from the interests of the general Zionists that they do not even wish to participate in the general Zionist Congress.</p>
