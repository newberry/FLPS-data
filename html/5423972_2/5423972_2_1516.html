   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>March 22, 1877.</p>
   <p>To the Publisher of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>In a postscript to a letter directed to your newspaper and published March 22, you truthfully stated that the Jews are not only religiously united, but are a nation or a race, which fact can not be disputed by anybody.</p>
   <p>On account of so many muddled opinions, I take the liberty to clarify a few points. The Jews do not consider themselves as a religious communion, but a nation, (not politically.) We sometimes hear people say that there are no sects in Judaism in which instance the word sect is incorrectly used. Notwithstanding assertions to the contrary, there are Jewish sects to be found in Western Europe as well as in America, which differ as much as does Catholicism from Protestantism.</p>
   <p>Of course, they all believe in one Supreme Being, but the orthodox and the reformed Jew, differ greatly in their prayers and ritual life.</p>
