   <p>Judge Philip Bregson and Mr. Harry A. Lipsky were in Joliet, May 22, to complete arrangements for the Passover services to be observed by the fifty Jewish prisoners there. Warden Ned Ellen welcomed them very courteously and gave them permission to do everything necessary for the preparation of the Passover services.</p>
   <p>The Warden declared that ever since last Rosh Hashonah and Yom Kippur when the Jewish prisoners had for the first time the opportunity to satisfy their religious cravings, their conduct improved by seventy-five per. cent.</p>
   <p>"We can easily see," said Mr. Ellen "that the fact that their brethren in the outside world take such an interest in them, has had a great moral effect on the Jewish prisoners, giving them a new outlook on life. They also gain the respect of those Jews who have become interested in their plight."</p>
   <p>In the evening, Judge Bregson and Mr. Lipsky addressed the Joliet Jewry in <span class="page-break">\2</span>Stern's Hall, and showed the necessity of organizing a committee to perform the Passover cermony in prison.</p>
   <p>The Jews of Joliet have praised highly the liberal state of mind and human methods employed by Warden Ellen.</p>
