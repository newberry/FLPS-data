   <p>Due to the teachers strike at the Temple Judea, the students are gradually moving. Some went to the Kehileth Jacob Talmud Torah others to the Anshe Sholom and many are at the Rache Leah Talmud Torah and to their joy they all feel as they found the right place, and the right atmosphere for Jewish education.</p>
   <p>The students left at Temple Judea, will naturally follow the example of the others, and our reformed Jews will be left with no Hebrew school.</p>
   <p>Now they are considering a radical school, by the radicals will not go there, because it is not the place for them.</p>
