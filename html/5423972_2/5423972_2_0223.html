   <p>Religion, and especially the Jewish religion, is not a business matter. Religion wants to regulate the relationship of man to God--and when the regulation of these relationships assumes a business like form, it is very tasteless. When certain branches of religion, and especially of the Jewish religion, become systematically commercialized, it is more than ugly.</p>
   <p>On the advertising pages of the Courier one can read that Jews, religious, honest Jews, offer themselves as circumcisers--and, of course, not for the sake of the precept alone; on another page one can read advertisements of Jews, who are offering themselves as marriage performers.</p>
   <p>The everyday Jew, worried about a livelihood, does not notice the pain and disgrace of this condition, and the leaders of the Kehilah, as it seems, are already accustomed to this industrialization of the Jewish religion in America, and are not bothered by it any more. Yet they complain that the young generation is marching along the road of licentiousness, forsaking everything that was dear and sacred to hundreds of Jewish generations.</p>
   <p>In no Jewish newspaper in Russia, Poland, Galicia, Rumania and Palestine, are there to be found such religious advertisements as are found in the Jewish newspapers in America, because in Eastern Europe and Palestine, where Jewish life pulsates strongly, the Jewish religion is not a business, circumcision is not a business, performing the matrimonial ceremony is not a business, and the burial of the dead is certainly not a business. Only here in America the Jewish religion is a business--and from birth until death the religious Jew is persecuted by the businessmen: circumcision has become a business, burial has become a business and even the prayer for the dead is now a business.</p>
   <p>It would be entirely wrong to attack those who are deriving a livelihood from the Jewish religion. They are only victims of certain conditions, which they cannot control. Guilty for this disgraceful condition are the leaders of the community. They are more interested in politics than in the organizing of Jewish life upon a Jewish foundation. Guilty for it is the clique spirit which still prevails within American Jewry.</p>
   <p>We often make fun of the Chassidic cliques; every Chassid visits his Rabbi and every Rabbi has his own Torah. But isn't the clique spirit which prevails within American Jewry much worse than the Chassidic? Chassidism as a whole, has a certain co-ordinated standard, and the Chassidics of all cliques take the same position in regard to the principal religious questions. Such is not the case of the traditional Jew in America. He has lost every standard--he knows no more what a Kehilah is--he knows only the congregation--a private group of worshipers, who do not pray so zealously and often do not pray at all.</p>
   <p>The Congregation, as a private group, has only a certain duty to its members, who annually pay a certain sum. It has no obligation to the community and cannot have one, because it is a private group, which can dissolve any day. The general Jewish work of the congregation depends entirely upon the good will of a few individuals, and even then their activity is limited. They are only a local Talmud Torah or a local clique and no more.</p>
   <p>The general religious-social work is left to the businessman: circumcision, to the professional circumciser; burial of the dead, to the professional gravedigger, etc. From the cradle to the grave the businessman escorts the religious life of the American Jew. The generation which was born here naturally does not know that, in places where Jewish life is pure and honest, such conditions do not exist, yet he instinctively feels that it is not nice, not normal, and he forms an incorrect opinion about the Jewish religion and disregards it entirely.</p>
   <p>The American environment is a more religious one than the Polish, Lithuanian, or the Russian, and the religious life of the American Jew should have been more strongly developed. Instead, we see religious indifference and wantonness everywhere. One of the reasons for this circumstance is the industrializing of the Jewish religion in America. When religion becomes principally a business matter, the respect for it is lacking. And the industrializing of the Jewish religion in America is mainly ascribed to the clique spirit which is expressed in the congregation--a private praying group for weak prayers....</p>
   <p>When the religious life of the American Jews is normal, the clique spirit will disappear. Instead of congregations, one Kehilah should be in existence, and should regulate the entire religious life of the community. Circumcision, kashruth, burial of the dead, etc. should not be turned over to private individuals. Only the Kehilah, as such, should control these religious activities.</p>
   <p>And as long as this is not so, as long as a private business is made of circumcision, kashruth, and burial of the dead, the Jewish religious life in America will make no progress, but will be subjected to shame and ridicule. The Orthodox Rabbi will become a Reform Rabbi, a creature which God has created in His wrath; the head of the community will be a politician and the center of Jewish life will not be the Kehilah, but a clique, the congregation.</p>
   <p>Only the Kehilah can socialize the religious life, and the task before the American Jews now is the establishment of a Kehilah. Congregation means wantonness, Kehilah means a regulated Jewish life. Establish Kehilahs! Let religion cease to be a business!</p>
