   <p>The Poale Zion, of whom we have not heard of in a long time, are announcing their second annual Purim ball to be held Wednesday evening after the reading of Magillah, (The Story of Queen Esther), at the Working Man's Hall. The Poale Zion are Jews with great hearts. We very often criticize our Jewish young men for their neglect of Judaism, but nevertheless when it comes to celebrating something Jewish, they are always the first ones to respond, not only with their presence, but also with their cash. Therefore, we hope that our young men will come in throngs to the Poale Zion Purim ball, where they are assured of a most wonderful time.</p>
