   <p>Three hundred wealthy German Jews, eminent professors, influential advocates, world-renowned physicians, and learned men in general, have affixed their signatures to a document which avowedly affirms their non-relationship with Zionism. They declare that the Zionists are simply a clique of agitators who seek to gain the upper hand of the German Jewry. And, in the interest of German Jews they ask that they should not be identified as Zionists.</p>
   <p>This document, bearing the signatures of these "magnanimous herrs," appeared in the form of advertisements in the most popular newspapers of Germany, because the publishers have refused to print such a libel in the other columns lest they might incur the slightest injury. When the document appeared in the press, many of the signers protested strongly, declaring that they had <span class="page-break">\2</span>not the remotest idea that their names would be used for such a purpose. They also professed that they had little or no knowledge of the contents of the document to where they had attached their names.</p>
   <p>Whatever the thing may be, it is, however, amply clear to all that this act, by these three hundred German Jews, is a disgrace to all the Jewish people. It shows how far removed these learned men are from the inner Jewish life. Even if they had given their signatures to something they were not aware of, it no less shows how indifferent they are toward matters concerning Judaism. They don't care what is being done with Jewish affairs and Jewish interests.</p>
   <p>The present cry, that they were duped, was merely raised because they are beginning to realize what a disgraceful act they have committed. We have given thought as to whom the instigators of this document might have been. It is readily understood that at the head of this undertaking stood Dr. Paul Nathan and Dr. James Simon, who are convinced that Zionists are not "patriots," <span class="page-break">\3</span>that as long as they [the Zionists] want Hebrew used exclusively as the instructing language in the Polytechnical Institute in Jaffe [Palestine], so long should the German Jews keep aloof from them. Nevertheless, these loyal Germans should have borne in mind that three hundred is by no means the entire German Jewry. We can rest assured that the German Jews are not in the least in accord with Paul Nathan and James Simon.</p>
