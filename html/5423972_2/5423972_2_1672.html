   <p>A large meeting of Jewish traveling men was held last Saturday at the Grand Pacific, to take steps in aid of the Russian refugees. It was held at the suggestion of the Russian Aid Society, who believe that such good could be accomplished by the formation of an advisory board of commercial travelers. S. Despress presided, and L. A. Kohn acted as secretary.</p>
   <p>A number of earnest addresses were made, showing the anxiety of those present, to aid in relieving the distress of the refugees by securing them employment. A committee of twenty was appointed to issue a call to all traveling men, for a general meeting to be held this Saturday afternoon, at 3 o'clock, at the Palmer House. The Hon. Simon Wolf, of Washington, it is expected, will address the meeting.</p>
