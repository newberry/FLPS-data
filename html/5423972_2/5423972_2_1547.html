   <p>Those labor leaders who are still under the impression that the workers cannot engage in politics will find it very interesting if they will look into what has occurred here a few days ago in the rank of organized capital. What they will see is of great significance to organized labor, especially to some of the leaders we have in mind.</p>
   <p>A few days ago the Employers' Association of Chicago gave a banquet in honor of the State's Attorney and unanimously endorsed his candidacy for a second term.</p>
   <p>Gathered at this banquet were all the Chicago reactionary elements of organized capital, the very same elements who won't hesitate to use any horrible methods to combat and kill every attempt made by organized labor to protect itself against exploiters.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>At the banquet there was also present the famous Citizens Committee, of sad recollection, whose object is to destroy the unions of the building industries in Chicago and replace them with the "open shop" system. This committee consists of wealthy bankers and contractors under the leadership of Judge Landis, labor's greatest foe. This committee once dreamed that they would become a national body strong enough to start a great movement throughout the country in favor of the "open shop." Fortunately for labor, they did not succeed; the millions of dollars spent by the rich contractors and bankers to support the Citizens Committee did not help. The resistance of organized labor was never so strong against those who wanted do destroy their unions, and the result was that the dream of the committee never materialized, the "open Shop" movement becoming a thing of the past.</p>
   <p>But organized employers are still dreaming and now try to force themselves in the political field, where they hope to have better luck. Their first step <span class="page-break">3</span>is to have a man of their own kind in the office of State's Attorney, since the latter is the most important man in times of trouble, that is, when they have to call on the law for help.</p>
   <p>We understand very well that the State's Attorney, who is endorsed by the capitalist party, would no doubt serve the employers loyally for their endorsement of his candidacy. On the other hand, we realize that the employers taken individually, would approve only of a candidate on whom they can depend, one who will serve their interests well. But this is not as bad as the fact that the employers are declaring themselves openly as an organized body, going so far as to give a banquet in honor of an important city official to whom they publicly promise to give their Wholehearted support for re-election. Another significant fact is that this official accepts the honor of being endorsed by a body that openly demand his election because they can depend on him. These facts speak for themselves, and the organized workers should learn a good deal from them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The same official, who by all means will serve the interests of organized capital alone, for it is his special duty to protect the interests of those who backed him financially, now assumes the role of representative of labor and must also pay a personal debt to those in this group who worked in his behalf.</p>
   <p>The excuse of this group is that they endorsed the present State's attorney because they hope that he will help them weed out of the unions all crooks and gangsters. This excuse is not only a filthy piece of hypocrisy on their part, but shameful and unbelievable. If it is a fact that in the ranks of some unions there are crooks, then let the unions rid themselves of them without asking assistance from capital. Then again, if it ever occurs that through the unwelcome elements in some unions, confusion arises due to their carrying on illegal attacks, then it is the duty of the State's attorney to act, ragardless of whether he did yet support from the Employers' Association or not.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>But the truth of the matter is that for the employers, and particularly for the bosses of the Citizens Committee, there exists no such thing as a good union. All unions, no matter how good, honest and respectable they may be, are painful to the employers. Had they the power, they would abolish all forms of organized labor, and they are trying to accomplish this through the Citizens League, whose first attempt, as we know, failed. To get the State's attorney on their side is just the beginning of the new plan that organized capitalists of Chicago intend to carry through on the political field.</p>
   <p>Therefore, these occurrences must be carefully scrutinized by the conservative labor leaders who still have the old-fashioned idea that the political problems of the nation have no connection with the economic interests of organized labor. The capitalists are more experienced in this regard and, realizing their political weakness, apply all their energy to influence the political field. The fact that employers are organized in various associations is very often <span class="page-break">6</span>considered by certain union leaders who point out the necessity for the workers to be organized in strong powerful unions, so as to stand in a strong and powerful political position, controlled by people of their own class.</p>
