   <p>That which is commonly called "The Jewish Problem" is sort of a magnet - a wheel which is constantly turning. It could also be compared to a "roulette," with an indicator and numerals. The Jewish problem contains many points and folds, and each time the wheel turns, the indicator pauses at another point or fold, which becomes an opposition to various events for a time, until the wheel turns back, and the indicator appears at a different point. Then new events begin and new discussions, until the wheel turns agains. The wheel keeps on turning, and the same points and folds reappear, one after the other.</p>
   
   <p>At present the indicator is at the point of intermarriage. Incidentally, Mr. Israel Zangwill arrived with his play, "The Melting Pot," in which a Jewish young man marries a gentile girl - so the Jewish newspapers and the Jewish pulpit are thundering over the question of intermarriage.</p>
   <p>In an interview, which Zangwill has left as a rememberance to America - of his last visit - he showed himself to be an ignoramus, without any qualifications. He stated that when Jews live among Christians, it is impossible that there should be no intermarriage. As long as Jewish young men associate with Christian girls and vice versa, intermarriages are inevitable. Should the Jews have a country of their own, where Jewish society could be developed and where the Jews would be in a majority, there would be few or no intermarriages. It is, therefore, Zangwill said, that he is a Zionist, for Zionism alone is capable of keeping the Jewish</p>
   
   <p>people from mixtures. This interview had assisted his "Melting Pot," and had called forth numerous comments.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, for the last two Sundays, Dr. Hirsch spoke about this predicament at the Sinai Temple. Should one like to draw a moral from his brilliant discussion on this subject, it may be said: it is entirely wrong to purposely promote intermarriages, for this would mean the eradication of Jews, but in case of accident, what can one do?</p>
   <p>This, precisely, is what Zangwill says, only in a different manner. Dr. Hirsch ended, naturally, not with the conclusion, that, therefore, he is a Zionist, because he is not. He seeks no remedies against intermarriages and offers no advice for its prevention. He is convinced that it is of utmost importance to uphold Judaism, and he is very much disturbed, because Jewish children forsake their religion, in order to marry Christians.</p>
   
   <p>For if intermarriages would not injure the Jewish religion, he would be pleased. His argument that Reform and Orthodoxy are as far apart as Reform and Unitarianism, that one way or another, there exists no Jewish race, why then should a marriage between a Jew and a Unitarian be worse than between a Reformed and Orthodox Jew?</p>
   <p>In this it is very hard to agree with Dr. Hirsch. If we were to ask an Orthodox Rabbi, whether a radical-reformed rabbi is a Jew, he would say yes. He would, naturally, say that the Reformed Jew is a disgrace to Israel, a violator of the Jewish law, but he is still a Jew. Should you inquire of a Reformed Jew, whether or not the Orthodox Rabbi is Jew, he would reply that the Orthodox Jew is a bigot, a fanatic, but that he is a Jew. When inquired of a Unitarian regarding both Rabbis, he would tell you that they are both Jews, but that he does not belong to them, because he was not born a Jew.</p>
   
   <p>What is the difference, whether you call it race, tribe or nation, as long there exists among the Jews, something else besides religion - Judaism, and that this something is what Dr. Hirsch has not explained.</p>
   <p>Should Dr. Hirsch have been a Zionist, he would have said, that this something is the instinct of self-preservation, the natural fear to be wiped off from the face of the earth. But Dr. Hirsch is not a Zionist, and, therefore, this something remains a mystery.</p>
