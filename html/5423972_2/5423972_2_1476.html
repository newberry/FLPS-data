   <p>As this is the time when our fathers and friends of the Old Country, go to visit the graves of the Departed, It would be high time for the Chicago Community to see that such graves should at least be redeemed from desecration. The old Jewish Cemetery of Lincoln Park is in the most neglected condition. A gravestone with a Hebrew inscription serves the purpose of a stoop to a urinal. This is simply a disgrace to our community. Why cannot the bodies be removed from the spot? If the congregation or society which owns the spot is too parsimonious to do it, other Jewish Societies should interfere.</p>
