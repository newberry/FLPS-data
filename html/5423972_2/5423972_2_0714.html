   <p>The Jews have to cope with many difficulties in life and have to struggle harder for their existence than any other people on God's earth, but nothing is more unpleasant than their own ignorance--of matters Jewish. Millions of our people suffer and they do not know why they suffer because their knowledge of Judaism amounts to next to nothing. To suffer without knowing why is the most unpleasant thing in life--and millions of our people do not know why they suffer so much, why fate is so cruel to them.</p>
   <p>How much does the average Jew know about Judaism? How much does he know of the Jewish past, how much does he know of the achievements of the Jewish genius, how much does he know about Jewish doctrines, Jewish ethics, Jewish law, about the Jewish conception of life? Stop the average Jew in the street and ask him: What is the main feature of the Jewish religion, and wherein <span class="page-break">2</span>does it differ from Christianity, since both are considered monotheistic religions? In only one out of ten cases will you receive an intelligent answer. Ask the average Jew about the place of Judaism in history, about the importance of Judaism for modern civilization, and he will look at you with bewilderment because he knows nothing about these things. But ask an American similar questions about America, or ask an Englishman similar questions about England, and you can be sure to get a more or less correct and intelligent answer. Few people realize it that we, the people of the book, know so little about our own book. We may know a whole lot about somebody else's books and orders of life, but we know next to nothing about our own great book, the Book of Books.</p>
   <p>The average Jew is a good Jew, that is to say, he is interested in matters Jewish, is ready to help those Jews who suffer from all sorts of disabilities and oppression, and is always ready to fight against the common enemies, but he is led by instincts only. He does not know the cause of our suffering. We need not dwell upon the disadvantages of this state of affairs. Ignorance <span class="page-break">3</span>of Judaism leads and must lead to the production of all sorts of demoralizing energies--and in many cases, it leads to indifference to all matters Jewish. This is especially true of the assimilated and wealthy Jew. The root and origin of assimilation is ignorance of Judaism. We cannot imagine a Jew equipped with knowledge of Judaism to assume the air of an assimilationist. The rabbi-assimilationist may or may not possess a knowledge of Jewish books, but he certainly does not know much about the life of our people. He who knows something about the life of our people in the countries of the Diaspora, he who knows something about the driving forces in Jewish life cannot possibly advocate assimilation as a solution to the problem, just as no sane man can propose suicide as a solution to man's sufferings on earth.</p>
   <p>Most of the unpleasant phenomena in Jewish life are due to our ignorance of Judaism. And this ignorance is widespread and so general, and it is so especially in the western countries that one must be surprised at the survival of our people in those countries.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>We look with surprise and disgust at the long list of Meshumodim [apostates] issued week by week, by the Jewish communities in Central Europe. In 99 out of 100 cases these Meshumodim know nothing of Judaism and are ignorant of matters Jewish. They say to themselves: why should we suffer? This is, of course, no excuse for their deserting the Jewish camp but it goes a great deal to explain their action. The average Jew is a Jew by instinct but not by knowledge and intelligence, and Judaism is first of all a proposition of knowledge. "The ignoramus cannot be pious." Even Jewish religious piety requires knowledge of Judaism and only a small minority of Jews can boast of possessing it.</p>
   <p>If we mean to cope with our internal problems successfully, we must start not with social or political reforms but with educational reforms. We must enable every Jewish child to acquire a knowledge of Judaism, and only by doing so, will we be in a position to fight the struggle for our existence successfully.</p>
