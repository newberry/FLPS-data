   <p>The battle of the reactionary forces of Halsted Street (the Courier) and of the self-crowned synagogue politicians against the Shochet's Union was discussed yesterday at the meeting of the United Hebrew Trades....and it was decided unanimously to support the schochets and to resist morally and financially the reactionaries attempt to smash the shochets union.</p>
   <p>This decision was made after the delegate of the Schochet's Union and the delegates of the United Hebrew Trades to the Labor Conference had reported what had occurred during the past week and what the employers and the rabbis under the leadership of the reactionaries of Halsted Street (the Courier) had undertaken to perform against the union.</p>
   <p>The plan of these reactionaries is to split the shochets from the union and place them under the supervision of several self-chosen synagogue directorial "pious" Jews. This would make impossible any attempt by the shochets to improve their condition through their connection with the butcher workers in particular and the labor movement, in general.. In case the shochets will not accept this plan fostered by the synagogue politicians and the rabbis, threats are being made to declare all meat of animals slain by unionist shochets as not kosher and thus remove all possibilities as for earning a livelihood.</p>
