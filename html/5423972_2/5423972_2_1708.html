   <p>The Turners Union, Local 45 of the Fur Workers International has recently sent their new demands for the coming 2 years to the employers.</p>
   <p>They ask the following wage scale, for cutlers $60. per week; for operators $50. and for finishers and nailers $40.</p>
   <p>It is understood, of course, that this is a minimum scale, the large majority of the members will not work for such sums. They are getting more at present but this is not the basic point. They demand the abolition of the different scales for slack and for busy seasons. They demand, aside from wages, 10 yearly holidays not omitting the 1st of May; and demand payment for them.</p>
