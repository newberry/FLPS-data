   <p>We anticipated to bring a lengthy report ofthe promised great things that were to be offered by this haute volle congregation, which occured on last Monday evening. We are sorry however, the results proved otherwise, order and decorum were wanting. Much confusion prevailed and the exercises were exceedingly mediocre. They had Christmas trees but no chanuka lights. Is this according to the spirit of the repeatedly claimed talmudical lore of their recently appointed religious teacher? Might not the spiritual adviser have taken less responsibility withthe exercises and thereby avoided the ire of his directors? It is a pity that the talented off-springs in that congregation should have been summarily curtailed of their grand geniuses and forensic display.</p>
