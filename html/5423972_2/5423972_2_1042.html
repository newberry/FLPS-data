   <p>A telegram to the Jewish Labor World informs us that the various committees, consisting of the Congress Committee and the Committee for Jewish Rights which consist of twenty-six central bodies were in unison on all points, and recommended to the executives of both bodies a United Jewish Congress movement.</p>
   <p>(As is already known through the daily Jewish newspapers, a heated debate is going on between the Congress and the National Labor Committee on the one side, and the American Jewish Committee on the other side). When shall the Congress meet? And what shall the principle issue of the Congress be?</p>
   <p>It is clear that the Zionists intend to use the Jewish Congress as a tool for Zionist propaganda.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the Congress Committee want a permanent Jewish Congress in this country to perpetuate the glory of Jewish life. They are anxious to have a Jewish government without a Jewish state. It is true that such a Jewish congress could not accomplish a great deal, and would have even less influence in general Jewish life, but this doesn't worry them in the least. Influenced by Zionism, they want to force their thoughts upon everyone.</p>
   <p>When a Jewish Congress will assemble where all classes, the workers, the middle class, and the rich class will be represented, it will be certain that the congress will be devoted only to those purposes, which have been created by the present war conditions and where it is possible that a united action on the part of all Jews in this country will have the desired influence after peace will be declared in Europe.</p>
   <p>The National Labor Committee was and still is faithful to the principles of the workers. It always stands for equal rights to all, even though it may lead to conflict with the rich class. When the purpose is to help establish citizen rights for a nation discriminated against, we will unite with whoever it may be in order to realize these principles.</p>
   <p>The Congress movement could not and dare not be used for any other future purposes than to help establish Jewish rights in such places where the Jews are denied their rights.</p>
   
   <p>The Zionists should have understood it from the beginning. They would not have been standing like a stone in the way of the movement to organize all classes of Jews.</p>
   <p>Credit is due to the National Labor Committee for the position they have taken in the Congress question. They would not let themselves be misled by anybody, not even by Justice Brandeis, nor Herzl- the God of the Zionists.</p>
   <p>Now that unison in the congress question is a fact, all the Jewish organized workers of the country should prepare to participate and to take active part in the movement, to help, to influence, and to bring about a time where all Jews will have equal civilian, religious, and political rights in every country where Jews live.</p>
