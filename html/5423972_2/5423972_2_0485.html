   <p>Attempts to bar Jews from scholarly competitions, are common knowledge, but when it comes to athletics, women's athletics at that, they're something strange and new.</p>
   <p>Six Jewish clubs are barred from entry into the annual tournament of the Western Women's Golf Association. The Jewish clubs may not compete because they hold only associate and not full membership in the Association. And to become a full member, a club, must have a membership acceptable to the executive committee of the Association.</p>

   <p>Two years ago, we are told by Mrs. Hathway Watson, former president, a vote was taken by the entire membership on the question of admitting the Jewish clubs (the only associate clubs in the city) to full membership. The results of the vote must have been unsatisfactory to the Jewish clubs, who had urged it to be taken, for immediately they commenced sending in their resignations. The Ravisloe was first and was quickly followed by the Lake Shore, the Idlewild, and the Northmore.</p>
