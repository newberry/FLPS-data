   <p>The protest meeting at the LaSalle Hotel, arranged by the Irish Fellowship Club, to protest against the Russian blood accusation was quite a natural step for this nation which is fighting for its existence in spite of all obstacles placed in its path.</p>
   <p>Except for the Jewish people, the Irish have suffered and endured everything so as to remain a nation, and therefore can more readily sympathize with the Jew and his national tragedy. The Irish, like the Jew, suffers not because he is better or worse than anyone else, but because he wishes to retain his identity as an Irishman or a Jew. Both nations have lost their language, their government, and their land, but they have not lost their identity and for this they shall never be forgiven.</p>

   <p>The Irish protest therefore is no mere almsgiving, but a brotherly hand extended from one brother to another who understands his sufferings. The Jewish people will know how to be thankful to the Irishmen. Although at present we can do nothing but express our thanks, we shall remember this debt of gratitude!</p>
