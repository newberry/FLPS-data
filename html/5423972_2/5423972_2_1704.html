   <p>During the past week (Local 54 of the Raincoat Makers Union) had a double victory. They won their demands in wages and in control. Until recently they had control of the contracting shops only, but now they have an agreement with the manufacturers also.</p>
   <p>But this is not all.....They have succeeded in fully organizing Conrad B. Shayne, a shop which had practically been given up as a lost cause....</p>
   <p>For six long years the local spared neither money nor energy on this shop, but each time the union was dissappointed, and now the shop is unionized.</p>
