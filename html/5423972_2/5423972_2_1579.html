   <p>Chicago is expecting a rise in milk prices. There is no doubt that we will soon have to pay more for milk. There is at present a milk strike in New York, and the milk operators here in Chicago are awaiting the New York results. If the New York milk dealers win their strike, you people in Chicago can be very certain of higher milk prices here also.</p>
