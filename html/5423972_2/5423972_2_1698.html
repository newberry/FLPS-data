   <p>Three conferences have been held between the representatives of the Furriers Union and the Manufacturers Ass'n. No agreement has been reached........</p>
   <p>The Union asks for cutters $60 per week; for operators, women and men alike, $50 per week; for nailers and cleaners $40, for finishers, men and women $40.</p>
   <p>The employers offered the following scale, dividing each work into two grades: cutters, first class, $40, second class $34; operators, first class, $32, second class, $26; nailers and cleaners, first class, $28, second class, $20; finishers, first class, $24, second class, $18.</p>
   <p>Besides this the employers do not wish to accept the system of equal distinction of work, and refuse to acknowledge the right of the business agent to visit the shops and check on the maintenance of the agreement.</p>
