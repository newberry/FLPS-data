   <p>The shochets of Chicago, who are organized in a union under the United Hebrew Trades, decided at its meeting to maintain their union despite the threats of the reactionary forces of the city.</p>
   <p>The question was discussed at yesterday's union meeting and it was decided not to waver even a hairs breadth from their alligiance to the union.</p>
   <p>The question of rejecting the religious authority of the rabbinate also was discussed. The shochets decided that they would accept the rulings of the rabbis in regard to Laws of Kashruth, but in no case would they accept any supervision in the economic phase of their work.</p>
   <p>The rabbis had sent to the shochets a list of eleven points, but only those were accepted which dealt directly with the Laws of Kashruth.</p>
