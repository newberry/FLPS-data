   <p>The Jewish bakers have, at last, succeeded in uniting all the Jewish bakers on the question of baking on the Sabbath. We appeal to all our Jewish consumers to assist the bakers in their earnest undertaking by doing all in their power to avoid buying bread on the holy Sabbath day.</p>
   <p>We are having a special meeting this evening for all the rabbis. Everyone is invited to attend and discuss the holy undertaking of the Jewish bakers. The object of this meeting is to decide on plans whereby this undertaking may be established permanently and a Shomray [a society to help observe the Sabbath] organized. All those who wish to join the proposed society should file their application with us.</p>
