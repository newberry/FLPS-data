   <p>Chicago Jewish youth is preparing to attend the Grand Ball arranged by the local gates of the Order Knights of Zion. The affair promises to be a great coming out occasion for our young Jewish society girls.</p>
   <p>We are now approaching a period in history when we begin to realize that we can no longer live within our own sphere of activities, our little Ghetto, and our own lives. We now realize that we must spread out from the Ghetto. We can no longer remain at home and partake only of the Talmud. We want to see the world and all its pleasures. So say our youth and justly so. If we will not help them create a Jewish world to their liking, they will seek these joys in a non-Jewish world.</p>
   <p>The various lectures series given at the Chicago Hebrew Institute are food for the mind; the body should not be neglected. It is just affairs as that sponsored by the Order Knights of Zion, and the affair to be sponsored by the Jewish Old Peoples Home, that are a step in the right direction.</p>
