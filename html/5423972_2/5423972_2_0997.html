   <p>It has been extremely necessary this year to lay stress upon the statement that Judaism is a religion--not a nationality. The children have heard much from their fathers about zionism. Going back to Palestine has been more or less seriously discussed in their homes. Through the work of the Religious School, the children have been led to see that zionism offers them nothing worth having.</p>
   <p>They have been taught to appreciate the privileges offered in the United States--democracy and religious freedom. Allegiance to the United States, to the Stars and Stripes has been urged upon them. They have taken part in every patriotic activity of the year. They have both thrift and War Savings Stamps and a large number of the children sold or bought bonds of the Third Liberty loan. On February 23rd the school celebrated the birthdays of Washington and Lincoln. The exercises, simple but interesting, were conducted by the boys of the upper grades. It was in bringing flags for decorating on this occasion that one of the boys brought, what he called the Jewish flag.</p>

   <p>This showed the influence of the Zionistic movement and made clear the need of strong, patriotic lessons to overcome it.</p>
