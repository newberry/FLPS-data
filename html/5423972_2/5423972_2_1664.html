   <p>The tailoring manufacturers, members of the Associated Wholesale Tailors Association, have apparently feared the that the Amalgamated was prepared to call, and are withdrawing from their association; three firms promptly surrendered yesterday, closing agreements with the Union, one a 9% raise for all workers, and a $2.00 raise for the cutters.</p>
   <p>These manufacturers were: Ira Barnette, 430 S. Green St., the Treasurer of the Bosses Association, Levine Meyer, Secretary, 318 W. Washington St., and also the independent firm, Grossman Bros., 314 S. Racine avenue, who altogether employ about 350 workers.</p>
   <p>At this rate the above-mentioned firms have destroyed the association and it is expected that the others will take heed of their example and sign agreements with the Amalgamated.</p>
   <p>The news brought about a revival among all tailors. The Amalgamated now begins a powerful campaign to organize the entire industry, introducing into the shops the watch-word: "Join the Union, tailoring workers!"</p>
