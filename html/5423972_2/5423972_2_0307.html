   <p>I am announcing to the most worthy Jewish public in Chicago and vicinity that I have imported from Russia whisky acceptable for Passover use from the well-known firm of Joffa von Krodna. This whisky is distilled twice, and makes a tasty drink. On every bottle there is a religious permit issued by the greatest rabbis in Russia. Whoever desires this whisky should place his order with me as soon as possible for I have not received very much of it. The early bird catches the worm! Peddlers may get a special price.</p>
   <p>I also accept orders to deliver to your home mazoths, wine, flour, sugar, plums, and all kinds of whisky. Everything is kosher and may be used during Passover.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>M. M. Hurwitz,</p>
   <p>1007 South Wood Street.</p>
