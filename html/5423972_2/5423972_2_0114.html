   <p>The meeting next Sunday morning of the Chicago Kehillah should unfold a new page in Orthodox Judaism of Chicago. The contemplated budget of the Kehillah is pitifully small, but at least it is a step in the right direction. Orthodox Judaism in this city needs a central body to act for it, to strengthen it, and to represent it.</p>
   <p>The vexed problem of Kashruth can only be handled by the Kehillah. We all know that one of the most important foundations of Orthodoxy is the use of strictly kosher meat. But how many Orthodox Jews will prefer a complaint against a butcher shop on the grounds that the State Kosher Law is being violated, and further pursue the case through the tortuous windings of court procedure. We all remember the agitation when the Kosher Bill was before the State Legislature at Springfield, and the committees, and the delegations, but does anyone remember the attempts to enforce the act once it became a law.</p>
   <p>Another very fruitful field of endeavor for the Kehillah will be the supervision of wine permits, which Washington dispatches say will soon be granted.</p>

   <p>The wine scandals will be green in the memory of Chicago Jewry for many years to come. We are certain that if the scandals crop up again in the distribution of sacramental wine, that no power on earth will be able to prevent a scandal that the community will never be able to live down. It is manifestly a duty of the Kehillah to take the proper steps to prevent such a scandal.</p>
   <p>The present plan to support the Kehillah is a guaranteed small budget. While this may be good for a start, still, the field for the activities of the Kehillah for the advancement of Orthodoxy is so large that this budget must be increased several times over. According to the present plans it is contemplated to hire a field secretary, but we know that several such field men are absolutely needed, besides a well trained executive secretary.</p>
   <p>It seems to us that in this matter the example of the European Kehillahs could be profitably adopted. For instance, a small tax could voluntarily be collected by kosher butcher shops, to whom the Kehillah would give a certificate that absolute Kashruth is being observed. Or a small tax could be used for the supervision of sacramental wine distribution.</p>
   <p>At any rate the Kehillah should have an assured source of income, and not have to seek charity and always be broke. It is as much a community function <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>as synagogue attendance, and as such its income should be assured.</p>
