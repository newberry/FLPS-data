   <p>To the Editor of the Chicago Tribune.</p>
   <p>Chicago, April 8. - That racial questions should be introduced when a mayor of a large city is to be chosen is a deplorable circumstance. Your statements in your today's and yesterday's issues appear to me not well grounded. While some Jews have probably been influenced by reports of derogatory remarks said to have been made by Mr. Clark about the race, I am confident the majority of the Jewish voters knew nothing whatever thereof. The Jews in this city are so much scattered, and so much divided on questions of religion, politics, etc., that I would be at a loss to know in what way a pronunciamento issued by some Jewish "Boss" could have the desired effect, and if this thing were attempted with a certain free-masonry, and perchance, the Hebrew idiom resorted to, I venture the assertion by far the overwhelming majority of Jews would not understand it.</p>
   <p>If one or the other Hebrew merchants had a personal grievance against Mr.<span class="page-break">\2</span>Clark, rest assured, Mr. Editor, the Jewish citizens at large do not consider that sufficient reason to antagonize him. There was no consolidation on the part of the Jewish votes on last Tuesday. In fact the "Jewish" vote, with its imputed pliable solidity, is a thing more of the imagination than anything else. The most gifted, the most prominent men among them would not undertake to control them or guide their political actions.</p>
