   <p>A very important problem faces the Jewish working class of Chicago and that is: What can be done to make our masses citizens of this country?</p>
   <p>The working class, as a whole, has not solved this problem. A branch of the Workmen's Circle, the Young American branch 227, - which is composed of intelligent American young people, has undertaken this work on a small scale. It opened a League (naturalizations aid) and for a short time contributed good work. One Workmen's Circle branch, regardless of how intelligent its group is could not carry on this work. The League dissolved and the Jewish working masses, again, remain without such an institution.</p>
   <p>Because such an institution is necessary, the City Central Committee of the Jewish Socialist Alliance has therefore, determined to start a movement similar to a movement carried on in New York 13 years ago, and have determined to call a conference to hasten such a movement.</p>
   <p>In order to begin the work immediately, it decided to open offices on certain days in the Douglas Park district and the North West Side. It was also <span class="page-break">2</span>determined to do the work in cooperation with the Young American branch to which a committee was sent. The Young American branch accepted the invitation of the Jewish Socialist Alliance and will begin work tomorrow. The League of the Workmen's Circle Lyceum will be opened tomorrow. The plans for the conference will be drawn by a committee of the Alliance and the Young American branch.</p>
   <p>The office in the Workmen's Circle Lyceum will be open every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Attorney E. Marcus will be in charge of the office. The office on the North West Side will be in the Socialist Institute.</p>
