   <p>In previous centuries, Jewish problems consisted of religious troubles. Religious intolerance embodied the tribulations he suffered from the various countries in which he lived. The Jew's dramatic appeal to the world was: "Tolerance. Has not one God created us? Are we not all the children of one Father?"</p>
   <p>The dramatization of this distressful plea was attempted by a no lesser talent than Lessing, in his drama "Nathan the Wise." The religions of the Christian, Mohammedan, and Jew are respectively portrayed by a Templar, a Christian nobleman; a Sultan; and a rich Jewish merchant. All three are brought together in a conflict that attains a dramatic semblance. It is a conflict of religions that leads man to the heights of suffering.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>But Lessing makes no attempt to solve this dramatic problem. He dispenses with the plot by citing the parable of the three rings, which signifies how man can serve God nobly, each in his religion. He disposes of it with philosophy, instead of drama.</p>
   <p>In present times the story of the entire conflict is ridiculous. There are no great quarrels about the religious question. It is almost impossible, in these days, to present a drama on religious differences.</p>
   <p>We may cite an example from Jewish life proper. Several generations ago, one could build a strong drama, depicting great tragedy around the insignificant incident which forbids smoking on the Sabbath.</p>
   <p>Imagine a capable young man, married to a beautiful Jewish girl, living a life of love and happiness in the home of her father, who is a community leader, and a rich man. The young man begins to read scientific <span class="page-break">\3</span>books, gradually losing his strong belief in the old customs, but outwardly still conforming to them like a true pious Jew. All mothers wish such a son. His modest wife regards him with the greatest admiration. But one Saturday, after the repast, he is found in the garret with a cigarette. Like a cardboard house, his happiness, and that of his family, suddenly collapse. This, and the separation from his wife, offer a tremendous tragedy.</p>
   <p>Well, can we imagine such tragedy in this day and age? This drama, if presented, would astonish many Jews, who would not comprehend what occurred here. Many would be prone to think that the fault lies in his smoking a cigarette in the attic, where a fire can easily break forth. Or it might occur to them that he promised his wife not to smoke. The sin of profaning the Sabbath, when to date 75 percent smoke on that <span class="page-break">\4</span>day or desecrate it in thousands of other ways (now in disuse), cannot serve now in our eyes as sufficient excuse for such forceful dramatic portrayals.</p>
   <p>The old time heretic tried to justify this Sabbath-smoking by clothing it in various philosophical arguments. He presented, from the Torah, sage and scientific books, statements which proved smoking on the Sabbath to be no evil. Today a young man may be seen walking the street on the Sabbath with a cigar in his mouth. Try asking him why he does this on the Sabbath day, and he will regard you with astonishment, since he does not even know it is forbidden. Just imagine presenting a drama on that subject!</p>
   <p>The same is true of the intermarriage problem. Gradually it is becoming less and less of a problem, and therefore loses its value for dramatic material.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>At one time, powerful dramas were written and presented on the theme of interracial love. A Jewish maiden and a Gentile fellow, or a Gentile girl and a Jewish boy, fall in love, become desperately attached to each other, but their differences in belief are an obstacle in their path. Many gigantic dramatic effects were achieved with this theme, as in the case of Ivanhoe, by Walter Scott, or Ludwig Halavi's The Jews, and numerous other dramas written in this vein. A few generations ago, these made strong impressions; today this attitude toward intermarriage is almost nil. All dramas based on this subject appear today to those who read or view them, as greatly overdone. Therefore, why, in truth, should we make so much noise about it when all we have to do is go to a Justice of the Peace, get married for two dollars, and no one would even think of mentioning it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>In this respect, the Jewish theme, becomes weaker and weaker as a dramatic problem on the stage.</p>
   <p>We see this in such plays as "The Little Brother," "The Gentile Wife," etc., which lack a strong central plot, because they still deal with the old questions that have, in the present day, lost much of their meaning.</p>
