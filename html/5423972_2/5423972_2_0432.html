   <p>Mr. Lucius L. Solomons, first vice president of the Independent Order B'nai B'rith, addressed members of the Order in Chicago at the Hotel La Salle commemorating the eighty-fifth anniversary of the organization. In his address Mr. Solomons stated that Jews are regarded as inferior social beings because the Jew allows the critical world to judge him as a member of a race instead of as an individual.</p>
   <p>"Under pressure of criticism," said Mr. Solomons, "the Jew has suffered, and doubly, because he has allowed himself to be judged as a class, not as an individual."</p>
   <p>Mr. Solomons denounced Jewish authors, stage and motion picture producers who presented undesirables of their own race to the contempt of the Jews and the world. "The world unfortunately judges a race or class by its worst members," said Mr. Solomons.</p>
