The fact has been repeatedly pointed out to our correligionists that these private side-shows are an injury to our regular congregations, nay, that some of these minjanim are even a disgrace to Judaism and a libel on religion, but all these undeniable assertions, notwithstanding the disgraceful private speculations multiply with every year.

Many an Israelite would like to join a congregation, not only for the sake of attending divine worship at a regular respected house of prayer, but mostly for the sake of sending his children to the Sabbath school, yet it is almost impossible for them to do so, for they live a great distance away from any Sabbath school, and how can they send little children a distance of several miles, especially in the winter season?</p>
