   <p>If the Jewish employers, who engage women to manufacture dresses, waists and kimonos, would have such big hearts as they have memories, they would treat their employees more humanly.</p>
   <p>Since a year ago, when the women employees of the above mentioned trades struck for human rights and better conditions, the bosses do not forget that the Jewish girls were the fighters for these rights. Now, when the Jewish girls want to work for them, they are not hired. The employers have a blacklist and they all agree not to give anyone work who sympathizes with the union.</p>
   <p>Two bosses have especially distinguished themselves against the Jewish women: Mr. Herman Spivak of 228 Market Street and Arthur Weiss of 317 Market Street. The result is, that these shops are filled with Gentile girls--which is no crime, but they are not organized and they are exploited to the greatest degree. The Jewish girls are discriminated against for fear they will spread propaganda.</p>
   <p>Local 100 of the International will do everything possible to fight these bosses and their actions toward Jewish women.</p>
