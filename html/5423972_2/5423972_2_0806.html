   <p>Chief of Police Garrity said that he would send out a squad of policemen tomorrow to guard the corner of Twelfth Street and Kedzie Avenue so as not to allow any "warfare" to occur between the Poles and the Jews. Mr. Adolph Kraus, president of the Jewish Defense League stated yesterday that he did not expect any trouble. Mr. Kraus issued the following statement:</p>
   <p>"The Jews have never attempted to harm the Poles. On the contrary, they wish to see the Poles happy since no country has as large a Jewish population as Poland. What the Jews demand now is that the massacres should be stopped and that the Jews should be treated as citizens, like all the other groups.</p>
   <p>"I wonder why the editorial staffs of the Polish newspapers did not realize that by intensifying the hatred against the Jews they placed a weapon in the hands of those who are unfriendly toward them. Jews have neither attacked <span class="page-break">2</span>nor criticized the Polish citizens of America. I do not believe that the Poles will use physical force against the Jews. If they will resort to that they will discover that the young, American Jews are like the Irish--they will not run away. Agitation between the two groups of the American population should be stopped immediately."</p>
