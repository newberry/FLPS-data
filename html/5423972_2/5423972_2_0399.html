   <p>In every part of the country, especially in large communities, organizations are being formed for the purpose of furthering the movement of boycotting the Hitler regime. Chicago thus far is, as usual, way behind. Nothing has been done in that direction. Why this backwardness? Why this inactivity? Why this silence? Chicago's four hundred thousand Jews are eagerly awaiting the call to fall in line and march along with the other communities, and do their part in paying the Nazis back in kind for what they are doing to our unfortunate co-religionists in Germany. The time has come when Chicago Jewry must do its share and not wait until it is prodded into action by New York, who do not know who is who or what is what in Chicago.</p>
   
   <p>If this boycott movement in Chicago should become effective, the Kehillah, representatives of the B'nai B'rith, Women's Organizations, labor groups, the Rabbinate, and similar organizations, should be called in, so that all elements comprising Chicago Jewry are represented in the Worthy endeavor. If a thing is worth doing at all, it should be done quickly and thoroughly, without fan fares and publicity stunts. Just do it and that's all. Mr. Max M. Korshak called a preliminary conference where plans will be formulated for an active campaign in this direction.</p>
