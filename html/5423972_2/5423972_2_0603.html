   <p>At this moment when the Chicago Cloakmakers are preparing for a battle, which is expected to be one of the bitterest and most severe in the history of Workers' battles, it is important to say a few words to the Jewish trade unions regarding conditions in the Labor Movement, and what the unions ought to do. To the active members of unions affiliated with the United Hebrew Trades, it is no secret that the Jewish unions are in a very poor condition, both materially and spiritually; each union has its own pack of troubles, and worries over its own existence.</p>
   <p>It has been forgotten that there is such a thing as a general labor-movement. Not one union has any time to think that there are other Jewish unions, and were there not a central Jewish Workers Body that meets every two weeks and receives reports from the delegates, there would be no sign of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>United Hebrew Trades movement. The time has now come to remind the Jewish trade unions, and especially their officials and active workers, that the way things are going now, the organized Jewish labor-movement will not make any progress from any standpoint.</p>
   <p>It is true that your own Union comes first, but there must be a place in the program of labor organization to unite all the unions for the general workers interests, materially, culturally, industrially, and politically. Such connections, such unity of interests do not exist among our various Jewish trade unions, and when the delegates of the United Hebrew Trades meet, there is very little spoken of general principles and material interests, and less and less are such questions being brought to the organizations by the delegates.</p>
   <p>At the meetings of the individual trade unions there seems to be little that indicates a general labor movement with mutual class interests. From the minute the meeting is opened until its closing only matters of local interest <span class="page-break">\3</span>are discussed, but the members do not stop to consider that they are a branch of a labor movement, which thought they must bear in mind if they want to be considered an honest-to-God labor organization.</p>
   <p>It is possible that I have aroused anger for exposing the faults of our Jewish-unions, but the truth must be told and I have decided to talk things over with the Jewish trade unions, or rather, with the active administrative spirits of our locals, and see if it is possible to rouse them from their long sleep and bring more life, more spirit, more activity and greater class-consciousness in the life of the Chicago Jewish Workers.</p>
   <p>Such a thing as a united Jewish trade union movement exists not only for the unions themselves, but for the greater interest of the labor class.</p>
   <p>The first question I would ask these unions is: Are they interested in the approaching battle that faces the Cloakmakers? Do they intend to discuss <span class="page-break">\4</span>the reasons and the motives of the fight that the bosses are forcing upon them? Do they realize what it means, and do they feel the imminence of the struggle - for if it does break out it will involve the existence of all other unions that are in the same position.</p>
   <p>It is time for the Jewish organization to discuss this question seriously. They must not forget that the Cloakmakers' battle threatens the existence of all the Jewish unions.</p>
   <p>With a strike only a few weeks off, the Jewish trade unions should raise the question and decide what to do when the fight does break out. The unions must take a stand and instruct their delegates to the United Hebrew Trades, so that the central labor-body will carry out their decision.</p>
   <p>The existing conditions in the cloak trade gives the Jewish Trade Unions an opportunity to turn over a new leaf in the history of Jewish labor-movement on the subject of mutual support, for that is the basic principle of the labor movement, <span class="page-break">\5</span>the foundation upon which the future human society must be built, and that spirit is missing.</p>
   <p>Another question that our Trade Unions must take up is the cultural and spiritual side of the Jewish labor movement which is being neglected by all the unions, with but few exceptions.</p>
   <p>The Jewish trade unions, as they now function with regard to spiritual, cultural, and social-education, can exist a thousand years, and will show no signs of progress in the direction of class freedom. What do our Jewish trade unions do to educate their members in the ideas, principles, and theories of class struggle? Nothing! The Jewish unions do not spend one-cent for educational work. They do not arrange lectures for their meetings. They do not educate their members in anything that deals with the labor movement.</p>
   <p>They do not discuss the problems that face the labor organizations, nor do they speak about current questions, whether of local, national, or international importance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>At the union meetings there is neither time nor desire for such debates.</p>
   <p>The members come to the meetings; they yell, they insult one another; make motions and points of order, insults the leaders and officers and call them grafters, and that is the way the meetings end.</p>
   <p>But questions such as the railroad strike and why it did not materialize, the armament conference and its meaning to the Worker, taxation which enriches the Government and enslaves the masses, municipal-ownership, crime and graft, and other economic, social and political problems are completely ignored. I am pointing out these facts to the Jewish unions, because the gentile unions discuss such subjects and they submit resolutions to the American Federation of Labor.</p>
   <p>To my sorrow I must say that the Jewish unions interest themselves very little with the general Workers' movement.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>This condition is not a healthy one and must be altered. Naturally, it remains for the United Hebrew Trades to discuss these important problems.</p>
   <p>Now is the proper time; the conditions and the circumstances demand it. Let us place the Jewish unions on the spiritual and cultural basis upon which it must and will stand.</p>
