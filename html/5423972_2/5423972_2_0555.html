   <p>The reactionary Courier showers the Cloak-Maker's Union with new prevarications. The Courier received a sharp and well earned answer to its lies, by Comrade Max Brodsky, secretary-treasurer of Local 100, International Ladies Garment Workers Union. The answer speaks for itself.</p>
   <p>Brodsky's Statement.</p>
   <p>"I deny all statements that were published in the Courier under my name. I am absolutely not responsible for yesterday's scribbling in this paper, in which an attempt was made to justify itself by using my name. I want to emphasize that whatever the Courier wrote about me is a lie.</p>
   <p>"First of all, the Courier wanted to show that I was a candidate for secretary-treasurer of the Joint Board on the left-wing ticket; the Courier also tortures itself in proving that in the Joint Board can be found two sections, a left-wing and a right-wing. I deny this.</p>

   <p>"It is also said in the Courier that Schoolman and those who supported Rosen's candidates, compelled me to withdraw my candidacy as secretary-treasurer of the Joint Board. This is not true. The truth is as follows: Brother Fogel, manager of the labor department of the Joint Board, proposed that both candidates should withdraw in order to avoid certain misunderstandings. I immediately accepted Brother Fogel's proposal and resigned. When I was, later, renominated I refused to accept the nomination. However, Brother Rosen remained a candidate and the result was that Conefsky was elected. This is the truth, not as the Courier had written."</p>
