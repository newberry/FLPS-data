   <p>The members of the Jewish Bakers, Local 237, celebrated a victory yesterday. The bosses all came to the Union and signed an agreement with Local 237.</p>
   <p>The Union demanded a raise of $6.00 a week, for first and second bakers, and $2.00 a week for third-hand bakers.</p>
   <p>The bosses at first refused these raises and the Union determined to stop the work of those bosses who refused to grant the demand, giving them until Sunday midnight. The bosses signed the agreement, making it unnecessary to stop work in any one shop. The bakers will also be paid for the ten Jewish Holy days in the year.</p>
