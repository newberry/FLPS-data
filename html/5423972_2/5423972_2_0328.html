   <p>Congregation Ahavath Achim thanks Mr. and Mrs. Aaron and Jessie Rosenberg for celebrating their son's Bar Mizvah [ceremony of confirmation when a Jewish boy is thirteen years old] in our synagogue, 108 Newberry Avenue.</p>
   <p>The Bar Mizvah ceremony was beautifully performed by the son. The teacher of the Bar Mizvah, Rabbi Jacob Dolnitsky, must be a genius in preparing Bar Mizvoth; the boy certainly knew his part well.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Rosenberg, the mother of the Bar Mizvah, donated a hand-made and beautifully designed silk cover for the scroll of the Holy Torah. Mr. Rosenberg, the father of the Bar Mizvah, made several donations to the Congregation and to other institutions--mainly charitable institutions. We thank the parents of the boy.</p>

   <p>Sussman Bernson and Meyer Moses,</p>
