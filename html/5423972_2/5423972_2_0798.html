   <p>As mentioned yesterday in the Courier, the Poles who have been arrested will be arraigned today before Judge Gemil in the Municipal Court. The chief culprit, Casimer Lota, had led a mob of Poles who were intent on making a pogrom against the Jews in South Chicago because they claimed that a Jewish merchant, H. Cohen, 8401 Buffalo Avenue, had enticed a Polish lad into his store and had put him to death in order to use his blood for religious purposes.</p>
   <p>The warrant for Casimer Lota was taken out by Marcus Cohen, one of Mr. H. Cohen's sons whom Lota had tried to attack, crying, "Return our son"; then, without waiting for a reply, he shouted, "We must kill the Jews!" The policeman who made the arrests is also a Pole and it is very doubtful whether he will tell the entire truth in court since he stated at the station that the arrested were merely excited but had harmed no one.</p>

   <p>Charges against Casimer Lota are both disorderly conduct and incitement to riot. In order to establish their case, the Cohens, through their lawyers, will today request a postponement of the trial.</p>
   <p>In the meantime Jews of South Chicago are in constant fear of a pogrom. The Cohens are particularly concerned, and deliberated yesterday as to whether or not they should open their store today.</p>
   <p>Poles in the vicinity still maintain that a Polish youth was murdered in the store and that the police, who searched it, carried the body out the back way. Already two Polish witnesses say that they heard the boy's cries as he pleaded with the old Cohen to spare his life.</p>
   <p>The Cohens appealed to Mr. Frank Ridzevski, one of the election commissioners in Chicago who lives not far from them. They asked him to request priests and pastors to speak, yesterday morning, in their churches in order to quiet <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the agitation. Mr. Ridzevski, who is a liberal person, agreed; several priests did him that favor, telling their listeners to forget such nonsense, about Jews needing Christian blood to bake their matzoth, and also declared that no Polish youth had been murdered by Mr. H. Cohen.</p>
   <p>But fanatic Poles are too deeply enraged. The fright of Jews in South Chicago increased yesterday upon hearing that Polish workers instead of going to work today will strike, ostensibly for the liberation of Tom Mooney, but actually will [use the occasion to] vent their wrath upon the Jews.</p>
   <p>The office of the Courier was assured yesterday by the Chief of Police in Chicago that enough police will be sent there to maintain order. A search will be made for the Polish family which seeks a son, in order to clear the issue.</p>
