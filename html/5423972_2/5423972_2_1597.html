   <p>When the well known Jewish millionaire and philanthropist Mr. Julius Rosenwald woke up this morning, he was informed that there is a company of Real Estate promoters who wish to relieve him of four hundred and fifty thousand dollars. A report was published by the City Press association in all English papers that a meeting was held in the Apollo Hall and it was decided that Mr. Rosenwald give four hundred and fifty thousand dollars to each group of 450 Jewish farmers to buy farms in the state of Oregon.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald was interviewed by a Courier reporter to whom he stated that this report was absolutely without foundation, he never had any such idea on his mind of having a Jewish Farmers Colony in Oregon.</p>
