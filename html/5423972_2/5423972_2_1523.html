   <p>A discourse by Dr. Adler, a Jewish clergyman, on Sunday, should attract some attention from its high-toned and broad liberality. He advised his co-religionists to give Christianity every possible respect, to avoid harsh and unkind criticisms of Christian dogmas, and to extend to the followers of that faith the same consideration and toleration which the Jewish believer wishes to be afforded to his own religion.</p>
   <p>This is a veritable return of good for evil. No class of men has been so persecuted by so-called Christians as the Jews. For ages, the latter were regarded by the former as ligitimate objects of abhorence, contempt, despoiling, and persecution. Under the Old Testament teaching of an "eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth," the Jews owe the Christian world a heavy debt of vengeance; but, this modern representative of the race shames the history of the Christian persecutors of his people, by inculcating the Christian sentiment of, "Love those who hate you." The sentiment not only shames the record of the treatment which Christian has extended to Jew, but it indicates a great advance in a people, who once hewed their progress through adjacent nations by Divine command, and who since have not had that bloody order countermanded. The savage code established under the Divine hierarchy, provided at the birth of the race, has never been repealed so far as the Jews are concerned.</p>

   <p>It is, therefore, no small anomaly that, for centuries, Christianity, ostensibly a faith of love and toleration, has put to blush the most sanguinary commands of the Jewish code, while the Jews, with their bloody laws still in force, have placed themselves upon the true Christian ground of fraternal love and broad toleration.</p>
