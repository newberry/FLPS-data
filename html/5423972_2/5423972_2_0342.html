   <p>The system prevailing among our synagogues of counting only heads of families as members comes in for pointed criticisms not free from sarcasm. We can assure our fair opponent that with all her deep learning, she fails to understand the plan of operation which governs the fiscal policy of Jewish congregations. Women are not excluded as in proven by the fact that widows enjoy the same right as the men who are heads of families. Membership in Jewish congregations is a matter of financial obligations.</p>
   <p>Outsiders should not confuse membership in the synagogue with what is implied by the same expression when used in reference to a church. Should,for instance, a single woman, or even a married woman, apply for membership in Sinai Congregation, there is nothing in our constitution to disbar her. She will assume a fixed financial responsibility and this is all the privilege which she, or any other member will enjoy, and which is not extended to those who are not members.</p>
