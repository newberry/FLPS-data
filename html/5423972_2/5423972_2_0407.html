   <p>The educational season has arrived. The season arrives of itself but it is problematic how far and how much of the educational will arrive this season. The American Jew has traveled very far in this country. His progress is not very different from the progress made by other groups. But he has found that his progress has been unimpeded in this country for the first time in a very long time and he should keep pace with all the rest. And so the American Jew has marched from the basement residence to the room behind the little grocery store, to the little stove-heated home for which the mother carried the coal and the water, to the steam-heated apartment in which there was considerable pride of achievement and home-feeling, to the suite in the splendid apartment for which the rent is probably paid out of the coupons of the mortgages held on the hotel - if they are being paid - and all along there was the steady march of material progress. It was a unique experience in Jewish life, this unimpeded march with plenty of opportunity for individual prowess. It is no wonder that as children with a new toy, American Judaism should have come to think very gratefully of its material possessions and rejoice in them.</p>
   
   <p>For that march there did not come the call for organization. The land and its markets were open, the opportunities were there and each man - again as in all other groups - pushed out and reached and possessed for himself. The net result was a conglomeration of people who happened to be living together. They had to live together, business was not impeded but the social life was impeded. From the opening of the business hours to the last hour of business, America was one camp but with the close of business hours each group went to its tents. And under those conditions the word "community" might loosely be applied to the Jews who by force of circumstances lived together and moved together from one section of the city to another. The American Jewish community picked up something on the march and lost something as well. While the march could, until very recently, have been pictured as a glorious success, from one point of view, from another it was a dismal failure, And that other is the chief factor really, in the creation of a genuine community. There is no community as long as men and women just buy and sell real estate, or manufacture and sell. There is only a community when men and women will join in the maintenance of cultural and educational and religious work. There were days, of course, when the far-sighted men of America saw the need of this factor in the creation of a community. The blessing of their vision is the union of American Hebrew congregations. The Hebrew Union College, the Jewish Theological Seminary, the Jewish Institute of Religion and other institutions in which Jewish knowledge is spread, and the Jewish tradition and spirit kept alive and enriched. But the march of the American Jew could still be described as a failure.</p>
   <p>Parallel with the economic march was the educational march. The family living in the basement would not think of letting children grow up without some instruction in the history of the people to which both parents and children belonged. The instruction may have been, and from the point of view of these, our days, we can say that it was inadequate, but the proportion of the income of a family spent on the Jewish cause by an impoverished family struggling along was more than adequate. Families saved and stinted to pay the Hebrew teacher. In the little back room of a grocery store or in the home of a wage earner, there was always something laid aside each week for the support of the congregation, and again the proportion of the income used for educational purposes was very large. The ratio has been falling steadily, on the march, and we can say of American Jewry that it does not support its cultural, educational, religious spiritual work adequately. We have lost something on the march, and the loss shows itself these days. At the beginning, the first need that the poor Jew supplied was the affiliation with something. We are no poorer these days than we were in the beginning of the march but the first thing to be slashed from the family budget is the amount, never set aside, just sent when the bill comes, contributed to the cultural work of Jewry. It is pathetic that this should be. We are not saying that the problem of providing just bread for the needy is not heavy these days. But we are saying that the cultural needs should not vanish. We shall impoverish the whole spirit of the Jew at very great risk.</p>
   <p>Perhaps days like these show us how unorganized we are, and how little one section of the community helps another section. In the eyes of the world we possess virtues that we really do not have. The world thinks that we act as a body; the world thinks that if they have a rabbi on the committee, all of the Jewish community will contribute to a cause, and if they put a certain proportion of Jews on the governor's commission, the Jews have been lined up solidly for the cause. It is not so at all. We have no organization. If we had, we would not now be facing the danger of foreclosures in temples - one foreclosure is already recorded. We would not now be facing the need of cutting down on the work of the educational boards. The Christian community that is organized is not stopping its work in the home and foreign missions.</p>
   
   <p>There are still men who give lavishly because they love the cause. Christianity has retained its missionary zeal. In Judaism, because we have lacked organization we let the congregations struggle along. If a congregation is rich it is rich for itself, and if it has a rabbi, its rabbi will be on all committees, because the non-Jew is shrewd and wants money and the rabbi can very well be used to get money. If a congregation is poor it struggles for itself. Now is the time for a group of men and women, who have the cause of Israel at heart to get together and discuss the whole situation of Judaism in these troublous times. If the pressure continues, there will be little left of all the cultural activities and some of these days they will have to be started from the bottom again. Financial stringency is hurting, but financial stinginess and lack of organization are hurting the community much more.</p>
