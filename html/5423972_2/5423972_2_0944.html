   <p>All Jewish workers will cease work and all Jewish business will close at 2 P. M. Jewish children will not play in the streets. We must show that the brothers of those, whose blood is painting the streets of the cities, whose courage has been broken, whose pride is being dragged in the dust. whose goods and wealth has been stolen or has gone up in smoke are ready to do anything so as to stop the pogroms, the eternal shame of the twentieth century.</p>
   <p>The District Committee demands that all Comrades join in the march to the Auditorium Theater. Comrades, he who will not put work or business aside or who will stay at home during this day of the procession and protest will be branded a traitor. We are certain that all our comrades will join in the march.</p>
   <p>For the District Committee</p>
