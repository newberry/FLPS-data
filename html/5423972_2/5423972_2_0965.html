   <p>In the West, the white dove of Peace flies to impart the news of immediate peace, but in the East there still roar machine guns and cannons. Instead of Peace doves, there fly torpedoes and bombs spreading death and destruction.</p>
   <p>While in Paris there is bargaining over the famous fourteen peace points, in the East there continue fourteen wars, the fires of which flare around the Jewish quarters. As always, in the sequel of a large fire, scoundrels and outcasts of mankind come forth from their hiding to rob, murder, steal, and plunder. In the alarm and din of the fire, when all eyes are riveted on the sea of flames, these rascals, like stealthy night thieves, overcome their helpless victims with the grimness of murder.</p>
   <p>All Eastern Europe is yet under fire of the War, Civil war, revolution, and Jews of those regions are not only victims in the line of fire but also victims of those dark lawless elements which are taking advantage of War's turmoil <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and tumult to annihilate them.</p>
   <p>While peace is being discussed in Paris, hungry and forlorn Jews are being murdered in Poland and Rumania, thus prolonging a barbaric war against a people helpless to defend themselves. War is not the term for the atrocities of Poles and Rumanians against our people. Slaughter is the fitting word, and these slaughters are executed in a manner displaying the very worst traits man is capable of achieving. It is accomplished in numerous zones and in numerous fashions: setting fire to a synagogue filled with Jews; attacking a Jewish neighborhood, murdering all its inhabitants; leading Jewish deputies from their meeting place, and shooting them cold-bloodedly; robbing an entire Jewish community of its last food supplies that they should die of hunger; tormenting and crucifying Jewish individuals; and the slow torture that does not permit the victim to die while their tormentors look on and laugh.</p>
   <p>The evil spirit and evil imagination of the two degenerated countries, Poland and Rumania, purport to murder millions of Jews, and in Paris they speak of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>peace and justice. Poles and Rumanians are leading an entire people to the scaffold and we here devote our thoughts to national justice and cultural autonomy. Over there Jews are being burnt at the stake as was done 500 years ago in Spain, and we are creating beautiful plans for the future set to futuristic music.</p>
   <p>Our people are being murdered on the other side of the sea, and a whole world is silent. The black dark earth of Poland and Rumania is now being soaked red with Jewish blood, and we Jews say nothing, we make no motion, no movement, as if it were no concern of ours while the truth is that those whom the Poles and Rumanians are now putting to death are our own flesh and blood, our blood, we, born of one father, hewn of one stone. Are our imaginations dulled, our hearts stoned, and our spirits estranged? Or do we see the sufferings of our brothers and sisters in Polish and Rumanian lands but know not how to bring them succor?</p>
   <p>Can we help them, can we save them from the talons of their foes?</p>
   <p>If one witnesses the murder of his brother, he cries loudly for help, hollers, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>and makes himself heard if he himself can do nothing in the matter. His noises attract attention so that perhaps other people will come to his aid and rescue his brother from the executioner. Such are the dictates of brother instinct and the conscience of man. Call for help, holler, to save your brothers from murderers if you yourself can do nothing.</p>
   <p>But we are silent while our people are being murdered. We do not protest or raise our voices, make no attempt to aid or rescue them. Looking on is not a wrong but a crime for which there is no atonement.</p>
   <p>Too long already have we remained silent. Who knows how many brothers and sisters we may have saved had we protested. Should we continue in this attitude, we would not deserve to be called Jews.</p>
   <p>Now is the time for America's three million Jews to make themselves heard in the following clamor: "They are murdering our people." They should lift <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>their voices like a ram's horn and state their protests.</p>
   <p>These three million American Jews should now go forth with a black flag and notify the world of the tragic situation in Poland and Rumania. It is time that they arise as one man to tell the world: "As long as Jewish quarters in Poland and Rumania are diverted into fields of scaffolds, there can be no peace on earth, only civil wars, revolutions, and Bolshevistic plagues."</p>
   <p>It is now that we must go forward and protest against the afflictions of our people.</p>
   <p>The protest is our only weapon.</p>
   <p>We must use this weapon against the murderous enemy. If not, we can blame only ourselves for these massacres. Our silence encourages the enemy to continue his brutality, as a sign of weakness and helplessness on our part.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Hundreds of thousands of Jews in Poland and Rumania pay with their lives for our continued silence. Yes, it is our responsibility.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we must lift our voice of protest. What more have we to fear of the Poles and Rumanians since they can do no worse in their plunders and pogroms than that which has already been done. In all Poland and Rumania there are not enough knives to kill all the Jews in one day, although every knife on hand finds its way to the throat of a Jew.</p>
   <p>In protesting, we have nothing to lose and much to gain. Let us protest against this slaughter of our people.</p>
