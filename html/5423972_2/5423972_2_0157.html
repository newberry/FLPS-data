   <p>There was a meeting last night at the Anshe Sholom Center of rabbis, synagogue presidents, and prominent citizens. The problem of Sunday funerals was discussed.</p>
   <p>Dr. Meyerowitz, chairman of a committee of nine, which had been elected at a previous meeting to work out a plan whereby funerals could be held on Sunday despite a decision of the Liverymen's Association and the Chauffeurs' Union not to permit funerals on Sunday, reported that the committee had found a way by which funerals could take place on Sunday. The plan is this: The dead body should be brought on Friday or Saturday evening to the cemetery of the Free Burial Society, or to any other cemetery where there is a chapel. The body should remain in the chapel until Sunday morning,and two sextons should watch over the body while it is there. On Sunday, the relatives and friends of the dead person will come to the cemetery and the funeral will take place.</p>

   <p>The plan was discussed in detail by all those present, and it was decided that the plan could easily be carried through, and that from now on funerals would take place on Sunday in accordance with this plan.</p>
   <p>It was also decided that all the rabbis should give an explanation of this plan for Sunday funerals in their synagogues this Saturday.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adolph Rabin was chairman of the meeting.</p>
