   <p>The modern Tag Day as it is known in America, or Flower Day as it is called in Russia, is no new discovery in the field of social work in modern charitable contributions or collections. It matters little which name it assumes since it is nothing more or less than an old Jewish custom in which every worthy institution and organization had its chosen section of the Pentateuch. The The Saturday on which this section was read was the Tag Day, or Flower Day of that particular worthy community.</p>
   <p>In the good old days, when the synagogues or religious schools were the spiritual homes for the Jews, the centers where all Jews gathered, when <span class="page-break">\2</span>Saturday was not only a day of rest from physical work but also a day of care for the spiritual work of the community, in those days it was, we find, the custom to hold Tag or Flower Days, the income from which was given to charity. Every institution had its section and its week of reading.</p>
   <p>When respectable Jewish citizens went to the synagogue to pray on Saturday they already knew which Flower Day they had that day and considered it degrading to come home without a flower.</p>
   <p>New times, new customs, and no more Pentateuch customs. One is tagged and buys a flower; instead of the beautiful Saturday contributions, committees are sent out on Sunday to get subscribers. It may be that the circumstances <span class="page-break">\3</span>of the neighborhood have so been altered, that they fit the new methods much better. But, we must not forget that there are many, many people to whom the original Jewish form of the Tag Day or Flower Day is still dear to their hearts. They will come to the synagogue on Saturday to "Honor" this or the other institution.</p>
   <p>The Saturday chapter "Veiero" has for hundreds of years been allotted to the "Hachnosess Urcheem" (a home for the wandering homeless). There is not a single place where Jews did not observe this regulation on that Saturday. When Jews gathered, wherever they were permitted to settle, their first task was to make a haven for those less fortunate than themselves, who had no homes. A so-called corner was set aside for wanderers or strangers - one Jew is not a stranger to another - he is a guest, and a guest room was set aside for such purposes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Our Biblical Abraham may be called the "Patron Saint" of this custom; the Hachnosess Urcheem was even called Abraham's Hotel, Abraham being the symbol for this guest friendship among the Jews. How guests are to be treated is symbolized in the chapter of the Veiero implying even many things not mentioned in the Torah. The Jewish strength of imagination is expressed in our commentaries with all sorts of legends in the first paragraphs of the Veiero, and, therefore, this chapter has become the one said for the Hachnosess Urcheem, and the Saturday when it is read become the Hachnosess Urcheem Saturday.</p>
   <p>There is no reason why this good and beautiful custom should become non-existent. When the Federation began financing all the Jewish charitable institutions it certainly had no intention to do away with everything that is beautiful, poetic, traditional and endeared to the Jew. The Federation <span class="page-break">\5</span>wishes only to make everything better and more convenient. It does not wish to destroy anything, especially this beautiful ancient custom that Jews have had for hundreds of years in all their diasporas.</p>
   <p>Of course, it is understood that it is not for the Federation to take the initiative to establish a "Hachnosess Urcheem Saturday." It does not belong within her scope of work. With the Federation, every day is a Hachnosess - Urcheem Day. Such a Saturday should be made by the officers and leaders of that institution. They could do this if they so desired.</p>
   <p>It would certainly be very appropriate if Mr. Thomas Pyzer, the president of the Hachnosess Urcheem, called a special meeting of his directors and made a special Chapter Veiero program, one to be used in all the synagogues <span class="page-break">\6</span>in Chicago. The Rabbis should mention this in their sermons. The donations will belong to the Hachnosess Urcheem. Everyone wishing such a Saturday should be tagged for the Abraham's Hotel and the spirit of Hachnosess Urcheem should rule in those places where Jews gather for that occasion.</p>
   <p>We believe there can be nothing finer or better or more elevating from the Jewish point of view than a decision whereby all the directors, headed by their officers, would choose, on this Saturday a synagogue for prayer where all should come in parade. The Rabbi should have an especially fine program, making it a truly fine Hachnosess Urcheem Holiday.</p>
   <p>It is not the amount of money raised on such a traditional tag day that is our main concern. It is the spirit and the impression that it makes on the Jewish heart and soul, the get-together of the masses, thus acquainting them with the activities of this great magnificent institution that is most important.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>It should be understood that the income of this ancient tag day will be used for the Hachnosess Urcheem and for that institution only. Sooner or later a new building will have to be erected and modern improvements installed. It must not be forgotten that a Jewish Hachnosess Urcheem is not a home for strangers, but for guests, and a guest is not given the worst room, but quite the contrary. The time is past when Jewish communities built charitable institutions with first and second mortgages to permit shifting from building to building.</p>
   <p>A well established Hachnosess Urcheem tag day may add a goodly sum to the building fund, and, when the time comes, the money will be used for this suitable purpose.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>According to the chapters of the week, and the Jewish customs, one finds the Hachnosess Urcheem first on the list of the winter Saturdays. The chapters continue each week with each institution assigned its portion, but we find that they are not uniform in all districts...</p>
   <p>It is certainly desirable that the respective charitable institutions should again install, in Chicago, the old true Jewish customs and if the Hachnosess Urcheem were the first to start, we are certain the other institutions would follow in its footsteps to the greater respect and honor of the Jews.</p>
