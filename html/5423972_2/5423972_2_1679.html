   <p>The business agent of the Baker Bosses plans a contrivance to harm the Baker's Union.</p>
   <p>A plan to undermine the Baker's Union by Mr. Jacob Cohen, was unveiled at the strike now in process, at Jacob Gonkowsky's bakery, 2219 W. Potomac Ave. Mr. Gonkowsky is located near the bakery shop of Mr. Moskovitz, 2219 W. Potomac, where a strike is also being carried on. Moskovitz is selling his bread at 7Â¢ and attempts to persuade several women that the Union is against a reduction in bread, showing that the Union conducts pickets at his shop, telling the women not to buy his bread. The Union stopped the picketing in order to deny the boss any false pretexts. Upon observing this, Mr. Gonkowsky wanted also to reduce the price in bread. Then the business agents of the Baker Bosses Association stepped in and promised Mr. Gonkowsky that the Association would pay him for any trade loss, if he continues with the high prices.</p>
   <p>It is readily understood that they persuaded Mr. Gonkowsky to break the agreement with the Union, and he did so by discharging the Union workers and declaring a fight, against the Union.</p>
   <p>The Baker's Union calls a meeting today, at 3420 W. 12th St. to discuss the situation.</p>
