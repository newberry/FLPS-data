   <p>It is excusable for the German paper to make the charge that Chicago was unwilling to receive more immigrants. At that distance from us, they had no means of ascertaining the true conditions of things, nor of learning who Mr. Greenfelder and Mr. Kiss are, and what positions they occupy in our community. But what shall be said of the Rabbi from Baltimore who rushed headlong into his pulpit and edified his hearers by a furious onslaught on Chicago and myself, in particular, because we, he claims, were haters of the Jews.</p>
   <p>A story has been going the rounds of the Jewish press, that Hirsch of Chicago was fanatically opposed to the Russian Jews. I venture to call the whole Jewish community of Chicago to witness, whether anyone, among the Rabbi here, or elsewhere, has worked more faithfully and more tolerantly for the poor victims of Russian terror, than have I. From the first moment of their coming hither, until today, I believe I can honestly claim to have done for these people what lay in my power.</p>
