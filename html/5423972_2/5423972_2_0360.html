   <p>It is well known to all that many disruptions and troubles were caused between families and quarrels in small congregations by men who call themselves Rabbis, who for the sake of a few dollars will divorce a husband who is in America from a wife in Poland, which brings ruination and misfortune to helpless and innocent children. And these self styled Rabbis for the sake of a few dollars will give Cabola or authorize men to be Shochtim (orthodox buthers), who know nothing of Shchites (orthodox animal slaughter). And for the purpose of abrogating these shameful deeds, and save the name of Judaism from disgrace, we, the Polish Congregation Baith Hadresh Hagodoul and other of our brethren of Chicago,have brought Rabbi Lisse from Poland.....a man, who besides the salary that he receives does not want to take anything from parties, for whom he has to act in his Rabbinical capacity. If a man is capable and worthy to be a Schochet he gives him Cabola gratis and the same in case of Gittin. We have made a contract with him for three years.</p>
