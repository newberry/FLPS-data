   <p>The 1,500 junk peddlers who sold old iron and other things, have been locked out by the Junk Dealers Association, who refuse to purchase anything from the junk peddler, because he has organized himself into a union and demands better treatment.</p>
   <p>The junk peddlers, who are 100% organized in all sections of the city, had offered an agreement to the Dealers Association, demanding recognition of the union, and payment of the full market price for all junk.</p>
   <p>Also, a union representative should have the right to visit the junk shops; that the dealers must purchase their junk only from union junk peddlers; that cash must be paid for all purchases; and arbitration for all disputes. The Dealers responded with a lockout.</p>
