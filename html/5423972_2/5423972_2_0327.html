   <p>Plans are being formulated by the following organizations to conduct a united appeal: Congregation Anshe Knesses Israel, Mariampoler Congregation, Congregation Beth Hamedrosh Hagodol, Congregation Bnai Jacob, and Congregation Bnai Moshe. The purpose behind this unity movement is to gather funds with which Mazoth and other foodstuffs needed by the Jewish poor for Passover may be purchased. The number of Jewish needy in Chicago seems to be much greater; more funds will be needed to supply the demand for free Mazoth and wine for Passover. The decision [of these congregations to conduct a united appeal] assures us that the results will be better quantitatively and qualitatively. More and better goods will be bought for the poor. We hope that, when the other congregations will see the success of this united effort, they will follow the course of these few congregations.</p>
