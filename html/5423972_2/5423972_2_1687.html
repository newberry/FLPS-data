   <p>The Chicago Cloth Headwear Manufacturers Association, figured without their partner when they pasted notices in their cap factories stating that all work-would be piece work.</p>
   <p>At their union meeting at which were 500 members, the workers decided to raise a fund of $50,000 to carry on the fight with the bosses. A collection was made and soon cash and pledges to the total of $8,000 was raised. Twenty-three members gave $100 each, six gave $200 each, L. Matchin and L. Matten, $1,000 each, M. Chanin, gave $600 and M. Nagers gave $500.</p>
   <p>The union also decided that no strike benefits would be paid for the first six weeks of any strike so that the $50,000 fund would last longer.</p>
