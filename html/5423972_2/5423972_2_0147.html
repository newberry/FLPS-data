   <p>Editorial. Borrowing the New York "Kosher Law."</p>
   <p>The New York "Kosher Law" has been upheld by the Supreme Court of that state. This law, providing that all establishments advertising kosher food must confirm to Jewish dietary requirements and that all food so labeled must be prepared according to the Jewish ritual.</p>
   <p>Following the lead of the New York Jews, the Chicago Union of Orthodox Congregations is preparing to inaugurate a campaign to induce the Illinois legislature to pass a similar measure. This enterprise should receive support from Jewish organizations and individuals, whether orthodox or otherwise. It embraces to a certain extent the same considerations which led to and are embodied in the Federal "pure food" statutes - that the consumer shall be protected in his purchases, not only as to the quality and wholesomeness of a given commodity but also as to its identity.</p>
