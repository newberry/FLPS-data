   <p>This evening the second protest conference against pogroms on Jews in Poland will take place. To this conference are expected not only the delegates from all organizations, Socialists, Radicals, and Progressives, but also the delegates from all Jewish organizations which were not present at the first conference. The conference will take place in the West Side Auditorium. At this meeting, measures will be taken to fight the boycott and pogrom agitation organized by the Chicago Polish reactionaries and priests. The Chicago hooligans, yesterday achieved the heights of savagery and hooliganism. The savage Polish cartoonists are arousing the Chicago Poles to repeat in this city the pogroms of Lemberg, Lida, and Pinsk.</p>
   <p>In two Polish Newspapers yesterday, cartoons awaking the emotions of race hatred among the Polish masses, were published. One of the cartoons is in Smolski's paper, Dziennik Narodowy. It portrays two Jews crucifying Poland, with the title: Just as the Jews have crucified Christ, so they are crucifying Poland.</p>
