   <p>Poles of Chicago will today march in a demonstration which will also have an anti-Semitic character.</p>
   <p>The anti-Semitic propaganda in the Polish press, these last few weeks, set a large portion of the Polish population in Chicago in an attitude of incitement against Jews. There are grounds to fear that today's Polish demonstration may lead to terrorisms against Jews.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, advise the Jewish population in Chicago to keep at a distance from the demonstration, in order to prevent any possibility for probable provocations that might give the Poles any reason whatsoever for unpleasant incidents.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Insinuations of the demonstrators against Jews should be ignored.</p>
   <p>City authorities will take the necessary steps to keep order. A large police force will accompany the demonstrators.</p>
   <p>Retain your calmness and dignity.</p>
