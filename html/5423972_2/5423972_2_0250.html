   <p>It is said that in New York the streetcar conductors are now beginning to make inquiries as to the exact day on which the Jews hold a festival in the cemetery. They are eager to acquire this information beforehand because it will be a day of hard work for them. Crowds, loaded with bundles and small baskets containing all sorts of food and drinks, will swarm into the cars, and the car conductors will have their hands full. This "tradition" has gradually spread from New York to Chicago. This ugly festival can now be witnessed in the local cemeteries, and at the close of the day the cemetery has all semblances of a picnic ground.</p>
   <p>It is hard to conceive how this obnoxious tradition could have possibly developed among Jews. From time immemorial, the Jew has always paid homage to the memory of the dead. The fantasy of the Jews had always pictured the <span class="page-break">\2</span>spirit of their beloved ones resting under the wings of Providence, and departed parents supplicating for their children and close relatives, who are still earthly beings, but who will sooner or later come to them in heaven. But where have the American Jews found the aforementioned custom? Whence did they bring it and from whom did they learn it?</p>
   <p>To visit the graves of our beloved ones on Tishah b'ab (ninth day in Ab of the Hebrew Calendar, which is observed in commemoration of the destruction of Jerusalem) is an old custom, and a beautiful custom. And the Jews who mourn the Diaspora have always sought on the day of Tishah b'ab a place to shed tears of grief and sorrow, and to make their hearts feel lighter by giving voice to their affliction, and to unbosom their misery to the spirits of their beloved ones. The thought alone of throwing a party amid the graves--even when not on Tishah b'ab--is enough to fill a Jew's heart with grief. In America, Jews go to the graves of their beloved ones with a cheerful heart, just as if it were good fortune that their parents had died or because Jerusalem had been destroyed. They do not sense how ugly this appears in the eyes of the world, <span class="page-break">\3</span>let alone its affront to the Jewish past.</p>
   <p>At present, we lament a ten-fold, a hundred-fold destruction. It seems as though all the misfortunes of the world have been melted together and poured out on our people. We must bear this in mind, and when we visit the graves of our beloved ones this Tishah b'ab, let us not manifest any hard-hearted, cruel derision of our people.</p>
   <p>The Relief Committee for war sufferers has determined to make a collection in the cemetery for our hungry brothers in belligerent countries, in order to alleviate their plight as much as possible. The place (the cemetery) and time (Tishah b'ab) are appropriate for such an undertaking.</p>
   <p>American Jews who go to the cemetery, eat enough at home if you have no desire to fast on Tishah b'ab! Every unfortunate brother abroad has many, many fast days each month. Donate to them the cost of the food baskets which you are wont to take along to the cemetery!</p>
