   <p>There is a Russian saying, "As long as the thunder does not crash, the peasant does not cross himself" - indicating that the peasant possesses a sluggish nature. He displays little interest in what occurs around him, unless it happens to be of an unusual nature....</p>
   <p>It is far from our thoughts to compare the Jew with the peasant but the long Diaspora, the enslavement of the Jewish spirit, the hundreds of thousands of years of dispersion and readjustment to strange spheres, the influence of strange lands and environments, have carved similar scars of inertia and subjugation. It demands unusual and striking occurrences to awaken the Jews from their nation's dream.</p>

   <p>Quiet and peaceful ran the waters in the Jewish life-stream for many centuries, a green mould began to spread here and there, frogs swam around and dinned their shilling concerts...</p>
   <p>In vain did the Jewish leaders fume - their satirical arrows sank into the old mould, life went on as before. The young, the life-lusty and life-thirsty tore at the oppressive stillness, leaving the stagnant waters for the strange impetuous sea. It is here that they first displayed marvelous feats in swimming, in creating civilization theories and whole active movements.</p>
   <p>Their objectives were: excessive storms, bloody rains, hail of stones to break and pierce, to color the streets with blood and cover the rocks with brain matter, so that those in the Jewish Street might rub their eyes, cast their glances about, and stop to think of what is actually occurring around them.</p>

   <p>So it was in ancient times and so it still is today. When Jews were expelled from Italy they migrated to France, from France to Germany, Germany to Poland, forever wandering from one land to another, one country to another, without aim or purpose. They named it the Verdict from Heaven, without stopping to consider why the sky should be gruesome for them only, why its ire was directed only "on their heads?" We are not worse, nor more sinful, nor more criminal than the rest of mankind. Heaven cannot create any exceptional rules that only we alone need heed the play of all the angry storms and tempests. No one gave it a thought and comforted himself with the lofty thought that it was a Verdict from Heaven. Thus it was from one storm to the next, from one decree to the other.</p>
   <p>In more recent times a seeping consciousness of these conditions gave rise to the pursuit of an answer not in the ire of the Heavens, but, in the position held by Jews in this sinful world...It was noticed that all the persecutions <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>pointed to a definite earthly trait which played first fiddle in all our troubles and misfortunes. In every land Jews were tolerated only as long as the country had a need of them; as long as they fulfilled that specific demand in the life of that nation.</p>
   <p>Jews in every land have been mainly the merchant element. The native populace was divided into the nobility and the peasants. The former controlled government; the Jews were the middlemen between the state and the villages, between the country and other countries. They were a factor in developing the city and laid the foundation for trade and production. As the city developed the natives began to produce their own craftsmen and tradesmen. Here began the strife between the progressive native and the stranger, the tolerated Jews.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>On the grounds of this achievement rests the tragedy of a landless Jewish Folk. It is the key to all persecutions. The growing industrial national forces wish to expel the stranger. In ancient days they were simply driven out. Today in our polished civilization they are not driven, but measures are devised to make the life of the foreign undesirable Jew impossible so that he is forced to leave his position in this alien sphere and wander again, wherever his heart desires except within the borders of that land in which he resides and is unwanted.</p>
   <p>On such a basis has grown our modern anti-Semitic movement in every land where Jews compete with the native population in the fields of commerce, trade and liberal professions. We cannot, therefore, determine who are the foes of the Jews since they may be found in all classes of our modern civilization. The present civilization is so complicated that there are many more <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>points of conflict between Jew and non-Jew. Another difference between former years and the present is that all countries have now adjusted their economic forms so that there is no land that has the need to invite driven Jews. Each country instead, wishes to rid itself of those already within her boundaries.</p>
   <p>At present there is no difference between nations in their attitude toward the Jew, the main dissimilarity being in the form of opposition, relying on the cultural standards, and political status of the country that places and categories the trade of the people. Although the methods are different the object is the same. Hilzner, Dreyfuss and Bailis represent varied forms of one and the same motive, the desire to expel Jews from the social sphere, deprive them of their positions, and narrow their lives.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>The Bailis trial, just as the Dreyfuss trial in its time, aroused the stagnant waters of the Jewish life stream, so covered with mould since the storms of past years. Jews grew calm after the end of the bloody pogroms. Again they dreamed under the influence of the frog concert that arose from their stagnant community stream. But, this performance came to an end, the curtain fell, the church bells resounded the prayer for the "martyr" Euchinsky; but the actors of the Russian government and their friends of the criminal Tchebreiakoff gang will again turn to their undercover criminalities, the entire turmoil will be stilled, and the Jews will relapse into their lethargy.</p>
   <p>But this must not happen. Awakened Jewish consciousness must not sleep again. The drama has left the stage and life continues in the path of the opposition forces. Similar dramas may again be set up on the stage. Jewish energies must be directed not only against individual racial accusations, <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>but likewise against the undermining of the Jewish folk, the cause of Jewish life being splintered and scattered among other nations. As long as the splinters are kept from uniting there will continue, from time to time, to be Hilzner, Dreyfuss and Bailis trials.</p>
