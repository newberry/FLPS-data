   <p>A nine dollar a week raise is the record made by the cutters in their campaign of the Amalgamated for better conditions for all the workers in the tailoring industry.</p>
   <p>Each of the fifty cutters of the Chicago Tailors Association received a raise of $9.00 a week. It is no wonder that the cutters are constantly joining the Amalgamated. The cutters of the Continental Tailoring Co., Brodie &amp; Dogenski, and Fox Brothers are joining in a group as the same time as the tailors. Comrade Frank Rosenblum explained to a Forward representative that this is an epoch making event in the existence of the tailor's organization.</p>
   <p>It exceeded all the expectations of the most optimistic in the Amalgamated.</p>
