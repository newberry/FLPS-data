   <p>We never think of criticizing individuals or private groups for participating in a banquet at the La Salle Hotel although we know that the food is not kosher. Each person may live as he sees fit, and if one likes pig's feet better than gefilte fish, may God help him!</p>
   <p>Yet we resent the fact that we received an invitation to a "bachelor dinner" to be given tomorrow evening at the La Salle Hotel in honor of Mr. Arthur Horwich, the son of Mr. B. Horwich.</p>
   <p>We forgive the sponsors for the vulgar invitation. The committee is composed of individuals who are well-qualified to be vulgar. But the idea of giving a nonkosher dinner in honor of a grandson of Rabbi Anixter and the son of the president of the Jewish Federation of Orthodox Charities must be resented by every Jew. We recall that Mr. B. Horwich, at a public banquet held recently, <span class="page-break">2</span>urged Chicago Jewry to organize themselves to combat the evil of eating nonkosher food which exists in Jewish life.</p>
   <p>It is deplorable. Our only salvation is that Mr. Arthur Horwich, for whom the banquet is being prepared, is not involved in this affair. And our only hope is that he will not thank the sponsors. Mr. B. Horwich will certainly not tolerate this.</p>
