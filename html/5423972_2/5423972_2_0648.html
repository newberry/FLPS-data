   <p>A great many of our people are growing more pessimistic from day to day. They think that the end of Judaism is come. They point out that never in the history of our people was Jewish blood shed so much as in the last four or five years. They assert that the war and its aftermath has practically ruined Eastern European Jewry, reducing it to beggary and physically to a skeleton and there is not much hope for our people to survive this crisis. Our people in the Western countries, they say, is doomed because of the strong currents of life surrounding them. Sooner or later they must fall victims to assimilation and perish as Jews. With Eastern European Jewry ruined both physically and economically, and with Western European Jewry ruined, our people will disappear from among the nations of the earth, and all the attempts made to prolong its existence will be of no avail.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Those who argue that way believe themselves to be realists, but are not so. A few isolated facts, no matter how impressive, do not represent the sum total of the reality of life, and the facts enumerated by our skeptics, by our pessimists do not constitute the whole Jewish reality either. It is true that our people in the East are ruined economically, physically and morally and it is also true that assimilation in the countries of the West is making rapid strides. Even the baptism movement among the Jews in the West has not disappeared as yet. Reports from Vienna, Budapest and other parts of Eastern Europe go to indicate that hundreds of Jews are embracing Christianity every month, and that sometimes brainy and able Jews desert their people. Jewish travelers in Eastern European countries are mostly impressed by the fact of the demoralization of the Jewish youth there. The Jewish youth in Poland and in Lithuania, in White Russia and Galicia is aping the Gentile radicals, is playing with radicalism, is God-forsaken. It has lost all sense of proportion with regard to matters Jewish and is often a destructive force. In the Ukrainia, Judaism has ceased to be altogether. Out of two million Jews living there in 1918, half a million was killed or wounded or crippled, another <span class="page-break">\3</span>half million fled to neighboring countries to escape massacres and the rest are wandering from village to village and from city to city looking for bread. They are only waiting for the moment when they will be able to cross the Ukrainian border. They are determined not to stay in Ukrainia. For all practical intents and purposes, Ukrainian Jewry has ceased to be. It is decimated and reduced to one-fifth of its original status. White Russian Jewry is crushed, Galician Jewry is totally ruined and so is Hungarian Jewry, while the Jews in Poland are in constant fear of their lives because of impending pogroms. These hard facts may make every Jew a pessimist and may fill his heart with despair but still in spite of hell and tornado there is no cause for pessimism, for the simple reason that the Jewish point of gravity is not east, not the Old World at all, but west--America; and the Jewish settlement in America is sane and strong and solid.</p>
   <p>If it is true as our pessimists assert that at no time was Jewish blood shed so much and that no time in the world's history was the majority of the Jewish <span class="page-break">\4</span>people so badly situated as it is now from every point of view, it is also true that at no time in the history of the Jewish people with the exception of a century or two in Spain prior to the rise of the Inquisition has a Jewish group numbering millions enjoyed so much happiness as do the American Jews today. In Spain, the center of Judaism in the Middle Ages, there were at the very best four hundred thousand Jews, but in America the greatest Jewish center and the most powerful Jewish center that the world has ever seen, there are four million Jews and though not all the four million are ideal Jews, there is no baptism movement in America among Jews and there is no artificial assimilation movement and there are many other evils from which the Jews in Western Europe are suffering and from which the Jews in America are free. This strong Jewish center--America is not threatened by anybody and is not imperiled. America is a country of the brave and the free, and phenomena like Fordism notwithstanding. America will never adopt the policies and methods of European governments and peoples toward religious minorities, for America is the only great country, where there are no anti-Semitic traditions. Born out of the <span class="page-break">\5</span>spirit of freedom as it found its expression in the Declaration of Independence, America cannot be barbarized and America cannot become an anti-Semitic country, because the very basis of Americanism is freedom. For America to alienate itself from this spirit would be for it to commit suicide and we need not be afraid that a strong and healthy American people will commit suicide. For this reason there is no room for pessimism as far as the future of the American Jew is concerned. Anti-Semitic outbreaks may occur here and there. These outbreaks are in the main artificial and are not indicative of a change of mind of the American people. The greatest Jewish center in the world's history--American Jewry--is thus safe. It faces no menace at present and will not face any in the future, either, and this strong Jewish center established in the course of the last fifty years will bring about the rebirth of the Jewish nation, will heal the wounds of the war and the pogroms from which European Jews are suffering and will in the course of time bring about a reconsolidation not only of Central European Jewry but of the Eastern European Jewry as well. The American Jews have spent some fifty million dollars to save the war and pogrom-stricken Jewries from annihilation and will spend <span class="page-break">\6</span>fifty or one hundred million dollars more to rebuild the Jewish settlements in the East. It is true that the Jewish map in Eastern Europe is undergoing radical changes and will undergo changes in the future, too. The process of attrition in the East will continue for a long time, but in the end, these forces will come to a standstill. Pogromism in Poland and Bolshevism in Russia will not be supreme forever. Bolshevism is not a political nor an economical order of things but a madness, and while an individual may lose his mind forever, a nation like Russia, numbering one hundred and fifty millions will not be mad forever. It will regain its reason one day. When this day will come Bolshevism will be overthrown and a normal state of affairs will take its place. Then those Jews still left in Russia will breathe freely. They may not be the happiest Jewish group but they will at least be in a position to struggle along and work for their salvation as best they can.</p>
   <p>The future of Poland cannot be foreseen. It may and may not be safe, but the probability is that Poland as an empire will disappear, and the present greater <span class="page-break">\7</span>Poland will be smashed to pieces, and that only a little Poland forming a buffer state between Russia and Germany will remain, but no matter what happens to Poland, the spirit of pogromism still prevailing there cannot perpetuate itself because it does more harm to Poland than to the Jews. One day, the intoxicated Polish masses will awaken to a consciousness of the ugly reality of a feudal reactionary and anti-Semitic Poland. It will recognize the impossibility of such an order of things and will replace it by another. Even then the position of the Jews of Poland may not be an enviable one, but the Jews may be in a position strong enough to struggle along and work out their salvation as best they can. What hold [s] good of the possibilities and probabilities in Russia and Poland, also holds good for the possibilities in the other pogrom-stricken countries of Europe. If Bolshevism is a disease, pogromism is a pest and pests are only temporary. They disappear one day for no apparent reason, and one day the pest of pogromism will disappear from Poland, too. It is true that while this pest is raging, it demands many victims and it is surely tragic beyond words to see how it spreads havoc to the <span class="page-break">\8</span>Jews wherever it puts in an appearance. However, we have to take consolation in the fact of their strength and with all the power at their disposal and this in itself indicates that the Jews in Poland are not in despair, but are moreover convinced that their situation will undergo a change for the better one day.</p>
   <p>For these and many other reasons, we assume that there is still a ray of hope for it is not a new plague and as a plague it is only temporary. The Jews in Poland are combating and counteracting with all Eastern European Jewry though we admit it will never regain its pre-war strength because the forces of attribution have made too rapid strides and because the war has divided Russian Jewry into various groups separated from one another by political and economic barriers. It is sure that the Slavonic countries will never again harbor the greatest Jewish center, but it is equally sure that the division of Russian Jewry into many groups notwithstanding their present tragic sufferings, they will survive the crisis, because they have the support and sympathy of the <span class="page-break">\9</span>American Jews who are today the strongest group in the world, both economically and morally. The pessimists are wrong in assuming that the days of Jewry are numbered. We have survived more severe crises and we will survive this crisis, too.</p>
