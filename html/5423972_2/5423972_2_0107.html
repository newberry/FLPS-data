   <p>There is something to be said about the Confirmation services this year that could not be said before. Having in mind the conditions that prevailed in the Jewish community during past years, under which the Confirmation services stretched for a period of weeks, in accordance with the plans and wishes of the individual congregations and rabbis, the Chicago Rabbinical Association, after long discussion, came to a unanimous understanding about the time of services and we shall have this year a practice approaching uniformity.</p>
   <p>Reform congregations having their confirmation services on a Sunday will celebrate the Confirmation ceremony on May 24, that is, for this year. For the next years, the Rabbinical Association will set the date at the beginning of each year.</p>
