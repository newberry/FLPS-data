   <p>The workers of the great garment firm of Hart, Schaffner and Marx really had a fine holiday yesterday. Their celebration of the first of May was doubled by the announcement that all workers will receive a substantial raise in wages.</p>
   <p>Mr. Malenbach, chairman of the Trade Board (sic) of Hart, Schaffner and Marx, who was present at the May first celebration at Guyon's Hall, announced the good news about the wage increase, which the firm voluntarily decided to give to all workers employed in its clothing factories.</p>
   <p>All cutters, trimmers and other weekly workers will receive a raise of three dollars a week. Piece workers, making less than $20 a week will be raised fifteen percent, and piece workers, who make more than $20 a week will be given a raise of ten percent.</p>
   
   <p>The announcement of this increase in wages, which is the third received by the workers, since the signing of the last agreement in 1916, was welcomed with great enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>"When the agreement in 1916 was signed, we received a raise of ten percent in wages," said Mr. Sam Levin, chairman of the Joint Board of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union of America, yesterday. "The working hours, according to the agreement made for a period of three years, are forty-nine hours a week.</p>
   <p>"During that time, the firm has taken one hour from the working week. That means that the firm, upon its own initiative, has established a forty-eight instead of a forty-nine hour week and has given a second raise of ten percent."</p>
   <p>"The present raise is larger than all previous ones, and equally as voluntary. For this reason the announcement was greeted with unfeigned enthusiasm by the thousands of workers of Hart, Schaffner and Marx who stand united under the banner of the Amalgamated."</p>
   
   <p>The income from the raise for the first week, amounting to fifteen thousand dollars, will be given by the workers to the Amalgamated Union to enable the latter to begin an extensive campaign to organize the nonunion tailor shops in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The mass meeting adopted a resolution of grief at the death of Joseph Schaffner, who was one of the founders of the great tailoring firm, and one of the most liberal and big-hearted employers in America.</p>
   <p>The main speaker at the May Day celebration was Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union of America.</p>
