   <p>Governor Cox received a Jewish delegation yesterday at the Congress Hotel. The delegation, headed by Congressman [Adolph] Sabath, was composed of Judges [Harry M.] Fischer and [Joseph] David, Mr. M. P. Ginsburg, publisher of the Courier, and Dr. S. M. Melamed, its editor. Judge Fischer was the spokesman for the delegation. After describing the terrible condition of the Jews in Poland and the Ukraine, he, in the name of the delegation, asked the presidential candidate whether he had anything to say about the problem and whether he intended to do anything for the unfortunate Jews of Eastern Europe.</p>
   <p>The Governor listened to the words of Judge Fischer very seriously, and answered his questions thus: "Gentlemen, I am aware of the seriousness of the situation and I can assure you that if I am elected president, my first task will be to take up the Irish and the Jewish questions. Under no circumstances can the situation be permitted to remain as it is now. I can assure you that I <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>wholeheartedly agree with the policy of extending minority rights to national and religious minorities in Eastern and Central Europe, as envisaged and established in the Treaty of Versailles. You may use this statement to explain my position on the Jewish question in Europe."</p>
   <p>The explanation of Governor Cox was spontaneous; it was spoken in a tone of great sincerity and made a deep impression upon the delegation.</p>
