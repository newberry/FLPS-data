   <p>A report was given at the last meeting of the Shohatim Union that all the rabbis of Chicago, including Rabbi Yehudah Leb Gordon, are protesting against Benjamin Rubin for not having his Kabalah [a document given by a rabbi to an individual who is permitted to be a shohet]. Mr. Rubin is employed at the butcher shop of Becker and Polina. According to the Hebraic dietary laws it is illegal for him to slaughter any fowl.</p>
   <p>Rabbis Ezriel Epstein, Ephraim Epstein, Samuel Shack, A. L. Kaplan, Abraham I. Gordon, Harry Ollschwang, and Yehudah Leb Gordon warn those who buy chickens where Mr. Rubin is employed that they are not kosher and should not be consumed for domestic use.</p>
