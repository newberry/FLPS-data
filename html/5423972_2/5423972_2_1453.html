   <p>During last Sunday's preliminary meeting at the Palmer House, Convention Hall, our leading Isrealites freely exchanged opinions how best to solve an imminent question, to wit; the dimicility of the thousands of the persecuted Russian refugees now arriving in this Country?</p>
   <p>It is quite certain that in order to maintain our own hard-fought for status as progression Isrealites, our high credit for intelligence and morality would indeed be seriously impaired were the persecuted refugees allowed to shift for themselves in this broad land. The Isrealites in America owe it to themselves to devise and strive for the plan presented by the Alliance Israelite Universelle to institute a Colonial Bureau with ample means to locate all the available men from persecuting Europe to till the soil and thereby become producers, which is at once the most enobling occupation we can select for them.....Such a plan will certainly redound to the credit of our Jewish population of properly organized and judiciously managed. On the other hand, if nothing is done to provide means or facilities to place the thousands now flocking to our shores, they will only become a source of charity and pity and will at no remote day reflect disgrace and shame upon American Judaism.</p>

   <p>These people with but a few exceptions are still bound by blind religious ideas and customs. And are far behind in modern knowledge. They come here deprived of all means; they lack everything...Knowledge of our language; our laws and business habits. They will naturally resent to traffic barter and peddling; a thing which in this present century should be curtailed if we desire to escape the common edict which non-Jews apply to such as are found to carry a puck. Indeed it would not be long before an anti-Semitism may be invoked that might prove as diabolical as that of Germany. The Israelites hope this Country can illy afford or stand idle in this vital matter.</p>
