   <p>The Amalgamated Union Refuses to Recognize Company Unions.</p>
   <p>The Amalgamated strikers of Alfred Decker and Cohen held a meeting in which the firms proposed plan was discussed and was unanimously rejected. The strike should not be called off until the Amalgamated Union was fully recognized. The original plan of Alfred Decker and Cohen is as follows: 1. The election of a permanent shop committee with the authority to transact business with the employers. 2. Rules for discharge of employees are to be worked out. 3. Positions of foremen and superintendents are to be filled from the ranks of the shop employees and not outsiders. 4. Employees will participate in the profits of the firm after a certain time. 5. Sick benefits. 6. Life Insurance. 7. A pension until a certain age. 8. Workers will elect a committee to which the firm will send its delegates. 9. Ballot boxes will be supplied by the firm.</p>
   <p>The above plan at first sight does not seem bad, but on second thought shows itself to be a scheme for the formation of an open shop union.</p>
