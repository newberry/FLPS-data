   <p>The meeting was called for 2 P. M., but the crowd began to gather at eleven in the morning. The street cars and elevators were packed with thousands of people who were anxious to secure a seat for this historical occasion to which Chicago has added a well written chapter in the history of the fight for human justice and rights.</p>

   <p>About 12 o'clock noon, it was seen that the Grand Opera House was much too small to house even a small percentage of the large audience that responded so enthusiastically to the call of the committee sponsoring this meeting. The Garrick Theater was then pressed into use, but within half an hour this large theater was also filled. The thousands who were unable to gain admittance surrounded both theaters and stood patiently listening to the various speakers who expressed their opinions of Russia and her justice.</p>
   <p>The meeting at the Grand Opera House opened punctually at 2 o'clock. Judge Edward A. Brown of the Appellate Court was the chairman. He explained the purpose of the meeting and announced as the first speaker Miss Jane Addams of the Hull House. Other speakers were:</p>
