   <p>Bakery Owners declare Guerilla War against their Workers.</p>
   <p>The Union opens a five thousand dollar fund, and more if necessary to back the war against the owners who seek to destroy the organization.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Baker bosses were afraid to declare a lock-out, to force the workers to accept a reduction in salaries. On the contrary, they carry on a quiet and insidious guerilla warfare. They think that by this method they will break the solidarity of the membership and destroy the structure of the Union.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Local 237, has seriously considered this condition and determined to fight those bosses with all mediums existing in the Union and the Jewish Labor movement. The first thing the Union decided to do is to appropiate five thousand dollars to fight the bosses, who want to undermine the Union.</p>
   <p>The members have unanimously accepted this plan. A special committee was appointed to carry on the work of the Union. They are as follows: V. Krash, B. Satz, Sam Mosler, Jake Yunkovsky, David Rothstein, Jake Fineblatt, Joe Weissbaum, L. Rubenstein, Max Nash, Max Oshbaum and Hyman Schlossberg. This committee will act as board of directors to manage the fund in the interest of the Union.</p>
