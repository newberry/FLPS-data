   <p>Cincinnati, Ohio, May 25.-- The Mizrachi convention was called to order at eleven o'clock this morning by Tzivia Hirsh Manishevitz, chairman of the arrangement committee. Over three hundred delegates and hundreds of guests filled the music hall where it was held.</p>
   <p>The grey-haired venerable Rabbi Jacob Gershun Leser opened the convention with a prayer and greeted the delegates in the name of the Orthodox Jewery of Cincinnati. Mayor Galwin welcomed all in his cordial address, in which he stated that, as an Irishman, he could feel the sorrows of the Jewish people and sympathise greatly with their national strivings.</p>
   
   <p>When Rabbi Berlin was to speak, the entire assembly rose to their feet and cheered him heartily for several minutes. He began with a panegyric for the murdered Jews in Poland and for the eminent Hyman Soloveitchic and Meyer Simchah. "With the death of these two distinguished men," the Mizrachi leader remarked, "Judaism lost great guiding lights who were only thoroughly understood by the Mizrachis."</p>
   <p>He reviewed Jewish life during the past year, a year full of sufferings, sorrows, and need for our sisters and brothers across the sea.</p>
   <p>"There are nations," he said, "that want to build their happiness and freedom upon the graves and ruins of others, but we Jews can build only on the fundamental principles of justice. We Jews do not plant our trees on graves. We are not permitted to eat such fruit. We hear cries from various sides. We must protest. To whom? Who will hear our protests? There is only one way to help,-to be organized, to have unity among us, and to rebuild Palestine together.</p>
   <p>"True, we come today to our convention with little hopes. True, only part of our hopes have been realized. But it is also true that the path to our Homeland is more broadly opened to us. We must secure the entrance doors to Palestine, then can we fix the "mizuzoth" (prayer talisman) on them."</p>
   <p>Rabbi Berlin then indicated that the Mizrachi is recognized by such men as Balfour and other prominent statesmen; therefore, the Mizrachi, aside from the fact that it is a spiritual factor in Zionizm, plays a great and important political role. It is a part of the World Zionist Organization, but was never a part of the American Zionist Organization. In America, it is an organization of its own. The work of Mizrachi is now acknowledged everywhere, and at the Zionist conference in Palestine its ideas had to be reckoned with, so much so that the conference found it necessary to appoint a special committee on education for Palestine."</p>
   <p>In speaking of the Mizrachi's Palestinian Fund, the speaker pointed out: "From a spiritual and political standpoint, it is our duty to concentrate our actions and build a permanent center in Jerusalem, as well as to see to it that a large part of the Palestinian Fund be designated for this purpose." Rabbi Berlin then made an appeal to increase the Mizrachi Palestinian Fund, which at present amounts to seventy thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Berlin advised the convention to see that more and more land be bought in Palestine, which is to be settled by Jews, and also that aid be given to the Mizrachi Teachers' Institute.</p>
