   <p>Jewish Butcher Employers refuse to negotiate with the Union.</p>
   <p>The Butchers Union Local 589 have stated their new demands to the butcher employers:</p>
   <p>(1) Recognition of the Union</p>
   <p>(2) A raise of $10.00 per week</p>
   <p>(3) 54 hrs labor per week</p>
   <p>(4) One weeks vacation to the worker who has been employed for the entire year.</p>
   <p>(5) Holidays on July 4th and Labor Day.</p>
   <p>(6) Compensation in case of accident in course of labor.</p>
   <p>(7) No employee shall be fired without reasonable cause.</p>
   <p>(8) Every employer must display a union card in his window</p>
   <p>At a conference which was held between Union representatives and representatives of the association, it was noticed that certain butchers, who employ no labor, have taken it upon themselves to destroy the union and with this attitude they forced the union representatives to quit the conference.</p>
