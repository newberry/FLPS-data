   <p>Rabbi Louis Mann of Chicago Sinai Congregation, in addressing a group of clergy in Chicago, appealed for friendship between Jews and Christians. He showed that for nineteen hundred years the Christians have hated the Jews because of the false assertion that they killed Jesus.</p>
   <p>"Children are taught in all Christian schools to hate the Jews, the 'God Killers,'" said Rabbi Mann. "This, however, is false. The Jews did not kill Jesus; the Romans killed Him. It is a fact that Jesus fought for the Jews in their struggles. The Jews of that time were not endowed with the power to convict anyone to death. They did not have the right, speaking in general terms, to pass sentence on anyone. And yet, our race is condemned and cursed on account of this falsehood in all parts of the world."</p>
   <p>The rabbi then appealed to the Christians that they should help undermine this superstition and create a friendly relationship between Jews and Christians.</p>
