   <p>As a people in Diaspora, the entire life of the Jews in a struggle against the current. A battle for life against life.</p>
   <p>A Jew can carry on the largest business and yet not manifest in it his Judaism. Except those who commercialize it, Judaism yields no profit to anyone, and whoever wishes to lead on foreign soil a nationalistic or religious life, must exert himself strenuously because anything connected with Judaism is against the general current of Christian life. And it is hard to swim against the current.</p>
   <p>Every Jew how keeps up a Jewish home and who gives his child a Jewish education, is to a certain degree a champion. From such a person the race has a right to demand all he has to offer. A Jew who sends his child to Hebrew school is not justified in proffering excuses for not teaching his child to read or write Yiddish, so that he may be better bound to Jewish life. Nothing will tie the child more to the life of the Jewish people of the entire world than the possession of a language, literature, and newspaper in common.</p>
   <p>It is also wrong on the part of such a Jew to deny his child an education in Hebrew: for such attitude he can offer no excuses. An education in Hebrew will enable the child to understand, at least, the Bible in the language in which it was written, so that he may come to some understanding with his distant brethren who have a wider knowledge of Hebrew than Yiddish.</p>
   
   <p>It is tough to swim against the current, and in the current of the rich Anglo-American life it is rather difficult to arouse the Jewish child's interests in Jewish studies. But generally speaking, the Jew who doesn't exert any effort to implant some Judaism in his child, - enough to give him strength to grip firmly the heritage of his ancestors, so as to resist the current of non-Jewish life for which the whole of Judaism is worthless, that Jew is a weakling or a coward. He drops from his hand the blood - drenched Jewish flag, for which Jews have at all times sacrificed themselves, and he surrenders his weapons to the enemy without retaliation.</p>
   <p>After all, why don't we swim against the current in flocks instead of individually? Even the tiny, insignificant grains of sand defy the power of the ocean when they stick together. Let the Orthodox Jews support the Talmud Torah's (Hebrew Schools) and Sabbath schools, and the radical Jews support their schools. Then the weakest individual Jew will be strong enough to fight the battle of the ages, the battle which will ultimately be crowned with success.</p>
