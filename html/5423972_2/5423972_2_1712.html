   <p>The Strike at Berry and Benson.</p>
   <p>The pants makers of Berry and Benson, 12th st. near Halsted, have been on strike for the last few months. They are members of the Amalgamated local 144, and are determined not to give up because their demands are reasonable. The pants makers, who have been organized since the last general strike, have proved to be loyal to the Amalgamated, and a few months ago, they prepared their new program, which contained their new demands and distributed them to all the basses.</p>
   <p>The firm of Berry and Benson, through their stubborn action prolonged the strike. Last week they asked for a conference to settle the dispute. The officials of local 144, met with this firm, and they offered a 4 1/2 per cent raise in pay. The striking pants makers rejected this philanthropic offer, with anger, and agreed to proceed with the strike until they will be the victors.</p>
