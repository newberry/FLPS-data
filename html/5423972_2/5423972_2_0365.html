   <p>Our orthodox Jewish brethren might, if they choose, take a gentle hint that the keeping of more than one day of Rosh Ha 'Shono, or more than seven days of Succoth, or Pesach,are all that is implied or required by the strictest interpretation of the Jewish tenets.</p>
   <p>Modern Judaism has long since discarded the second or eighth day in these festivals. There are many good reasons why these superfluous apendages to the laws and rituals should be abrogated in this present enlightened age.....If, therefore, ancient Judaism has left us this burden-some relic of taking up half the year in feast and fast days, it can no longer be obligatory upon us to maintain such, as every head of a family is more or less dependent upon the labor or business vocations in which they are engaged.</p>
   <p>Modern Judaism isprone to forego even the Sabbath day, for the same reason, if that could be changed to Sunday. It need not necessarily imply a yielding from the divine or sacred institution of our Jewish Sabbath, to the nation of Chukas ha' Goyim (christian ritual) far from it.</p>
