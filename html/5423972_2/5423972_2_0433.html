   <p>"Is the Assimilation of the Jew Desirable?" will be the subject of debate between Rabbi Solomon Goldman of Cleveland and Professor Edward Sapir of the University of Chicago, at Sinai Temple, 4600 Grand Boulevard, on Monday evening, January 16, at 8:15 o'clock.</p>
   <p>Both men are unusually equipped to treat of the subject which has been of more than academic interest to both Jew and non-Jew alike. Professor Sapir is noted as one of the foremost anthropoligists in the country, a man who has made profound research in the study of race problems. He is regarded as an expert in the fields of ethmology and anthropology.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Goldman, who is affiliated with the conservative wing of American Judaism, and one of the younger men in the American Jewish pulpit has made a mark for himself. He is a keen and brilliant scholar. Both men will offer a splendid evening's intellectual program.</p>
