   <p>The tragedy of Leo M. Frank is closed. It is the tragedy of a Jew, who had the misfortune to live among a blood-thirsty mob and be the object of their suspicion and revenge.</p>
   <p>His friends and acquaintances thought him innocent. His enemies and the enemies of his race were unable to prove his guilt. The judge, who tried him, a judge of the lynch state of Georgia was doubtful as to his guilt. In the highest court of the land its two outstanding judges considered Leo M. Frank an innocent sufferer.</p>

   <p>The justice of Georgia did not want to deny itself the murder of its victim. And when a brave governor extended the favor to Leo M. Frank in commuting his death sentence to life imprisonment a flare of revenge swept through the civilized state of Georgia, which is a part of the free republic of the United States and the life of the governor itself was in danger.</p>
   <p>The mob of Georgia was thirsty after Jewish blood. A former candidate for president of the United States has openly agitated combat against the entire Jewish race. Jews in Georgia were boycotted and Jewish life became as cheap as in Rumania and Morocco.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The proud sons of the gentlemanly Georgia chose a professional murderer, as their representative to kill the Jewish martyr in his sleep, when he would be unable to resist the attack, or call for help.</p>
   <p>This was a crime even for a state like Georgia. The experienced hand of the murderer shook, and the sharp butcher knife failed to fulfill its mission.</p>
   <p>The "conscience" of the state of Georgia could not calm itself; a person, whom its inhabitants hate and whom they wish to lynch lives and dares to hope for deliverance.</p>
   <p>Having exhausted their patience, they organized and armed themselves, not for the purpose of defending their nation and country from a foreign foe, but to attack their own free institutions and to cover their state and country with such ridicule and shame, as can not be washed away by generations to come.</p>

   <p>Their desire was to lynch the Jew, Leo M. Frank, but with him they lynched American liberty and killed the beautiful hopes of humanity in the land of Washington and Jefferson.</p>
   <p>"Poor, great martyr," calls the old martyr race to the new victim. "You are not the first one, nor unfortunately will you be the last son of your people, who is being murdered for sins committed by others. In Russia, Rumania and Galicia, your brethren are being killed now by the hundreds and thousands. This is the fate of your homeless people for thousands of years past. By murdering you they meant to strike at the very heart of your people."</p>

   <p>Leo M. Frank was not lynched, as an American, nor as a citizen of the United States, who was suspected in a crime. Frank was first sentenced to death and then murdered by his fellow citizens, because he was a Jew, and the life of a Jew is worth much less, than any one's else even in this free country.</p>
   <p>The murder of Leo M. Frank is a warning to Jews in America, not to be influenced by false prophets, who think, that Americanism will cure the Jew of all of his troubles.</p>
   <p>The Jew is not being liked as a Jew, regardless of whether he is an immigrant, or native born, a nationalist or a believer in assimilation, orthodox or reformed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>It is possible, that a time will come in the distant future, when people will learn to love and respect each other, though belonging to different races. But in the meantime the Jew is not liked. And when such an opportunity presents itself, as it did in Georgia, where the yellow press and yellow politicians have the last word against the Jew, then their inborn hatred toward the Jew awakens, and the result could end as tragically as that of the young Jewish martyr, Leo M. Frank.</p>
   <p>Of course such conditions, as in Georgia do not exist in every state of our republic; nevertheless it is best to bear in mind that one must not depend too much upon the sentiments of American liberty, or American justice, but seek strength in our own selves, individually and collectively.</p>
