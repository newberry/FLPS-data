   <p>A man named Walter Hurt, of Chicago, is now busily engaged in explaining the Jewish problems from a Gentile point of view. He is publishing a series of articles in the Jewish weeklies in which he deals with all types of Jewish problems. He touches upon every phase of interest to the Jew from a religious, social, and political point of view. On the whole he does his best to defend Judaism and to show that it is a great religion. Mr. Hurt is, of course, not the first to come to our defense. Since the Jewish question first became evident, representatives of Christianity have come to our defense. Unfortunately, the resistance was always accompanied by ill luck and poor success, mainly because knowledge of Judaism was limited, or they knew nothing about it. We are sorry to say that Mr. <span class="page-break">\2</span>Walter Hurt, though prompted by the best intentions, belongs to the class of defenders of Judaism that would like to defend it but do not know how.</p>
   <p>In one of his articles, Mr. Hurt takes up the question of Christianity and Judaism, and makes the following illuminating statement:</p>
   <p>"Judaism is purely a religious institution, although it embraces many things not strictly spiritual, but which tend to conserve the welfare of the Jewish people. Christianity by contrast is more political than religious, and more economical than either. The different denominations are all engaged in political war against one another, but every object of strife is overshadowed by the economic consideration. The church is thoroughly commercialized."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>We need not tell our readers that the truth about Christianity and Judaism is just the opposite of what Mr. Hurt says. Judaism is also a religion, but in the main it is a system of civilization and culture. It has its own code of ethics and morals, and, of course, its own philosophy. Judaism has rightly been described as a portable state. As we have said, it is a religion, but it is also much more than that. It regulates the relationship between individuals ethically, morally, legally, and is thus practically a system of civilization.</p>
   <p>Christianity, on the other hand, has nothing to do with politics, civilization, or jurisprudence. It is merely a religion. It is a matter of the church and the priesthood. Christianity being a religion can only make peace with all the powers, with despotism and communism, with autocracy and <span class="page-break">\4</span>democracy. Judaism cannot do that, because it is connected to certain doctrines and committed to certain principles of civilization. Judaism can never make peace with despotism and autocracy, and can never make concessions to any power, because Judaism, in the final analysis, is a monarchy; that is, a system of laws and thus to a great extent legalistic in nature. Christianity, however, has nothing to do with legalism because it is not legalistic. It has no laws; it is not based on laws, but on certain myths, emotions, and sentiments. But still Mr. Hurt, who knows very little about theology, has the audacity to maintain "that Judaism is a purely religious institution and that Christianity by contrast is more political than religious."</p>
   <p>Here is another illuminating example of Mr. Hurt's wisdom. "While on the <span class="page-break">\5</span>subject of Jewish religion, I cannot refrain from paying tribute to the high character and abilities of American rabbis. With their learning, eloquence, earnestness, power of leadership, general culture, and fine personal qualities, they constitute the most admirable intellectual body in the world. Their superiority in respect to the Christian clergy is much greater, as is the difference between the respective religions. Contrast the magisterial mentality of a Hirsch, or a Wise, or a Harrison, with the mediocre minds of such grotesque clowns as Sam Jones, or Billy Sunday, or Gypsy Smith."</p>
   <p>We would like to know since when have Sam Jones, Billy Sunday, or Gypsy Smith become examples of American Christianity, and since when have Hirsch, Wise, and Harrison become examples of the American Rabbinate. These three gentlemen are very fine orators, sermonizers, or preachers, if that is what you want to call them, but they are not <span class="page-break">\6</span>rabbis, because religiously they are not even Jews. What is called Reform Judaism may be reform, but it is not Judaism, and the representatives of this sort of Reform Judaism have as much, or as little, to do with the Jewish religion as Gypsy Smith and Billy Sunday have to do with the Christian religion.</p>
   <p>This is another illustration of the wisdom of this defender of Judaism. "It is true that the two branches of Judaism differ in forms, but agree in fundamentals."</p>
   <p>This is a false statement from beginning to end. They disagree not only in forms, but also in the fundamental principals of Judaism. Reform Judaism has not only done away with nearly all the Jewish rites, but also with all the fundamental principles underlying Judaism, the first and <span class="page-break">\7</span>most important of which is the divine revelation of the Torah.</p>
   <p>We could go on quoting Mr. Hurt, and show that each and everyone of his statements is not based on facts; that he displays a maximum of good intentions and a minimum of philosophical and theological intelligence, and knowledge, but still the American Jewish press swallows his wisdom, because he is a Gentile. This fact in itself does not testify to the intelligence of the editors of the Jewish press in America, nor to their Jewish pride.</p>
