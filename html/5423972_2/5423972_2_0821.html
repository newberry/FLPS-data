   <p>Polish hooligans, who last week carried on repeated pogrom tactics in Douglas Park, apparently decided to give a "regular" pogrom display in the Douglas Park District, that Chicago Jews might have a "sample" of what now occurs in Poland.</p>
   <p>Chief of Police Garrity was informed yesterday that a gang of 5,000 Poles had secretly organized to make somewhat of a pogrom at noon today in the Jewish West Side District. This plan, which no doubt was the influence of the daily incitements in the Polish Press, is, according to the reasoning of the Chief of Police, to gather near Douglas Park, about noon and proceed from there to Twelfth Street and Kedzie Avenue, and thus avenge themselves on Jews for the Protest Demonstrations.</p>
   <p>The Chief of Police announced that he would send 250 extra policemen to the Fillmore Police Station of the Douglas Park district. Every attempt of Poles to start anything will be nipped in the bud. Polish hooligans will have the opportunity to prove publicly that Chicago is not Pinsk or Wilna. Polish pogrom "culture" is not in place here. Any outbreak that may possibly occur is the direct responsibility of the Polish newspapers Dziennik Chicagoski, Dziennik Narodowi, and the organ of the Jewish Pole, Pon Lotnitski, which do not cease their base agitation against Jews and incite innocent readers with their daily articles and nasty cartoons.</p>
