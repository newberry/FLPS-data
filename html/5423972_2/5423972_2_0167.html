   <p>The Jewish butchers yesterday declared a lockout against the shohatim. The butchers demanded that the shohatim reduce [the price they charge for slaughtering each fowl] in half. Until the present time a shohet received ten cents for each killing.</p>
   <p>A short time ago the rabbis and the Council of Shohatim decided that the shohatim must not clean the chickens they kill--i.e., remove the feathers from the chickens. The resolution pointed out that the shohatim were in the butcher shops only for ritual-slaying purposes; it was beneath their dignity to clean the slain carcasses. It seems that the butchers responded to this resolution by declaring a lockout.</p>
