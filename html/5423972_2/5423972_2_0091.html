   <p>Parents and teachers interested in rearing children seek various methods by which to break bad habits and ugly gesticulations practiced by children and for punishing children for disobedience. They ask: "What methods can be applied thereto? Should the strap and the rod be used as in olden times, or should we merely speak to the child, appeal to his finer senses, point out to him as examples good children, and, thereby, awaken in him an inclination to do things correctly and an aversion to things bad?"</p>
   <p>Years ago it was considered futile to speak to a child so that he might reform his conduct. [It was believed] that the child was inclined to break and destroy everything within his reach; that he was disobedient; that he was unwilling to study; and that, in order to improve him, the rod was necessary.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>This philosophy is a very simple one. The child, when punished by the rod, feels the pain and remembers it; and whenever his instincts dictate to him to commit another wrong, he recalls his punishment, and, therefore, refrains from committing the crime. As the child grows older, however, something proves to be wrong with the child. Beating and scolding accomplish nothing; in fact, they very often lead to bad results. The child who is brought up by the rod becomes obstinate and hard, and bears within his heart an everlasting hatred toward his father and his teacher.</p>
   <p>While it is true that punishment creates fear, as soon as fear disappears and the father or teacher is not present then the child again does as he pleases. It often leads to habitual concealment and denial of his acts. He loses faith in his parents and teachers. He no longer looks upon them as friends from whom he can find sympathy and compassion. Thus an abyss is formed between the child and his parents. In fact, the older the child gets, the stranger he becomes toward his parents.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>A child who was raised by parents that beat, cursed, and abused him has no respect for them. He does whatever his mind dictates and his heart desires. He grows up without a true guide, without a leader; and even when he knows he is doing wrong, he will not have the courage to confide his troubles to anybody. Brawn as the sole means of rearing children is, therefore, not very wise.</p>
   <p>There is a proverb which says: A slap passes away, whereas a word remains. The maltreatment a child receives as punishment passes away, and its effects disappear with it. If, on the other hand, we spoke to a child and explained to him how beneficial it is to be good, acted friendly toward him, and praised him for his good acts, it would have more effect upon him than bodily force. Hearing other children being praised makes a child envious, and he seeks to earn praise himself--until he thinks that it is natural to be good. He looks upon his parents and his teachers who are friendly to him as people who are looking out for his welfare. He acquires a feeling of friendship for them, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and becomes bound to them by the strong fetters of love and respect. He also confides to his parents everything--with all the simplicity of his childish heart.</p>
   <p>We must observe two things: (1) to break grown-up children of bad habits is harder than to teach the child good habits from the very beginning; and (2) there are no standard laws governing children which can be applied to all children alike. We cannot use one method on all children. Children of different parents, and quite frequently children of the same parents differ from each other in character and inclination. There are, of course, always exceptions to the rule. There are children who should occasionally be punished by bodily force; this should happen, however, very seldom.</p>
   <p>Above all, we must refrain from punishing a child with a hard instrument, such as wood. Even slapping a child is not very wise. Never punish a child when you are angry or aggravated. Wrath breeds wrath, hatred, and contempt. If physical force is necessary, we should use the utmost caution in applying it.</p>
