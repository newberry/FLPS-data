   <p>Polish propaganda in America spreads from day to day. Poles in this country believe they can lessen the impression of their crimes by denouncing Jews as Bolsheviks, pro-Germans and Separatists. In their speeches and writings against Jews they avail themselves of these four arguments.</p>
   <p>1.) Jews, the natural foes of Poles, instigate pogroms to harm the cause of the young Polish Republic.</p>
   <p>2.) Jews of Poland welcomed German victors with open arms, meriting, therefore, the hatred of all patriotic Poles, of all friends of the Entente, and of the entire civilized world.</p>
   
   <p>3.) Polish Jews are Bolsheviks and as such are the worst enemies of Poland. They are Polish traitors. The fate meted to the traitor is well known.</p>
   <p>4.) Polish Jews do not seek equality, but desire their own country within Poland, so naturally they are traitors of the Polish Republic, and no mercy should be shown them.</p>
   <p>An American Pole, N. L. Piatravski, sets forth the above four arguments in a pamphlet The Jews and The Poles, which has now made its appearance in Chicago through the Narod Polski Publishing Company, a Polish propaganda institution.</p>
   <p>Mr. Piatravski is not the only Polish anti-Semite and propagandist in America to present these arguments, because they can be found in every Polish pamphlet published during the last five years.</p>
   <p>True, lies are short-lived, but when many falsehoods are constantly repeated, the public soon comes to believe that these tales are at least half-truths or perhaps entirely true. That is why it is our duty to tear the mask of hypocrisy from Poles caught using these base and vulgar prevarications.</p>
   <p>Apparently we Jews have a dark fate; we were the first to proclaim: "The blood belongs to the being" (Biblical expression forbidding the shedding of blood). "Thou shalt not kill;" and yet we are accused of religious (or ritual) murders. We were the only nation to proclaim to the world that "Dina D'malkhutha Dina!" (the law of the land is the law) was the same as the law of the Torah, yet we are constantly accused of disloyalty. Everyday accounts of victims of pogroms are given, stating their names, their addresses, their age, and the conditions under which they were murdered by Polish criminals, yet Poles maintain that we instigate pogroms to discredit Poland. Such brazenness could only be displayed by a nation whom God had created in the heat of wrath. Of greater infamy than the pogroms themselves are the Polish insinuations that these pogroms are of our own doing, primarily to harm the Polish Republic.</p>
   <p>Not only the Jews of the large Polish cities but also the Poles themselves gladly welcomed the German victors. Not the Jewish women but the ladies of the highest Polish society threw flowers to German officers when the German Army entered Warsaw. As long as Poles believed that the Germans would be victorious, they remained not only pro-German, as did the others, but stooped also to flattery, as only Poles can do. And who knows this art better than the Pole? Polish Jews were pro-German, i. e. anti-Russian, because they knew that pogroms were forbidden in Germany, and not because of any great love for the German. But Poles were pro-German because they wished to obtain a desired political deal. They were prepared to sell and betray the Allies if the Germans agreed to their terms. Thus when Poles come today to accuse Jews of pro-Germanism they establish this accusation on the same moral level as the one in which they accuse the Jew of inciting pogroms to handicap the Polish Republic.</p>
   
   <p>Most vile of all accusations is [the one] that Jews in Poland are Bolsheviks. Poles in all their crudity have lost their sense. Jews of Poland are the middle-class men against whom Bolsheviks wage a bitter battle of life or death. Then how can the middle-class Polish Jew be a Bolshevik? Who would believe such foolishness of the Pole? Let that be as it may. Polish thinking is harassed and dimmed by hatred, infamy, and baseness. In this condition they think that the whole world is idiotic and that they can convince the people of anything.</p>
   <p>Even if Jews of Poland sought special rights we could still understand that. When one lives together with robbers and thieves one wants to be on the safe side. But the truth of the matter is that Jews do not demand a state within a state, nor special privileges, but only the elementary rights given national or religious minorities in any national state if that state wishes to exist. But Poles who were never able to secure any rights themselves, having at all times been in a state of slavery....will not now cede rights to anyone else.committee Jews of Poland wish to make secure their position by seeking minimum minority rights. This is the reason for the Polish wrath, for the base Polish accusations and vile lies.</p>
