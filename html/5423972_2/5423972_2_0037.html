   <p>We have received a request that the following letter be published; the letter is self-explanatory.</p>
   <p>"To the editor of the Daily Jewish Courier,</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir: For the benefit of other Jewish girls who are in the same predicament as we are, we trust that you will print the following which is a story of 'social conditions' as we find them today. We are two young girls who have been brought up by strict Orthodox parents. We have made every effort to associate with young men and women of our own faith. We have plenty of girl friends, but so far as men are concerned, we wish to ask some advice.</p>
   <p>"To begin with, we have no opportunity of meeting young men at our friends' homes, and, therefore, our only contact with young Jewish crowds is at club <span class="page-break">\2</span>affairs, which include entertainments and dancing. At these affairs, the class of men we meet is not the type we prefer. It is generally a young, careless, and carefree crowd. Although we are only twenty-two years of age, we are more serious, and, therefore, we like serious men; the question is--where can we meet serious-minded men of from twenty-eight to thirty-five years of age?</p>
   <p>"From this statement, please do not infer that we are prim and averse to having a good time. We can dance, we dress just as nicely as the occasion demands, and we always make an effort to be sociable among strangers. Although we are very Jewish-minded, we are Anglo-Saxon in physical appearance. Our complexions are fair; we are tall and slender, and are usually mistaken for Gentiles.</p>
   <p>"When we first meet a young man and become fairly well acquainted with him, we usually drift into a discussion of religion during a discussion of various topics. It seems that as soon as he finds out that we are Jewish girls, he takes the first opportunity he can find of quitting our company. Probably this type of man usually seeks the company of a Gentile girl. He considers his time <span class="page-break">\3</span>and money wasted on our type. Why?</p>
   <p>"The reason is quite obvious, and we are sure you understand. It seems that most of our Jewish men prefer to take out Gentile girls, until they reach the age of forty, or thereabouts. Then, after they look old enough to be fathers of children, they are ready to settle down with a young girl of eighteen or twenty.</p>
   <p>"The young Jewish girl is forced to stay at home and wait until the man has finished having his good time. There is but one alternative for her, and that is, to go out with Gentile men--and why not, if they are the right kind? From [our personal] experience, we wish to state that they treat us courteously, think it an honor to take us out, and in every way show us how much superior they are to our men in manners and respectful regard for a lady. Are we breaking any religious laws by going out with Gentile men? Are we doing wrong? Please advise us. Our parents do not believe it necessary for us to go out to seek pleasure or the company of men.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"Being young, we find great pleasure in going to different amusement places. Since it is improper to go unescorted, and since Jewish men never invite us out, why can't we go out with Gentiles, as long as they are perfect gentlemen? We want you to understand that there is absolutely no possibility of anything serious developing from our association with these young men. Our religion is too deeply rooted within us to allow such a friendship to go too far.</p>
   <p>"We hope that we have really explained the difficulties as they exist, and trust that you will offer some advice through your paper."</p>
   <p>We are very sorry to state that we cannot offer any advice because we are not acquainted with the position and station in life of the two writers of this letter. Jewish girls should make it their business to associate with Jewish men because a girl can never tell where a friendship with a Gentile man will lead. If the Jewish girls made it their business to spend part of their earnings to brighten their homes, instead of spending everything on clothes and <span class="page-break">\5</span>cosmetics, they would easily find plenty of Jewish friends. In a great many cases, Jewish men do not associate with Jewish girls because, while the girls look like princesses on the street, they cannot entertain their friends at home because their homes are poor and unattractive. Whether or not the writers of this letter belong to this type of Jewish girl, we do not know. As a rule, if a Jewish girl does not find friends among Jewish men and is compelled to associate with Gentiles, it is her own fault. In many other cases, Jewish men are simply afraid of associating with Jewish girls because the latter do not allow a friendship to develop [normally] and seek to monopolize the man prematurely. Therefore, the conditions described in the above letter, are due to the individual shortcomings of the Jewish girl.</p>
   <p>However, we admit that there is a certain class of well-educated, well-mannered, and intellectual Jewish girls in the city of Chicago who find it difficult to secure the right sort of Jewish male companionship. There are many more intellectual Jewish girls in Chicago than intellectual men. An intellectual <span class="page-break">\6</span>Jewish girl will refuse to associate with an uneducated and ill-mannered man. To give a Jewish intellectual girl an opportunity to meet the right sort of men, a Jewish intellectual center should be established. This is the only advice we can offer.</p>
   <p>If the writers of the letter are merely seeking our approval of their association with Gentiles and of their going out to amusement places with Gentiles, we wish to tell them immediately that they won't get it. If, however, they are well educated and modest Jewish girls, who do not use a whole drug store on their faces, they will find plenty of nice Jewish company.</p>
