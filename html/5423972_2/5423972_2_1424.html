   <p>No better time could have been selected than during the present holidays to discant upon the status of our Chicago Judaism. To this end we publish the names of all our Congregations Chevras and Minyans in this article. The five or six first named are among the most prominent congregations whose mode of worship is denominated as reformed, while the others represent the several provincial and foreign ritualisms of the most orthodox stripe. That the Russian and Polish Jews which have emigrated hither are forming a large contingent of our Jewish population must be apparent, since they well nigh outnumber the other Jewish nationalities in New York City and are doing so in Chicago, if <span class="page-break">2</span>we are to judge from the numerous attendance at their several places of worship. In the West 12th Street Turner Hall, for instance it is positively asserted that there were not less than one thousand worshippers, while a like number were present in the Anshe Keneseth Israel Congregation, corner Judd and Clinton Streets. It will be observed that through this influx the extreme orthodox or mediaeval Judaism is prominent even in our city. We have carefully watched the doings of these people in American communities. Their ideas of crude Judaism are daily becoming more prominent in a not very savory sense, owing to their want of education and heretofore enforced Ghettoism or ostracism of their foreign governments.</p>
   <p>We cannot at this writing determine what the outcome of these people will result in. Suffice it to say that the young elements are casting loose from the old regime...especially those who attend the public schools or private institutions of secular teachings. But, the influx of Russian and Polish immigrants will for many years keep alive these mediaeval Chevras and <span class="page-break">3</span>Minyans, ad nauseam. The efforts put forth by a number of prominent gentlemen in New York last year to instruct these immigrants on the moral, ethical and social relations to their new home in this land of religious liberty was undoubtedly a wise movement. The lectures and discourses by Drs. Kohler, Gottheil and others before them should have born good fruits. It seems that our Chicago eminent Jews have as yet not attempted a like "missionary work" among that class of immigrants. Our daily press have however, their quota of acts and doings of these misguided people, who in their ignorance and superstition perform acts, which if not wholly contrary to our statutes, are thrown at the doors of all Israelites indiscriminately, be they Reformed, Semi-Orthodox, or conservative Jewish citizens who have nothing in common with the peculiar chassidim or extreme ritualistic orthodox letter worshippers.</p>
   <p>It is our opinion that Chicago's leading reform congregations might do something to send its talented and able Rabbis to perform a little "missionary <span class="page-break">4</span>work among them" i. e., instruct and teach them the history of Israel; its true religious sentiments; their duty toward the state and society; the abrogation of false conceptions, and so forth.</p>
   <p>It would in a short time reflect the highest credit upon Judaism in general. We need scarcely say that in some of the places of worship during the past holidays, their services resembled barbarous idolatry more than true and orderly convocation of devout people, resulting from the confined environment of their late foreign homes.</p>
   <p>It will, however, be seen that the revival of Judaism, not only in our reform temples, but among our brethren of the orthodox side reveals a religious fervor, since all the temples and places of worship were filled overflowing.</p>
