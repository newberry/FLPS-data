   <p>If the brethren of District Grand Lodge No. 6 of the Independent Order B'nai B'rith. desire to know what impression their"elegant speeches" and "Judicious action" in the charter business has made upon the public they may take notice of the manner in which our daily papers have summed up the affair. The Chicago Times did it as follows:</p>
   <p>Drawing the Line.</p>
   <p>If Christians Object to Jews, the Latter in Turn "Sit Down" on Other Jews. The Convention of the I. O. B. B. Decisively Refuses Charter to Polish Applicants. The Chief Objection Being an Alleged Super-abundance of Filth and Ignorance.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staatszeitung terms the affair:</p>
   <p>Eine Judenhatz unter Juden</p>
   <p>(Jew-baiting among Jews)</p>
   <p>Comments are unnecessary.</p>
