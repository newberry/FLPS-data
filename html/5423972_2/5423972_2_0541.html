   <p>In his sermon at the Morse Avenue Church, in Rogers Park, Reverend S. F. Lang stoutly defended the Jewish morale, and, among other things, said:</p>
   <p>"The Christians who evacuate or shun districts where Jews reside, set a very poor example of true Christianity. Wherever Jews come, they bring light and life, and we should welcome them with open arms."</p>
