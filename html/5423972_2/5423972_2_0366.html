   <p>It has not yet, nor will it ever be ascertained which is the first day-hence, the seventh day will remain forever a mystery. That it is divine to keep our Sabbath day holy is a well established law. It is the greatest moral tenet for all civilized nations and their religious beliefs. But a proper chronology is wanting entirely to say or indicate which of the days in the week is truly the first or seventh day. As a result of being interlinked with the people of other denominations among civilized nations per force even that day is sadly neglected. Hence, the great apathy in present Judaism.</p>
