   <p>The rearing of children is expensive. Parents know full well how costly it is. Notwithstanding this fact, children are assets, not liabilities. There are few parents who would say that their children are not worth the amount they cost. If parents are unable, for whatever reasons, to provide for their children, and this obligation falls upon the community, the children are still assets to the community. Conditions in society are not always what they should be. Ill-health shortens the lives of many, and illiteracy limits the working capabilities of others. Crime and immorality imperil the social order, and society is responsible for this. But the future generation furnishes fresh material which can be shaped in accordance with society's needs. The mistakes which we adults have made, can be rectified by our children. A few years of public attention focused upon the welfare of children, could change a society. Therefore, one can understand that the guidance and care, that children need, should be given to them not only out of kindness and humanitarianism--it is the children's right.</p>
   
   <p>Every child is entitled to certain things--if a child does not receive them, society suffers. Let us briefly mention these things, and then we shall see whether society can guarantee them to every child.</p>
   <p>All of us agree with the most recent scientific discovery that all children are entitled to the best prenatal care, because the care of a child begins with the attention the mother gets before the child is born. They [children] have the right to enter a home which has been prepared for them. They have the right to the proper kind of nourishment, which should be given to them at the proper time: first the mother's breast, and then simple, well-selected, and well-cooked food. They have the right to a clean, well-arranged and spacious home. They have the right to sufficient fresh air and pure water, and well-heated rooms and proper clothing in cold weather. They have the right to a lot of sleep and a comfortable bed. They have the right to protection against contagious disease and the right to instruction in proper conduct. They have the right to an education in keeping with their abilities, and to good training. and influence. They have the right to play. All these rights are usually assured in a normal family life.</p>
   <p>It is unquestionably true that the child has the right to live in a home where the father can provide him with the aforementioned necessities. Most parents are willing to do everything they can for their children. The first thing that communities should do, in order that children may enjoy their rights, is to establish children's bureaus, and to prohibit the use of force upon children. One of the most important social institutions would be a health center where parents could learn how best to raise children. If a father's earnings do not allow him to provide his children with everything they need, society must come to his aid with milk stations, recreation centers, etc.</p>
   <p>If a father is dead or unable to work, then society must help the mother take care of her children. If both parents are dead, the child should be taken into a private home where he can be given individual attention. The child has a right to be raised by people who have watched his development and who know his nature and character. If the child is neglected and needs special treatment, which requires the guardianship of others, then it must be given under social supervision. To direct a children's home requires the services of an expert, who knows how to become friendly with children, and who can find out their particular desires. It is in the interests of society that every child should be placed in an environment where he can properly develop his capabilities. Therefore, the Juvenile Court, or the court which provides guardians over children, is one of the means through which society can fulfill several of its duties.</p>
