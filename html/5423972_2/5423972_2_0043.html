   <p>That most mothers aid nature in developing their daughters weaker than their sons is a fact which no one can dispute. Whereas a boy is permitted to run, jump, and climb, girls are dressed like dolls and ordered not to get dirty, not to bring their curls, bows, bracelets, rings, etc. into disorder. The little girls donned in white dresses and white shoes, over which mothers labor the whole morning, feel as though they are obligated to look after their dresses, shoes and bows. They must be quiet, not move about too much. And mothers are proud of their quiescent girls.</p>
   <p>However, these mothers do not know that their quiescent daughters will develop into weak, anaemic women, without physical or moral strength. The least amount of work will tire them. The slightest temptation will conquer them. The mothers do not know that only in a strong, healthy body with wholesome nerves can there reside a sound spirit, a strong will power to withstand the temptations which a big city furnishes so abundantly.</p>
   <p>We already have, thank God, equal rights with men. But is this all that we need for our women? To take advantage of the rights endowed upon us, requires the possession of physical and spiritual strength; requires physically and spiritually healthly women. Can the present educational system produce such women?</p>
   <p>Women who bring up their daughters with rings and bracelets, who implant in them the lust for jewelry and dresses, who do not have their daughters acquire the habit of earnest work, who do not allow their daughters to run and jump lest they soil their dresses, - such women cannot take advantage of the privilege bestowed upon women. They have no use for these privileges. The daughters of our mothers can be nothing else but physically and spiritually weak. They are unable to acquire either the desire or strength to work.</p>
   <p>Nature is not to be blamed for our weakness or inability to render or create independency. Nor is it the fault of the men. But we mothers, ourselves, are the sole guilty ones. If it is the mother's wish to make of her daughter a sugar doll, a plaything for her future husband, if all her efforts are concentrated toward achieving this goal, then the daughter will naturally not become selfreliant. Most mothers await for men of wealth, business, and prominence to marry their daughters. The girl is not taught to be useful, but to be pleasant; nor is she taught to become a selfreliant person, but a pleasing object. She is superficially taught to maintain a fine outward appearance, to make an effect, to catch a gold fish in a net,--a rich young man.</p>
   <p>Neither laws nor privileges will help so long as mothers cannot understand that by raising children in this fashion, they merely raise coquettes and useless, unfortunate women. Every person should, first of all, place implicit confidence in himself and then in others. Ability and strength evolve from work. If girls are reared like boys, they will be useful and productive. When pomp will cease to be a means for marriage, when marriage will cease to be a meal-ticket; then will women be as competent workers as men. Mothers should not rear dolls, but human beings.</p>
