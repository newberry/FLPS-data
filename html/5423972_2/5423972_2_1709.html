   <p>The news is that the Tailor Employers Association is breaking down. If ever any one doubted the courage of the workers, he will now have to admit that the destruction of the association is due to the strength of the organizational campaign conducted and still being led by the Amalgamated Workers Union. Many victims were laid at the altar of human rights. We need remind ourselves only of the strikes of 1910, 1915, and 1916. We cannot forget our murdered, wounded, hungry, and frozen brothers. We cannot but curse the association and blame them for the tremendous sacrifices. The present campaign of the workers is the most extraordinary in the annals of Jewish labor.</p>
