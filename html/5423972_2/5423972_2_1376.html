   <p>Let Chicago return that portion of the $2,500,000 which it has received from the puritanical Congress of the United States!</p>
   <p>Next winter that same Congress shall return that money with interest. The man who will vote against any such proposition will be left home at the next election! No free man, no laborer, no poor man, will vote for him!</p>
   <p>Prevent thereby the democratic administration from continuing to crusade against Sunday opening (of the World's Fair), disgusting friend and foe, making this "land of the free" a laughing stock in the eyes of the whole civilized world!</p>
   <p>There was no necessity of having a World's Fair in this bigoted and preacher-ridden country bare of religions liberty and where individual liberty more and more becomes a mockery. No strangers should have been invited to witness our humiliation! With what feelings will they again leave this "land of the free?"</p>
