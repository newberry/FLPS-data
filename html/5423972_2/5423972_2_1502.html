   <p>Judge Hilton, who banished the Jews from his Grand Hotel in Saratoga last year, is now reaping the reward of his meanness and exclusiveness by seeing his house nearly empty, notwithstanding his efforts to fill it up. His narrow and selfish policy is not calculated to build up the hotel business, and it is reacting against the property in a marked degree. In spite of all his efforts the concern languishes and the magnificent outlay of A. T. Stewart could probably be bought for one-third its original cost.</p>
