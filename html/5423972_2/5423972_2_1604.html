   <p>Foes of the Forward desire to prevent the Forward from being sold on all news stands. Circulars are spread that the news dealers declared a strike against the Forward. Whose black hand was raised against the Forward?</p>
   <p>They speak in the name of the news dealers. They say that the news dealers have a grievance against the Forward. We shall herein reveal the entire story with the complete information.</p>
   <p>Last Tuesday, December 18, a committee of the news dealers turned to the management of the Forward, demanding that the price which they receive for selling the Forward shall be raised to 20% on 100 copies. Comrade Benjamin Schlessinger, the manager, told them that, as the Forward is a working class paper, and a community paper, and not privately owned, he must submit their demand to the managing council in New York. He also stated that as manager of the Forward, he will recommend their demand as favorable; but it will take about ten days until the matter will be considered and decided upon by the Forward Association.</p>
   <p>A few days later, he was in receipt of a letter from New York, relating that the Forward Association appointed a committee to participate in the fifth anniversary of the Chicago Forward; that the committee consists of Comrade B. Vladek, general manager of the Forward, Adolph Held, president of the Forward Association, and Meyer Gillis; that the committee will arrive in Chicago Monday, December 31, and will spend a few days in Chicago; and that the same committee will also take up all matters concerning the Forward of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In the meantime a circular began antagonizing the news dealers and a committee of news dealers (not the same committee that previously acted) notified the Forward that they must immediately obtain an answer whether their demand is granted. A second conference was promptly arranged, and Comrade B. Schlessinger invited representatives from all parts of the labor movement in Chicago to be present.</p>
   
   <p>The committee of the news dealers came to the Forward yesterday at 2 P. M. and the conference began. Those present were: Edward Knuckles, secretary of the Chicago Federation of Labor; Sam Levin, manager of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in Chicago; Meyer Pearlstein, vice-president of the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union in Chicago; and Leon Hanock, secretary of the United Hebrew Trades of Chicago. Comrade Schles-singer repeated the statement that was related above, namely, that a committee will arrive from New York, Monday; the committee will take up the demand of the news dealers; that he shall recommend in favor of the demand and whatever shall be determined, the agreement shall become effective from the time that the news dealers first submitted their demand.</p>
   <p>After the labor representatives listened to everything, they made the following statement: We listened to the news dealers demand to the Forward, and to the answer that Forward had given them. The answer is within limits of reason and only just. It suggests only, that the news dealers shall await the committee of the Forward Association, Monday.</p>
   <p>The record of the Forward in its relation with the workers, in all its departments is well known to all unions of these workers and to the entire labor movement. Consequently, the news dealers can rely upon the Forward, as brother Schlessinger advised them, especially, when they know that brother Schlessinger's recommendation to the committee of New York, also contains the clause, that if a higher price is decided upon for them, that agreement shall become effective on the day that they submitted their demand.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that no other answer to the news dealers, than the one brother Schlessinger gave, would do, and the news dealers should be absolutely satisfied.</p>
   <p>(Signed) Edward Knuckles, secretary of Chicago Federation of Labor; Sam Levin, manager of Chicago Joint Board, Amalgamated Clothing Workers; Leon Hanock, secretary of Chicago Federation of United Hebrew Trades.</p>
   
   <p>We thought that the statement of the well known labor leaders, as well as the statement of our manager, Comrade Schlessinger, was valid and that the news dealers would wait until Monday for the decision of the Forward Association from New York. But anyway after the news dealers' committee left the Forward office, they called the Forward, by phone, and a person calling himself a representative of the news dealers yelled out, "A strike shall be called against the Forward!"</p>
   <p>What strike? Who is calling the strike? What is the strike being called for? It is a conspiracy - not a strike! A strike is declared by workers when they approach a boss with certain demands and the boss refuses to grant the demands under any conditions. The Forward is no boss and the manager of the Forward did not refuse to grant the news dealers their demand. The manager only wanted them to permit him to present their demand to the committee from New York, which will arrive here Monday, because he is not authorized to decide upon agreements, himself.</p>
   
   <p>Nevertheless, a circular was distributed stating that there is a strike -- a strike by the news dealers, It is, therefore, readily understood, that a conspiracy was contrived somewhere against the Forward.</p>
   <p>Who are the conspirators? The circulars speak of a News-boys' Union, and it is asserted that the union is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. We challenge that statement on the basis of our knowledge of unions and strikes. The news dealers do not belong to the Chicago Federation of Labor, to which all unions of Chicago belong. And furthermore, Knuckles received a telegram from Frank Morrison, secretary of the American Federation of Labor in Washington, stating that the news dealers organization does not belong to the American Federation of Labor. It has been a long time since the news dealers were considered a union of the American Federation of Labor. In this circular, the American Federation of Labor is mentioned in order to create its false impression that a recognized union has declared a strike against the Forward.</p>
   <p>All the working class enemies of Chicago have united with this circular, thinking that they can blackmail the Forward. The Forward is the organ of the workers, and is implanted in the heart of every reader. Everybody will be convinced that a plot is made against the Forward, and everybody will help to obstruct the conspiracy.</p>
