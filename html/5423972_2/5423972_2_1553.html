   <p>A few days ago the graduation ceremony of over twelve hundred students took place at Northwestern University. Heretofore it has always been the custom that the minister of the chapel of the university be the main speaker at the graduation celebration, as he is to offer his blessing to the young men starting out in life as grown-ups.</p>
   <p>But this year something occurred in this aristocratic college that made it impossible for the minister of the University's chapel to talk before the graduating students. The minister himself was prepared to deliver his speech and his name was even printed on the program, but the administrators of the school, in the last few days before graduation, objected to him and in his place announced another minister, a bishop, to give his <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>blessing to the graduating students and to tell them what is awaiting them on their new road to life.</p>
   <p>The minister of the chapel was objected to for this one reason: A short time ago he permitted in his church a meeting of students who were strongly opposed to war, and although he did not participate in it, the fact that he permitted it in his church was sufficient for the school administrators not to trust him with the graduation speech, lest the twelve hundred students might be affected by his fascist ideas.</p>
   <p>But when trouble is set to visit anyone, it is very hard to get away from it. And so it was with the administration of the Northwestern University. They could not get rid of fascism. It was expected that the guest bishop, as a good religious person, would give the students a blessing and nothing else, but this expectation didn't come true.</p>
   <p>Here is what the bishop said: "The great World War--we have been told-- <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>was to bring peace and disarmament to the entire world. Instead of that, England and France continue keeping regular armies, the largest armies ever heard of in the history of these two nations; and their fleets are now spending twice the amount they spent in 1912. The United States is now spending four times as much on its fleet as it did in 1912. We just simply betrayed the confidence of the young heroes. The young men who fell victims in the war believed the war would bring peace to the world. We are now seized by the evil of a great reaction."</p>
   <p>This is what the bishop had to say about the beautiful dream of "world peace" that the war brought into the world. He did not stop there but went on to describe a picture of present social conditions, emphasizing especially the great battle now raging between capital and labor.</p>
   <p>As a representative of God in this world of sin, this minister must deal impartially. When he speaks of the great industrial injustice that is being committed, he does not shield the workers nor the capitalists. He <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>claims that the workers of today are not as good, as religious, as they should be. But the capitalists are not better. "What we can see," claims the bishop, "is that the workers' indifference to public welfare is no more than an echo of the same indifference which the public shows regarding the injustice committed against the workers."</p>
   <p>At the end of his speech the bishop asked the graduating young Americans the following questions of vital interest to them:</p>
   <p>"Society is now asking you what do you intend to do with the education you have achieved? Do you seek education to free yourselves from hard work and from the troubles and misery that beset the great masses? Do you think that you can keep yourselves apart from public life and go around by yourselves with neat, clean-washed hands and perfumed clothes?"</p>
   <p>The bishop declared that a person's aim in life should to a great extent consist in what he can do to alleviate the sufferings and improve the living <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>conditions of the people around him.</p>
   <p>And so the administrators of the aristocratic college were very much disappointed in the exchange [of speakers].</p>
   <p>These obscure reactionaries, afraid of free speech and opposed to allowing a representative of the church whom they considered a liberal and fascist to address the students, were finally astonished when they had to face the truth of the evils of present society spoken by a person who is neither a socialist nor a radical. Perhaps this will be a good lesson for them. It will teach them once and for all that the American colleges cannot be transformed into barracks of military discipline, and that the young American students dare not and will not remain deaf and blind to society's present evils.</p>
