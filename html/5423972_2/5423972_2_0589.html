   <p>Kovno, the capital of Lithuania, has a Jewish population of from twenty-five to thirty thousand. The majority of the Kovno Jews are by no means well to do, and a great many of them are actually paupers, but these twenty-five thousand Jews in Kovno are maintaining fifteen Jewish public schools, three Yeshivahs, one teachers' seminary, and now they have established a faculty for higher Jewish learning, and have pledged to support it to the extent of two hundred thousand marks annually. Besides, there are in Kovno a number of other Jewish educational establishments, and any number of Jewish Kindergartens. All these institutions are not supported by voluntary contributions, as is the case in America, but are supported by the community.</p>
   <p>In Chicago there are more than three hundred thousand Jews, and most of the Chicago Jews are well to do; even the poor cannot be called paupers, and these <span class="page-break">2</span>three hundred thousand Jews in Chicago do not support even ten Talmud Torahs, do not support one teachers' seminary, do not maintain kindergartens, and do not support a faculty for Jewish learning. They may do so in the future, and we hope they will, but at the present they must be appealed to, to support anything.</p>
   <p>How is it that twenty five thousand poor Jews in Kovno can do more for Jewish education and Jewish culture than three hundred thousand wealthy Jews in Chicago? How is it that Kovno Jewry can maintain a faculty for higher Jewish learning, make such men as Albert Einstein and Simon Dubnow take an interest in their Jewish faculty, while the Chicago Jews can do nothing of the sort? How is it that the poor Kovno Jews can care educationally for every Jewish child, while the Chicago Jews do not care educationally for even twenty per cent of the Jewish children? The answer to these questions seems to us simple enough. The Jews in Kovno are communally well organized, and are animated by strong Jewish sentiments, while the Chicago Jews are communally not organized and are not animated by Jewish idealism and Jewish sentiments. The Jews in <span class="page-break">3</span>Kovno want to be happy, not only as human beings, but as Jews as well. They want to live a Jewish life, and they want to perpetuate their Judaism. They want to bring up their children as Jews, and to do that they give them the best sort of Jewish education possible. The Chicago Jews on the other hand, are only anxious to be happy as human beings and most of them do not give a tumble for Judaism. Outside of charity, they do nothing for Judaism. They are not anxious to perpetuate it, or at least they do nothing to perpetuate it, and hence they do not give their children Jewish education. They do not care for the Judaism of the next generation. Most of our people here are anxious to have a good time; that is all. What they call a good time is mostly a cheap affair. In Kovno they are also anxious to have a good time, and are surely anxious to be happy, but there they know that unless they are happy as Jews too, they cannot be happy as human beings either--hence their keen desire to be happy as both.</p>
   <p>This explains best why the poor Jews in Kovno can do a thousand times more for Jewish education and Jewish culture than the three hundred thousand wealthy <span class="page-break">4</span>Chicago Jews. Then, of course, we must take into consideration that the Kovno Jews are communally organized, while the Chicago Jews are not. In Kovno there is an organized Jewish community, an organized Rabbinate, an organized Beth Din, an organized Kashruth, and an organized Jewish life. Here no Jewish community exists, and only one out of twenty belongs to a Jewish congregation, and probably only one in fifty takes an interest in a Jewish congregation. Without a communal organization to cope with communal problems, and without any higher communal authority in existence to enforce the will of the majority, Chicago with its three hundred thousand well-to-do Jews cannot do as much as can Kovno with its twenty-five thousand poor Jews.</p>
   <p>They can do it in Kovno all right, because in Kovno they are serious-minded Jews; they cannot do anything in Chicago, because in Chicago they are not serious-minded Jews. That is all there is to it.</p>
   <p>The spirit of anarchy with which Jewish life in the city is permeated is bound to perpetuate itself, unless we establish some sort of a communal <span class="page-break">5</span>organization to enforce the will of the majority of Chicago Jews.</p>
