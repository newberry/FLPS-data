   <p>The dictionary has become richer with a new word: White Protestant Civilization. The Protestant Civilization is the credendum of many patriotic Americans. The Ku Klux Klan wants to protect the Protestant Civilization; Mr. Henry Ford's agents want to protect the Protestant Civilization; the foes of immigration want to protect the Protestant Civilization, and every reactionary force in the country is now speaking of the White Protestant Civilization.</p>
   <p>The Czarist government wanted to uphold and protect the Greek Orthodox Civilization; the Spanish Inquisstion wanted to protect the Roman Catholic Civilization, and Soviet Russia of today wants to protect the red atheistic-communistic civilization of the commissars. The black, the red, the white, the yellow--all wish to protect the civilization of their own color and in order to protect the color of their civilization they are willing to commit great crimes--to undermine the foundation of every civilization.</p>

   <p>When you hear of a person who wishes to protect this or that civilization, you may rest assured that that protector of civilization is a beast of prey. The "protector" of the White Protestant Civilization is the same beast of prey as is the protector of the Black Catholic Civilization or as the protector of the Red Atheistic Civilization.</p>
   <p>All of them are archenemies of every civilization. By nature he [the protector of civilization] is a savage and a violent person--at any rate, the antithesis of a civilized man, because the truly civilized person is against violent acts and against imposing forcefully a certain conviction or belief upon another group of people. The truly civilized person does not hate his fellow men, because he has his own political, religious, and philosophic convictions. Hatred is fostered by the savage, the uncivilized, in whom the spirit of the barbarian is still alive. The civilization of a certain color is for him merely a veil, a shield, behind which are concealed bestial inclinations. Whenever you hear a person speak of protecting a civilization, shun him as <span class="page-break">3</span>you would shun a beast of prey.</p>
   <p>Civilization does not have any color. It is neither yellow nor green; white nor black; red nor grey--it is the total amount of all human endeavor and human acts for a better and more beautiful world. Civilization is not a monopoly of any color and of any race. There was a great civilization in America before the white people ever knew about the existence of this continent. There was a great and highly developed civilization in Asia when the peoples of Europe did not differ much from animals and beasts. There was a great civilization in North Africa while the peoples of other countries and continents could not distinguish between man and beast.</p>
   <p>There is no Protestant, no Greek Orthodox, or no Roman Catholic civilization, because civilization has as much to do with religion as snow has with confections. Civilization is the product of the human tendency to make <span class="page-break">4</span>the world better, more beautiful, and more comfortable--and such a tendency lives in every person--in one it lives in a greater degree; in another, in a lesser. Only among animals and beasts does this tendency not live. By that token of reason, civilization is a purely human affair and all men are peers in the corporation which is called civilization.</p>
   <p>In America the spirit of civilization lives in many--it lives in the Protestant as in the Catholic; in the Jew as in the pagan. And there are such [pagans] in America. The White Protestant civilization exists only in their obscure fantasy, because Catholics and Jews have no less contributed to this civilization than Protestants. The Protestants have not fixed their seal on the American civilization, because it [American civilization] is very little Protestant or Puritanical and is a great deal universal and worldly. If this or that great inventor or discoverer, who opened new worlds for American civilization through his invention or discovery was a Protestant, his invention or discovery is as little Protestant as the invention or discovery of a Catholic is Catholic.</p>

   <p>Galileo was a Catholic, i. e., born of Catholic parents and brought up with the Catholic religion, yet no one will assert that the works produced by Galileo are Catholic. Einstein is a Jew, but his great contribution to civilization has very little to do with his Judaism. Leibnitz, Newton and Darwin were Protestants, but their discoveries and inventions which have contributed so much to civilization have nothing to do with their Protestantism. Just as Mendelyeev's theory has nothing to do with Greek Orthodoxy, so has civilization developed independent of religion and has little bearing with religion. It has some bearing with race, because there are productive and unproductive races--a race that is not productive can be attributed to certain living conditions such as environment, education, geographical conditions, etc. A race can be noncreative in one country and very creative in another country. But civilization certainly has nothing to do with religion, and when you hear of a "match" between religion and civilization, you should know that that match is not a match, but a reactionary conspiracy or an outburst of barbarous forces. So remember.</p>
