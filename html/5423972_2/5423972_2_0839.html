   <p>A group of Polish ruffians, under the agitation of Polish "pogromists", attack Jews every evening in different sections of Chicago. The bloodiest attack on Jews occurred in Douglas Park. A band of young Poles overwhelmed a group of old Jews, threw some in the water, and injured the others. When the police arrived, a few young Jewish boys were standing around ready to protect the old Jews from any further attacks by the Polish hooligans. The police, by mistake or perhaps deliberately, gave some of the Jewish boys a beating instead of looking for the Poles who were responsible for the attack. One of the old victims is David Levitt of 3331 Grenshaw Street, a member of the Russian Socialist Branch, who was beaten up very badly by seven Polish hooligans.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Polish newspapers have begun a new anti-Semitic campaign. The Dziennik Chicagoski, the organ of the Polish church, published a very ugly cartoon in which the Jew is represented as a parrot saying what the Germans tell him to say--namely, "pogroms [on Poles]".</p>
