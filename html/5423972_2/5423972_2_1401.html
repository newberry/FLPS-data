   <p>So easy the definition of the word "Jew" appears to be, yet in the history of the Order of B'nai B'rith, it was twice already found necessary to appeal to the highest judicial authority of the Order for such a definition. (See Appeals No. V and No. XLVI.) It is true enough that in some instances the term "Jew" is used in the sense of a confessor of Judaism, of one whose religion is the Jewish religion. In these instances the word "Jew" is to be classified with the parallel words Christian, Mohammedan, Buddhist, etc. or with the words Catholic, Methodist, Baptist, etc. It is in these cases the designation for a member of a religious community. But in among a hundred cases, perhaps ninety-nine times, one who speaks or writes of "Jews" intends to convey the meaning that he treats of people who belong to a certain racial community - viz., to the Jewish race. Here then the word "Jew" <span class="page-break">2</span>cannot be put into the same category with the words "Christian," "Mohammedan," etc., but it has to be classed with such words as "German," "Italian," "Englishman," "Scandinavian," etc. In such a sense the word "Jew" is mostly understood in the present times, and in such a sense it was understood in the past times.</p>
   <p>First, in the present times there are, as it is well known, still many countries where the Jews do not yet enjoy equal rights with non-Jews and where still, exceptional laws and ordinances regarding "Jews" are existing. Do these exceptional laws in their speaking of Jews, refer to the believers in one God, to the observers of certain religious forms and ceremonies? No. These laws and ordinances have reference to members of the Jewish race. What they believe or do not believe, what ceremonies they practice or neglect to practice, this is perfectly indifferent to the administrators or judicial executors of these laws. So it is in Russia, in Rumania, in Italy, and in other uncivilized and semi-barbarous countries, today.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The constitutional and legal enactments, and the administrative edicts and ordinances, had, and have members of the Hebrew race as their object. As it is the case in the legal use of the word, so it is in the common mode de parler generally.</p>
   <p>Preachers, authors, writers for newspapers and others speak, especially if they are unprejudiced and desire to be just, of the natural gifts, of the good qualities, of the moral and intellectual excellencies of the Jews. But there are also others who speak of their real or supposed faults and foibles, of their, as they say, harmful influence upon non-Jewish society, and so forth. It will be admitted that among all these people, the Jew is not thought of as a member of a religious community, but as a member of a particular race. In this connection we involuntarily think of the disgraceful anti-Semitic agitation in some European countries, and of kindred tendencies (as for instance, excluding Jews as such, from certain clubs and societies, and so forth) even in the otherwise so liberal and so tolerant America. Against the members of the Jewish race these agitations and these excluding endeavors are directed, <span class="page-break">4</span>not against anti-Trinitarians or against people who keep Saturday as their Sabbath. Moreover, the Jews themselves, when they speak of Jews, mean usually brethren-in-race. Our preachers have so much to say of the brilliant Stammestugenden (racial virtues) of the Jewish people, of the great achievements of the Jews in history, of their beneficial activity in the present times as statesmen, authors, professors in universities, etc. And then our Jewish periodicals, especially in these United States! Do they connect with the word Jew any other sense than that of a man of the Jewish race? And because they are so race proud, and because they push the Jewish religion so much into the background, they speak with such a great gusto of every "Jew" who in whatever sphere, rises more or less on the surface or over the surface. They boast of Rachel and of Sarah Bernhardt, of Pauline Lucca, and of Mr. Sontheim, of Professor X, and of sculptor Y. In their chauvinistic spirit they even claim quite a number of men as belonging to unsere Leut, who have been of good Aryan stock, as for instance, Massena, Gambetta, Rassine and others.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>If Mr. Isaac Levinson of Smithville, has been elected mayor of his town, our Jewish papers report it, and comment on it, and emphasize it, how again one of our Jews has risen to eminence; and all the Aronsons and Blumenthals and Veilchenstreins and Lowenbergs and Abramoskys will have to rejoice at the success of Isaac Levinson - for, you know, he is a "yahudi." If Mr. Tulpedfield, the champion among the billiardists, has arrived in town, the Jewish papers will not fail to announce it, that the famous Jewish billiard player, the greatest among great, is among us, and we all feel proud of him for he is our brother and sheds so much glory upon Judaism.</p>
   <p>In this wise the Jewish papers lay unbecomingly, improperly, yes, dangerously particular stress upon the Jewdom of their heroes, not considering that they thereby nourish, and to a certain extent justify, an anti-Semitic feeling among the non-Jews in whose midst we live. Sometimes they come out, loudly and vehemently against certain of the daily papers, which had been so inconsiderate as to mention in their news columns that the"Jews" N. N. had been fined by the police-judge for having done some unlawful act. Yes, then our brethren of the quill become valiant champions and <span class="page-break">6</span>defenders of Judaism. Then they protest. Then they cry out against unjust discrimination. Then they raise their voice in great indignation and call unto the editors of such papers - Why do you mention "the Jew" in such connection? Why do you not state the religion of non-Jewish offenders? Why do you avoid saying that the Congregationalist Brown was sent to the penitentiary for having committeed a robbery and that the Presbyterian Green was committed to the jail for having been disorderly on the street? But, gentlemen of the Jewish press, would it not be well that you first would take the beams from your own eyes before you notice the mote in the eyes of others? Are there not some among you who, instead of helping to take down the social, commercial and other partition walls which divide Jews from non-Jews, make the foundation of these walls more solid, their thickness more thick, their height still higher, and who, by their no doubt great influence, isolate the Jew more and more? Cease then, first of all, making of your papers, Jewish society-papers, and raise them to the dignity of Jewish religious papers. Remain within bounds of propriety in your praising and lauding the Jews - not as confessors of the Jewish religion, <span class="page-break">7</span>but as members of the Jewish race - up to the seventh heaven. Then and then only, you have a right to call your gentile co-laborers in the newspaper field to order, when they mention "the Jew" so-and-so was fined for unbecoming conduct or sentenced for some criminal act committed by him.</p>
   <p>Let us return. What do our Jewish clubs and societies mean by the term Jew? How do they understand the word and how do they construe the paragraphs in their constitutions and laws in which the word occurs? When they have an application of a candidate for admission to decide upon, will they investigate what the religious opinions of the applicant are? No, in their eyes a Jew by birth, a racial Jew, is a Jew; if they consider the applicant otherwise worthy of admission they admit him, if not, not. And thus we might proceed and furnish more proofs or the truth of the fact that in actual life the word Jew is used to designate one of the Hebrew race. We might remind the readers that our Jewish Relief Association endeavors to assist and raise up the poor ones of our race; that the Alliance Israelite aims at helping and lifting, mentally and materially, the suffering ones of our race wherever they are; and that our noble and liberal philanthropists, men like Moses Montefiore, Baron Hirsch, Jacob H. Schiff, and others <span class="page-break">8</span>like them, act as they do act out of sympathy for the thousands of oppressed and suffering members of the Jewish race, and so forth. We might furthermore point to the fact that even our Jewish burial societies which have a quasi religious or semi-religious character - would not and could not refuse burial in their cemeteries to any deceased member upon the plea that he was an infidel or had been disregarding certain religious duties. I hope my readers will not misunderstand me. Of existing facts, I do not speak; what actually is, I merely report, and not of what should be do I draw a picture. The Jewish community should be a community of the most noble ones, of the most moral ones, of the most sincere ones in the human family: A community of such, only, and in which the wicked and the base and insincere should not be found; - an invincible church of the truly chosen people, not limited by racial or ecclesiastical limitations and not kept together by accidents of birth or other circumstances, but united by the spirit of true religion and by the firm striving after hallowing and elevating the lives of individuals and the life of society. Thus it should be.</p>
   <span class="page-break">9</span>
   <p>Thus the prophets saw in their grand visions the ideal world of the distant future. It should be so, - but is it so? As to our Jewish people, we cannot but repeat it, that actually we are more of a race than an idealistic religious community.</p>
   <p>We have thus far spoken of the sense in which "Jew" is taken in our present times. Let us now, secondly, ask - How was the word understood in past times? How the gentile world understood it is well enough known to every student of history. But so much is to be admitted that formerly, in the eyes of the gentiles, race and religion were more indissolubly connected than is the case in the present age. But how was it with the Jews themselves? And here we find that the Jews themselves had had, since two-thousand years and more, one and the same answer to the question - Who is a Jew? A Jew is a Jew by birth; a Jew is one who belongs to the race of the Jews; and a Jew is he who is "of the seed of our patriarch Abraham" in his religious opinion and conduct; he may be largely divining from what is generally accepted, he may be an outspoken heretic but he is a Jew nevertheless; he is then a sinful Jew.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>The matter however deserves a more minute study. Let us then examine the authorities, let us see what the old established laws of Judaism have been in this regard. When so doing, we will find the following to have been the regulating principles and rules:</p>
   <p>1. Where a Jew has entered into a valid and legally admissible matrimonial union, the status of the child is that of the father. Thus for instance, if the father is a "Levite" the child is a Levite; if the father is an "Yisraeli," the child is Yisraeli; in short, the child is a Jew if it is the off-spring of a legally married couple, and if the father is or has been a Jew.</p>
   <p>2. With a Gentile woman, no legally admissible marriage could, under the ancient laws, be concluded. The off-spring of a union between a Jew and non-Jewess followed the status of the mother, and were therefore considered Gentiles.</p>
   <p>3. The off-spring of a Jewess were under all circumstances considered as <span class="page-break">11</span>Jews. (In case the Jewish mother was legally wedded to a Jewish husband, the off-spring were most certainly recognized as Jews; but not for the reason that the mother was a Jewess, but because the father was a Jew.)</p>
   <p>4. Another legal rule of the Synagogue was - Once a Jew always a Jew. The Synagogue claimed, therefore, the apostate as a Jew, despite his having disconnected himself from the Synagogue. This seems strange to a man of modern times and with modern ideas, yet it is so. And, therefore, marriages between a male Israelite and an apostate Jewess, or between an apostate Jew and a perfect Jewess, were considered to be valid and legally admissible, and the off-spring of such marriages had the status of Jews. Therefore, a so-called Cohen had to remain distant from the corpse or the grave of an apostate Jew, just as from that of a faithful Jew. Therefore, also, a law-abiding Jew was not allowed to sell prohibited food to an apostate, or to offer to him leavened bread on Passover, or to cause him to do any work on the Jewish Sabbath, etc. For if he, the Jew, would have done so, he would have exposed himself as one who led his brother Jew upon the ways of sinfulness.</p>
   <span class="page-break">12</span>
   <p>5. Besides these "Jews," who according to the old laws, were born as such, the laws recognized also those as "Jews" who were accepted into the fold of Judaism as proselytes. They had, so to say, emigrated from Gentiledom, had immigrated into Jewdom and had been naturalized therein.</p>
   <p>The question now arises, can all these ancient ecclesiastical laws, all these old rules and regulations, which originated in times long gone by, still be maintained? Ought all of them be maintained? In this regard, I would say:</p>
   <p>1. The off-spring of Jewish parents should, in our present times too prima facie, be considered as Jews.</p>
   <p>2. In case of a Jew having legally wedded a non-Jewess in accordance with the laws of the state in which he resides, or a Jewess having legally married a non-Jew, such matrimonial union should be considered as perfectly valid by Jewish Rabbis and congregations, as well as by the state, and the children in such families, if so desired by the parents, should be <span class="page-break">13</span>recognized as Jews, or if the child grows up and wishes honestly to be recognized as a Jew, his wishes should be granted.</p>
   <p>3. As the rule - Once a Jew always a Jew - Israelites in our present age will declare this rule to be absurd and untenable. Professor Neander Kirchenrath Stahl, Abbe Ratisbonne, and others, had by birth been Jews. But they left the Jewish community, they emigrated from it, they joined some Christian denominations, and became even, strong pillars of the church which they had joined. Could now the Synagogue really and rationally claim them as Jews, because they had been born Jews? Nonsense! And so would undoubtedly Paul Heyse, one of the best and of the most eminent among the living German poets and novelists, find it highly amusing and ludicrous if some orthodox Jewish Rabbi would approach him and say, "Professor Heyse, you are a Jew!" "Probably you don't know it, nevertheless, you are a Jew." "I, a Jew?" "How so?" "Well, Professor, was not your mother's name Julia nee Saalling? And was not this Julia by birth a Jewess?" "And because your mother was a Jewess, therefore you are a Jew. For such is our Talmudical Law!" Certainly this maxim in the old ecclesiastical Jewish <span class="page-break">14</span>law is in our days - I do not hesitate to repeat it - to a large extent nonsense. It is at least untenable in our present time. And practically all the orthodox Jews themselves have given it up. Even our strictest Russian Jews in New York, or Chicago, or elsewhere would refuse to count an apostate among the required minyan (religious quorum) and to hold a public divine service with nine genuine Jews and one apostate. Who has left us, has left us.</p>
   <p>4. Proselytes, this is self understood, are to be considered as perfect Jews, and they have the same rights and claims which Jews have who are born as such. A declaration of believing in certain definite articles of faith should not be required in order to be admitted into the Jewish community or to be recognized as a "Yehudi." This should be the rule not only in regard to proselytes, but also in regard to native Jews. Perfect doctrinal freedom was granted in ancient Judaism, and the new Judaism should certainly not give up that bright jewel in the crown of old Judaism, should not create a mental thraldom for those who adhere to it. It is of course superfluous to remark that it is expected of every "Jew" that he believe in the existence <span class="page-break">15</span>of a Supreme Being, of a Holy God. Such a belief is to be presumed, however, as self understood in every Israelite, and an inquisitorial research in such matter must never be thought of in Israel. It was formerly expected that the Jew by birth as well as by adoption (the proselyte) would obey "the laws" but doctrinal tests were never applied. No "confession of faith" was required in order to remain in good standing with the Synagogue. In this regard the largest latitude was allowed to the Jew. In his theories and opinions, even a teacher of Judaism might have gone as far as be liked, as long as he did not practically disobey any of "the laws" or did not cause any other Israelite to disregard "the laws." Only if in consequence of his teaching, the law was really disobeyed, he became a Zaken mamreh, a "rebellious teacher," and was as such subject to punishment. And so was any Jew liable to be punished by the Synagogue, if he transgressed any of the laws of Judaism. But a "Jew" he remained, despite his transgressions. Excommunicated he could never be. The Herem (ritualistic excommunication) of old was essentially different from the "excommunication" of the Christian churches.</p>
   <span class="page-break">16</span>
   <p>En passant I may be allowed here to add that I think it very improper to ask confirmants that they should solemnly vow ever to remain faithful to them. Furthermore, it is very improper, aye, un-Jewish, to pronounce after the confirmation rite, the confirmants as having now been admitted into the sacred covenant of Judaism by this ceremony of their confirmation. For they were already admitted into this covenant by their birth. This was old Jewish doctrine, and it is, if properly understood, a sound Jewish doctrine.</p>
   <p>In summing up, we can be brief. We need but state that a Jew is a Jew in consequence of his birth, or in consequence of his formal application and adoption, and that he remains a Jew so long as he does not openly and unmistakably separate himself from the Jewish community. To no one should be denied the name of "Jew" who honestly maintains and believes that he stands upon Jewish grounds and that his whole religious life and that all his religious views are rooted in Jewish grounds and have grown up from Jewish germs.</p>
