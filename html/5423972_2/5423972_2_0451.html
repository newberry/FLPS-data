   <p>The American Jewish Congress is considering the advisability of calling a Midwestern conference here in the near future for the purpose of weighing and acting upon a number of pressing Jewish problems. These problems are both domestic and foreign, including such as the combatting of objectionable immigration legislation, now pending, and the aid of Jewish refugees in Europe, whose situation is critical.</p>
   <p>Congressman Johnson's bill, now before Congress is viciously efficacious in its effect, which is quite obviously calculated to exclude immigrants from countries from which most of our Jewish influx has been coming. No true American Jew wants to have legislation enacted which embodies special favoritism to those of his own blood, but neither does he want it specially doctored to react against them. If the United States cannot absorb more aliens at this time, let Congress act to keep them out, but for our own self respect and in duty to our own, we ought to fight this activity of pretending patriots who imply that immigrants from certain countries are desirable, while for those from others (largely Jews) we have no room.</p>
   
   <p>As to the case of the war victims of Europe, it is well known, if not appreciated, that their plight is as bad as ever, if not worse. From reliable reports, such as those of Dr. Nansen and other impartial observers, the liquidation of the Joint Distribution Committee comes at a very inopportune time. What will avail all its splendid work in the past if now the derelict masses of Eastern Europe are left to starve? The Jews of America must not desert them now.</p>
   <p>To consider such grave problems as these, a Midwestern conference would not be amiss. The public may be jaded by years of talk of famine, cold, and disease, but the millions in stricken Europe suffering these horrors are much more fed up on them than we who have been merely talking about it, or at best, giving a little of our surplus.</p>
