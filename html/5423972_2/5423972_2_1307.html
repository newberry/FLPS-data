   <p>For about fifty years now, we have been clamoring for the unification of Jewish charitable organizations. There are many instances when immediate aid is necessary and not forthcoming because our Jewish charitable agencies are not functioning properly. The old practice of hand to hand charity has long proven itself to be outmoded.</p>
   <p>Our previous crusades for the unification of charitable institutions were perhaps a bit premature. Our people were not ready for it. Now, however, with the growth of our community and its institutions, we feel that the time is at hand to effect this great step forward. Let us not hesitate or let factional differences deter us. Let us do it now.</p>
