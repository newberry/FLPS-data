   <p>Is the Mount Sinai Hospital a charity institution or not? Of course, it is a charity institution for sick people who can afford to pay the full price but do not and for the physicians of the staff to have their patients there. The hospital is not a big one and is fully occupied most of the time. A poor man is very seldom accepted there as a patient, but the managers, just the same, come with pretensions to the Jewish Charities and demand money; otherwise they threaten either to sever their connection with the [United Jewish] Charities and be on their own, or to close the institution entirely so that the sick Jews of Chicago will remain without kosher food.</p>
   <p>Many complaints, oral and written, have been made to this office about the <span class="page-break">\2</span>injustices of the Mount Sinai Hospital. The president and other officers of the institution always found excuses for the complaints. On Wednesday, March 12, however, something happened which compels us to bring into the open the status of the Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
   <p>A poor Jewish peddler had a swelling on his right foot caused by the toe rubbing against the shoe. The swelling grew and grew. He needed hospital treatment. A friend took pity upon the poor fellow and, after a telephone conversation with the office of the kosher hospital, gave him a note to the hospital and sent him there in a taxi. The poor man turned the note over to the office and sat down to wait. He waited and waited. His foot pained him greatly. The pain tore and pulled at his leg. The poor man is by nature a quiet, peaceful fellow, not an arrogant beggar. He controlled himself with all his might; did not moan and did not protest against the long waiting.</p>
   <p>Finally about twelve o'clock, two whole hours later, a girl came to him and said: "Mister, we have no place. Leave us your telephone number and go home.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>We will call you up." As if he had come there to ask for a job!</p>
   <p>The sick man, bent with pain, leaning upon a stick could hardly drag himself to the streetcar. The conductor, a Gentile, not only helped him to enter into the car, but let him ride free and gave him a transfer. The poor man was not even asked by the kosher hospital whether he had carfare.</p>
   <p>To make a long story short, his pains became unbearable and he was taken to the County Hospital, which took him in without many questions being asked. It was already nightime by then.</p>
   <p>His blood became poisoned. The toe became black and the blackness began to spread over the foot. The doctors at the County Hospital first cauterized the toe, then a part of the foot. The poor Jewish peddler is now near death, if he has not already died while these lines were written.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"Why was not this man brought to the hospital before? All he needed was a cleaning. He would not be now in this condition and a life could have been saved," the doctor at the Cook County Hospital exclaimed excitedly.</p>
   <p>How can we tell the doctor that we have a Jewish Mount Sinai Hospital in Chicago, which has no place for poor Jews! It would be like spitting at ourselves. The doctor was begged to do everything possible to save the poor Jewish peddler. The doctor tried hard, but....</p>
   <p>The poor Jewish peddler is dying because they did not want to give him a little space at the Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Charities have an active worker, Mr. Louis Cohen, whose job is to investigate all of our institutions, to see which of them can be dispensed with, curtailed, and which need enlargement and improvement. Gratitude of Jewish Chicago awaits Mr. Cohen if, for a short while, he will lay aside all his other work and devote himself to investigate the Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
