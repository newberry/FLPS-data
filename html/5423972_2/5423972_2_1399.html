   <p>The charge has been made that a dozen years ago, when Mr. Julius Rosenthal was a candidate on the Republican judicial ticket, Mr. Louis Hutt said he would not vote for him because he "was a Jew." Mr. Hutt stated under his signature that he has no recollection of saying anything of the kind. It is certain he voted for Mr. Rosenthal, so if he did say what is alleged, he changed his mind. The ticket was weighed down by the name of Charles Reed and was defeated badly.</p>
   <p>The Democrats are telling those Jews who are in the habit of voting the Republican ticket that they should "knife" Hutt for his alleged affront to their race. This seems on the face of it a very silly proposition. Broad-minded men do not cherish such small grudges so long.</p>
   <p>But is it not a dangerous as well as a silly suggestion? Supposing it were understood that this advice of "knifing" would be taken and Mr. Hutt should be defeated in consequence. His friends would say at once the Jewish vote did it. Mr. Hutt is German. He has many thousands of friends among that nationality. Of the fifty <span class="page-break">\2</span>or sixty thousand or more votes he will poll, a third will be cast by German-Americans. In case of his defeat how will those 20,000 Germans feel toward future Jewish canditates for office? Jews are as ambitions to fill offices as other people. Two of them are on the Democratic ticket now. But how many will be elected hereafter if the Germans pass the word down the line "knife all Jews," for they stabbed Louis Hutt?</p>
   <p>It must be remembered also that while Louis Hutt personally is a broad-minded, liberal man, with nothing of narrowness about him, there are among some of the Germans, though domiciled here for years, traces of "Judenhetze" which is strong in Germany. Do the Jews of Chicago think it prudent to blow on the half extinguished embers of that hate and fan it into life again? Will it not be their wisest course to vote just as they would have voted had another than Mr. Hutt been the Republican nominee for County Treasurer? They have everything to lose and nothing to gain by awakening animosities among the Germans for which there should be no place in America.</p>
