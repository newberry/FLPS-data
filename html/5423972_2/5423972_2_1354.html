   <p>"Of all the grave problems which the world is facing to-day the greatest is the Jewish problem," said William E. Blacksone yesterday morning in the second day's session of the sixth annual conference of the Chicago Hebrew mission in Moody's church at La Salle Street and Chicago Avenue.</p>
   <p>At the afternoon meeting Mrs. T. C. Rounds, superintendent of the mission house, 22 Solon Place, spoke on "Our duty to the Jews and How We Are Trying to Repay It in Our Mission."</p>
   <p>She gave a short account of the history of the work, founded in Chicago twenty-one years ago with two workers, which force has now increased to eighteen. Some of the work done by the mission is represented in the following charities. A Kindergarten in which there are 200 pupils, an industrial school in which sewing is taught, lectures in Yiddish for older women, a day nursery and a rag carpet factory, where the women of the ghetto spend odd time sewing carpet rags.</p>
   <p>Efforts are now being made to raise money for a four-story brick building to be <span class="page-break">2</span>erected at 22 Solon Place. This is to cost $10,000 and will accommodate the chapel, industrial and relief departments and the day nursery.</p>
