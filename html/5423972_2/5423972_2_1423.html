   <p>The Levinsohn Literary Circle at its meeting in the Haymarket Building yesterday afternoon passed resolutions criticizing an interview in a newspaper alleged to have taken place with Rabbi Hirsch, in which the doctor was made to say that the Russian Jews of Chicago were anarchistic in their tendency and that there are in Chicago 50,000 Russian Jewish Anarchists.</p>
   <p>The society pronounced this statement as ridiculous, and was strong in emphasizing the fact that the Jews - and no less the Russian Jews - were as patriotic as any race in this country. Other statements in the interview of a like nature were also condemned and declared wrong.</p>
