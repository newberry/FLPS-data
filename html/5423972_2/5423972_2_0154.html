   <p>It seems to me that the whole Ma-oth Hitim work in Chicago is mismanaged. [Translator's note: Ma-oth Hitim--practice of giving Passover food supplies to the needy.] Each synagogue has its own Ma-oth Hitim committee and it does not care what the other synagogues are doing. Mr. Henok writes to me from the Northwest Side that chaos reigns there in the Ma-oth Hitim work. There are seven synagogues on the Northwest Side and instead of uniting and working as a unit for Ma-oth Hitim, each one works separately, and one does not know what the other is doing. It seems that there are no politics in giving Ma-oth Hitim. Why then cannot those seven synagogues unite into one big Ma-oth Hitim committee, to collect and disburse the monies as a unit and thus save work, energy, and money?</p>
   <p>If on the Northwest Side there can exist a Council of Jewish Affairs, then there can also exist a united Ma-oth Hitim committee.</p>
