   <p>The Sears-Roebuck Y. M. C. A. has invited Rabbi Leon Fram of Temple Judea to conduct a Bible class composed of Christians and Jews.</p>
   <p>This is the first time in Chicago and perhaps in all America, that a rabbi has been asked to hold a Bible class under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A. It is an evidence of broad-mindedness in which Gentile and Jew might well rejoice.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Fram received the Rabbinical degree in 1920 and has been the spiritual leader of Temple Judea since his graduation from the Hebrew Union College.</p>
