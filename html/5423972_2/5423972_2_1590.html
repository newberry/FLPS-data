   <p>At a time when the women of Chicago, who are campaigning against the high cost of eggs, are boasting of a victory, John B. Mitchell, president of the Chicago Butter and Egg Board, announced that present weather conditions will boost the price of eggs much higher.</p>
   <p>It is being said that the boycott was used to conceal a condition of scarcity in eggs, and according to rumor it is thought impossible that farmers will offer eggs at thirty cents a dozen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Harry A. Lipsky, member of the Board of Education, believes that school children should cooperate in this boycott against the high price of eggs. The students eat their mid-day meal in various school lunchrooms. It is the Jewish student especially that eats mostly the egg sandwich. The high price of eggs has increased the price of the egg sandwich.</p>
   <p>If all Jewish students will cooperate in the boycott, it will, to some extent, help in this struggle to lower the price.</p>
   
   <p>The Clean Food Club stated yesterday that many organizations have joined the boycott under the Chicago Women's Aid, of which Mrs. Moses L. Porvin is president, with a membership of 10,000 Jewish women.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Ignatz Rice, president of Chicago Council of Jewish Women, reported yesterday that her organization takes an active part in the boycott.</p>
