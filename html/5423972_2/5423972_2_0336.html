   <p>On Sunday last, County Commissioner Kallis distributed 5,000 pounds of unleavened bread, from his residence, 511 S. Jefferson street, to the destitute Jews of his district. It was estimated that 500 families, representing about 3,500 persons, applied for relief. Each person supplied, received from fifteen to twenty pounds of matzos.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kallis has been very active during the Winter in relieving the distress of the poor, and undertook to help the poor of the people in celebrating Passover by providing as much unleavened bread as possible at his own expense. The commendation of all Jews and charitable people should be extended to Mr. Kallis.</p>
