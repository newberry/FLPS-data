   <p>On this New Year our accounts with Heaven for the past year have just come to a close. With pounding hearts and shaking knees we stood and prayed for forgiveness of our sins, and made strong promises that from now on we would be better people to ourselves, our God, and our fellowmen. From our eyes are hidden the Heavenly books of account. We do not know the balance contained therein and therefore do not know how our figures will correspond with that Highest Tribunal where no protection, excuses, or bribes can alter the verdict issued from the judge's chair of the Almighty.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Nevertheless, in spite of this uncertainty one feels at peace with Heaven and sure of himself. One knows that the Heavenly Tribunal is not like an earthly one, where the defendant is sought to be punished at any price and where, when there is no direct evidence, indirect methods are used, even leading to casualities to force the truth of justice. But, much different is the Heavenly form of justice. Here sentence is meted out indiscriminately. In Heaven's court are known not only one's every hidden deed and misdeed, but, also the causes and reasons that make man do one or the other. This court does not seek to punish man. It wishes only that man repent, alter his course, purify his soul, avoid bad habits, and cultivate the good of truth and justice.....</p>

   <p>Knowing these relations between Heaven and Earth, the bonds of Heaven's justice as pertaining to man, one feels unafraid and confident, especially after the close of the Heavenly books of personal account, to face the coming year of turmoil and strife in the path of life.</p>
   <p>But there are other accounts we have with our fellowmen - people of the earth. It is noteworthy to pry into these dealings with our fellowmen. But here the situation is not so encouraging.</p>
   <p>When we stop to observe how justice is administered to us (Jews) here on earth it makes us sad and unhappy. We roam from land to land, from country to country, meeting everywhere the same dark colors, the same tragic tones, the same gloomy echoes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Full of grief are our six million brothers burdened under the weight of law restrictions, treacheries and suppressions. Not an ounce of enlightenment occurred during the entire year, and this same dark inheritance is now carried by the New Year. Again we shall hear of disturbances and persecutions. Again we shall read of traitors, hear cries, see streams of blood and tears. The low, inexcusable blood lie against us, is again on the roll call. It is from those that do us most harm. They accuse us of crimes they commit against us, and the world stands by in silence. Thus a dark shadow spreads and dims the world's lights, covering the bright light of world justice.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>We go from Russia to Russian Poland. That unstable country which is being torn apart by the claws of the Russian eagle, also presents the same dark picture, the same hatred and hostility against us, the same gruesomeness. They, the oppressed and exiled Poles, have signed a treaty with their executioners. Both wish to annihilate us, to wipe us out completely. There will come a day of historical revenge, where they shall dearly pay for their deeds against us. One cannot buy happiness on the score of another's unhappiness. In the meantime stormy winds blow, spreading the dark clouds and marring our happiness.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>From Poland We Go Over To Austria.</p>
   <p>There, too, we hear the same tragic song, see the same dark shadows. In Galitzia there is the propaganda of a boycott against Jews. Here the economic condition gets increasingly worse and the political situation is very weak. There had been hopes that through the faithful Jewish politicians these conditions would be improved. But this illusion also faded.</p>
   <p>Roumania and Turkey, Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria present the same dark picture.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>As an exception we have, at present the American republic. Here too we have some dark signs of evil omens which should not be overlooked. We can never tell what proportions these forerunners of darkness may in time assume. Such are our earthly accounts. Not a very happy description. We cannot feel much happiness and security, since we Jews are being constantly persecuted.</p>
