   <p>The International Tailoring Company challenged the Amalgamated by the lockout for the cutters.</p>
   <p>When the cutters came to work, yesterday morning, they were told to go home, that the firm no longer needs their services.</p>
   <p>The reason of this lockout is because the cutters are all members of the Amalgamated, and as organized workers they demanded a $3.00 raise in pay. The Amalgamated is taking up the battle against that firm.</p>
   <p>The cutters immediately brought this report to the headquarters of local 61, where a meeting was held. Frank Rosenblatt and S. Risman addressed the locked out cutters and assured them that the Amalgamated will battle with all their strength and energy to win this shop for the Amalgamated.</p>
