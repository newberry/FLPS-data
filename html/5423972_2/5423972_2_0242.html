   <p>Among us Jews the stool pigeon has always been more despised than all criminals and uglier than all creeping creatures. This miserable creature, the stool pigeon, the spy, the prevaricator, has always been a plague of leprosy preying upon the Jewish body and the body of humanity. Even in his prayers, the Jew does not forget to mention him with a curse.</p>
   <p>Anybody acquainted with Jewish history knows that stool pigeons have always been the cause of a nation's misfortunes. On account of an indecorous and mean betrayal by a Jew, the Greeks in the time of Octavius the Tyrant invaded Jerusalem and slaughtered thousands of Jews. As the consequence of a similar betrayal, the Jews lost their land, and their last rebellion was crushed by the swords of the Romans.</p>
   <p>But we need not look into the past to see the ugly image and worthless character of the stool pigeon. Much to our regret, we have recently seen him in the Czar's <span class="page-break">2</span>regime, in which he deceived us in every way. Like an obscure shadow, he followed us, lurking his way into our hiding places by pretending to be a sentimental comrade ready to agree and sympathize with us, and then turning around to report everything we did to the police. How many victims have these stool pigeons, spies and prevaricators led to destruction! On their account thousands of our finest, most able, and noblest men have been driven to Siberia, there to be imprisoned or led to the gallows to exhale their last breath.</p>
   <p>All this is history now. The curse upon the Jewish and non-Jewish stool pigeons is now being realized. The abhorrent and loathesome stool pigeons, spies and prevaricators are now being, one by one, exposed in Russia and persecuted accordingly. Their place will now be in the dark prisons, where their lives will languish in forgotten memories.</p>
   <p>But lo and behold! Now when the reactionary role of the stool pigeons has ceased in Russia it is being revived, much to our regret, in our country. As soon as the right of free speech and free press was threatened in this country, these vile creatures, the stool pigeons, spies and prevaricators <span class="page-break">3</span>came out from the rat holes where they had nursed on mud and filth their entire life, and began to betray to the Federal Government, everyone wishing to express his thoughts and sentiments freely.</p>
   <p>That well-known miserable Chicago Jewish stool pigeon, spy, and pervaricator who squealed on the writer of these lines before high officials of the Federal Government, because, he dared to depict with black dye the horrors of war and implant into the hearts of our Jewish citizens peace and love for our country and our flag, is no more than a deceiver, a swindler, a counterfeiter who would sell by denunciation and prevarication our country and our flag to the enemy for a few measly pennies, just as he wished to sell the writer of this column.</p>
   <p>Hiding behind the mask of a patriot, the stool pigeon who wanted to put this writer on the spot would like to see every free spirit hampered and annihilated. However the worthless character of the stool pigeon is well known to every private citizen, as well as to the high officials of the government. The names of the Kaplinskys and the Ozeffs, who drew money from the revolutionary funds and from the government, were revealed. They were false to the government which employed them as spies, as well as to their supposedly revolutionary comrades.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>They exposed revolutionaries, who were hanged on the gallows, and at the same time they assailed the government officials.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Jewish stool pigeon is also a miserable creature. He would sell out his nation, creed, and land for a meager sum; he is an ugly creature that only breeds hatred in the world, exactly as the rat carries an epidemic from city to city, from country to country. Everybody detests and avoids him; nobody wants to be in his presence. Jews curse him in their prayers three times daily.</p>
   <p>In conclusion we wish to turn to the spy and say, Stool pigeon, spy and prevaricator! Translate this article, if you can't employ someone else, for the high government officials, and let them know what we think about a creature such as you!</p>
