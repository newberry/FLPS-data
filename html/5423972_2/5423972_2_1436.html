   <p>Friday evening last, September 21, 1888, the Russian Society of Ethics and Culture, gave a representation and ball at West 12th Street Turner Hall, which was largely attended by Jewish denizens in that vicinity.</p>
   <p>The "Poor Peddler," a one act drama, was spoken in a Jargon. A Mr. Weinberg spoke on Ethis and Miss Burkhardt sang some pretty ballads. We saw or heard but little of Ethics and Culture at the ball, the play was decidedly unethical, while the culture of the "gallerygods" acted more like cossack fiends, stamping, yelling, whistling, smoking, spitting and hooting as the lowest of Arabs.</p>
