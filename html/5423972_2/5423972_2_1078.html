   <p>The Anti-Semitism prevailing in America is largely imported. The American Christian is not Gentile enough to be a real Anti-Semite. Practically all of the prevailing Anti-Semitism is centered around the immigrants who have recently come from the German and Balkan countries. This imported Anti-Semitism eventually disintegrates in the great American melting pot - the public schools.</p>
   <p>It is only naturaly that, among the Gentile children of foreign parents, who attend their own national schools, there will be a great deal of enmity towards the Jews for another generation. By refraining from the process of Americanization they can not clean the filth in which their ancestors were embedded for the past two thousand years, and the ugly blotches will remain on their souls until time itself purifies it.</p>

   <p>If there is no racial Anti-Semitism in America, there is, however, a natural Chauvinism which makes one look upon a foreigner as lower than himself, whom one should not want to meet or associate with, nor include in his social life. But this Chauvinism is not specifically directed at Jews - it is intended for all foreigners. But the Jew who has a high degree of pride, accepts this natural Chauvinism as Anti-Semitism. Jews, upon finding out that a certain American club bars Jews from membership, do not want to find out whether the same club would admit a Pole or Bohemian, and they blame it on public Anti-Semitism.</p>
   <p>The protest against such Anti-Semitism is periodic. There is a variety of Anti-Semitism - summer Anti-Semitism; spring Anti-Semitism; fall Anti-Semitism; and winter Anti-Semitism. In spring, when people contemplate moving into new flats there are districts that bar Jews from renting homes; summer is stirred up with Anti-Semitic summer resorts; in autumn, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>political rivals who profess to be antagonistic toward Jews, can be found in large numbers; in winter, there are, no doubt, little Anti-Semites who are in search of Jewish heads at which to throw snow-balls.</p>
   <p>It is only natural, then, that the newly-arrived immigrant Jew sees more Anti-Semitism in this natural Chauvinism, and the longer he resides in this country the more he becomes accustomed to conditions, traditions and people of his environments, the better understanding he acquires of the non-Jew. A Jewish proprietor of a summer resort who specializes in Jewish trade, who brags about his Jewish cooking and his veranda where pinochle is played, does not want to cater to a Gentile lodger. Not because the resort keeper is a hypocrite or bears any prejudice against the Gentile, but because the Gentile is not adapted to the crowd.</p>

   <p>A Jewish landlord possessing a large apartment house occupied by Jews, does not want to rent a suite of rooms to a Gentile. Jewish children throw snow-balls at Italian or Greek peddlers, and Jewish candidates rally their main campaigns in Jewish districts, where they are better understood and better known and where they get more sympathy.</p>
   <p>The reason we no longer hear the usual periodical protest against Anti-Semitic resort-keepers who do not wish to admit Jews is not because these summer resorts are vanishing, but because the Jews have become more acclimatized to the surroundings.</p>
   <p>They have a better understanding of these things; They do not wish to crowd themselves into districts and places where they are not welcome. They seek contentment among their own, where they can adapt themselves.</p>
