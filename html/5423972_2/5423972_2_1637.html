   <p>Tonight, at 7:30 P.M., at the Odd Fellows Hall, 3337 South State Street, all Jewish storekeepers on the South Side will meet to discuss together ways and means of protecting their interests.</p>
   <p>This meeting is being called by the State Street Businessmen's Protective Association, which was organized last week and is founded on a number of important principles.</p>
   <p>One of the most important reasons for the existence of the association is the excessive damage, sustained by many businessmen of that neighborhood during the race riots, when a number of Jewish stores were robbed.</p>
   <p>Today's meeting is, therefore, thought to be a very important one for the Jewish businessmen of that neighborhood. It is expected that all of them will attend, in order to participate in the proceedings.</p>
