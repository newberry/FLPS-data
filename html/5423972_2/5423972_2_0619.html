   <p>It is often interesting to observe not only how the Jewish mind works but how its activity and movement affect the non-Jewish world, and how again the reaction caused by the movements or the Jewish mind in turn affect Jewish life.</p>
   <p>The Jewish mind has a mechanism of its own and the qualities and features are individual and striking. It is often self-contradictory. The Jewish mind is critical and skeptical but at the same time optimistic, it is elegiac and at the same time full of virility. It tends to extremes. The sages of the Talmud already knew that the Jews loved the parable, the paradoxical and were inclined to exaggerate matters. We are in the main a subjective and an individualistic people. And queer enough this individualistic people has produced Karl Marx, the murderer of individualism. This ultra-subjective people produced Ferdinand Lasalle, the founder of social democracy in Europe. The Jews, a monotheistic people, have <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>produced a Spinoza, the philosopher of Pantheism and we, the conservative and often only too conservative people always produced men and women who head revolutionary movements, and revolutionary tendencies in art, literature and science, philosophy and statesmanship. Since the days of Philo of Alexandria and of St. Paul, Jews have always been leaders of the great revolutionary tendencies of history.</p>
   <p>The movements of the Jewish mind because of its unique peculiarities are naturally apt to cause reactions, to invite opposition and to call forth the strongest contradictions and the fact is that whenever a great representative of the Jewish mind appears, one can already see in the background dark figures with faces expressing ire and anger! We dare say that we pay more for every great individuality we produce than any other people does. We pay with the blood of the masses and the wealth of our classes.</p>
   <p>Our mind works differently than theirs. They call it revolutionary and destructive though the appearance of every great Jew has always proved to be a milestone in the history of human progress. We have acquired the reputation of producing <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>destructive elements and the Gentile world calls us to accountability for our so-called destructive minds. A few illustrations will suffice to prove this sufficiently.</p>
   <p>Baruch Spinoza has largely contributed to the undermining of dogmatic and historical religion. The effects of his teachings on the synagogue have not been less disastrous than on the church. The synagogue to prove its negative attitude to Spinoza, excommunicated him, but for more than a hundred years we have been made to suffer for Spinoza. In the history of anti-Semitic propaganda in the eighteenth century, the chapter Spinoza is the greatest and to the present day we have not yet expiated for Spinoza's "crime". Immanuel Kant's hatred against the Jews can be traced to his bitter opposition to Spinoza and all the anti-Semitic propagandists in Germany to the present day present Kant as their state witness against Jews. Kant is saint of all the German nationalists. They may not know nothing about Kant's philosophy but they know that Kant hated the Jews and Judaism. Whenever they need his testimony against the Jews, they exhume and present him before the bar of public <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>opinion. However, Kant is only one case in point. Throughout the latter half of the eighteenth century, the quarrel about Spinoza was in fact a quarrel about the Jews. Spinoza had provoked all the reactionary forces of the church and all the religious bigots. Instead of trying to refute Spinoza's doctrine, they picked up the quarrel with the Jews, making the Jewish people responsible for the deeds of Spinoza.</p>
   <p>In the nineteenth century, history has witnessed many quarrels and disputes about the Jews which had their origin in the activities and achievements of certain Jewish personalities. The most disputed Jews in the nineteenth century are Ludwig Boerne, Henrich Heine, Karl Marx, and Ferdinand Lasalle. In the anti-Semitic bookkeeping, we have all these four men on the debit side and to the present day, the reaction these great Jews have caused can be felt. Nor have we reason to believe that this reaction will die out soon. Ludwig Boerne, one of the greatest German prose writers, was the advocate of democracy and republicanism. He had nothing to do with Jews and Judaism, for he actually embraced Christianity while still a young man and never returned to the fold. His entire <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>life was dedicated to the political uplift and purification of Germany. He was a great German patriot. But still having been a Jew by race, his mind had all the characteristics of the Jew. His sarcasm, his sharp analysis, his biting criticism, his peculiar satire, can be spoken of as typically Jewish. It was of course the patriot Boerne who made himself immortal in the history of Germany, but the great prose writer Berne who acquired immortality is the Jew Boerne. It was his Jewish mind and its expression that invited contradiction, hatred and opposition. In the third decade of the nineteenth century, Boerne's name in Germany aroused as much opposition and bitterness as Trotzky's name today and to avenge Berne's "crime" many a Jew was killed in Germany and after his life as the result of his influence of anti-Semitic propagandists, journalists and politicians, whose ire was aroused by the appearance of Ludwig Boerne.</p>
   <p>There is a library of anti-Heine publication in Germany and Austria. Not scores but hundreds of books have been written against Heine and the underlying idea of all these books is Heine, the Jew, Heine, the destructive mind, Heine, the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>anti-German, Heine, the parasite, etc. How many minds of innocent young men and women have been poisoned by these books against Heine? How many anti-Semitic agitators have been inspired by these books against the greatest of our poets and how many Jews had to lose their lives and their property because of the activities of these anti-Semitic propagandists whose ire was kindled by the appearance of Heine?</p>
   <p>But the reaction caused by the appearance of Boerne and Heine and its effect on Jewish life is infinitely small in comparison with the terrible reaction caused by the appearance of Karl Marx. Indirectly Karl Marx became the grave-digger of tens of thousands of Jews. Only recently two hundred thousand Jews have been murdered in the Ukraine. The slogan of the murderers was "Kill the Bolshevists". Bolshevism, so at least, the Bolsheviks assert, is applied Marxism. Intellectually, at least, Karl Marx represented the source of Bolshevism, and this source of Bolshevism became the source of misfortune and pain for million [s] of Jews. The ascendency of Bolshevism has naturally called forth many dark forces and anti-Semites everywhere, and entire nations have gone <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>mad with Jew-hatred. Ask a Pole why he hates the Jews [and he will tell you] because they are Bolsheviks. Ask a non-Bolshevik Russian, or a representative of any nationality in Central or Eastern Europe and he will tell [you] that he hates the Jews because they are responsible for radicalism, socialism, Bolshevism, etc. In his heart of hearts, he may know that the average Jew with whom he comes in daily contact is conservative, God-fearing, and law abiding and has nothing in common with radicalism. A Pole must be a lunatic to believe that the Chassidic Jew whom he meets every day is a radical but still the same Pole would kill all the Chassidic Jews only because Bolshevism can be traced to a Jew, Trotzky, who denies his Judaism and has divorced himself from Jewish life, has applied the teachings of Karl Marx to Russian life.</p>
   <p>It is still an unsettled question whether Bela Kuhn the leader of the Hungarian Bolsheviks, is a Jew or not. His friends claim he is not, the Hungarian reactionaries however, claim that he is and thousands of Jews in Hungary have been killed because of Bela Kuhn. Bavaria is rampant with anti-Semitism today because Eisner, the first Premier of Bavaria, was a Jew and a socialist. There are thousands of <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>socialists in Bavaria and there are Gentile socialists there who are more radical and more destructive than Eisner ever was. But Eisner was a Jew and therefore the Jews in Bavaria must suffer. In the realm of science, art, and literature we observe a similar play of forces. It is not so long ago that the public was surprised to learn through newspapers that Albert Einstein, the greatest living scientist and the discoverer of the theory of relativity, was threatened in public by university students at an open mass meeting. What was Einstein's crime? He is a great representative of the Jewish mind. He is a revolutionary mind in his own field of activity, in the field of physics and mathematics and Sir Oliver Lodge, the famous English scientist, although a man of moderate judgment and tactfulness, was not ashamed of calling Einstein a scientific Bolshevist and making him look as contemptible as possible. Those who believe that men like Einstein who is an abstract thinker and has nothing to do with politics at all, is on the credit side of the anti-Semitic bookkeeping are mistaken. He is also on the debit side, because he is expressive of the Jewish mind, thorough and cutting.</p>
   <p>Great Jewish artists like Bakst, Reinhart and Lieberman, who have revolutionized <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>art by their new ideas and new methods of work, who have thus inaugurated new chapters in the history of histrionic art, painting and scenic art, have also aroused as much ire and opposition, contradiction and anger among the Gentile artists as have the Jewish statesmen and Jewish economists and philosophers. So when the Jewish mind is active and in motion it causes terrible reactions and the reactions in turn not only affect Jewish life, but are very often responsible for the loss of hundreds of thousands of Jews. But when the Jewish mind is not active and does not participate in the progress of the world and is thrown back on its own resources and is confined within the narrow walls of the Ghetto as is still the case in many places in Eastern Europe or as was the case hundreds of years ago in Western Europe, they say that we are strangers in their midst and accuse us of being a mass of dead weight. This was the accusation leveled against us by men like Voltaire, and Herder. If we remain within our narrow walls, we are not good and if we get out in the street and take a part in general life, we are no good either. In the one case as in the other, we invite their contempt or their ire and the one as well as the other has often proved to be fatal to us. We are always moving in this vicious circle. And we <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>are always placed before the tragic alternative, and this we dare say is a very tragic fate of a people.</p>
