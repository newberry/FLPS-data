After all, the Zionist Socialists speak of the pure class character of their movement, of the difference between their politics and the politics of the Jewish bourgeois. They are only phrases that are in contradiction with their own theories.</p>
   <p>According to the theory of dis-organizing, a deep foundation must be created among the Jewish proletariate and the proletariats of other nations, because the Jewish workers are sinking lower and the workers of other nations are elevating themselves in the economic life. The various conditions must create different aims and different methods of struggle.</p>

   <p>The workers of other nations are pushing the Jewish workers from the production branches by the hatred between the Jewish workers and the workers of all other nations.</p>
   <p>The teaching of Zionist Socialists darkens the class consciousness of the Jewish workers and develops a mistrust in the Socialist movement and in his own class struggle.</p>
   <p>The International can cause much inconvenience by accepting the Zionist Socialists in their midsts.</p>
