   <p>Henry Ford's editorial writer of the Dearborn Independent seems to be as scholarly a man as his master, and his master is famous for his ignorance. Henry Ford's Dearborn Independent makes the following "intelligent" statement:</p>
   <p>"There is no such thing as anti-Semitism. In England, Germany, France, America, and Russia there is no anti-Arab sentiment of which anyone knows. None of the Semitic people have been distinguished by special dislike of any other people. There is no reason why anyone should dislike the Semites. It is very strange, however that the Semitic peoples should be a unit. Palestine, which still has only a handful of Jews, is peopled by Semites, who so thoroughly resemble the Jews that serious complications are threatening the Zionistic advance being made there. This surely is not anti-Semitism, <span class="page-break">\2</span>Semites against Semites, but they are at odds with the Jews."</p>
   <p>This crude and barbaric formulation of the thought is only a match to his nonsense and to the ignorance he exhibits. The assertion that none of the Semite people have been distinguished by special dislike by any other people, and the other assertion that the Semite people are united in their dislike of the Jews, are as true as the assurance given to the public by the same editorial writer, that the Jews are conspiring against white man's civilization. It seems that this pogrom agitator knows little history, for otherwise he would not maintain that none of the Semitic peoples had been distinguished by special dislike by other people.</p>
   <p>The Spaniards have fought for centuries against the Semites; first against the Arabs. After the Spaniards were through with the Arabs, they started their fight against the Jews, but the fight against both was actuated and determined by racial hatred. Europeans living in the Orient and coming in touch with Arabs, have as much use for them as anti-Semites have for Jews. Of course in Germany, <span class="page-break">\3</span>France, America, and Russia there are no Arabs and, consequently, they are not hated. But wherever and whenever Arabs and Aryans mingle together, the Aryans display not only animosity but hatred towards the former. Besides, the so-called scientific literature of the anti-Semitic scholars, as created in Germany and France, is based on the theory that the Semites are an inferior race, and all these so-called anti-Semitic scholars make it clear that they consider the Jews only part of the Semitic race. All the qualities they ascribe to the Jews they also ascribe to the Arabs.</p>
   <p>We refer the editorial writer of the Dearborn Independent to the works of Count Gobinau, Ernest Renan, and Houston Stewart Chamberlain. We need not go through the voluminous works of these anti-Semitic star writers to find that Jew and and Semite are not synonymous, for these anti-Semitic scholars state very plainly that the Jews are inferior to the Aryan peoples because the Jews are part and parcel of the Semitic race and the Semitic race consists of various nations and peoples. He will also find that, theoretically at least, the hatred of the <span class="page-break">\4</span>European anti-Semites is as much aimed at the Arabs as at the Jews.</p>
   <p>The second assertion of Henry Ford's editorial writer of the Dearborn Independent that the Semites hate the Jews, is a lie, pure and simple. The Semites, say the Arabs, hate or love the Jews as much as one Aryan nation loves the other Aryan nation. The Germans are Aryans and the French are Aryans, too; but still the French hate heartily the Germans, and the Germans hate the French. The same holds good among the other Aryan peoples. The fact that two people belong to the same racial unit does not necessarily mean that they must love one another. International relations are by no means determined by racial motives, but by political and economic motives. If an Arab finds that a Jew to whom he is racially related is instrumental in his economic development, he will love him; and if he finds the reverse, he will hate him. He won't love him because he is a Jew, but he will do one or the other because of economic motives, not because of racial hatred. The Austrians and Germans belong to the same Teutonic race. Both speak one and the same language, and both have one and the same civilization, but still in 1866 there was a war between Austria and Prussia, and even today <span class="page-break">\5</span>we can very well imagine a war between Bavaria and Prussia.</p>
   <p>Will Henry Ford's editorial writer maintain that the Prussians hate the Austrians and vice versa, because of racial motives?</p>
   <p>The Hungarians and Turks belong to the same race, but the Turk has no love for the Hungarian and the Hungarian has no love for the Turk because of historical remembrances and because of political and economic conditions. The same holds good of the Serbs and Bulgarians. They both belong to the same race, but still they are enemies.</p>
   <p>All these facts are known not only to newspaper editors, but even to school boys, but it seems that the anti-Semitic editor knows less history and worldly affairs than the average school boy; and hence his exhibition of ignorance.</p>
