   <p>Who is responsible for the fact that our children are leaving Judaism in the New World? As I see it, it is the fault of the parents. Having been a teacher in a Sabbath school, I have had many experiences which justify my conclusion. I find that children are compelled to do things much against their own will. Very often the children are correct in their behavior, and when the parents are adamant, the children begin to lose respect for the parents.</p>
   <p>Children should learn to like to do the things their parents want them to do. There should be no compulsion. I include religious training [in this generalization also]. Our youth is taught to observe the Sabbath; yet, as soon as they grow older, they are asked to find work on the Sabbath and support the family--very often in instances where the family could manage without this meager support. Thus the child loses respect for both his religious training and his parents who had previously imposed this practice of observing the Sabbath upon <span class="page-break">\2</span>him. How can we continue to teach paradoxes and still attract Jewish youth to Judaism?</p>
