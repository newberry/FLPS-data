   <p>Mr. Nathan Alexander, a ladies skirt manufacturer of 1743 West Division Street, who donated $50 last Sunday at the laying of the cornerstone for a synagogue and social center in Oak Forest, was so enthused about the institution that he phoned yesterday Mr. Herman Elenbogen, vice-president of the West Side National Bank and treasurer of the Society for Uncurably Sick Jews, and promised to donate a scroll of the Torah for the synagogue costing about $500.</p>
