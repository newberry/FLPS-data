   <p>One of Chicago's Polish newspapers, which does not deserve the privilege of being carried through the United States mail, is the Zgoda, a weekly provocative sheet printed on the North Side. It is the organ of the Polish National Alliance of America. One of its officials, much to our great shame, is the Jewish traitor and renegade, Nathan Kalmon Zlotnitzki.</p>
   <p>Even a non-Jew, possessing a clear head, and a kind heart, when reading the articles that the Zgoda has now begun to print, must come to the conclusion that the writers are prevaricators, inciters, and criminal in their attitude. The only thing to do is to sentence them to the penitentiary or to the insane asylumn. And the Zgoda should be cast out of the mails.</p>
   <p>This accomplishment should be undertaken by the Anti-Defamation League, of <span class="page-break">2</span>the B'nai B'rith. The sooner it is done, the better.</p>
   <p>We call the attention of the Anti-Defamation League to the following paragraphs in Zlotnitzki's sheet dated May 29, 1919.</p>
   <p>"... The protests of Jews in America against the said Polish pogroms, the turmoil is a Jewish Bolshevistic one. In free Poland a mighty strong government exists which will not permit every Tom, Dick, and Harry to steal from or rob the Polish peasant or factory worker. Poland, possessing a free outlet in Danzig, will be able to send her goods to the entire world without intervention. Our farmers or factory workers can do without the Jewish middleman or factory.</p>
   <p>"Several schools of commerce, industrial academies, consumption alliances, and co-operative stores are being erected in Poland.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"Business and factories are thus being taken over by the Poles. That is what excites the Jews so much. They realize that they will not be able to compete with the Poles.</p>
   <p>"On the other hand, Jews strive to engulf the entire world in a wave of Bolshevism, which they themselves have created for gaining control of everything. It is at this step that Poland blocks their way... Jewish Bolsheviks have failed to attach themselves to our country. Polish militia fight Russian and Ukrainian Bolsheviks unto destruction, because they--the soldiers--do not want Poland to become another Russia, where today Jews are in command, leading a blind mob.</p>
   <p>"Jews attack Rummania also because Poland and Rumania are to have a common border. Both countries will unite to build a strong wall against Bolshevism and will again re-establish themselves economically without any aid from Jews.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"Therefore, not the pogroms, which the Jews themselves created, but the above facts drive the Jews to embitterment and lust for fight. They cast upon Poles and Rumanians all these calumnies in order to shatter our common interests."</p>
   <p>"This is an economic strife, not one of race or religion. We must know how to defend ourselves. Let us all step out courageously as one man and together retaliate against this stubborn, common Jewish Bolshevik attack."</p>
   <p>On the front page of this same provocative sheet there is an appeal from which we take this excerpt:</p>
   <p>"Judaism works together with German and Russian Bolsheviks to hinder us from securing a united independent Poland with an outlet to the sea. Jews use every effort to install Russian Bolshevism and to bring forth race hatred. Therefore, all you Poles, wherever you may be, call protest meetings against this common <span class="page-break">5</span>Jewish action and unmask the outlaws.</p>
   <p>"Get the Americans interested in this subject and reveal to them the Jewish machinations because they, the Jews, are friendly to the Germans, the enemies of our country...</p>
   <p>"Meanwhile, answer with dignity and continue with your well-known watchword: 'Our own for our own. The Polish groschen to the Polish merchant and manufacturer!'"</p>
   <p>"And this will be the best answer to our enemies whom we have till now made fat and rich with our groschen. For kin, to kin."</p>
   <p>Will the Anti-Defamation League fulfill what it should? If so, it will be justified in asking our editorial office to request private persons not to <span class="page-break">6</span>protest the insults directed against all Jews, but to protest only when such protests might be effective.</p>
