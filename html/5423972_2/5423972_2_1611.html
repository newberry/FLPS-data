   <p>The United Hebrew Waiters 'Union, a branch of Waiters' Union Local 7, which has the supervision of all Jewish restaurants, has sent out a union agreement to each owner of the high-class restaurants giving him until Monday to sign the agreement.</p>
   <p>Rosenthal and Stern, 936 W. Roosevelt Road were the first to sign the agreement with the Waiters' Union, granting all demands.</p>
   <p>The most important demands of the Union were a 9-hour work day; owners must employ only Union members. After the 9-hours work they must pay $1.00 an hour for overtime; a boss cannot discharge a waiter without notice and good reasons; a waiter cannot be used to do porter work.</p>
   <p>All workers and progressive people should help the waiters in their efforts to unionize the Jewish restaurants, where non-Union waiters are working.</p>
