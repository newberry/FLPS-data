   <p>The price of bread and rolls suddenly went up a few cents last week. Both Jewish and Gentile bakery bosses raised the price, with the slight difference, however, that the Gentile bakery bosses raised the price one cent per pound, whereas the Jewish bakery bosses raised the price two cents.</p>
   <p>In the good, old days of "prosperity," when the workers had work and "were coining gold by the shovel" nobody would have minded such an increase in the price of bread. The workers were really earning good wages and a cent more did not make much difference. The situation, however, is entirely different now. There is a grave crisis all over the country. Unemployment rages like an epidemic and does not seem to diminish. Even the unemployment conference called by President Harding six months ago, did not seem to help. The many hearings which this conference held resulted in an executive committee being <span class="page-break">2</span>elected, to which the principal task was entrusted. After a few months of "serious, difficult labor," the executive committee issued a statement that it must further study the unemployment problem.</p>
   <p>Let us assume that the government committee was sincere in its statement and that it is now seriously studying this problem. However, their "study" did not eliminate nor diminish unemployment, and the unemployed did not get an opportunity to work and to support their wives and children.</p>
   <p>The bread problem is the most important one at the present moment. This problem exists even for a great many of the workers who are employed, because lately they have not been working full time but only a few days a week, and their earnings are so miserable that they can hardly make a living, i. e., pay the outrageously high rents and have sufficient money left over to buy bread and butter for their wives and children.</p>
   <p>A cent means a great deal to the worker in these critical times. When the <span class="page-break">3</span>price of bread suddenly goes up a few cents, the worker's wife has to give serious thought to the matter and decide how to save a few cents on something else.</p>
   <p>Still worse is the condition of the unemployed. A rise of a few cents in the price of bread simply means that there is a piece of bread less for every member of the family; it means that hunger among the wives and children of the unemployed will increase; it means that some men who have no conscience, have, for the sake of profit, deprived them of a piece of bread.</p>
   <p>The Chicago [Daily] Forward, which is supposed to be the organ of the "brother workers," takes the side of the bosses and tries to justify their act. The "holy Forward" which has recently begun to believe in rabbis, and has sold its columns, for forty-eight dollars, for an advertisement by a "miracle-working rabbi"--he sells a patent medicine cure-all compounded of Epsom salt and water--has again put on its pious pseudo-socialist mask and indicated its belief that the action of the bosses was just.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The Forward has done this its own, original way--in the same way that it chiseled forty-eight dollars from the "holy rabbi". In the advertisement it told of the wonders of the advertiser's patent medicine, and in the news it made fun of him. It reminds us of the story of the Jewish seminary student who always had two contradictory interpretations of any passage from the Bible: "if we wish, we may interpret it this way, and if we wish, we may interpret it the other way".</p>
   <p>On March 6, the Forward reported the rise in the price of bread. The bosses were criticized, slightly, for their action but a hint was given that their action was justified.</p>
   <p>The Forward said: "The Jewish bakery bosses recently began to quarrel among themselves, and as a result they competed and reduced the price of bread. The price of flour went up recently and this gave them an opportunity to unite in order to defend their common interests, and they decided to raise the price of bread and rolls." No comments are necessary. It is crystal <span class="page-break">5</span>clear that the Forward seeks to create the impression that the bakery bosses did not want to rob the public but that they had to "defend their common interests".</p>
   <p>But what about the interest of the workers whose earnings are hardly sufficient to support their families? What about the interests of the unemployed whose wives and children don't have enough bread now to satisfy their hunger? Does the increase in the price of flour justify an increase of two cents per pound in the price of bread?</p>
   <p>Six weeks ago the price of flour was seven dollars and twenty-five cents a barrel; the price now is eight dollars and fifty cents, an increase of one dollar and twenty-five cents. Two hundred and seventy pounds of bread can be baked from one barrel of flour, so the increase in the cost of bread be baked from one barrel of flour, so the increase in the cost of bread amount to less than one-half of a cent per pound. The bakery bosses, however, did not consider the price of flour, but the price of bread.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The Gentile bakery bosses pay their workers less wages than the Jewish bakery bosses. Last year there was a strike at the Gentile bakeries which the union lost. The biggest bakeries still employ strikebreakers who work for less money. These bakeries are now raising the price of bread one cent per pound and they want to reduce, by thirteen dollars a week, the wages of the drivers who have been so "loyal" during the strike, and have so faithfully and devotedly scabbed.</p>
   <p>Russell Pool, secretary of the High Cost of Living Committee of the City Council, announced last week that he would begin an investigation of the rise in the price of bread. We think that nothing will come out of this investigation just as nothing has come out of all his previous investigations.</p>
   <p>There is only one way to fight the high cost of bread and that is, the housewife must do her own baking. If the Jewish women would begin to bake their own bread, they would get good nourishing bread at small cost and they would help to reduce the price of bread at the stores.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>Let us consider the cost of baking bread from a five-pound sack of flour. These figures were given to the writer by an experienced housewife:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>flour, five pounds</td>
     <td>$.23</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>two eggs (the best)</td>
     <td>.06</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>cottonseed oil</td>
     <td>.01</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>yeast</td>
     <td>.05</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>gas</td>
     <td>.05</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Total cost</td>
     <td>$.40</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>For forty cents, the Jewish housewife will have four large, fine loaves of bread which would cost her a dollar at the bakery.</p>
   <p>The bakery bosses "wanted to defend their interests," as the Forward puts it. The Jewish workers must also defend their interests and this is the best way to fight for their interests. In this fight the Jewish women must be the leaders and they will, undoubtedly, be the victors.</p>
