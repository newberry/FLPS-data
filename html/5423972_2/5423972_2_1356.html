   <p>Chicago, Nov. 7 - A reader of your editorials and always with pleasure and profit for many years, I notice of late a tendency in tham to be unfair to me. I believe any writer has the right to have his utterances judged as a whole. It is unfair to pick out a single sentence without regard to what follows and what precedes and base upon that an argument. I believe you have followed this method in your discussions of some of my sermons and interviews.</p>
   <p>Last week you chose to present me in the role of one siding with criminals against society when every word of the interview could have convinced you that I did not condone crime but simply spoke of the methods which should be employed to combat crime. To-day again I come in for a share of your wrath. Every one present at my sermon could not but carry away the impression that I was contrasting sham Christianity with the teachings of Jesus. I spoke of the Russian orthodox church and it was of that I doubted the civilizing influence. I then proceeded to demonstrate that according to the teachings of Jesus the persecuted Jews of Russia were the Christians, while their persecutors were anything but Christian.</p>
   
   <p>If race is the element that provokes the hatred which the Jew has to meet then certainly no Jew can be accused of contributory guilt. Race is not subject to our free choice. I was not consulted when race was imposed upon me. But again the racial antipathy can only flourish where the doctrines of Christianity are ignored or have not been taught. Jesus was of the race of the victims of anti-Semitism. Paul refused to draw lines between Jew and Greek.</p>
   <p>Therefore may I ask what was my offense and in what did my statement that Russian Christianity was not civilized and that in Russia the teachings of Jesus have been ignored differ from the contentions of your editorial? Thanking you for ascribing to my words greater significance than they deserve and for the honor of editorial notice, I remain, respectifully yours,</p>
   <p>Emil G. Hirsch</p>
