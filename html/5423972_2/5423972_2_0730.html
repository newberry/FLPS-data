   <p>Several hundred Irish held a meeting yesterday evening in the real-estate office on the corner of Congress Street and Crawford Avenue in order to consider means of preventing the erection of a synagogue by the Jews in the neighborhood. The Irish had learned that a group of Jews had purchased the church on the corner of Springfield Avenue and Congress Street and were planning to remodel it into a synagogue. The Irish in the neighborhood object to this. It is not known what steps they have taken to prevent the construction of the synagogue.</p>
