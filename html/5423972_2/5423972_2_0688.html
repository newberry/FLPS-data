   <p>The facts first. We are only fourteen million people and they, the Gentiles, or to be more correct, the Christians, are five hundred million. We are an atomized people living in dispersion since time immemorial and they are organized in powerful states. In the best of cases they grant us equality, but in most cases we are the slaves and they are the lords. We are the oppressed and they are the oppressors. They control the earth and everything that can be reached beneath and above land, while we only control our tears, fearing that they will beat us more. They are building navies, armies, air fleets, and powerful war machines and we are building a university in Jerusalem. We hold the hope that the day will come when we will be left alone, when we will be able to work out our own salvation, but their hope is to expand their power, to develop their share of influence, to accumulate <span class="page-break">\2</span>more power and to grab more land, and to subjugate more peoples. It can thus easily be seen that we fourteen million Jews are by no means a match to five hundred million Christians, but still, since time immemorial, they, the more powerful and the more numerous were always frightened to death lest we gain control of them, lest we accumulate power too. Is not this fear now expressed by so many anti-Semitic propagandists and by so many people who cannot be described as our willful enemies, an insult to human intelligence? How can fourteen million people, living in subjection, in dispersion, gain control of five hundred million people, or are the foundations of the so-called Christian civilization so weak that one hard knock can shatter them altogether. But surely if this world war has not ruined Christian civilization altogether it cannot be said that it is very weak, nor can it be assumed that a small minority like the Jewish people could ruin it, then what are they afraid of? Why are they always expressing the fear that we might gain control of the lives of five hundred million people and impose on them our will, the will of fourteen million people?</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>As far as the professional preachers of the pogrom gospel are concerned, the talk about Jewish schemes to gain control of Christian civilization is conscious malice and war propaganda. There are certain groups of people who hate minorities or who hate other groups of people who live a life of their own, and there are certain dark forces all over the world that are interested in eternal warfare against the Jewish people to attain certain dubious aims, political, economic and social. But there are other people beside the anti-Semitic who are not ashamed of believing that we are a powerful evil and that we aim at the Christian civilization and are busily engaged in sinister schemes and because there are such people, the anti-Semitic propagandists laying stress on our alleged sinister schemes, lend a willing ear to the anti-Semitic talk and the anti-Semitic propaganda must yield fruit.</p>
   <p>One can often meet sincere and well meaning Gentiles who readily believe that we Jews are out for something special in this world, that we always <span class="page-break">\4</span>have something up our sleeves, that we are engaged in mapping out plans with the object of accomplishing something revolutionary in nature. It is true most of the Gentiles know little about matters Jewish, though we have been living in their midst for the last two thousand years. But in spite of their experiences with us, they cannot be reconciled to the plain and simple fact that we are a plain and harmless people and that we have nothing to hide and nothing to which they may object. They think that we are either all Trotzkys or all capitalists, that we are either all pacifists, or that we are all scheming to bring about war. They think that we are constant opposition to them. When they are overwhelmed with strong patriotic and nationalistic sentiments, they think that we are disloyal and when they incline toward cosmopolitanism, internationalism and universalism, they think we are narrow minded, local patriots. Before the war we were often accused of pacifism, and now they accuse us of harboring more sinister plans, of seeking control over Christian civilization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>It is hard for many of them to believe that we are a plain and simple people meaning the best for humanity, wishing every nation well and striving and helping as best we can to make the world safe for amity and justice. Why is it that the Gentile will always believe the most monstrous things about the Jews? If it be true that the Bible, a product of the Jewish genius is the text book of civilization as we believe it is, then they ought to know something about our aims and aspirations for they are reading the Bible for the last two thousand years, and they must be thoroughly acquainted with its contents, with its laws and its spirit. Why then, can every anti-Semitic imposter make them believe everything about us, and keep their mind agitated? Is it because of our survival in spite of the century long persecutions or is it because of our amazing vitality? Well, other peoples have also shared our fate though not to the same extent and have survived. Other peoples have also displayed an amazing vitality and still they do not invite the hatred and suspicion of the mighty ones. What is it then that causes them to suspect us and to ascribe to us <span class="page-break">\6</span>sinister plans, or to regard us as their eternal opponent?</p>
   <p>We have one explanation to offer, namely, the peculiarities and striking characteristics of the Jewish mind which expresses itself in extremes and often in eccentricities. We are not a normal people in the plain meaning of the term. We are inclined towards extremes. There were and are Jewish saints, prophets and Rabbis whose purity of soul and mind is so edifying that even our enemies cannot but admire them. But there were and are Jewish archcriminals too. One need only read the Bible from the point of view of the opposite character of its heroes to be convinced of the truth that we are always inclining toward extremism. The Bible is on the one hand a history of prophets, saints and martyrs radiating the most edifying religious spirit and on the other hand a history of lawbreakers, revolutionaries and criminals and a history of a gigantic struggle between both of them. The Jewish people today is certainly not the same that it was two or three thousands years ago. It has changed considerably because it is, <span class="page-break">\7</span>of course, subject to the law of developments. In one respect the two traits unite: namely, in the ability and inclination of our people to produce extremist forces.</p>
   <p>To the Gentiles, the word Jew, and rich man are identical, but the fact is that the Jews are economically the poorest people on God's earth and actually belong to the hungry part of humanity. However, there are a minority of extremely rich Jews. The Jewish poor like every other poor is naturally discontented and often inclines to boldness and in many cases to revolutionary tendencies. Poverty is always a fertile soil for revolutionary agitators and inasmuch as millions of Jews, hard-working people, are living in countries, the governments of which are corrupted and are thus actually destitute, they listen to everybody who promises them a better future. They naturally also listen to revolutionary agitators. Hence, the fear expressed by the representatives of capitalism that the Jews as a whole are inclined to Bolshevism or radicalism in one way or another. On the other hand, however, there is a minority of extremely rich Jews. These <span class="page-break">\8</span>rich Jews are active in public life. They are constantly in the public eye. They are doing their duty to their own country and to humanity and therefore must always be on the move. Being constantly in the public eye, ever so many people come to believe that all Jews are rich, extremely rich and those who are not blessed with wealth and have the human trait of envy, accuse the Jews of attempting to accumulate the wealth of the earth or accuse us of capitalism. And so we have an explanation for the contradictory charge levelled against us that we are capitalistic, that we are Bolsheviks, although as a matter of fact, we are neither, but try to make the best of the present order of things, because as a whole, we are a middle class people. From the viewpoint of modern education, the majority of the Jewish people, at least in Europe, is not educated, though it is by no means illiterate. It is not only not educated in the modern sense of the term, but it is living in an order of life resembling more the Seventeenth than the Twentieth Century. But still these same unmodern, uneducated and unschooled masses of Jews produce scholars of international fame, great thinkers, great artists, and great writers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Israel Zangwill and his father are a striking illustration. The father was a Rabbinic Jew, thought in notions of the Sixteenth Century and died in Jerusalem, the death of a medieval saint. His son, Israel, however, is one of the foremost English writers of our time and the most modern and progressive man imaginable. Bergson's grandfather was a Chassidic Rabbi and the grandson is the foremost French philosopher, writer and modernist of his time. Gershuni a Russian Jew was the saint of the Russian revolution, a great and true martyr for a great cause. Azev, another Russian Jew, was the greatest traitor to the Russian revolution. The founder of the Prussian conservative party was a Jew, and the founder of the German Social Democratic party was also a Jew. Leon Trotzky, one of the stars of the Bolshevik government, is a Jew and Guggenheim and Schiff are also Jews. The Gentiles, while judging the Jews have only the Jewish extremists in mind, either the extremely Jewish rich men or the extremely Jewish poor man, either the great Jewish scholar, artist or writer or the totally ignorant and shabby Jew; either the Jewish reactionary <span class="page-break">\10</span>or the Jewish revolutionary; either the Jewish saint or the Jewish criminal because these are most in the public eye.</p>
   <p>The striking phenomenon of Jewish extremism keeps the mind of the Gentile agitated and causes him to consider the Jew as the most amazing and most mysterious creature in the world and being amazed at the Jew, be will always believe everything he may be told about him. However, the vast majority of the Jewish people consist neither of saints nor of criminals, neither of scholars nor of ignoramuses, neither of millionaires nor of beggars, neither of revolutionaries nor of reactionaries, but of a mass of plain working and striving people who try to make the best of life and to serve their neighbors and humanity as best they can. But because they are not in the public eye, the vast majority is ignored altogether while the extremists are considered to be the standard Jews.</p>
   <p>Hence, the constant fear of the Gentiles that something is the matter with us; that we have something up our sleeves and that we are always planning and scheming to accomplish dubious ends.</p>
