   <p>In response to the Courier's appeal we have, in last few days, received many letters and dozens of resolutions from Jewish organizations regarding the Bailis trial. Everyone acknowledges that something must be done; every Jew feels that he is the accused one in the Kiev Court, for he knows that a blood accusation in the twentieth century is not merely an accusation but a grave insult for which there can be no excuse. Punishment is the proper remedy if one is strong enough if not, one may express his wrathful contempt.....</p>
   <p>When Chicago protests, it will not only be the Jews, but the entire city, that will point its accusing finger at the Russian government.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>And Chicago will not be the only one. Her protest will be audible among all the voices raised in this country from coast to coast.</p>
   <p>In this way we will participate. Such a protest cannot be made merely by a local organization but must be the result of the meeting of united national organizations. This we are now in the process of accomplishing. The call for our response will come from the greatest most renouned men of the state and of people of international repute in the United States.</p>
   <p>In the meantime every Jew can do his share by being patient and conserve his energy until this immense protest meeting will be called.</p>
