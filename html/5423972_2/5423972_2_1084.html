   <p>On account of racial hatred, the holy city of Jerusalem was destroyed by Rome. And due to the same cause, Rome was destroyed by the barbarians. The causeless hatred, the racial prejudice of one citizen against another because of religious or political opinions, because such and such or one belongs to a different race, or one's skin is of another color. Just such prejudice will bring the nation's doom and sooner or later the nation will perish. In world's history is recorded all the acts of society and of the individual. The history of a nation, as well as the biography of an individual is contained in the record at the close of Judgement Day, and it is in accordance with the sentence which is imposed upon nation or individual, whether good or bad. An individual who over-taxes his strength can expect nothing less than illness and a shorter life. A nation which commits a crime cannot expect anything else but a day of revenge, and payment.</p>

   <p>For example, our own great country, the United States, established slavery in the new world. For that sin, she paid with a civil war in which hundreds of thousands of our youth were sacrificed and rivers were filled with their young blood.</p>
   <p>Spain paid very dearly for her sins against the Jews and Americans. Their troubles as yet are far from being ended. Also Spanish Mexico had a good reason for being rather restless because of its spilling of innocent Indian blood. And now when we read of the black atrocities of Russia and Poland, we are sure that their day is coming, there is an infinity of curses in store for them, for the day of Judgement is vindictive and knows no mercy.</p>

   <p>Here we read an article of a Negro's house being burned down in Oak Park. The house was burned for no other reason than that the Negro chose to make his home in Oak Park in a neighborhood of white aristocracy. The whole family came very near perishing in the flames. All this is due to the uncalled for race prejudice.</p>
   <p>A sad occurrance of this nature reminds us of Poland, where the Polish aristocracy are burning Jewish homes in order to get them out of their neighborhoods and villages. The difference between the atrocities of Poland and those of this country is this: In Poland when a crime of this sort occurs, you can hear them utter these words, "It does not matter, it was only a Jewish home." And in this country when a Negro's house is burned the white people day, "Why this is nothing; it was only a Negro's house."</p>

   <p>Nevertheless these black crimes remain black. It does not matter whether the crime was committed with the cleanest and the whitest of hands, the crime of burning a house with this kind of a motive in view, is despicable race hatred.</p>
