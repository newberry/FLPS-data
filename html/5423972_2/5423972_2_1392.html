   <p>The recent news from Russia presents even a darker picture of the persecution of Jews in that country than had previously been drawn in the English or American press. It was rather widely believed, or at least hoped, that the Czar was kept in ignorance of the extent to which the oppression of the unfortunates was carried by his underlings, and that their suffering might be ameliorated if his attention were called to the facts. It now appears that this hope was a groundless one. It is alleged that he is fully aware of the cruelties to which the Jews in Russia are subjected, that the most severe treatment of them is approved by him; that he has refused to consider a petition from prominent subjects, and that he has been exasperated instead of soothed by the well-meaning but injudicious zeal of the English people who signed the Guildhall memorial in favor of the suffering Hebrews in the land of the Moscovite.</p>
   <p>In response to the memorial the provincial Governors have redoubled the severity of their treatment. Secret circulars have been sent to the officials instructing them to vigorously administer the anti-Semetic laws, and to supply any legal difficiencies <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>by decisions of their own, which shall be in harmony with the intolerant spirit of the Government at St. Petersburg.</p>
   <p>The only hope of escape for the Russian Jews from this persecution is by a wholesale migration to some other country. And whither shall they go? It was suggested by The Tribune of January 25 that they be sent back to the land of their forefathers. Since then it is learned that the subject is being extensively agitated in the United States by the Rev. Mr. Blacksone, a Methodist missioner, whose project meets with the approval of clergymen and laymen of all creeds, and that probably it will soon be brought to the attention of our Government. The intention is to ask that this country shall take the initiative in a movement to be joined in by those of Western Europe, the latter furnishing such guarantees as may be needed to obtain the consent of Russia and Turkey to the arrangement.</p>
   <p>The plan is not only feasible but the best that could be adopted. The country of Judia is capable of sustaining at least 2,000,000 inhabitants, or four times the present number, and considerable portions of it might be made again to flow with milk and honey as in the days of yore. The Jews themselves would be glad to go there as they belong to that class of their race who have never ceased to sigh for a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>restoration to the Holy Land or to firmly believe they will be restored to it at some time in the future. Also there is no reason to doubt that if the way were opened for such a migration sufficient funds would be furnished by the wealthy Hebrews in other lands to help their brethren escape from a bondage bitter as that imposed by the taskmasters of Egypt and to do so by a return to the Land of Promise.</p>
   <p>There would seem, however, to be little hope that the requisite permission would be given in response to appeals originating with any of the governments of Europe. International jealousies stand in the way, and fears of disturbing the "balance of power" would cause the enterposition of obstacles by one Government to propositions made by any of the rest. Russia has already shown that it is disposed to resent British interference in the matter by making the burden doubly hard to bear, and a weak government like that of Turkey could hardly be expected to yield assent to a request from England to open up its domains to settlement by the Jews when in doing so that "Power" would incur the risk of fresh encroachments by its ancient enemy.</p>
   <p>But the proposition could be made with good grace by the United States, and with little danger of any other than the respectful hearing which is almost a pledge of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>acquiescence. Russia would respect the proposal as an unselfish one and not likely to lead up to complications in after years, while in that case Turkey would be false to her own interests did she refuse to admit such a numerical augment with the possibilities of revenue from taxation after the Jews were on the high road to prosperity.</p>
   <p>Does the government of the United States wish to take the initiative in a movement that may be fraught with so much of blessing to a much persecuted race and pave the way for what many thousands of Christians, as well as Jews, would regard as a fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy?</p>
