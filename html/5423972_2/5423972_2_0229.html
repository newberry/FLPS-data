   <p>The Baltimore Jewish Comment complains bitterly about the vicious attacks, which are being brought against Reformed Jewry by some Zionist representatives. It prints excerpts from different newspapers and periodicals, and expresses its anger at such poisonous expressions as "Reformed Jewry is like a cancer upon the Jewish body," as well as the comparison between "Prussianism and Reformed Judaism," etc.</p>
   <p>We agree with the Jewish Comment that such expressions are not nice, nor are they decorous. Besides being so fearfully exaggerated, it isn't correct for Zionists to write or speak so.</p>
   <p>On the other hand let the Jewish Comment not forget that some of the leaders of Reformed Jewry are just as intemperate in their attacks, and just as <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>careless of the truth, as those Zionists, whom the Jewish Comment condemns, and whose enthusiasm obscures their common sense.</p>
   <p>When a prominent Rabbi warns his congregation to keep their hands upon their pockets, because the Zionists are coming,--when another accuses them of not being loyal citizens--when the main organ of Reformed Jewry in Cincinnati comes out with an accusation against Judge Brandeis and Judge Mack, declaring that they are devoting time to Zionism which in reality belongs to their judicial offices--then how is it possible that such ugly declarations in the press and from the pulpit, should not result in provoking counter attacks from some Zionists.</p>
   <p>Let the Jewish Comment take this into consideration and try to understand the merits of those whom it accuses.</p>
   <p>As the voice--so is the echo.</p>
