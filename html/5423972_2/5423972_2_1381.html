   <p>One of the most agreeable and surprising of all the many pleasant testimonials of regard for Dr. Felsenthal given Saturday, the rabbi's seventieth birthday, was the tribute of the congregations of all the Russian-Polish-Jewish synagogues of Chicago. It was a beautiful floral gift presented by a committee representing all the synagogues. The tribute was particularly noteworthy as showing the affection for the doctor held by the orthodox Jews because they consider him the only one of the German-Jewish reformed rabbis who is ever ready to battle for their rights, and uphold their beliefs.</p>
   <p>Among those on the committee, which was headed by Dr. A. P. Kadison, were Dr. Regent, M. Barnett, B. Cohen, B. Fetter, J. Kanter, Leo Porges, Felix Ginsberg, A. Lieberman, and Abe Kalisch.</p>
