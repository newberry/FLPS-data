   <p>The obtaining of signatures from a number of our eminent rabbis to endorse the Cincinnati American Israelite some time ago, ostensibly with the view of trapping patronage from our Chicago advertisers, was a fraud of the deepest dye. The endorsement was given by these rabbis under the plea and promise that the Cincinnati concern was to be edited, printed and published here. Now it is a fact that the Chicago American Israelite, have not a case of type or press in Chicago, and never have had.</p>
   <p>By a careful look through both papers of the same date, one will observe that the Chicago Journal in its leading matter is simply a reprint of the Cincinnati edition, which does not represent our reform ideas of Chicago's progressive Judaism.</p>
   <p>The credulous rabbis who were thus entrapped feel deeply disgusted with the underhanded method resorted to by this Cincinnati concern.</p>
