   <p>This forthcoming Tuesday is Registration Day. Every citizen should register in his neighborhood's polling place for the primaries, in order to have an opportunity to vote thereafter.</p>
   <p>Many citizens who do not take advantage of this, lose their right to vote for their candidates afterwards. During each campaign, there are many who neglect their duty to register and then wake up when it is already too late.</p>
   <p>This is more common among Jews than among any other nationality. The reason is that the Jews, for the most part, come from countries under monarchic governments. They have not as yet fully learned to understand the role of a citizen in a free republic, where each individual is responsible for the election of the government, and where if a citizen abstains from voting, he makes it possible for the candidate whom he considers pernicious to become elected. Thus, it is <span class="page-break">\2</span>the duty of every citizen to participate in campaigns and help elect with his vote those whom he thinks advantageous.</p>
   <p>Everyone should therefore register. It should certainly not be neglected by any Jewish citizen!</p>
   <p>Particularly important is this registration, which for the first time in Chicago will be accrued a new factor, viz., the women citizens. The women will register next Tuesday on equal footing with the men. They will, for the first time in Chicago, exercise their right in political life, a right which has been denied them up to now and which is to this very day not recognized by the larger part of humanity.</p>
   <p>It is rather difficult to foretell whether they will be very active on the day of registration. However, if they are, it would be a great asset to the men. They (the women) would remind those who are always inclined to forget, that they should register.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The Jewish women have, however, evinced a stupendous indifference toward citizenship. But they can correct this Tuesday, the day on which they will register.</p>
