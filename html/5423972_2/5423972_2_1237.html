   <p>Mr. Sidney Ossosky, claim agent for the Chicago Railways Company, applied for membership in the South Shore Country Club, and among the members of the club the following question arised: "Is Mr. Ossosky a Jew"?</p>
   <p>Mr. Stanley M. Wiley, secretary of the club, asserts that Jews are forbidden to enter as members in the club according to the rules, not observing that many founders of the club were Jews, and that they are still members at present.</p>
   <p>This implies that Jews and non-Jews decided to establish a club, and they established the South Shore Club. In a short time afterwards, the non-Jews thought that it was not becoming for them to have anything to do with Jews.</p>

   <p>Those who were already there could not be legally expelled, and they can be found there to this day.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Ossosky wanted to become a member of this club, whose laws prohibit it to accept Jews as members, perhaps he did not himself know that he is a Jew. In his application he had written that he is an "American of Polish descent." Mr. Ossosky's mother was a Gentile, but his father (here's where the trouble starts) was a Jew. However, Ossosky had long forgotten this, until the body which he wanted to join reminded him about it.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. H. Ladel, one of the members of the club, declared, in behalf of the club, that his father's Judaism inculcated enough Judaism in him to bar him from membership. Although Mr. Ossosky non-Judaism provides him the right to become a member of the club.</p>

   <p>The entire matter was brought to light on account of Mr. Ossosky's face. His heart and all other organs of his body bear no signs of Judaism, but his face is always a traitor. The Jewish God created Mr. Ossosky with a nose and features which could assert without any doubt, that his great grandparents stood on Mt. Sinai, and when the Investigation Committee investigated the candidate for membership, they immediately suspected that Jewish blood must flow through this "American of Polish descent and after thorough investigation they discovered that his father was a Jew." His father was a Jew, regardless of his intermarriage, because he did not convert himself, and a Mr. Ladel said: "If Mr. Ossosky wanted to deny his racial descent, he will never be on the level. The South Shore, as other large clubs, are not in favor of accepting Jews as members. But my opinion is that if Mr. Ossosky's father was a Jew, he should certainly not be accepted as a member of the club."</p>

   <p>Mr. Fowler, also one of the governors of the club, said the following:</p>
   <p>"We rejected many Jews who wanted to become members in our club. The Jews, who are at present members, were admitted when the club organized itself; being that Mr. Ossosky's father married a non-Jewess is of no concern of the club."</p>
   <p>Mr. Wiley, secretary of the club, says, "In the two years since I have been secretary no Jews have been admitted to our club. A law that forbids Jews to become a member in our club was adopted a short time after it was organized, and this law is observed. The denial of Mr. Ossosky's descent is considered, by the Jewish members of the club, as a vile aspersion. No one is anxious to know with whom Mr. Ossosky's father got married."</p>

   <p>And in such manner it was ruled that Mr. Ossosky is a Jew.</p>
   <p>What we merely wish to comment on the above, is that the South Shore Country Club is in Chicago, in the United States of North America, and Mr. Ossosky applied for membership in the month of July, 1912. In the one hundredth and thirty-sixth year since the principles were adopted declaring that all peoples are equal, in 48th year since an amendment to our constitution was accepted to the effect that there are no differences in America between races, colors, and religions.</p>
   <p>We have no more to say.</p>
