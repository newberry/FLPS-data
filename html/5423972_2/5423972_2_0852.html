   <p>more about it to familiarize itself with the idea of a creative, constructive Jewry.</p>
   <p>Such significant descriptions of the "new" type of Jew, have been revealed to the entire world recently by two Holland "tramps" who made their way to the Jewish colonies, worked there for some time, and then wrote of their experiences in a book which the Holland Society For Good, Inexpensive Literature recently distributed.</p>
   <p>The authors of the book, Abraham Mossel and his friend Van Der Horn, both native Dutchmen, are, of course, no tramps in the ordinary sense of the word. They are rather two young men, students, caught by the wanderlust, traveling over half the world, "going through the mill", weathering every kind of hardship, and finally arriving in Palestine.</p>
   <p>"We tramps decided to get to work," write the "tramp" authors. "For two years we tramped over Europe, then Egypt and Syria, weathering heat and cold, facing all kinds of dangers and difficulties. We have tramped since July 1911, when we decided to roam the world on foot. But, let no one think that we were driven to work because we were tired of travel. Our zest to tramp about was still strong. What made us resolve to stay was the following. We noticed great things developing in Palestine. We became exceedingly interested and decided to study the results at close range. This naturally required remaining longer, and since we had no money, we had to work."</p>
   <p>The authors depict the difficult road from Jerusalem to Remla in the heat of a May day. The hilly region seemed desolate and arid. But arriving in Remla, and finding their way to the Jewish colonies, our "tramps" found the landscape an Eden. "By God", cry the authors astonished, "this cannot possibly be Palestine!" An Eden after so much desert! "The path lay between fields of golden grain lined with olive trees. Soon we reached orchards of almond, olive, apricot, and orange trees. The rows of trees, set well apart, followed the windings of the road. What spacious Avenues!</p>
   <p>To this admirable portrait given by the Holland "tramp" authors we wish to make a small addition.</p>
   
   <p>In the last few years much has been written about the new Palestine by Jews and non-Jews. Whichever book you pick up to read, you will invariably find that the author, on his first arrival in these Jewish colonies, can hardly help but cry joyously with wonder and astonishment. This is due to the vast difference between those parts of the country not touched by Jews and the sections which Jews occupy and cultivate.</p>
   <p>The intelligent "tramps" got themselves jobs digging the earth, uprooting undesirable vegetation, and preparing the earth for sowing. For a few weeks they worked hard for one and a half francs a day. Many times they were ready to quit, but remained on the job. Later they secured lighter work in an orange grove. In time they tramped through all the Jewish colonies, working here and there and finally arriving at Ben Shoman, joining the colony "Hashomar".</p>
   <p>From this point on the authors portray the interesting and romantic life of "Hashomar." Throughout the entire book one feels a whiff of the fields and gardens of Palestine in strong contrast to the close ghetto air one feels in all Jewish literature from Warsaw to New York. Would that more such reports might come from the new Palestine. Thus the name of Jew would become elevated in the eyes of the world.</p>
