   <p>Last night, the Valley gang again set forth on its wild escapades in the Jewish quarter. These drunken hoodlums, riding in an automobile, stop wherever they see a Jew, and give their unfortunate victims a brutal beating.</p>
   <p>Yesterday about 2 P. M., one of the bandits jumped from the auto at 13th Street near No. 1516, and assualted Mr. Louis Switzky, 40, inflicting a cruel beating on him. His screams attracted a large crowd of people, but the bandit leaped into the car and escaped.</p>
   <p>Mr. Switzky received several wounds on the head, and was taken to the County Hospital. The police have not caught any members of the gang.</p>
