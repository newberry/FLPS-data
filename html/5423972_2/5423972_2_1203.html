   <p>Many of the West Side Jews share this opinion, possibly because the University is basically a religious institution founded by the Baptists, and therefore it makes the impression of being somewhat anti-Semitic. The Jewish students, however, think quite differently. The relationship of the administration, faculty, and fellow students to the Jewish element is very friendly. Dean Lavet of the junior college is especially friendly towards the Russian Jewish student.</p>
   <p>The exams for this year will be given on Shvuoth (Pentecost), and it was announced last week in the classes that Jewish students may defer the exams to a later date. Until now the University would recognize only Rosh Hashanah (New Years) and Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) and Jewish holidays. More consideration is apparently now shown for the Jewish students.</p>

   <p>One who knows the difficulties which are connected with examinations, especially for the professors, will certainly appreciate this recognition.</p>
   <p>There is at the University a Jewish Menorah Society of which Mr. B. Blumberg is chairman. This society offered a prize of $35 to any student writing the best article on the Jewish question. Mr. Bernard Stein won the prize. His subject was "The Influence of Judaism on Mohammedanism." The judges were Dean Angell, Dr. Stolz, and Rabbi Laptziger of Terre Haute, Indiana.</p>
   <p>The number of Jewish students is not large. There are approximately 250 Jewish students among the 4,000 students attending the University. Yet they rate high among those who won scholarships. Several Jewish students needing help are engaged in the library.</p>

   <p>There are also several Jews among the faculty. Professor Freund can be found in the law department, Prof. Michaelson in the physics department, and Prof. Schlessinger in the chemistry department. There are also several Jewish instructors in the biology department.</p>
   <p>There are, perhaps, Jewish students ill-at-ease due to the religious exercises, which must be attended by each student once a week. It is quite possible. But the Jewish students who do not wish to attend these exercises, which are more of a social than religious character, may do so because it is not a strict requirement.</p>

   <p>This University is far from being anti-Semitic, especially on the part of the administration. Jewish students are respected as well as others. Anti-Semitism can probably be found in the wealthy fraternities and sororities. But who takes this into consideration? The most they can do is monopolize the social activities, for which the average Jewish student has no time any way.</p>
