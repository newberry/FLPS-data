   <p>We could not have asked this question about thirty or forty years ago because Jewish intellectualism then favored Yiddish education. Jewish intellectualism, primarily of Hebrew origin, had its cradle in the Yeshiva (school of learning), which produced not only great rabbis but also poets, writers, scholars, and civic-workers. But since the Yeshiva no longer plays its once famous role in the lives of our people, and since Jews draw their creative forces from other cultural sources than Hebrew, a new grouping of our intelligentsia has developed. It is our present day Jewish intellectualism which is no longer entirely Yiddish in its educational standards. Many of this group know very little of Hebrew literature, but, are nevertheless Jewish intellectuals because they live in Jewish streets, use their mentality to meet Jewish situations and problems and are completely influenced by Jewish life. Just as these intellectuals are no longer scholars in the old sense of the word, so too are they no longer members of the well-to-do class. The <span class="page-break">2</span>old form of study was the monopoly of the middle class. Today, also the Jewish proletariat has its own intelligentsia.</p>
   <p>We can say, without exaggeration, as compared to their numbers, that there are more intellectuals in the working class than among the higher classes. All of modern Jewish literature is one of the proletariat. The great Yiddish poets, Raisin, Rosenfeld, Ash, Bergelson, and many others are all proletarian writers. Then too, the majority of our publicists in America and Europe belong to this class, devoting their energies in the interests of our working people. And yet, it would be quite a fallacy to infer that our intellectuals are found only or even to a greater extent among the working classes. I would be the very last to belittle, the great cultural contributions of our new intelligentsia. It has created much, very much, in the field of folk portraits. It has opened the minds and built the heart of our working class. It came forth as a creative educational force of great importance, and yet it is not truly Jewish or even of former Jewish intelligence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The culture of a people consists not merely of pretty literature in poetry, drama and education, nor in publications. It aims to reveal the rhythm of daily life as well as that of the past, and views that of the future. Modern Jewish education, as represented by the great Jewish writers, dramatists, and publicists, is produced only for today, of momentary occurrances. Not so much different from these daily interests, stands the national Hebrew picture, which is also not so typically Jewish, according to the old teachings, though it retains the old-taught traditions. These national pictures are not in the hands of our working class, yet without the national Hebrew portraits Jewish education is practically without value. Just imagine, if Sholom Ash, Avraham Raisen, and Morris Rosenfeld knew no Hebrew, could produce nothing from the original sources of our national life, what worth would they or Mendele, Sholom Alechem, or Peretz have without this knowledge? Can you imagine Peretz and his Chasidishe stories without a Hebrew background? Or Sholom Alechem and Mendele without this same background?</p>
   <p>Therefore, no matter how much we profit from out modern Yiddish culture, yet <span class="page-break">4</span>we must remember it is no more than a continuation of our national Hebrew culture. Of greater importance is the fact that our national Hebrew culture, even at present, is the ruling power in our national lives, though the number of our scholars in the old school have greatly diminished.</p>
   <p>Jewish learning lies not in the hands of Jewish, but of Hebrew intellectuals. The desire to create a Yiddish science and Yiddish culture was not a successful venture. Djitlovsky's book on history, philosophy, and other similar works have remained literary corpses. Jewish history, archeology, religious philosophy, theology, and other branches of learning as jurisprudence, psychology, and sociology, are written in Hebrew.</p>
   <p>What the other Jewish teachings can at best do, is to popularize the national Hebrew culture and science for the masses. Whatever lasting Jewish spiritual culture was created in the last two generations was done in Hebrew. The modern Yiddish culture produced for the past twenty-five years is valued only in proportion to its Hebraic origin. Again may I state that modern Yiddish culture <span class="page-break">5</span>produced for today is good and original only inasmuch as it is influenced by Hebrew. The two best publicists in America, Shtechediger and Zivean, are both Hebrewists, Hebrew writers. The well-known Jewish proletarian writers who know no Hebrew and cannot draw from its sources, are truly colorless and their creations have little value.</p>
   <p>Within the small circle of the Hebrew weekly Haterin, there lies more Jewish intelligence than is present in all the Yiddish presses throughout America. In this contrast, the amount of intellectualism in the Jewish working class, though certainly large, is yet by far not as large as that of the Hebrew. Also, we must not forget that the caliber of the Hebrewist is much greater than that of the Yiddish intellectual. With the Hebrewist, you not only have the theater, literature of poetry and drama, but also scientific subjects. The Hebrew intellectual is more educated than the Yiddish because the Hebrew culture is a classic and he who has made this culture his own possesses a classical education. With the Hebrewist one can discuss philosophy, religion, and jurisprudence, or the deepest subjects that sway the human soul. But in the <span class="page-break">6</span>Yiddish this cannot be done because his intelligence, like his actual education, is very limited. When the Jewish intellectual does not draw his creations from Hebrew sources, then he certainly has not read the various Hebrew works. But the Hebrew intellectual who has had that privilege, has studied them basically and is therefore more strongly developed intellectually, and his knowledge is far greater than that of the Yiddish intellectual.</p>
   <p>To the question of where is Jewish intelligence we must answer, even today when we possess a good number of modern Jewish intellectuals, not among the workingmen but in the middle class; not within the circle of Yiddish, but in that of Hebrew literature, and whosoever believes the contrary, he speaks through his hat.</p>
