   <p>Before commencing the Purim services tonight, the importance of having every Jew purchase a shekel [a certificate issued by Zionist Organizations, which is sold as a note for delegates to be elected at the World Zionist Convention. Transl.] from the Zionist Fund will be discussed in every synagogue in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It has already become traditional for Purim to be Shekel Day in Chicago. Each year the tradition is adopted by more and more people. This year, it is believed, the purchase of shekels will exceed all previous years due to the Misrachi's tireless efforts.</p>
   <p>The Misrachi, the orthodox wing of the Zionist movement, labors unremittingly for the revival of Jewish nationalism and is supported by all rabbis and leaders of the orthodox Jewry.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>They are opposed to the idea of isolation and have therefore united with the general Zionists in the selling of shekels. May every Jew purchase a shekel so that the Hamans of each generation can get their reward,--the noose.</p>
