   <p>Over thirty of the Russian refugees that have come to Chicago have already applied to the Mayor of the city for licenses to peddle. If at the rate these men come here they are thus encouraged by a few of their countrymen who want them to peddle their wares and goods, old and secondhand, all our Chicago thoroughfares will be lined with Russo-Polish hucksters and peddlers.</p>
   <p>We suggest to the Russian refugee committee, No. 106 Randolph Street, to make it the imperative rule not to give a meal or lodging to those having purchased a license.....The refugees should not be allowed to cast odium upon Judaism in Chicago by thus early beginning and over-run our city with a peddlers horde; It would simply be a disgrace to us. To show how persistently these small rapacious traders urge their poor countrymen into the paths of low barter, nearly all in making application for license have signed their name in Hebrew.</p>
