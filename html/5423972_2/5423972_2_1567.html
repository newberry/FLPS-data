   <p>Dress Makers Celebrate Great Victory; Largest Concerns Sign Agreement with the Union.</p>
   <p>The dressmakers of Chicago celebrated a great victory yesterday. At 10 A.M., they walked out on strike and at noon most of them returned to work triumphantly.</p>
   <p>The Bosses Association undersigned the agreement before several workers had time to leave their work.</p>
   <p>The workers returned to work under Union conditions...44 hours per week and union scale and other conditions.</p>
   <p>The only workers on strike now are from shops that were until now unorganized.</p>
   <p>The union will carry on their fight until they win.</p>
