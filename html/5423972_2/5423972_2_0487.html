   <p>More than once have we insisted in this column that the root of anti-Semitism was to be found in the world status of the Jew. We hope we are as fully conscious as anyone can be of the splendid service individual Jews have given to humanity, and of all the remarkable parts they have played in the history of various countries. But the status of a people is not determined by the triumphs in any walk of life of the individuals comprising it. It is secured, and can never be otherwise secured than, by the part a people takes in its general contribution to the progress and the well-being of the world. How can this be accomplished by Jews, scattered as they are in every country and with no Jewish entity which their fellow men can recognize as Jewish? Suppose, for instance, the Jews in one country (say for the sake of argument) the Jews of America, through the opportunity afforded them by <span class="page-break">\2</span>freedom and liberty and absolute non-differentiation before the law, and through the good will toward them of their fellow citizens are able to do brilliant work and produce citizens of great credit and much renown. That will not perceptibly raise the Jewish status in general estimate, when you have comparatively only a handful of Jews in America in the splendid social condition which they enjoy, as compared with the enormous [number], say in Eastern Europe, treated somewhat worse than dogs. You may have a great community in America, prosperous and thriving. But counterweighing it you have the misery and poverty in which millions of Jews in other countries are sunk. Nor must it be forgotten that in those countries where Jews are free, at liberty and are prosperous, they are usually regarded only as citizens of the countries in which they dwell, and indeed usually like so to denominate themselves--English or American of the Jewish persuasion, for instance. But in countries where they are persecuted, in poverty and in distress, where they are harried and worried by inhuman brutality, there they are always pointed to as Jews and they themselves as citizens with the countries that treat them <span class="page-break">\3</span>thus badly. Thus the Jew is always known to the world at his worst and not at his best. And thus it comes about that whatever Jews do in present circumstances for the benefit of mankind at large, for the good of the states in which they dwell, in whatever realm of thought or activity they may labor, they cannot by themselves sensibly raise the world status of the Jew. It is impossible to create a Jewish cult when you have only Jews who are overlaid with a veneer of Englishry in England, or whose ideas and ideals are interwoven with Americanism in the United States. It is just as difficult for a Jew to be a really complete Jew in England or America or any other country as it is (save in point of citizen duty) for him to be a complete Englishman, Frenchman, American, or whatever it may be. And since no Jew can be a Jew (except in point of religion, which is only one facet of Judaism, albeit a most important one) and at the same time an Englishman, a Frenchman, or an American, it follows that his status as a Jew is necessarily in constant prejudice.</p>

   <p>The creation in Palestine of a Jewish Commonwealth or a Jewish National Home would remedy this deficiency. It would enable Jews to be completely Jews, to develop a Jewish cult and to give to the world some great national service in some aspect of activity or thought, which could not be regarded by the world as otherwise than Jewish. If Einstein had been a member of a Jewish Commonwealth he would have been known as a Jewish philosopher, not as a German or as a Swiss, as he has been called by newspapers in England for instance, which admiring him, did not like to give Germany credit for him. The same with Bergson. On the other hand, even though we are but at the very beginning and engaged upon almost the mere nucleus of the future Jewish Commonwealth, Herbert Samuel, despite his British training and despite the fact that he is in British employ, is recognized as a Jewish Statesman. It is surely not difficult to see that the establishment of a Jewish entity--Commonwealth, National Home, whatever it may be called--is the one means whereby the Jewish status the world over can be raised--the only means whereby the status of the Jewish people can be enhanced. It is hence the most effective <span class="page-break">\5</span>measure for combating anti-Semitism which at root is, as we say, due to the low world status of Jews in the countries in which they dwell, and in turn is ascribable to such facts of their situation as we have roughly sketched.</p>
