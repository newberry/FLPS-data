   <p>How it grieved us, how it so painfully hurt us that the American Press remained silent the entire time that cables brought us news of bloody acts in Poland against our people.</p>
   <p>Something like a thick wall of frosted ice seemed to be between our lamentations and the English press. We received no response from it nor any expression of sympathy or protest.</p>
   <p>Regardless of what the reason for this may have been, we realize that such attitude leads to doubtfulness. After all, we could not expect the American Public, the great masses of the people, to rebel against such "heaven-touching" deeds committed against our brothers across the sea, when they find no reference to it in their press, which is their source of information regarding activities and occurrences. On the opinion of the great American public depends the action of the government.</p>
   <p>But finally, the ice has been broken. Thanks to huge demonstrations in New York, large newspapers of this metropolis began to speak, and speak in firm terms at that, not only in sympathy for the victims but also in a strong tone of protest.</p>
   <p>We bring you therefore, the editorial which appeared lately in the most important newspaper of the country, the New York Times. This is what it says:</p>
   <p>"If officials from America, England, and France, who, representing their respective countries at the Peace Conference in Paris, found it fitting to demand an account of Italy for permitting herself to land military forces in Asia Minor, why, therefore, do they not also demand an explanation of the Polish government, and an immediate cessation of the horrible pogroms against Jews in that country? The new Poland is a child of the Peace Conference. The national spirit of the Polish people has lived more than a hundred years after their land was torn apart and they themselves experienced great persecutions. Now again their right to independence has obtained recognition and once more they have risen to the status of a free nation. They received the privilege of self-government. It would be horrible if this newly granted freedom be deformed by means of robbing a large part of their co-citizens of this same freedom, which they themselves have but just acquired. It would be dreadful if they renewed those persecutions on Jews which in previous years left an ugly blot on the greatest part of Eastern Europe.</p>
   
   <p>"For their own purpose, for their own name and the good standing that they should now possess among the nations, influencial Poles of the New Polish government should see that an immediate end be made to the pogroms and to all kinds of race oppressions.</p>
   <p>"The horrible stories of bloodshed and terrorisms that we hear from Poland have now aroused the voices of many lands. In America huge public gatherings are held and various states protest vigorously. Polish statesmen as Paderewski and Dmovski cannot remain indifferent to these manifestations and cannot set them aside unnoticed.</p>
   <p>"Representatives of the Allied governments in Paris must now face the situation of, first, confirming the truth regarding the persecutions of Jews in Poland, and second, of demanding that all these horrors be stopped immediately. It is said that many of these reports are perhaps being created in the minds of German propagandists or are being greatly overdone with the purpose of discrediting Poland in the eyes of the Allies, and also in the hopes that Germany gain something thereby.</p>
   <p>"It may be that Germany helped spread these deeds and fabricated many of them. What a horrible method, depressing the hearts of a world of people in order to obtain their own ends. But there is enough ground to believe that the conduct of the Poles against their Jewish co-citizens is such that it leaves a very ugly blotch on the birth of their new freedom.</p>
   <p>"The Paris conference must delve into the whole truth and take the necessary steps to end these pogroms and unhuman actions, not only as a justice for Jewish people, but also for the interests of the Poles themselves. In this task they need the sincere aid and backing of the Polish government itself."</p>
   <p>For June 8, a protest meeting is being arranged by the Jewish community of Chicago to take place in one of the largest halls in the city. A conference to arrange this meeting will be held tomorrow, Wednesday evening,in the Hebrew Institute. Every rabbi, every synagogue president, and every official of a lodge, brotherhood, and Jewish organization, is specifically asked to come tomorrow night to the Hebrew Institute. In this fashion only, will the planned protest meeting keep from being a failure in its desired effects.</p>
