   <p>At a meeting held yesterday by depositors whose money remained tied in the crashed 16th Street Savings Bank, it was decided not to allow the appointment of a receiver for the bank, but, instead, to raise a fund of $150,000 with which the bank shall be able to function again.</p>
   <p>The depositors have pledged not to withdraw their deposits for one year. Attorney Daniel Yuretz, who was appointed chairman, will appear in court today to fight the demand of certain officials who are in favor of a bank receiver. Yuretz said that he will confer with Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, and with officials of the Amalgamated Bank about taking over control of the 16th Street Bank.</p>
