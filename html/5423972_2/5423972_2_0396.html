   <p>Master in Chancery Max M. Korshak, presided at the meeting. The speakers, who included General Clinnin and Paul Hutchison, editor of the Christian Century, declared that there should be a universal boycott of Germany in condemnation of its treatment of Jews.</p>
   <p>LETTER FROM LEVINSON.</p>
   <p>Mr. Korshak received a letter from Mr. Salmon O. Levinson, noted peace worker, in which he said:</p>
   <p>"I have followed Mr. Untermyer's activities with the keenest interest and great admiration. While in my international work I have opposed the theory of governmental boycott, I feel that there is a clearly defined distinction with reference to individuals in relation to the outrageous treatment of Jews in Nazi Germany. I feel all the more <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>strongly on the subject because, for several years, I devoted a substantial part of my time here and in Europe in endeavoring to promote a settlement of the war legacies with an especial view to the liberation of Germany from the thraldom of the peace treaties.</p>
   <p>"I am therefore disposed to support in substance a movement so courageously and effectively launched by Mr. Untermyer. It strikes me as the only natural defense that we can make to the uncivilized conduct of Hitler and his colleagues."</p>
