   <p>Three thousand Jews met in Congregation Anshe Kanesses Israel church at the Southeast corner of Clinton and Judd streets yesterday afternoon to protest against the persecution of the Jew in Chicago and to adopt means of protection.</p>
   <p>It was one of the most demonstrative meetings held in the Jewish section of Chicago for years. The people were wrought up over the recent killing of Rabbi Glick on Ashland Blvd. near 48th Street, who was killed by a stone thrown at him, and the assault upon Meyerstarr, a peddler, who is now said to be dying in the County Hospital, following an attack and a severe beating he received on the west side last Thursday.</p>
   <p>The sentiment of the speakers of the meeting was unanimous that the police and other authorities of the county were disposed not to give the Jew the protection that was afforded others in the exercise of their rights.</p>
   
   <p>Feeling Runs High</p>
   <p>Feeling ran high while the speakers were voicing the ideas of those gathered in the main auditorium and galleries of the church, and while it was in a sense a sacred meeting those present were unable at times to restrain themselves from applauding the points made by the speakers.</p>
   <p>Resolutions were adopted which, after reciting the recent assaults upon Jews and the alleged failure of the police and other authorities to treat such offenses with seriousness, pledged those present to do all in their power to put an end to them.</p>
   <p>A committee from various sections of the city was appointed to cooperate with the authorities in behalf of good order and personal protection.</p>
   <p>Prior to the adoption of the resolutions addresses were made by Rabbi Epstein, H. Eliasoff, Israel Cohen, Rabbi Udelson, A. Goldberg, A. Kallish, H. M. Barnett and Leon Zolatkoff.</p>
   
   <p>The fact that the Jew of the ghetto was the target at present for the tough element of the west side was the uppermost thought of the speakers.</p>
   <p>Insist on Being Protected</p>
   <p>"We are law-abiding citizens and we shall insist upon the protection due us," said chairman Eliasoff. "We do not ask for any more than any other class of citizens nor shall we be satisfied with less."</p>
   <p>The committee to devise means for the protection of the Jews of Chicago as appointed at the meeting is composed of the following: Rabbi Udelson, Chairman; B. Horwich, M. H. Eliasoff, S. H. Cohen, Leon Zolotkoff, H. Goldberg, A. R. Blumenthal, L. Isaacson, Israel Cohen and T. Weinshenker. This committee will have a meeting this evening in the office of Secretary David T. Alexander, Halsted and 12th Street.</p>
   <p>Chairman Eliasoff said yesterday that the committee would probably go to Mayor Harrison with a resolution asking him to have the police of the ghetto district instructed to be more active and obliging in affording the Jews aid and protection.</p>
