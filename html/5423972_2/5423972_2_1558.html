   <p>In spite of the news the Chicago Tribune's readers are fed with day after day, they are not as blind as could be imagined.</p>
   <p>The Tribune, for more than a week did all in its power to enlist its readers to help an American officer now a captive in a German prison. Griffith, which is the name of the officer, was sent to jail for trying to kidnap Bergdahl, an alleged slacker now in Germany. Griffith had almost succeeded when he was caught, brought to trial, and sent to prison.</p>
   <p>From prison Griffith sent out an appeal for help to the Tribune. His appeal, together with another one direct from the paper itself, was to <span class="page-break">\2</span>the effect that $5,000 was necessary to save him from prison. However, although a week has passed during which the appeal appeared daily, the $5,000 has not been collected as yet. What does this mean? It means that the American masses read the capitalist papers simply because there are no others; not because they pay attention to or have any faith in what is published by them. Were it not for this fact, it would be easy for the Tribune to raise $5,000 for the big hero it is trying to make out of Mr. Griffith.</p>
