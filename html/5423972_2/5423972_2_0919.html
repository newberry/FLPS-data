   <p>The Jewish members of the House of Representatives, A. J. Sabath, Goldfogel, and Siegel, brought a resolution into Congress that deplores and protests against the massacres of Jews in Poland and Rumania.</p>
   <p>The resolution was given to the Foreign Relations Committee. There can be no doubt that when American Jews back the resolution it will be accepted, and Poles will know that by bloody pogroms on Jews they lose the friendship and sympathy of America. It is necessary, therefore, that Jews petition Congress and the President to defend Jews in Poland and Rumania from total annihilation.</p>
   <p>We therefore print below the petition blank which should be filled by every reader of the Courier. Fill in name and address, and send it to the Senator of this State and to the Congressman of your district, who in turn will forward the petitions to Washington.</p>
   <p>Fill out the petition, cut it out, and send it as per the above directions:</p>

   <p>PETITION</p>
   <p>I, the undersigned, a citizen of the U. S., petition his Excellency the President of the United States and Congress of the U.S.A., to use their high offices with the Polish Government, with the object of bringing about a speedy termination of the wholesale Jewish Massacres in Poland and Rumania. More than four million Jews in Poland and Rumania are threatened with annihilation unless the United States intervenes in their behalf.
