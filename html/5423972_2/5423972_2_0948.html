   <p>The protest movement against Polish wrath vent on Jews has encompassed the farthest corners of American Judaism.</p>
   <p>In New York, conferences are now being held between the leaders of large Jewish communities and representatives of New York's Judaism. Their purpose is to devise a plan for a protest campaign in cities outside of New York, which should be pliable and harmonious in order to produce the desired effect.</p>
   <p>Several leaders of Chicago's Jewish community as, Judge Horner, Judge Fisher, and Mr. James Davis will also participate in the conferences. As soon as the decisions of the New York conferences are made known, we <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>will notify the public of all particulars of the protest meetings in Chicago.</p>
