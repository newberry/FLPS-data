   <p>The strike of the raincoat makers in Kling Bros. shops is almost over. After the strike has been settled the union will engage in a campaign to have the conditions of a forty-four hour week and a 20% raise in wages accepted throughout the industry. Local 54 will have the moral and financial support of the International in this campaign.</p>
   <p>Representatives of the union held a conference with Comrade S. Singer who promised the full support of the International. He also appointed Mr. Greenspan to act as temporary organizer in the Chicago territory.</p>
   <p>The union also had a victory in the S. B. Shayne Shop, in that all their workers joined the union voluntarily.</p>
