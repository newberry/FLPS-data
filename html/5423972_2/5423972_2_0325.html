   <p>Next Saturday the portions from the Torah describing Abraham's hospitality to strangers will be read. It is appropriate that an old custom be revived then--that of making an appeal for the Shelter Home in all the Orthodox synagogues. We hope that the appeal for funds this year for this noble institution will receive a greater response than any previous one. In view of the renewed immigration, the facilities of this institution are being taxed to the utmost.</p>
   <p>Although this worthy institution is conducted by the Orthodox Jews, it has the support of all Chicago Jewry. The Shelter Home rejects no one on account of his religious beliefs. The doors of the Shelter Home are open to all. All Jews who have the interest and well-being of the immigrant at heart will support this noble institution--our heritage from Abraham, Our Father.</p>

   <p>We, therefore, ask all Jews who go to the synagogue on Saturday to remember the reading of the day. We appeal to our fellow Jews to carry on this fine custom established by Abraham.</p>
   <p>The condition of an immigrant who comes to a strange land can be understood very easily. Every man is merely a "stranger"--a "guest"--in this world. Those "guests" who are assured of an income in this world should not forget our immigrant guests who are not so fortunate and whose fate it was to suffer so much in the Old World.</p>
