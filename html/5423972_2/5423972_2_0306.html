   <p>Two orphans from the Marks Nathan Orphan Home were Bar Mizvah [ceremony of confirmation held when a Jewish boy is thirteen years old] at the Congregation Anshe Knesses Israel. The synagogue was filled to capacity; those present were not disappointed. The confirmants, Sam Omivsky and Bennie Newocosky, read from the Torah and chanted their Haftrah [usually a section from the Prophets or Writings of the Bible read after the selected portion from the Pentateuch is read]. This was followed by two very fine speeches delivered by the confirmants which showed that they already had a thorough grasp of Jewish lore and Jewish history. An appropriate talk was given by the president of the Home, Mr. H. M. Barnett, and several hundred dollars were raised for the building fund.</p>
