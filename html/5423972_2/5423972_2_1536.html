   <p>The Jews here numbered 15,000 souls at the last census and are probably constantly increasing.</p>
   <p>The now existing Jewish communities contain only a small part of the American residents. The Kehiloth Anshe Maariv, (community of men of the West), founded its synagogue in 1851; the Kehiloth Benai Scholem, (of peace), in 1854. The Sinai community was organized on June 20, 1861; the Zion community, September 20, 1864; the North Side community in 1867, and in the last three years, three orthodox communities with Polish rites have been formed, on Clark Street between Harrison and Polk streets, (the former hall of the Union Turn Association), on Pacific Avenue near Harrison Street and since a few months, on Milwaukee Avenue.</p>

   <p>Jewish aid societies exist in sufficient numbers and are strongly supported in their activities by the United Jewish Aid Association. All through the United States is spread a kind of Jewish national association for charity, education and entertainment, which is known under the name of "Benai Berith," (Sons of the Covenant). It counts here five lodges, namely: Ramah, (since June, 1857); Hillel, since June, 1865; Moviz Meyer, since 1867; Sovereignty, since 1869; and Jonathan, since 1870.</p>
   <p>Among the associations aiming exclusively at entertainment the Standard Club and the Phoenix Club on the South Side, and Harmonia on the West Side, may be mentioned.</p>
   <p>The five have paralized the life of clubs and associations on the North Side for an indefinite time.</p>

   <p>Up to 1850, there were in Chicago almost none but German Jews. Since then, however, a strong influx from Polish districts has taken place, so that the number on both sides may be about equal. This is worth mentioning in so far as the German Jews adhere to the reformed; the Polish Jews to the orthodox rite. For the last ten years the "reform" has unceasingly professed so that finally all German communities and even the biggest Polish community have been reformed by the abolition of most of the antiquated customs and religious practices. The most thorough changes were made by Dr. Chronik in the Sinai Community.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Jews have found their place everywhere in business. However, in social life, they have remained almost completely separated from Germans and Americans and live completely among their own kind.</p>
