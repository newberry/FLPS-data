   <p>Plans for a parade for Jewish memorial day, with thousands in line, were started at a meeting of the West Side Auxiliary Relief Association at 47 Johnson Street, last night. Jewish fraternal societies and other organizations will participate. The parade probably will form at 12th Street and Michigan Avenue and traverse the principal thoroughfares downtown and on the West Side. The intention is to make it an impression of the sympathy felt for the stricken in Russia. Committees to arrange details were appointed at last night's meeting.</p>
   <p>Arrangements are progressing for the theatrical benefit to be given at the Auditorium the afternoon of December 12. Manager George W. Lederer of the Colonial Theater has consulted with a number of managers who have promised attractions.</p>
   <p>Contributions to the relief fund it is thought will be swelled by those from the banking interest of the city to-day. Yesterday the sum added to that already received by Treasurer Greenebaum was $4,571.38 making a total of 71,442.86 handled by him and of about $80,000 raised in Chicago altogether.</p>
