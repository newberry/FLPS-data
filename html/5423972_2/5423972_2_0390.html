   <p>Conditions for the Jews in Germany are admittedly very bad. To remedy that condition to exert as much pressure as possible upon the Hitlerite government, various proposals are being offered to the Jewish community of Chicago - chiefly that of the formation of all - Jewish committees to further a boycott of Nazi products.</p>
   <p>Let us examine this proposal - let us examine it in the light of four thousand years of recorded history. We Jews are not an upstart race, with only a short history and still shorter memories. We have suffered the oppression of taskmasters to whom Hitler is the veriest tyro.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We are told that the Jews should become a militant race once again, to fight back every attack. When war is declared by a common enemy on our people, we must, it is our duty, to fight back, for our own self-preservation.</p>
   <p>With that sentiment we fully agree - but not with the means. Because Hitler declares a boycott on Jews, is our only defense to be a counter boycott? Shall we let a Hitler not only attack us, but also tell us with what weapons we are to fight him back? Yet that is exactly the attitude of those who want a private Nazi boycott in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Let us not forget, at any time, that we are a minority people, and that our weapons cannot be the battalions of men and the battleships of the nation. Let us choose our own weapons, our own field of battle.</p>

   <p>We have a very close analogy with what is happening to us now with what happened two thousand years ago. When Titus was destroying Jerusalem and burning the Second Temple, the vast Jewish populations outside of the Holy City were quiet. We know that the Jews in those days were considered to be among the best of soldiers - that they were much in demand for mercenaries. Yet instead of meeting the Roman legions on the battleground, as did the Zealots in Jerusalem, the Jews of that time had only to wait, as they did wait, to see time take its own revenge upon Rome. We are living today - Rome is not!</p>
   <p>Shall we say now that the Jews of those days, whose proud descendants we are, were wrong - that those Jews should have flung themselves upon the famed short sword of the Roman, and thus abolish our people forever?</p>

   <p>Hitler is not fighting us on the field of battle - he is fighting with us commercially and economically. In any war, allies are very helpful-in most cases of decisive strength. There is a vast anti-pathy to Hitler and Hitlerism in the United States. Shall we forsake the strength of our allies. Let us merge ourselves in the general anti-Hitler movement in this country, where we can do a vast good, instead of privately fulminating in the secrecy of committee rooms, throwing our ability as orators and experts on parliamentary rule.</p>
   <p>We Jews are supposed to be a commercial people. Let us act as such. Do not let our good judgment be overthrown by a passing squall. The boycott movement against the Nazis in this country has been impressively endorsed by such organizations as the American Federation of labor and others. Their work, and the work of similar organizations, should be supported. But we have no need for private committees, each one <span class="page-break">\5</span>pulling in a different direction and suspicious of one another.</p>
   <p>Our ancestors used good judgment two thousand years ago. Let us use equally good judgment today!</p>
