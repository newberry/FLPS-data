   <p>The United Hebrew Trades discussed the condition of the Bakers' Union, yesterday, at a meeting in the Labor Lyceum, and determined to authorize the Executive Board to do everything possible to close the dispute between the employers and the Union.</p>
   <p>This was decided upon after the delegates reported, that the employers had notified the Bakers' Union, in writing, that they would declare a lock-out, Friday, if the Union would not appoint a committee to discuss the condition of the bakery trade with them, and to improve the conditions which make it impossible for places to exist as Union bakery shops.</p>
   <p>The delegates have unanimously determined, that the Executive Board shall have the full right in negotiations and to do everything within their power to avoid a lock-out.</p>
   <p>It was also resolved, that three delegates be added to the Executive Board.</p>
