   <p>I</p>
   <p>Not with any wooden weapons</p>
   <p>To the forest children come!</p>
   <p>Too many ruffians, combatants</p>
   <p>Await us there-in formation.</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>The teacher then will helpless be</p>
   <p>Us to shield against their guns,</p>
   <p>Strong and powerful are the foe,</p>
   <p>Stronger than the mighty Huns.</p>

   <p>III</p>
   <p>Not even with your "reddest bombs"</p>
   <p>Can you hope to drive them far,</p>
   <p>For the hoop - the bow and arrow</p>
   <p>of this age no longer are. . . .</p>
   <p>IV</p>
   <p>Only arms of flame and iron</p>
   <p>To the forest carry, Ho!</p>
   <p>To lead against the enemy</p>
   <p>Should a strong young hero go.</p>
   <p>V</p>
   <p>And so with bullets crashing loud,</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>As the flames of Sinai red -</p>
   <p>Encounter thus the enemy,</p>
   <p>Who seek Jews to put to death...</p>
   <p>VI</p>
   <p>Let loose your wrathful anger, seek</p>
   <p>Justice for your people's stress,</p>
   <p>Then your battle of L'g B'omer</p>
   <p>Will be fought with great success!</p>
