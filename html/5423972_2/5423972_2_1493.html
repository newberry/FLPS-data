   <p>Some of them have even excluded all religious questions from their literary programmes, giving preference to funny Irish dialogues, or antiquated and stale farce of no merit whatever. They meddled in questions that are of no earthly use to anybody; they tried to solve social problems that are too high for the layman, but they forgot their religion.</p>
   <p>Many of our Congregations are poverty-stricken; some have no Sabbath schools at all, and many of those that have some cannot afford to maintain them for the want of funds.</p>
   <p>Would it not be better to lend a helping hand in this direction than to lose large sums of money in excursions and picnics.</p>
