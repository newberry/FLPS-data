   <p>The Courier shows a greater dislike to free Russia each day. Especially since it changed the tone of its editorials, which are now written in the style of Louis Miller.</p>
   <p>The Courier was a warm friend to the Russia of Czar Nicholas. The Courier was the only paper (in Yiddish) in America that opposed the breaking of the treaty with Nicholas' Government, because it did not recognize American passports in Jewish hands. But ever since the fall of the czar, the Courier has borne a hatred toward Russia and its hatred has multiplied since the Bolsheviks have taken over the Russian Government, and have bitterly attacked pogrom inciters and the reactionary elements of all nations.</p>
   <p>The Courier has apparently gotten the ambition to make its readers strong for reactionaries. Naturally the Courier's hatred cannot harm free Russia. On the contrary, it is for her good, because, until now, the Courier discredited everything that it formerly had praised. It has discredited Judaism by closely associating it with the names of the Frank Bros. It declared that "true pious Jews" must elect such a fine fellow as Frank of the underworld to be a president of a synagogue. It has discredited Jewish nationalism by associating it with cheap politics, and declaring that every <span class="page-break">\2</span>"National Jew" must cast his vote for subjects, of which are a disgrace to mention in decent society. It has discredited the Jewish synagogues by sending dissolute fellows into them who have defiled the holy ark and blasphemed the Jewish Torah through their boodle-political speeches. It has discredited the Jewish teachers by taking their educational system under its protection. A certain S. A. Maziman, a free thinker, a follower of Dr. Benderly, came to Chicago planning to revolutionize Jewish education here. The Courier cooperated with him and procured him a position in a Hebrew school which is being advertised as a "Teachers' Seminary" and is preparing to compete with the noted "Rabbinical Seminary" in the basement of the Russian synagogue. It has discredited Zionism by associating it with anti-Jewish and anti-humane politics.</p>
   <p>Revolution is a good thing for its sympathizers in Chicago. Otherwise it would discredit Russia as it has Judaism, Jewish Nationalism, the synagogues, rabbis, teachers, and Zionism.</p>
