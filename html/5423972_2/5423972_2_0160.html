   <p>All efforts of rabbis, judges, representatives of synagogues, and institutions to persuade the Motor Liverymen's Association and the Chaufeurs' Union to permit Jewish funerals on Sunday were in vain. The explanation to the non-Jews that it is against the Jewish law and against sanitation to keep a corpse from Friday (and sometimes from Thursday evening) until Monday did not help. The strongest arguments used on this occasion by Judges [Hugo] Pam, [Henry] Horner, [Joseph] Sabath, and [Harry] Fisher, and by the rabbis, remained voices crying in the wilderness. The livery men and the chauffeurs refused to listen, and they sent a letter to Mr. Adolph Rabin, president of the [Free] Burial Society, declaring that no funerals would be held on Sunday.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rabin called a meeting of rabbis, and other representatives immediately, and read the letter to them. A committee was appointed, consisting of Mr. Rabin, Chairman, Rabbis [A.] Cardon, and [Saul] Silber, Judge Fisher, Dr. M. Meyerowitz, Messrs. H. M. Barnett, Jacob Cohen, Joseph Feinstein, Joseph Weil, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and Sam Rosenstein to work out a plan whereby the Chicago dead will not be blasphemed. They will submit the plan on Monday evening, February 20, at the Anshe Sholom Center, and they urgently request all rabbis, synagogue representatives, and superintendents of cemeteries to be there.</p>
