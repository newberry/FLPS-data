   <p>Four or five of our congregations have Sabbath schools where efficient teachers, paid or voluntary, are working. The rest, especially the Polish congregations, would rather spend a lot of money for a cantor or a shohet than spend any money to hire a teacher to instruct their children. They are charitable and generous toward strangers, and are very anxious to support theological students in the Yeshivoth of Volozhin "for the sake of the Torah," but neglect the education of their own children.</p>
