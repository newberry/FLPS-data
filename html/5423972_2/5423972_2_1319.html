   <p>Just what are theorists out to prove when they theorize that Jews are neither a people, nor a nation, nor a religious sect? How would these theorists feel if in a discussion it was proved, perhaps with a little exaggerated logic, that they, the theorists, were not men? These theorists who go around propounding these theories are merely playing with words. Jews are not a "people" because, what ordinarily signifies a "people" does not really constitute a "people." For a "people" is something which the Jews are not. Thus continues the "word play" logic of these self-styled theorists. All these theorists who can prove that the Jews are not a "people" cannot, when presented with the facts, deny that all other "people" hate the Jewish "people" and would like to be rid of them.</p>
   <p>Let us for a moment assume that these theorists are correct, that we are not a people, nor a nation, nor even a religious sect, that we deny our existence in all of the above categories, and proclaim to the world that we are just "men". Would then our lot among nations be improved? No!</p>
   <p>It is an eternal hate of an eternal people, and the christian world has itself not decided whether it is the Jewish people, or the Jews that it hates. If we were completely to deny our ancestry and completely assimilate ourselves, would then America open its doors to our persecuted brethren in Europe and North Africa?</p>
   <p>Let us discard this "word-play." We are a "people" because we stem from the same ancestry, and suffer everywhere similar persecution; we are a "people" because all the "people" dislike us equally well; we are a people despite the fact that we live scattered throughout the world, speak different languages, have different features and very often different customs.</p>
   
   <p>Persecutions unite us. We will remain a "people" until all "people" are united into one - "mankind."</p>
   <p>Until then we must choose our own place to live, our own territory, where we can live until that time comes.</p>
