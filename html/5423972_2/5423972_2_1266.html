   <p>The leaders of the Jewish Home for the Aged, and the Orphan Home, have now an important question to consider. Their decision will depend on the outcome of the questionaire they have submitted to our orthodox leaders in Chicago. The Hebrew Charities submitted a proposal that if the above mentioned institutions will discontinue their big annual affairs, namely, their annual balls, and bazaars at the Coliseum or other places down-town, they will receive several thousand dollars, each, annually, by the Hebrew Charities, or just as much money as these affairs bring in. That is not the first proposal that our reformed brethren have made in order to stop the annual affairs of the institutions. Several of those proposals submitted have been rejected on the simple ground that our orthodox Jews fear that such generous subsidies made by our reformed Jews, may lead to the complete domination of these institutions by them, which may mean their meddling in the internal affairs of the institutions. Just what will become of the present proposal is hard to tell. At any rate, it is an interesting one and is worth <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>discussion by all those who regard the orthodox homes as dear and sacred.</p>
   <p>Our reformed brethren claim that the running of such affairs by the two institutions in the down-town area, cause great inconvenience to many of our Jews. It leaves an unpleasant feeling when offices are being flooded with tickets, and when everyone is being stopped in the streets and asked to buy tickets. By doing so, the Jews in this city place themselves in a discredited position; and they add, that institutions that cannot be supported by annual contributions made by individuals, such institutions ought not to exist. On this theory, a reformed Jew wouldn't help a poor man with anything, but would send him instead to the Hebrew Charities, claiming that he pays his annual dues to the institution, and therefore, the institution is the one to help the poor man.</p>
   <p>But our orthodox Jews have been accustomed to a different system. No matter in what financial straits one finds himself, he would not permit a poor man to leave without a contribution of some kind, when the poor man asks him for help. It is true that our orthodox Jews are not donating as much to charity as the reformed Jews, yet they are giving according to their means, and they give, in small amounts, to individuals, which means a lot, and also contribute to institutions.</p>

   <p>To prove that orthodox Jews are contributing money for the upkeep of institutions, one can notice the fact that the institutions in question are being supported by orthodox Jews only. If they have to resort to running affairs in order to get the money, so what of it? Jews are buying tickets eagerly, and they anticipate such affairs with delight. They know that at the affair they have a chance to get together and spend an enjoyable evening. There they are able to meet friends and acquaintances from all over Chicago. It's a real home-coming for them and they feel, at the same time, that their money goes towards an important cause.</p>
   <p>But what we cannot understand is, why our reformed brethren are so much ashamed of the affairs given by the Home for the Aged, and the Orphan Home? Why do the "Four-Hundred" run social affairs of all kinds, to raise money for charity, without being ashamed of it? How come that Catholic and Protestant charities run big affairs to raise money for their institutions without being in the least ashamed of them? When the Winter season comes around, we hear more of different affairs being given by other nationalities living in Chicago, than by Jews. In what way, then, do Jews in this city put themselves in a disgraceful position by getting together at a ball, and thus contributing money to a charitable institution? On the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>contrary, it seems to us that such a gathering improves and strengthens the position of the Jews in this city, when Gentiles learn that we are able to take care of our old people and of our orphans.</p>
   <p>The question remains to be decided whether our orthodox Jews should be deprived of their pleasure and anticipated joy of meeting their friends at one of the affairs given by the institutions? It seems to us that when these affairs chould be discontinued, the entire support of the Homes would depend on the whims and caprices of our reformed brethren. Furthermore, the Homes would lose their many friends, and public interest will gradually wane. If the institutions should be supported by the reformed Jews, suspicion and doubt will enter the minds of our orthodox Jews, and if anything will go wrong, they will have only themselves to blame.</p>
   <p>We merely gave our opinion regarding this question. Our orthodox Jews in this city have the final say in this matter.</p>
