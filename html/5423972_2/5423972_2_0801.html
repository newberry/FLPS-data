   <p>Poles in South Chicago are very angry. They are seeking Jewish blood. Several times, since Friday afternoon, Poles, numbering thousands, have besieged Buffalo Avenue where most Jewish stores are located, and have sought to carry on a pogrom.</p>
   <p>Police and firemen dispersed them, but they returned again. Twelve Poles who cried "Kill the Jews!" were arrested. Neither police nor firemen were able to dispel all the Poles. Jews are therefore very much afraid--afraid for their lives, their goods and belongings. Thus late yesterday evening they appealed to the Courier to notify, in their behalf, the Chief of Police and the State's Attorney's office. This the Courier did.</p>
   <p>The trouble began on Friday about two o'clock in the afternoon. The <span class="page-break">2</span>department store of H. Cohen, 8401 Buffalo Avenue, had one door open, not for business but to admit the electrician for repairs. A group of Polish youths arrived and attacked the store with stones and mud, shouting that the store was open on July 4. When they would not stop, Mr. Cohen closed his store and went home. Before a half hour had passed, approximately one thousand Poles had gathered on Buffalo Avenue, demanding the release of a Polish youth whom they claimed was locked in Mr. Cohen's store.</p>
   <p>All Jews in the vicinity kept out of sight. Police arrived, bringing Mr. Cohen and several prominent Polish persons with them. They entered the store, searched everywhere, even in the basement, until finally the police, who had not believed the story anyway, came out to inform the crowd that there was no one there, nor had anyone been harmed.</p>
   <p>But the mob of Poles stood stationary, they did not leave their places. The police phoned the fire department who dispelled the group by turning the <span class="page-break">3</span>hose on them. Twelve Poles who stubbornly refused to leave were put into the patrol wagon and taken to the South Chicago police station, where they were released on bail.</p>
   <p>Everyone thought this ended the matter, but such was not the case. Until late in the evening groups of Poles marched back and forth on Buffalo Avenue. Because it was the Fourth of July and Friday evening all Jewish stores were closed, Jews did not enter the street, thus denying the Poles any chance for combat.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, Saturday, Poles again began to march on Buffalo Avenue where Jewish stores are located, still seeking the Polish youth, reasoning stubbornly that the Jews had killed him in order to use his blood in matzos that are baked for the Passover holiday. The Pole is seeking to plunder and kill Jews and to affix the blood accusation upon them.</p>
   <p>Last night Mr. Cohen held his store open under police protection. A patrol wagon stood ready for arrests but this failed to comfort the Jews on that <span class="page-break">4</span>street who feared an attack by the Poles. If the police are not able to subdue the aroused Poles in South Chicago, the Jews there will have to appeal to the governor for militia.</p>
