   <p>p. 5.. The concert and gymnastic exhibitions given at Sunnyside Park yesterday were a success in every respect. The entertainment was arranged by the German Turners and singers, for the benefit of the hard hit population of Galveston and neighboring towns.</p>
   <p>Chicagoans responded splendidly to the call for assistance from their fellowmen in Texas.... Every German gymnastic society as well as the singing societies, engaged in hard work preparing for this affair. The Indiana Turner District did likewise.</p>
   <p>The performers were well repaid for their efforts by an appreciative audience. The proprietors of the Sunnyside establishment, Messrs. John H. Colvin and Fred W. Erby, most graciously donated the use of the park. Their humanitarianism went still further as they contributed 25 per cent of the gross receipts from all the food and drink consumed on this occasion.</p>
   <p>The Boys Orchestra directed by their instructor, Mr. A. Winkler, executed its part of the program splendidly. Other participants of the excellent musical program were: the mass-choir, consisting of the singing sections of different Turner societies, the United Male Choir, and numerous other singing societies.</p>
