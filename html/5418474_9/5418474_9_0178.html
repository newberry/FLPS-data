   <p>It has become necessary to enlarge the German Hospital by an addition, but the funds of the hospital management have been used up more than was expected and there is still much money needed in order to complete the wing and furnish it. The Board of Directors applies therefore in the interest of this welfare institution to the German population of Chicago for help, big and small- and all contributions sent to the Hospital management will be accepted with thanks. Already the Schwaben Verein has given an example worthy of imitation by granting $100.00 for the purpose, truly an example that should find an echo in the German Clubs and Lodges. There are many German firms and private persons in Chicago who are well able to bring a sacrifice, without doing themselves financially any harm.</p>
   <p>Germans, dont let this call be made in vain, give your hearts a good push and open the purse for this good purpose. Chicago could have had for a long time a German Hospital three times as large, if only the funds needed would have come in more abundantly. Dont let it be this time words alone, but let us see actions for once.</p>
