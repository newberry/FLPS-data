   <p>The woman's society, "Recovery", whose purpose it is to aid German families in distress, held an entertainment last evening in Freiberg's hall.</p>
   <p>The first part of the program consisted of a number of splendid recitations, and the second part of special dances.</p>
   <p>The cash balance, which resulted from the evening's entertainment will be put into the treasury of the society. More than a dozen really poor German families are aided from the treasury with a total outlay of $35.00 to $40.00 per month. The society has now 150 members, and the membership increases in proportion as the actual requirements of needy families, are continually growing.</p>
