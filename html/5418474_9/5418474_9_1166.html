   <p>The expenditures incidental to our concert at Farwell Hall in behalf of German soldiers and their dependents were met with funds taken from the treasury of our society. We are enclosing a check for $215, the gross receipts, which represents our contribution to the worthy cause.</p>

   <p>Mr. H. Claussenius, treasurer of the Ladies' Aid estimated the total net receipts from the activity of the ladies at about $17,000. That is very gratifying.</p>
