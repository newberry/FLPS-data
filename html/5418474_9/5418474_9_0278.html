   <p>The Uhlich Orphans' Home, 2014 Burling Street will celebrate its 60th year and after that move to its new location on Irving Park Boulevard. The manager of the Lane Court Theatre on Center and Clark Streets, Mr. Ronda, had the children of the orphans' home as his steady guests in his movie theatre every Sunday and on holidays for the last five years.</p>
   <p>Yesterday evening he arranged a special farewell performance for his favorites. Lead by Mr. King, the superintendent of the institution, they marched to the theatre and occupied the best seats. Shortly thereafter Attorney John R. Philp made a speech, praising Mr. Ronda for his generosity towards the orphaned children.</p>
   <p>After that the children went one by one across the stage, and each individually, presented to their fatherly friend, a flower. Mr. Philp then handed Mr. Ronda a group picture of the children, which he accepted with great pleasure and promised to give it a place of honor in his office.</p>
