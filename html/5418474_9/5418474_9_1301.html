   <p>Census Bulletin No. 182 is indeed a very voluminous work, containing a classified resume of murder in the United States. It presents the laborious compilation which Mr. Fred H. Wines, Special Agent of the Census Department, Division of Pauperism and Crime, has gathered. It throws a clarifying light which thoroughly permeates the subject. On June 1st, 1890...the prison-population of the United States was 82,324. 7386 or 8.97 per cent were accused of murder of which 6958 were men, and 393 were women; 4425 were white, 2,739 were negroes, 94 were Chinese, 1 was Japanese, and 92 were American Indians. Of the 3157 white people in the United States 1213 were of foreign birth; the origin of 55 is unknown; and of the 3157 born in the United States 2182 had native parents, 176 had either a foreign father or mother, 494 had parents of foreign extraction; 305 were of unknown parentage and, according to Mr. Wines' figures 56.14% of the white people accused of murder were indigenous, whilst 43.86% belong to the foreign element. He intends to disprove the assertion that the native Americans are exceptionally prone to commit homicide. He achieves this result by deliberately including those in the foreign classification, who cannot give definite information about, their parentage. In regard to the 3605 parents of criminals who have been listed as foreigners...</p>
   <p>Parents of 522 were born in Germany, 219 criminals had German fathers and mothers, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and 21 were of partially German origin - a total 763. This is very gratifying for the Germans since from a numerical standpoint they constitute the largest class of immigrants....</p>
