   <p>As has been already announced, a fund shall be established for the support of needy veterans in Chicago and Cook County. These veterans of German wars received a small pension, but as soon as they became citizens of the United States, they lost these pensions. Others who were in favorable financial circumstances, lost everything and are in dire need.</p>
   <p>Because of these facts, the German War-Veterans Organization, established 1874 in Chicago, with the cooperation of local German military associations, and eminent citizens of German descent, have decided to undertake the support of these needy veterans in Chicago and Cook County.</p>
   <p>There will be a huge and dignified celebration on January 12th consisting of a great concert, speeches by eminent orators, allegorical plays, and marble-groups.</p>
   <p>The total income will be turned over to this fund. The celebration will take place at the Northside gymnasium.</p>
