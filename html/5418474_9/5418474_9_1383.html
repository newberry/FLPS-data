   <p>With every legal execution which takes place here in Illinois the opponents of capital punishment gain new material for propaganda from the fact that these executions are often carried out in an amateurish way which amounts to torture. The last double hanging performed in Chicago had the appearance, once again, of a theatrical performance.</p>
   <p>One of the criminals actually danced around on the platform. It took almost four minutes to pinion his arms and legs, to drape a white hood around him and pull a cap down over his head. Not until then could the drop into eternity take place. Even then the thing wasn't over, because the criminal kept wriggling for a few more minutes. It was not until eleven minutes had passed that the physicians could pronounce him dead. The entire execution therefore lasted all of fifteen minutes.</p>

   <p>In Peoria, at almost that very same hour, a Mexican was executed. When the body dropped into the abyss the knot holding the rope gave, so that the condemned man hit the floor and had to be pulled up again. In this, as in the first case, death came by suffocation.</p>
   <p>In the face of these happenings one must ask whether the State has the right to torture to death persons who have fallen into the hands of the hangman. Is not the death penalty rather a preventive measure calculated to render a criminal permanently harmless? From the standpoint of our civilization the death penalty can only be justified as a preventive measure which must be retained as a fearful example. But this does not justify the horrible punishment of strangulation. In the first place, a better preparation and a more careful handling of the whole unpleasant ceremony is to be hoped for; then abolition of the gibbet, which dates back to the time of the Flood, and the introduction of a more humane and swifter method of execution are vitally necessary. The electric chair might perhaps meet the requirements.</p>
   <p>Even when the electric current has to be turned on for a second time to</p>

   <p>produce death no torture is possible, because the first shock has already paralyzed the brain centers and taken away all consciousness in the fraction of a second. The gibbet, however, is, under the most favorable conditions, but a poor substitute. Criminals whose bodies are not heavy seldom die from a swift and painless fracture of the neck, but rather slowly suffocate without losing consciousness. Execution thus becomes an unnecessary torture. The antiquated justice of Illinois is not improved by the use of medieval methods of execution, which are retained because we are too easygoing or too lazy to keep pace with the times and with progress.</p>
