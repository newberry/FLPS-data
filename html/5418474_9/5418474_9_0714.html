   <p>This terrible war which was forced upon Germany and Austria-Hungary has been going on for months now, and the motto of our brothers in the old country is "Victory or Death".</p>
   <p>We are in constant suspense about the fate of our blood brothers in the homeland; and we do our best to make our relief work for the alleviation of their distress a success.</p>
   <p>The Chicago German element has responded gallantly to our call for financial help, but public opinion has been systematically poisoned by false news reports in the papers. Our German press is doing its utmost to clear things up.</p>
   <p>But now we have the opportunity of hearing the best qualified representative <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of the German Reich, who will give us firsthand information. It is no other than Dr. Bernhard Dernburg, former Colonial Minister of the German Reich and a well-known patriot, dipolmat, and orator.</p>
   <p>The Deutsche und Desterreichisch-Ungarische Hilfsgesellschaft [German and Austro-Hungarian Relief Association] has therefore called a mass meeting for Thursday, December 10, 1914, at 8 P. M. in the Medinah Temple, Cass, Ontario, and Erie Streets. The Chicago German element is heartily invited to attend.</p>
   <p>Besides Dr. Dernburg, Mr. Charles H. Wacker, Dr. Emil [G.] Hirsch, Mr. Harry Rubens and Dr. George Scherger, professor at the Armour Institute, will also speak.</p>
   <p>Admission into the Hall, which has a capacity of four thousand seats, is free.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>One thousand reserved seats will be sold at one dollar each to cover expenses. Tickets can be obtained at the offices of the Hamburg-American Lines, corner Randolph and La Salle Streets.</p>
   <p>The undersigned appeal to the Chicago German element to come to this meeting.</p>
   <p>The German vereine [societies] are requested to send their flags and standards to the Medinah Temple in the evening [of the meeting]. The presidents, secretaries, and standard bearers [of the vereine] are to mount the stage. Tickets for this can be had at our office at La Salle and Randolph Streets.</p>
   <p>Germans, Austrians, and Hungarians, come all, and prove yourselves worthy of the noble cause.</p>
