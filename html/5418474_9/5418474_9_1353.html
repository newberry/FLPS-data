   <p>Tuesday afternoon at 3, A Bohemian named Nartin Benada killed first his fiancee Catherine Nicolan, and then himself. They both were working in the tailor shop of Mr. Thomas Hocohm, 403 W. 16th Street. Last Monday Catherine expressed to her fiance the desire to view the German parade. Martin flatly refused. Resenting his attitude Catherine declared that she would go anway, and that she would have no difficulty in finding an escort. She found one and had a good time watching the hated "nemetz" without Martin. Tuesday the two met again in the shop. Martin was quiet and did his work as usual. In the afternoon, he went away but returned after a while with a revolver that he had bought from an innkeeper at Blue Island Avenue. Again he took up his work, but only for a few minutes. Walking towards his sweetheart, he said in Bohemian: "Farewell Catherine'" pressed the revolver toward her left temple and fired.</p>
   <p>The girl fell bleeding to the floor. Before anybody could interfer, Benada had fired another bullet into his own brain. He died immediately. He was only 20, one year younger than his victim who died yesterday at half past eleven.</p>
