   <p>The Illinois Grand Lodge of the Order of the Knights of Pythias, asked the Superior Court for an injunction against the Waldeck Lodge, which has left the order recently, and demanded to stop them from forming a new Lodge in the State of Illinois and in Cook County under even a part of the name of the Grand Lodge. As will be remembered 48 members of the Waldeck Lodge on December last, joined the newly formed "Improved Order of the Knights of Pythias" and installed the new "Waldeck Lodge No. 1 on Saturday night in Folz's Hall.</p>
   <p>Judge Payne did not grant the injunction, but issued an order for the summoned party to appear before him, to give him all necessary explanations.</p>
