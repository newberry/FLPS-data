   <p>Delegates of Lutheran congregations held a meeting the day before yesterday to discuss the matter of building a Lutheran Old People's Home. A committee was present consisting of H. C. Zuttermeister, H. Biermann, C. Joern, H. Heppe and J. Lange. They submitted offers of real estate properties located at Lombard, Thornton, Desplaines, and Addison. For practical purposes, however, it was emphasized that the institution should be erected within the city. The pastors, A. Reinke, and W. Bartling, as well as H. C. Zuttermeister were requested to prepare accurate plans in regard to the institution, its constitution and by-laws, ways and means of obtaining the necessary funds and after these plans have been submitted, to proceed in incorporating the Lutheran Old People's Home Society.</p>
