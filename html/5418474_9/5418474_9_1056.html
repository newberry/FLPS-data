   <p>In order to spare the public a collection in these bad times and yet to secure sufficient means for coming winter, the board of directors will organize a theatrical production for that purpose. It will thus be made easy for everyone to fulfill the obligations we have towards our poor fellow country men and immigrants. But the purpose can be attained with such small contributions only through a general participation. On account of that we hope that every German, even those who have never contributed a cent, will buy at least one ticket in order to support the only public interdenominational charitable institution. Many drops make an ocean.</p>
