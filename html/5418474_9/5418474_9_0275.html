   <p>The Uhlich Orphan Home, a German institution which has sheltered poor orphans for six decades, celebrates its 60th anniversary today. It is with real pride and satisfaction that those who participated in this work of Christian charity, can look back upon the history of the Home.</p>
   <p>Sixty years ago the foundations were laid for the orphan home by the Rev. Joseph Hartmann, then pastor of St. Paul's church. Through his efforts the home was established on Clark and Webster Streets. Pastor Hartmann took over the management of the institution and Mrs. Christine Ratsfeld, a true helper, became the "mother" of the Home.</p>
   <p>In the year 1867, Mr. and Mrs. Uhlich, a very wealthy German couple, gave the Home a large lot bounded by 23rd Street, Wentworth Avenue, 24th Street and La Salle Street. In honor of the noble benefactors, the Institution became known after that as the Uhlich Orphan Home.</p>
   <p>The property at that time was not very valuable, but its value increased steadily with the development of Chicago, and today the parts leased to warehouses and factories bring in the considerable amount of $50,000 yearly. During the great fire of 1871 the buildings burned down.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jean Muehlke made a donation of $20,000 toward a new orphanage. Next year the foundation of a building was laid on Burling and Center Streets, and the year after that it was ready for occupancy. The Institution became too small and an addition became necessary.</p>
   <p>Here Mr. Charles Wacker extended a helping hand, and made a donation of $10,000. Other philanthropic families like Seipp, Uihlein and Conrad Furst contributed larger amounts to build the needed addition.</p>
   <p>For 50 years the Institution carried on its activities on Burling Street, but then again the building became too small, therefore the younger generation had to solve the problem of enlarging the Home once more. The pastor of St. Paul's church, Mr. J. Pister, was asked to take charge of an organization for the rebuilding. Mr. Pister declared himself willing, and due to his tireless efforts an executive committee was organized, composed of the most prominent members of the German element.</p>
   <p>The president of the committee is Postmaster Arthur Lueder, vice-president; Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, secretary; Pastor Jacob Pister, and treasurer, William W. Wieboldt. Other officers are: Messrs. Carl Buehler, Otto F. Closius, Henry Schoellkopf, Charles Schick, Max Teich and Frederic J. Haake. Mr. Wieboldt, the treasurer of the committee, deserves special thanks for his efforts in raising the required 250,000 dollars.</p>
   <p>Mr. Henry W. King, the superintendent of the Home, is an experienced teacher.</p>
