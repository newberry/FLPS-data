   <p>Theodor Weber has finished his report on the German National Bank, and his conclusions are similar to those which were published some months ago in our Vox Populi column. The "House of Greenebaum" and its various branches has spent not less than $237,200 of the Bank's money. The report gives a fair account of Greenebaum's transactions involving the Bank, and contains several rather serious accusations. It is also shown that Greenebaum withdrew money for his firm after the Bank was insolvent.</p>
   <p>According to news from Washington, criminal proceedings may be instituted against Henry Greenebaum.</p>
