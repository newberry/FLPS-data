   <p>Acting according to the old adage, "A dollar today is worth ten tomorrow", the undersigned formed a committee last Sunday to collect voluntary gifts to care for the immediate needs of those families that suffered losses in Saturday's fire. To date, we have collected $312.63, which we distributed among twenty-seven families--not a large sum when one considers that there are seventy-one children in these families. However, the amount was large enough to provide what they needed most.</p>
   <p>Having done what we proposed to do, we gratefully acknowledge the willingness with which the donors came to the aid of the unfortunates in this emergency.</p>
   <p>Following is a list of the names of the collectors and the sums which they received: Mr. Boehner, $26.70; Mr. Bouse, $7.75; Mr. Freiburger, $49.38; Mr. Hilpert, $6.50; Mr. Frank, $23.00; Mr. Mueller, $83.85; Mr. Werkmeister, <span class="page-break">\2</span>$37.90; Mr. Leindecker, $6.25; Mr. Kappler, $3.50; Mr. Pollak, $10.00; Mr. Schwienk, $23.80; Mr. Ritzinger, $34.00.</p>
   <p>Families aided: German, 12; Irish, 7; American, 2; Bohemian, 2; Dutch, 1; Negro, 3.</p>
