   <p>The D. A. H. [Deutsche Amerika Hilfe (German-American Aid)] was founded July 15, 1919 by a small group of German-American men and women, whose hearts were touched by the cries of despair from the old country. They thought the time had come to give effective aid immediately. Without fear, they went to work. And their efforts met with success, because all who know what hunger and want means, came to their aid. The German communities, clubs, and lodges collected gifts with such zeal that, within a few weeks of hard work, it was possible to dispatch the first shipment of milk to Germany.</p>
   <p>On September 4, one hundred parcels of powdered milk were sent to Berlin, and the same amounts were sent also on September 15, 23, and 30, and October 18, all to Berlin. On October 11 one hundred parcels were sent to the community of Barenwalde in the Erzgebirge [Translator's note: Erzgebirge is a mountainous region in central Germany]. The shipments <span class="page-break">\2</span>to Berlin were addressed to the Foodstuffs Ministry. On November 20, we sent 10,000 pounds of powdered milk (in fifty-pound cans) to the Red Cross in Hamburg, for distribution throughout Germany. Altogether 15,000 pounds of powdered milk were shipped across, which will have saved the lives of several thousand children.</p>
   <p>At the same time, fat stuffs for the adult population were not forgotten. Consequently, five thousand dollars worth of lard for Berlin and an equal amount for Vienna were ordered through the Armour Packing Company on November 7. The lard was already in storage in Europe, making a quick delivery possible, which is very important for our relief work.</p>
   <p>At the last session of the D. A. H. the business committee decided to purchase another ninety-seven-boxes of condensed milk for three hundred dollars, to be sent to the Deutsche Wohlfahrtspflege [German Welfare Administration] in Berlin, destined especially for the sick children in the Charite Hospital. Furthermore, it was resolved to ship five hundred <span class="page-break">\3</span>boxes of sweetened condensed milk (Libby's) for each of the next three months, because the German government had informed the D. A. H. that condensed milk for the near future was needed badly. It was resolved further that the chairman of the finance committee, Mr. Ferdinand Walther, should place an order for 20,000 pounds of fat [lard] with Armour and Company. This merchandise is already stored in Germany and will make a highly welcome Christmas gift for our suffering brothers at home.</p>
   <p>As far as the other branch of our relief work is concerned, namely, the collection of clothing, we can report good news. After all preparations had been made, we started our first shipment of clothing on November 8, and by December 8, exactly within a month, we had sent thirty-two large boxes with a total weight of 10,033 pounds: three boxes to Dusseldorf; eight to Barenwalde in the Erzgebirge; three to Bernau; two to Nordlingen; and, sixteen to the Red Cross in Berlin. This week another ten boxes will be ready.</p>

   <p>The credit belongs to the ladies who have been working so hard at the D. A. H. headquarters, at 1610 North Park Avenue. It took us only a little more that a month to organize and make preparations, and already we have effectuated the shipments mentioned within three short months, from September 1 to December 1, in spite of the most difficult circumstances. But the D. A. H. will be able to do much more in the future if everybody will take part in our relief work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Carl Autschbach has promised to give the profits from his song "Lovely Night" for the alleviation of suffering among the German children. The song can be had for twenty-five cents from Mr. Autschbach, 4338 Greenwood Avenue. Mr. Wilhelm Middelschulte, famed Chicago organist, said the following about the song; "The melody is agreeable and well suited to the voice. In the hands of an enthusiastic singer the song should prove effective."</p>
   <p>The song was sung by Miss Marshall at the D. A. H. meeting on Tuesday night in the North Side Turner Hall, and was received with war applause <span class="page-break">\5</span>by all.</p>
