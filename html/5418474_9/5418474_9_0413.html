   <p>The monthly meeting of the Ladies' Club of the German Altenheim (Home for the Aged) was held yesterday afternoon at the Kaiserhof Hotel. Mrs. Klara Rehtmeyer, the president, reported that Mrs. Lefens, widow of the late Thies Lefens, gave $10,000 to the Home a memorial to her departed husband. After the completion of current business, Mrs. Frankenhuis (probably Frankenhaus, Transl.) announced the program.
