   <p>Rehm complained yesterday to a Tribune reporter that Jussen had had the audacity to send him a bill for $645 although he worked strongly against him.</p>
   <p>To our reporter, Jussen said in answer: "It is not true that I was retained by Rehm for his defense. The latter used me only for some private business. Thus I had to go to Canada for him. I did not accept a general retainer fee from Rehm, because I knew that his interests would clash with those of my main client, A. C. Hesing. Any lawyer will tell you that my fee is moderate for all that I have done for Rehm. On account of him I have spent entire days in my office, to assist at the consultations of the distillers. Rehm should be the last to complain, he who took money from me, without having done anything for it."</p>
   <p>Reporter: "How was that?"</p>
   <p>Jussen: "Two weeks after my appointment as federal tax collector, Rehm came to me and asked for a detective position in consideration of his help towards my appointment. When I told him that no money was alloted for such a position, <span class="page-break">2</span>he said I should pay it out of my own pocket. He continued to say that the distillers needed the strictest supervision. He, of course, never reported any irregularity. When after four months, I discharged him, because I got wise to him, I gave him $525. Here is the receipt: 'Received from Edmund Jussen, Collector of the 1st District of Illinois, $525 in payment of my services as Deputy Collector from May 15, 1869 to Sept. 1, 1869. Jacob Rehm'. This is all I wish to say."</p>
