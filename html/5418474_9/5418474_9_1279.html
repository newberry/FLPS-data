   <p>An ever-increasing number of Chicagoans predict that the elder Insull and his brother, Martin, will never be brought to Chicago to answer for their unsuccessful speculations. The efforts to extradite these two master builders of large corporations might well be compared to a tug of war: a struggle, not between America and the countries which benefit from having been selected as places of refuge by the two fugitives, but between two local groups. In addition to the thousands who suffered losses and would like to see the Insulls brought to justice, it is alleged that there are two small but very influential groups which are hoping that fate will prevent the return of the two financiers. It is said that these groups consist of people who greatly fear that should the Insulls, be brought back by force, they might reveal some matters which otherwise could easily be concealed.</p>

   <p>This explanation is very plausible; for, apparently, there was some dishonesty connected with the flight of the Insulls, especially with that of Samuel, and the extradition negotiations with Greece and Canada were strangely protracted. Insull's battle against extradition certainly has cost him a large sum of money, and, if indications are not deceiving, he is still paying heavily. If a less "valuable" refugee had been concerned, Greece would hardly have set forth such strenuous efforts to keep him in its country. A poor devil cannot so successfully resist the long arm of Uncle Sam. Where did Insull get the money to pay for the fight? This question is frequently asked by interested persons, but they are not satisfied with any of the answers which have been offered. Although many conjectures have been made concerning the source of the money, no definite proof has been established to date.</p>
   <p>The endless prolongation of negotiations with Canada indicate that similar "forces" are at work there. That they do not receive so much space in the public press is no doubt attributable to the fact that the public looks upon Martin Insull merely as Samuel's puppet.</p>

   <p>The daily bulletins concerning Samuel's health are issued to arouse sympathy for him. The same procedure is followed in the case of nearly every criminal, whether he is a robber or murderer, or merely a swindler. If the "sob sisters" work long enough they can certainly convince some people that the "unfortunate one" is being persecuted; the feelings of the victims, however, are given no consideration whatsoever. "It would surely be terrible if the old man's death should be hastened by his being forced to leave his hideaway," say his sympathizers. However, it is much more regrettable that a great number of his innocent victims, facing starvation, were forced to commit suicide to avoid becoming public charges. They were not guilty of any offense. They trusted Insull and thus lost all they owned. Sam Insull, however, who is responsible for hundreds of thousands of losses, need not suffer, save from an illness brought on partly because of his advanced age and partly because of the fear of arrest. He still has enough money to spend his life in comfort and to evade a reckoning. Who is financing his life in exile?</p>
