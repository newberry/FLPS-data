   <p>The German Society held its monthly session ,yesterday. The Swabian Society was received and report of the agent is as follows:- In the last month 210 employers called to obtain workers, but quite often without any result, although a sufficient number of employment seekers were at the same time present in the office. 613 applications for employment were placed, the agent is complaining that some of these immigrants are demanding too many favors which causes the society unnecessary trouble.</p>
   <p>The influx of immigrants through Chicago in February was 10,450, in March 16,700, in April 20,000 but in May over 50,000. Little over 1% remained in Chicago. etc.</p>
