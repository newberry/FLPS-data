   <p>Doctor P. P. Claxton, Federal Commissioner of Education, who may be remembered by our readers because he advocated instruction in the German language during the War, recently published a noteworthy article entitled "Americanization of Race Groups," which deals with educating our foreign-born inhabitants.</p>
   <p>Among other things, he says: "Let no one overlook the fact that the Government of the United States and the spirit of American democracy recognize no groups. People representing various races, languages, confessions, occupations, and stations of life live in the United States. Yet our inhabitants do not consist of groups of Englishmen, Scots, Irishmen, Germans, Swedes, Norwegians, Frenchmen, Portuguese, Italians, Bohemians, Poles, Greeks, etc., but of one hundred million or more individuals, a number of whom once were members of these or other races or nationalities. Our population does not <span class="page-break">\2</span>consist of groups of Christians, Jews, and Mohammedans, Catholics and Protestants, Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Christian Scientists, and Mormons, but of one hundred million or more individuals, a number of whom belong, or do not belong to one of the church bodies mentioned, or to some other sect.</p>
   <p>"The population of the United States is not made up of groups of farmers, textile workers, blacksmiths, and merchants, but of one hundred million or more individuals who follow one of the aforenamed or some other occupation. It does not consist of groups of poor and rich, employers and employees, landowners and renters, producers and consumers, tax collectors and taxpayers, but of one hundred million or more individuals of every financial standing, from the poorest to the multimillionaire, who continually climb up and down the ladder to success.</p>
   <p>"As a result all immigrants soon develop into Americans, though some individuals of all races may cherish the customs and memories by which they are <span class="page-break">\3</span>linked to the land of their fathers and to relatives who still live there.</p>
   <p>"There is no restriction of, no constitutional or legal prohibition against the use of any language. However, it is advisable that all inhabitants of America, even old people, earnestly study the English language because it is the language of the land, it is universally used, especially in commerce, and, in fact, is the language of universal literature.</p>
   <p>"All creeds are equally protected by the law and their adherents may live according to their rituals and dogmas, as long as these do not endanger public peace. However, in the sphere of American liberty, all strive for the religion of humanitarianism, for a ritual of acts of mercy, benevolence and patience--the doctrine of the brotherhood of man. The population of the United States consists not of groups, but of free men, women, and children. Sincere efforts to Americanize are permeated with the spirit of liberty and the knowledge that the dignity of man is much more important than the dignity of all groups."</p>
