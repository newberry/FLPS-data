   <p>Agent's Report</p>
   <p>Although the press reported that immigration from Europe had decreased greatly during the past year, and one might expect, therefore, that only a few applicants for assistance had visited our office during the month of December, the deduction is erroneous; in the past few months there were many calls for aid. As matters turned out, the financial condition of many who arrived here from Germany lately was such that they were obliged to ask for help as soon as they arrived in Chicago. In fact, a great number came to our office directly from the depot.</p>
   <p>We noticed especially that applications for assistance by women were unusually numerous; the majority of these ladies claimed that they had been deserted by their husbands. Even though we investigated each case thoroughly, it was impossible to determine whether or not everyone <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of these applicants told the truth.</p>
   <p>Your agent was so busy caring for the needs of local indigent Germans that the collector of the Society had to assist him in his work, every day during the past month in order to do justice to all applicants. Although the German Society of Chicago was called upon to help many needy Chicago Germans who were neglected by other societies during this winter, and to aid many others who could not obtain assistance from other sources, yet a comparison of December, 1873 with December, 1874 reveals that the financial situation of the poor class, especially of laborers, is better during this winter than it was last winter. While 4120 persons, among them 1714 women, applied for help at our office in December, 1873, there were only 1460 applications for assistance in December, 1874, only 376 of them by women. In December, 1873, 1554 persons applied to us for employment, but only 694 in December, 1874. We gave 784 persons cash relief in December, 1873, while in December, 1874, only 189 persons received this form of support. This indicates that the general financial condition has <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>greatly improved during the past year, and we hope that the fears which were expressed at the beginning of this winter, and filled the hearts of many charitably inclined people with anxiety, will not be realized.</p>
   <p>Following is a report of our activity for December, 1874:</p>
   <p>Letters received................... 34</p>
   <p>Letters written..................... 103</p>
   <p>Visits by employers................ 42</p>

   <p>Advice and aid given to........... 208</p>
   <p>Requests for relief................. 812</p>

   <p>"We also wish to thank the ladies' arrangement committee, of which Mrs. Bluthardt was chairman and Mrs. August Beck secretary, for their efficient work. Their labors, their zeal, their sacrifice of time spent in soliciting money and goods, and their willingness to co-operate in every respect were certainly most commendable.</p>
   <p>We also thank Mr. A. George, manager of the Turnhalle for the assistance he rendered during the entire Fair, and also at the raffle.</p>
   <p>Your committee hopes that the money which our treasurer will deliver to you, will enable you to carry on your noble work during this winter. We assure you that we made every effort to do what you expected us to do.</p>

   <p>Treasurer.</p>
   <p>G. Schneider, Max Eberhardt, and A. Loeb were appointed to audit the report of the treasurer of the Fair committee.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>The officers of the German Society of Chicago were instructed to thank the ladies who worked so diligently to make the Fair a success, the committees, and the German public for its faithful support of the enterprise.</p>
   <p>The following letter of grateful acknowledgement was composed by Mr. George Schneider, approved by the executive board and submitted to newspaper reporters for publication:</p>
   <p>"The executive board of the German Society of Chicago takes pleasure in gratefully acknowledging the efforts of the ladies and girls who so generously and faithfully gave of their time and efforts toward the success of the Fair, and without whose co-operation the gratifying results attained would not have been possible. We also express our sincere gratitude to those men who served on the various committees and also sacrificed their time and efforts in behalf of our charitable undertaking. We also thank the choral societies that did much to attract visitors and entertain them during the Fair. And finally we commend the Chicago Turnverein and its <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>able manager, Mr. A. Georg, for their advice and assistance, and the German people of Chicago who supported the Fair so liberally.</p>
   <p>"A. Schoeninger, President</p>
   <p>"Max Eberhardt, Secretary."</p>
   <p>Finally, the executive board discussed ways and means of checking (curbing) the number and extent of the demands for assistance, since the Society is not able to meet them. After much deliberation, the following resolution was adopted:</p>
   <p>"Resolved, that the German Society of Chicago will henceforth assist only those immigrants who have been in this country no longer than six months, excepting in cases of illness or emergency."</p>
   <p>Adjournment followed.</p>
