   <p>To our co-workers:</p>
   <p>We are well aware that we have made great and continuous demands upon the friends of this good cause ever since our organization was started. We would have failed in our duty if we had not done so.</p>
   <p>Since we began our collection drive, we have borne in mind that our humanitarian efforts must keep pace with the titanic struggle of our brothers in the old country. Limited only by our neutrality legislation, we aimed to give those who were bearing the heavy burden of war, our active support, and make them aware of the deep compassion which their brothers and <span class="page-break">\2</span>sisters here in America have felt for them.</p>
   <p>The result of our activities will show to what degree we have succeeded in that.</p>
   <p>It now seems certain that the contest which is raging in Europe will not be decided within a comparatively short time, as we had reason to believe in the beginning, but that this world conflagration may last months or even years.</p>
   <p>What is our attitude in view of this development? Can we or should we say: "Our work is finished. The generosity and charity of the Germans and Austro-Hungarians in America is exhausted. We cannot do any more? "We cannot do that. We mustn't!</p>
   <p>We would fail in the mission we have undertaken if we should argue like <span class="page-break">\3</span>that. We also believe that those who have so far willingly lent us their eager support would not be pleased if we should discontinue our work.</p>
   <p>And so the all important question presents itself: By which means are we to safeguard the continued existence of our Association? How are we to raise the funds which would make it possible for us to carry on with the task that is confronting us?</p>
   <p>We are turning again to those many thousands who have so gladly co-operated with us in the past. We now have to enlist a large number of members in our organization who will be willing to pledge regular contributions from now on until the end of the war. In other words, we want to put our War Relief Association on a permanent basis. That is the only possible way to continue this great work which has had such a promising beginning. Only in this fashion can we hope to be equal to our assignment, which is to <span class="page-break">\4</span>give relief and consolation to the wounded, the widows, and the orphans.</p>
   <p>We are confident that all those who have supported us in the past will continue to give us a helping hand in our future efforts.</p>
   <p>Bear in mind, you men and women, that you are living in a great time, unequalled in the history of mankind. Prove yourselves to be worthy of it. Do not forget those who are standing in battle and need your assistance. Remember the men who are risking their lives so that Germany and Austria-Hungary may not perish. Don't forget the tremendous sacrifices which are being made over there. Think of the wounded, and help provide the means to make their lot easier. Remember the ones who are left behind by those whom the war has claimed. Join the ranks of the men and women who are rallying around the banner of charity and mercy. As the men will be remembered who have fallen on the field of honor, you, too, will be remembered <span class="page-break">\5</span>in times to come, if you do your share in alleviating the suffering.</p>
   <p>German and Austro-Hungarian War-Relief Association.</p>
