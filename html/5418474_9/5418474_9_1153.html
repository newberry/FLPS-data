   <p>Lengthy report on the activities of the "Deutsche Gesellschaft" (The German Society). Means too limited to do much in the way of direct support of indigent. Address of the Deutsche Gesellschaft in all railroad stations, offices of German Clubs, etc. People came to it who lost their baggage, or seek relatives, or want to adopt children, or have relatives who need treatment in hospitals or insane asylums. There are daily cases of people cheated by the employment offices by building contractors and "emigrant runners". Frequently free tickets can be provided for people who want to join their families, or have work promised in some other town, or wish to return to Germany.</p>
   <p>Sometimes, families in Germany try to find runaway sons in America, or to get in touch with relatives who have not been heard of in years. The report gives many cases. The "Deutsche Gesellschaft" also helps Poles, Bohemians, Swedes, Danes, etc., but it could do much more good if it were" enabled by the liberality of our fellow-citizens to fulfill also the demands for material support that it receives."</p>
