   <p>For the benefit of the widows and orphans, the Chicago Lodges of the Order of the Hermann's Soehne are arranging at present in the "Aurora Hall" a grand bazaar that so far was visited by a large number of people, that certainly is twice as pleasing in view of its noble purpose. The Fair Committee did everything in its power to secure a genuine success for the affair, and also the other brothers and sisters of the Order have honestly done their part.</p>
   <p>From far and near beautiful gifts were received which are now exhibited in the large Theater-Hall... Yesterday afternoon the American-sisters held a jolly "Kaffee Klatsch" at the bazaar.</p>
   <p>The eloquent sister Augusta Ulm delivered a much-applauded address to the Coffee-Party.</p>
