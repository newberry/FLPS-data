   <p>The German Aid Society had about exhausted its means and was forced in the last session of its executive to give and in future only in cases of sickness. Yesterday the Society however had the great satisfaction to receive $1000.00. Mr. F. Madlener, 62 W. Lake Street, whose shop is so close to headquarters that he can see daily the misery, and Mrs. Bernauer, the owner of the house of the headquarters of the Society, each gave $500.00 spontaneously.</p>
   <p>The gift of Mrs. Bernauer is all the more impressive as she already had distributed $1200.00 directly to the fire victims.</p>
