   <p>One of the main features, perhaps the main feature of the present-day social program is called "Americanization". Americanization is undoubtedly beneficial and desirable, but it must not be limited to certain parts of the population; it must embrace all. It must not exclude the English, Canadian, or other English-speaking elements. Just to speak English does not make one an American by a longshot! There are many people who have not mastered the English language, yet are good Americans--much better Americans in fact than certain of the people who speak only English ever have been or ever will be. We refer particularly to Americans of German birth--they certainly have demonstrated their hundred-per-cent Americanism--but there are other non-Anglo--Americans who also make good citizens.</p>
   <p>It is a gross fallacy to make the mastery of the English language the prerequisite of Americanism and to make its study the first step toward it. It is equally fallacious to consider the exclusive use of English as proof of hundred-per-cent Americanism. One can worship American "idols" in other languages just as well as in English, and the principle of the American republic and its great problems can be interpreted just as easily in a "foreign" language. But this error is widespread; it is constantly nourished and disseminated, partly by systematic British propaganda which uses "Americanization" as a means of educating us to be British-minded, of making us suspicious and intolerant toward all other languages, and of convincing us that the ability to speak English is a prerequisite of good Americans.</p>
   <p>One of these apostles is undoubtedly that Chicago judge who, in his zeal for Americanization, grossly overstepped his bounds last Saturday by making a lot of stupid remarks which might have sounded highly patriotic but which were actually asinine and in the poorest taste.</p>
   <p>A damage suit dating from 1916 was on the court calendar. As the jury was being selected, the attorney for the plaintiff (a Lithuanian who had immigrated to this country in 1911) requested the appointment of an interpreter for his client. Here the judge saw his chance.</p>
   <p>"This man," he said, "does not need an interpreter. What he wants is a teacher, and I will give him a chance to get in touch with one. This case is continued to July in order that the plaintiff may learn English. If he has made good progress by that time his case will be tried, if not, it will be continued again and again until the plaintiff is capable of speaking English. This man has taken out his first papers, but has never managed to get his final citizenship papers. He wants to enjoy all the rights and privileges of a citizen, but he makes no effort to learn the [English] language, nor to understand or appreciate this country and its institutions. He has sent his money to his wife and child who are still in Lithuania. I have no patience with a fellow of this sort."</p>
   <p>It is hard to have "patience" with judges of this sort. They not only make themselves ridiculous, but the rest of us as well. By their arbitrary rulings and superficiality they discredit American jurisprudence and court procedure and excite the greatest danger the country could possibly face: the scornful and hostile attitude of a great majority of people toward our law-enforcing agencies. That judge (and there are many like him, doing exactly the same thing), by "sentencing" that Lithuanian to learn the English language and continuing the case until he has mastered it, has set himself above law and justice by arbitrarily placing the English language above these principles, and thus has perverted both. His extremely flimsy argument showed that he was intolerant, malicious, and petty, and therefore incapable and not fit to hold the office of judge, or else that he willfully misused his exalted position for cheap patriotic advertising, which would be just as bad.</p>
   <p>"Americanization" is fine, but it must be understood and worked out properly. Attempts at Americanization such as the one described above can never produce good Americans, but will only inspire hatred toward America.</p>
