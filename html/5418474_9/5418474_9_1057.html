   <p>The two last months in general did not offer much of anything of interest. The number of employment seekers of the various vocations is still great, and can clearly be contributed to the city's badly afflicted business conditions.</p>
   <p>By order of our President your agent visited a few hospitals of this city, as well as the Poorhouse and the Insame Asylum in Jefferson, first of all, to determine the total of Germans, and secondly, if perhaps cases are at hand in which the German Society could be helpful. The first visit called for the St. Joseph Hospital...the next visit was to the"Alexianer Hospital" on North Franklyn Street, one block South of North Avenue. The same does not differ very much in size and space from the St. Joseph Hospital. It is managed by 16 Brethren, calling themselves "Alexiania Brothers".</p>
   <p>When completed, also 200 sick can find accommodations. At this time there were about 35 patients, also every nationality was represented. About one third were Germans.</p>
