   <p>The fight of the anti-Saloon League in Evanston, involving the speakeasies, led to the detention of Albert Otto and Fred Krueger. As agents of the organization, they functioned as professional snoopers to ferret likely places and hail the owners into court for an accounting.</p>
   <p>They are accused of having committed that overt act: perjury. The plaintiff is George Kirsch, who recently defended himself before Judge Boyer on the charge of being a speakeasy operator.</p>
   <p>He claims that the testimony was perjured, and that the detectives were not in Evanston on the second day of January.</p>
   <p>August and Henry Hartmann were fined $10 for illegal sale of liquor.</p>
