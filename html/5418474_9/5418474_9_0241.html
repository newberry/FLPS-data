   <p>One of our unpleasant duties is to inform our readers that for lack of finances the German-American dispensary is forced to discontinue operating on May 1st. That our German citizens could not support this institution although the financial responsibility on their part was very small, is by no means a good sign. It may be true that times are not exactly rosy, but at the same time we can not believe that there would not be 350 among the 20,000 German families, who could spare four or five dollars annually for the support of this highly desirable institution. The fact remains, that from the 350 members of the Dispensary Society only 150 paid their contributions, and even a large number of those cut their contributions fifty percent. Bad times have evidently nothing to do with non-payment of membership, for the 150 paying members belong to the class who live from hand to mouth, while the 200 members unwilling to pay the dues, comprise the wealthy people.</p>
   <p>One of these is the county Treasurer, Louis Hick, who because of his German <span class="page-break">2</span>nationality was chosen for this well-paying office, but of the $40,000 annual income he cannot spare four or five dollars for poor German families for whom it is an impossibility to pay a physician, and who have to seek medical help at the dispensary if they should not become a burden to the county. The closing of this institution is most regrettable when the best of our German physicians made remarkable sacrifices, giving several hours of their valuable time daily, to help humanity, thus in many instances saving the breadwinner's life, whose family would have otherwise been forced on the relief rolls, which means the taxpayers' money.</p>
   <p>We refuse to accept this act of our wealthy citizens as final, and hope that the newly appointed committee will find ways and means to awaken again the interest of our people in this excellent institution with the needed financial help. The committee can reckon on the hearty support of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung.</p>
   <p>The report shows further, that the $600 granted by the county toward the support of this institution, has also been withdrawn. Saving on part of the <span class="page-break">3</span>City Council is important, but in this case they ought to realize that the sum paid toward the support of the dispensary is saved many times over in relief costs. It is a great injustice on the part of the City Council to stop the municipal contributions to the dispensary which is known for its excellent activities. We hope that the German members of the City Council will undertake steps to assure this German-American dispensary its former support.</p>
