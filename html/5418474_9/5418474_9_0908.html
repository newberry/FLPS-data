   <p>The German Society held its regular Session yesterday. Great numbers of new members were initiated and the agents report accepted. We quote from it: Almost twice the number of employers made use of our office during this month as compared with the previous one: 69 employers as compared with 40 in January. We supplied 176 unemployed persons with worl and shelter, against 75 in January. Among them were many immigrants.</p>
   <p>Last month's new arrivals in Chicago total 10,450 against 7, 200 in January, the majority of them coming from Westphalia and from Alsace-Lorraine. The agitation committee has been requested again to crusade against the crooked Employment offices.</p>
