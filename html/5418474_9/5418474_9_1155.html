   <p>The Agent Anneke presents new statutes for the Society that are then discussed.</p>
   <p>Name: "German Society of Chicago, Illinois,"</p>
   <p>Aim of the Society: To assist, advise and inform immigrants, giving them, if necessary , legal, and medical assistance. To help them in finding work, or to locate lost baggage, or to support them with money.</p>
   <p>By the term "German Immigrants" also Hollanders, Bohemians, Poles and Hungarians shall be understood, because these people have no representation of their nationality in Chicago, and it is hoped that this will influence their countrymen to join the Society.</p>
