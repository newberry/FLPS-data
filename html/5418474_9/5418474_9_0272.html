   <p>The hospital of the Alexian Brothers here in Chicago has recently been honored. In Laramie, Wyoming Territory, a hospital has been opened by the Union Pacific. Due to reports in Chicago newspapers that had attracted attention, the Union Pacific turned to the Rector of the Alexian Hospital asking him to take over the task of furnishing and administrating the hospital in Laramie. The request has been granted. From Aachen (Aix-Les-Bains) twenty brothers of the order will be coming here. Dr. Baxter and Brother Paulus will go with them to Laramie by way of Omaha. Professor Belcke will accompany the expedition.</p>
