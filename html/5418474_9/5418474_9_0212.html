   <p>The German Hospital again fulfilled its task, to give hospital help to all, regardless of the religious affiliations of the individual.</p>
   <p>HOSPITAL REPORT.</p>
   <p>Last year, 376 patients were accepted........Classification: - 208 men, 159 women, 9 children. Nationalities: - 251 Germans, 71 Americans, 16 Swedes, 11 Swiss and the remainder represented nearly every national group of the country.</p>
   <p>During the year 1888, two-hundred and twenty-five patients were treated.</p>

   <p>At the end of the fiscal year a cash balance of $1,045.42 remained but, unfortunately, there is an unpaid mortgage of $14,000, which to many of our friends appeared a heavy load. Help comes at the proper time! It was quite unexpected. On May 10th of last year, a letter was received containing a check for $5,000, a present from Mr. Chas. Wacker, in memory of his deceased father, Mr. Friedrich Wacker. The money was given to us without any stipulations and so the administration resolved, during a special meeting, to accept this most generous gift and to provide one "perpetually free" bed, to be known as the Friedrich Wacker foundation, a fitting memorial for a son who honored his father in such a splendid manner.</p>
   <p>During the last year, membership has increased more than 100 per cent. Last year there were 175, now we have about 400 members, "and more and more are coming."</p>

   <p>The average detention days per patient are 34 1/3. This amounts to 12,888 days of treatments for the 376 patients. Further details are available in our separate reports.</p>
   <p>Financially speaking, I may add that the hospital has made good progress and we have a very fair surplus. Nevertheless, I regret that we still have to pay $775.37 for interest, which I hope, will soon be eliminated.</p>
   <p>Expressions of gratitude to the liberal donors are appended in the report. It is signed by J. H. Henning, president.</p>
