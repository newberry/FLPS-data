   <p>In my monthly report for August, I recommended that the Immigration Board <span class="page-break">\2</span>at Castle Gardens, New York, abolish the immigrant trains designed to protect immigrants during the journey from their point of landing to their destination, but my recommendation has not been adopted.</p>
   <p>The employes of the New York railroads, which have leased Castle Gardens from the Board of Immigration, cheat immigrants in various ways. When exchanging the foreign money of immigrants for American money, railroad agents fail to pay the full current exchange value. Often these agents overcharge immigrants for tickets; they charge them the price of second-class tickets, but give them tickets that are accepted only on immigrant trains. It also frequently happens that agents direct immigrants on roundabout routes, and thus force them to spend more time and money than is necessary to get to their destination. Again, agents habitually charge immigrants for excess baggage without issuing a proper receipt, thus forcing the immigrants to pay twice for transportation over some parts of the trip. In many cases, agents also fail to issue receipts for immigrant <span class="page-break">\3</span>freight, causing many delays and difficulties [Translator's note: The rest of this article has been clipped out of the newspaper.]</p>
