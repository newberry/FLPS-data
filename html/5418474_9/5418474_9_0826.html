   <p>The German Society held yesterday afternoon , its regular monthly meeting; Mr. John C. Meyer president; Mr. Oscar Kuehue, the business manager, made the following report about the society's activity during April:</p>
   <p>There were few requests made for assistance on account of unemployment; most requests were made by families, who were visited by sickness, or were in need through the death of father or mother.</p>
   <p>All of them received consideration. Thirty-six families with 127 children, and 29 single persons were assisted, and altogether $243.83 were spent for this purpose. In 14 cases board and lodging was given; besides 10 pairs of shoes were distributed; 182 persons received employment. In comparison with the same month last year, the number of people getting work, was smaller due partly to the unfavorable weather conditions during April, and partly on account of poorer business generally prevailing.</p>

   <p>Among the many letters received pertaining to employment matters, was an inquiry for an able German physician, who could find a good position in a small town near Chicago. The manager is very willing, to supply any information desired. Contributions from members are $1007.00.</p>
