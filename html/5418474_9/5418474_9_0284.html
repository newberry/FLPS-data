   <p>The chairman of the Peoples Alliance of the Bernhard Community in Stuttgart writes: "Although conditions in general are improving in Germany due to the temporary cessation of the nerve-racking devaluation of money, there exists, nevertheless, considerable distress among people of the middle class. They lack money to buy even the most necessary items. Earnings are less,with living expenses vastly higher than before the War. Therefore, clothing, shoes, underwear, and bedding, have been used indefinitely, until a large part of the population walks about in rags. Here want always predominates. How gladly we would like to help the cultured people of the middle class whenever they knock timidly at our door. Thank God, and thanks to your contributions, we can occasionally ameliorate conditions here and there. And, therefore, we implore you not to tire in this work of neighborly love in seeking help among the members of your circle."</p>
