   <p>The dedication of this Home was cause for rejoicing by the German population. After a speech by Mayor Harrison, Dr. Hirsch stepped on the platform and delivered in German an excellent address: "This is an honor day for the Germans of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The German's home is like an anchor. Storms and high waters may rage but it holds fast to its anchor. Thus, this House becomes a home for the veterans in the battle with life. Like loving relatives we shall receive them here, to conclude the sunset of their lives in peace.</p>
   <p>The heart of the German-American is capable of still greater benevolence. Neither Church nor sect play any special part. Therefore, it is limitless... This Home is a monument to German womanhood. They have erected a haven to receive what is left, when life has ceased to maim and to crush.</p>
