   <p>The Johanna lodge distributed Christmas presents yesterday in the basement of the Sinai Synagogue, 21st Street and Indiana Avenue. Presents were given to sixty-six boys and thirty-five girls. The gifts consisted of nice warm wearing apparel. Every boy received a pair of pants, coat and vest, two suits of underwear, two pair of stockings, boots or shoes, hat, necktie, suspenders, shawl, and gloves. Each girl was presented with a raincoat, hat, underwear, shoes, gloves, and so forth.</p>
   <p>The benevolently inclined ladies of the lodge obtained the money by arranging a concert and apparently donated additional funds of their own--judging from the quality of the presents.</p>
   <p>Only a comparatively small number of children were present. As most of their parents had seen better days, and as the Johanna lodge did not want <span class="page-break">\2</span>the little ones to know that they were objects of charity, the presents were sent to the various homes.</p>
   <p>The children who came to the hall were given candy, nuts, cookies, and so forth.</p>
   <p>The ladies in charge of gift distribution prefer to remain anonymous.</p>
   <p>The old proverb applies here, "Blessed be the Giver".</p>
