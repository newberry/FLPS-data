   <p>J. F. Hoyt, who was indicted with A. C. Hesing and Jac Rebin for evasion of the income tax, has become a fugitive from justice. In a letter to his lawyer Mr. J. R. Doolittle, the fugitive Hoyt had this to say:</p>
   <p>"Since I met you last time, I have been told that corrupt witnesses have given perjured testimony against me. Under these circumstances, innocent as I am, I have to look for security."</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoyt's lawyers are not very proud of thier client. Mr. Hoyt's bondsman, Chas. Jerome, will have to pay the sum of $10,000 he put up for bond.</p>
