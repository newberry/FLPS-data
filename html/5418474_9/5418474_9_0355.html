   <p>which took place yesterday, was a great success... When time for delivering addresses drew close, Pastor Hartmann stepped onto the speaker's platform and introduced Mr. Wilhelm Rapp who said: It is indeed no glory for America ot the American communities that they do hardly anything to help the orphans in which they are far behind the monarchistic countries. But at the present time the air is full with all kinds of good intentions, and we hear so much about the duties toward the welfare of the oppressed, so let us hope that the care of poor children will be included in this duty... Most of our orphanages have been established by the benevolent spirit of the United Churches. The German Protestants of Chicago should be praised for the German orphanage; the German Catholics of Chicago have built that lovely orphanage in Rosehill, and the Jewish communities especially the German Jews are the backbone of that excellent orphanage in Cleveland.</p>
