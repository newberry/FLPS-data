   <p>It is not even remarkable any more that, every time something sensational happens in this country which glaringly illuminates some wrong, there are soon heard cries for new laws, regulations, or ordinances.</p>
   <p>This tendency to "lift yourself by your own pigtail" has long become a part of American existence; it is part of the stock in trade of politicians who like to demonstrate their usefulness by having their bills enacted into laws. Thus we became a nation plagued by all possible decrees, ordinances, and laws, as no other nation on the wide globe.</p>
   <p>Accordingly, it was to be expected that the tendency of the land, following the kidnaping of Mrs. Stoll, would soon be exhibited in a demand for a new law. It promptly happened. A federal law is demanded, hastily, which would <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>forbid the paying of ransom money for kidnaped persons. This demand is justified by pointing to England, where such a law exists, and where cases of kidnaping are quite rare.</p>
   <p>It is futile to argue with the sages of the land. They twist the facts in accordance with their own needs, and conclude that kidnaping is rare in England because there the law forbids ransom payments. Every one who ever heard anything about English justice knows that England's relatively low delinquency, which also goes for its possessions and dominions, can be traced back to that very justice, and not to its laws.</p>
   <p>That, in this country, a law forbidding the paying of ransom for kidnaped persons would be ignored one hundred per cent is self-evident. They will pay and, in case they are criminally prosecuted, will rely entirely upon the insight of the jury. The defense attorney could make it clear to the jury that, in many instances, human rights stand above the law. Such a law, even if it ever resulted in sentences for those breaking it, would only create "martyrs" who <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>would be certain of everybody's sympathies. The subsequent outcome would be that such a law would soon be repealed.</p>
   <p>That, on the other hand, appeals are made to the public for such half-baked proposals (which receive no thorough contemplation) is just as significant as an index to our public life as the plan hatched out by the religious leaders of Oklahoma to have clinics readjust marriages that have failed.</p>
