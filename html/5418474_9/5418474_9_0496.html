   <p>The President's Report</p>
   <p>The year 1930 will surely be called "the year of depression." It has been characterized in history by a large number of unemployed. Stagnation of business and communications has been so acute all over the country that even a large number of banks have been forced to close their doors. The Government tried its best to help by spending large amounts but up <span class="page-break">2</span>to now no improvement is noticeable.</p>
   <p>Under these conditions the demands for aid arising from widespread poverty have increased enormously.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as the present yearly report covers only the period from November 1, 1929, to October 31, 1930, as shown by the auditors I wish to state that the months of November 1930 and January 1931, were the hardest in the history of the German Society. During these two months more than $4,200 was spent in helping the poor. However, there are also good news to report. A collection by Abendpost netted $1151.50. Also through a drive by a group of women under the leadership of Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, Miss Amelia Birk and Mrs. Meta Llewes Burgweger, we received $1,316. Our Christmas drive brought $1,356.50. In short a total of $6,059.50 was received, which includes the following: United Men's Chorus, their concert in the Medinah Temple, $3,600;</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>German-American Liberty League, $1,000; Wieboldt's Foundation, $950; German Day, $300; Suabian Society, $250; German Club of Chicago, $160.25; and Christmas Drive, $1377.</p>
