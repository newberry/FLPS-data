   <p>The question of what is to be done with the proceeds of next Monday's old settlers' picnic has often been raised. Some suggested that the fund to be obtained should be given to the German [Aid] Society; others believed that the money ought to be donated to the orphans' home, but it appeared that such a disposition of the expected funds would not be favorably received and therefore other proposals were considered.</p>
   <p>Peter Wolf offered the following solution which, in our opinion, should find general approval.</p>
   <p>He said that there are many old settlers and widows of old settlers in Chicago who eke out a mere existence--people who never were able to acquire considerable wealth, and who were robbed by Chicago's great conflagration of the meager possessions they had acquired during former years.</p>

   <p>He [Mr. Wolf] and, undoubtedly, many others, know of such aged women, who barely support themselves from the products of their small gardens.</p>
   <p>How about giving the proceeds from the next picnic to these people? Suppose these women were at the picnic and the distribution took place then and there?</p>
   <p>The suggestion is feasible. Many of these poor people would greatly appreciate a few dollars, and the money would prove very helpful. We recommend this proposal to the Committee on Arrangements and hope that they consider it.</p>
