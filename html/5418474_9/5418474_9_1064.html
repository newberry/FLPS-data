   <p>The German Society held its regular monthly meeting two days ago. The agent's [representative of the Society] report for the month of November 1875 was read and accepted.</p>
   <p>"Considering the present depleted cash reserves of the Society it is a very fortunate coincidence that the winter has been mild so far; otherwise the Society would hardly have been able to do anything for destitute Germans. The favorable weather still permits building operations and that provides an income for a large number of people. This also became evident in our office, since an increase of only one hundred people [needing aid] was noted over the number of last month's applicants. In November there were 568 persons asking for assistance; in October, 468 sought help; whereas in November, 1874, 850 unemployed people called at our office.</p>

   <p>"This year the people did not ask so much for financial aid; most of them wanted employment; there were also a large number of homeless and unemployed single people who asked for temporary shelter or railroad fare in the hope of finding jobs elsewhere.</p>
   <p>"Regarding the various impoverished and destitute immigrant families which arrived here, only a few--the most desperate cases--could be given room and board from the Society's funds; the remainder were referred to the county for the alleviation of their immediate needs.</p>
   <p>"Your agent obtained assistance from the R. and Aid Society [Translator's note: The expression is abbreviated as shown; probably "Relief and Aid Society" is meant] in the form of cash, railroad tickets, blankets, clothing, etc. It is very difficult to allocate jobs in the city; unemployed people are everywhere present in great numbers; but there are still profitable openings for farm labor.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>"Altogether 568 persons applied at our office for aid during November, 450 men and 118 women; there were also 253 who wanted jobs. Only 26 employers called and therefore no more than 68 persons could be given employment.</p>
   <p>"Support was given by the county agent in 42 cases [and by] the Relief [and Aid Society (?)] in 28 instances; and free transportation was provided in 2 cases. Your agent succeeded in inducing various railroad companies to give reduced rates to destitute persons. The reductions sometimes amounted to one half of the regular fare and affected 16 applicants.</p>
   <p>"The German Society made small cash donations in 9 cases, and in 19 instances involving immigrants, we provided temporary funds for room and board.</p>
   <p>"Two patients were sent to the hospital and to the German Dispensary.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"We received 38 letters and mailed 43.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully,</p>
   <p>"Charles Endres."</p>
