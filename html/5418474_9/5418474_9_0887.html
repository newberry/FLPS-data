   <p>The German Society in the capacity of the good samaritan, held its 32nd annual meeting at Wiehoff's bank locality. The president of the German society Mr. Wilhelm Vocke read the report which stated, that the distress among the laboring classes the less intense during the year just passed. This statement is based on the grounds he said, that less requests were received by the society for a financial support. Our advice to Mr. Vocke is, that with his talent for national economy he try for a professorship: it would be really great loss to the World if he continues to waste his talent on an obscure little society, when the whole world could be benefited by it. Any one Mr. Vocke said, who could prove that not through a fault of his own had to apply for relief, financial support was extended him. Exceptions are made with "charlatans", "people who scorn work" "drunkards" and "professional beggars."</p>
   <p>During the strike in the stock yards, the society has placed 150 men there. A highly commendable thing for this society, to provide scabs for the oppressors! This koscher society's membership grew to 677, meaning that 15 new members joined last year. The immigration from Germany is on the increase; during the years 1885-86, 150,000 persons arrived in Chicago although many with different destinations in mind.</p>
