   <p>The doors of the South Side Turner Hall were opened last night on a benefit fair, the net proceeds of which are intended for the Boer nation. The large hall was magnificently decorated with the Stars and Stripes and the flags of Transvaal. The attendance of the first evening at the fair, was beyond any expectation. Much interest was exhibited in the shops, as well as in the splendid exhibitions of Turner performances.</p>
