   <p>The management of the Austro-Hungarian Relief Association directs the following appeal to the Chicago German element: "Friends: While war is raging in the old country, while our loved ones over there are starving and suffering, we are doing our part over here to relieve their misery. Money is being collected from all sources, and everybody is doing his best to make this relief work a success. That is why the Austro-Hungarian Relief Association has decided to arrange for a great bazaar, to be held at the La Salle Turner Hall, Larrabee Street near Garfield Avenue, beginning next Saturday, and ending November 22. Gifts valued at over one thousand dollars have been collected, and eighty beautiful young ladies will sell them. Every night there will be a different program, thus combining pleasure with business. The opening night, of course, will be a special affair.</p>
   <p>"The undersigned are appealing to all those whose sympathy goes across the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>ocean to the brothers and sisters in the old country, who have not yet forgotten their native soil, who stand for justice and fairness, and whose hearts feel compassion for all those thousands of victims which this bloody war is demanding every day. We are appealing to all who have love for their fellow men to participate in our bazaar, and to do their share, so that we can raise a large sum to be turned over to the German and Austro-Hungarian Relief Association.</p>
   <p>"Come one, come all! Help us, and show us that, as Germans, Austrians, and Hungarians, you are capable of a noble deed.</p>
