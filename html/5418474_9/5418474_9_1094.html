   <p>The Staats Zeitung corrected a few days ago an error of the Tribune. The Chicago Tribune claimed that the Germans had started their own charitable organizations, because they did not want their countrymen to become a burden on the Relief and Aid Society. We pointed out that the fact that the Germans did not receive due consideration was responsible for the organization of our charitable enterprises. Now comes the administration of the Relief and Aid Society to disclaim the correctness of our statement. We regret that we have to reiterate our statement and to prove it we publish a list of relief clients according to their nationality. This list is issued by the Relief and Aid Society.</p>

   <p>The Germans are much more numerous in Chicago than the Irish and yet are behind them. The Americans do not experience as much need and privation as the foreign born and still they are on top of the list. But where are the Polish, Bohemian, Swiss and Dutch relief clients. If one deducts the Dutch and Bohemians, it becomes evident that the mentioned nationalities have been counted with the Germans <span class="page-break">\3</span>and then we are far behind.</p>
   <p>We have no reproach to make against the administration of the Relief and Aid Society. But the visitor sent by the society is used to connecting misery with dirt and filth. If he comes to a place where the floor is scrubbed, the children clean and the bed neatly covered, he writes down "not needed". If the Relief and Aid Society was doing enough, there would be no reason for the Germans to start charitable organizations of their own.</p>
