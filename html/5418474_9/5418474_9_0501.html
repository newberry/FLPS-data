   <p>This year the German Society of Chicago celebrates its 75th year of existence. But can there be a question of celebration in view of the threatening economical conditions that now prevail? The aim of the society is and has always been to allay the terrible sufferings which a considerable part of the Germans in Chicago, especially the newly immigrated, have to endure.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the celebration of the German society should consist of alleviating the prevailing misery among the Germans of Chicago.</p>
   <p>During the war the funds dwindled considerably, so that new endowments are needed.</p>
   <p>History of the Society.</p>
   <p>The noble determination to help our people led to the foundation of the Society for Aid of the German Immigrants in 1855.</p>
   
   <p>This Society was the precursor of the German society of Chicago.</p>
   <p>An immigration train which contained mostly German immigrants, met with disaster, and many Germans were killed, while others were more or less seriously injured. Women and children, unable to understand the country's language, were robbed of all their belongings, and were completely destitute. Help became urgent, and there were people who did help.</p>
   <p>Among them was the German veterinary surgeon, Dr. Albert Borchardt. On this occasion he planned the organization of a society with the aim of assisting needy German immigrants.</p>
   <p>The organization of this society took place in the year 1855. The German immigrants of those years suffered far more than those of to-day.</p>
   
   <p>Agents of unscrupulous lodging houses charged these unfortunate people exorbitant prices for poor shelter and still poorer food, and often took all their savings. Dr. Borchardt induced the city council to forbid the agents to practice their dirty business any longer.</p>
   <p>The society thus was a real blessing to the German immigrant.</p>
   <p>The first real test for the society was the terrible economical crisis of 1857, in which year the depression reached such proportions that the newly arrived German immigrants were subjected to untold sufferings.</p>
   <p>Here the Society for the Aid of German Immigrants did its utmost to help.</p>
   <p>The year of 1859-1863 marked the suspension of the German Society of Chicago. The Society for Aid of German Immigrants was dissolved in 1859, and a benevolent society was founded, the Society for the Aid of New Immigrants.</p>
   
   <p>Then came the Civil war, which likewise created a severe economical crisis among the working classes.</p>
   <p>The Charitable Society became a worthy successor of the Aid Society.</p>
   <p>The restoration of the society took place in 1868 and received the name German Society of Chicago, which it still carries.</p>
   <p>At first the membership increased steadily. But then came a terrible blow in the great fire of 1871. All the books and documents of the German Society became a prey of the flames.</p>
   <p>The appeals now made to the society were endless as the misery caused by the Chicago fire knew no bounds. The German Society is now confronted with a great problem. How to alleviate the tremendous sufferings of the Germans this year? Whoever has a heart for the poor, should send his contribution to the German society.</p>
