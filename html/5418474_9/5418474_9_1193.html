   <p>Yesterday afternoon, a large number of German women met in Uhlich's Concert Hall for the purpose of electing an arrangements committee to support effectively the People's Fair to be held for the benefit of the Society for the Aid of German Immigrants. The assembly elected Mrs. Betty Faber chairman, and Miss Amalie Herzberger secretary. After H. Claussenius, C. Knobelsdorff, and Doctor Bessel had explained the purpose of the meeting to the ladies, and had requested that they assist in making the Fair a success, it was decided to participate in this worthy benevolent cause and to elect a committee of twelve to make the necessary arrangements. The following were chosen to serve on the committee: Mrs. John Metz, chairman; Miss Amalie Herzberger, vice-chairman; Mrs. Lena Emmett, secretary; [and nine others, whose names are omitted in translation].</p>
