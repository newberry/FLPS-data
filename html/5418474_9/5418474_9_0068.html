   <p>The Mutual Aid Society of United Austrians and Bavarians will celebrate its summer-festival and picnic on Sunday, July 13, at Fritz's Grove near Clybourn and Webster Avenue.</p>
   <p>These Austrian and Bavarian celebrations are so interesting, that they do not need any special recommendations from us.</p>
