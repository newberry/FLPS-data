   <p>The American Bar Association has again adopted a resolution demanding that unscrupulous criminal lawyers be disbarred. Homer C. Cummings, Attorney General of the United states, agrees with the Association. It can hardly be assumed that the action of the Association and its endorsement by the Attorney General will have any effect whatever on the situation. For the unscrupulous criminal lawyer has become an institution, so to say, in our American life, and that institution is very deeply rooted. Other countries too have their pettifoggers and shysters, but the latter have a hard row to hoe. They are tolerated as long as their dishonesty remains unnoticed. However, the legal profession and the public in those countries regard them as inferior and even despise them.</p>
   <p>The situation in our country is quite different. Here results are the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>criterion. They decide the standing of a lawyer. If he succeeds in averting a fine, a jail term, or a death sentence for his client, by adroitly applying legal technicalities, or even worse methods, he is not despised, perhaps, nor is he considered to be an enemy of our social order; on the contrary, he is admired and envied. Our Federal Government deserves credit for ridding the country of professional criminals. Lost of our public enemies are lying under green sod. Others have the opportunity to contemplate the changeableness of fate behind prison bars. This removal of criminals from "circulation" was accomplished in a few years. And it was not long ago when it was stated publicly that sooner or later organized society would have to surrender to organized crime.</p>
   <p>Naturally, the abolition of prohibition had much to do with the extermination of our worst criminal element. However, when we recall those days we cannot but remember the learned and eloquent gentlemen who, next to the professional bodyguards, gave the archenemies of society the greatest protection--we mean the prominent criminal lawyers. They made use or every <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>legal technicality they could think of to "protect" the interests of their clients. It was absolutely revolting to note that habeas corpus proceedings were filed as soon as a professional criminal was arrested. This was done to keep them from being exposed to the slight discomfort of a short stay in jail. Frequently, the lawyer was at hand with an application for habeas corpus before the criminal was brought to jail.</p>
   <p>Habeas corpus proceedings, like many other legal technicalities that are in use in our country, originated in English law. Why are they not applied in England to make orderly legal procedure difficult, or even impossible? Everybody knows that England's penal code is rigidly enforced. A few years ago Sir Basil Tompson, the Chief of Scotland Yard, said that in England ninety-eight per cent of the murderers are put to death no later than three months after the date when the crime was committed. Our average is only two per cent, although our murder rate is much higher than that of England.</p>
   <p>The reason why the same laws have a different effect in England than they do <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>in America lies in the fact that the attorneys in England have a different conception of the legal profession than American lawyers have. That is true or State's attorneys as well as of the attorneys who conduct the defense. Our State's attorneys consider it to be their most important duty to bring about the conviction of the accused, irrespective of whether he is guilty or not. The lawyer defending the accused, on the other hand, considers it to be his foremost duty to gain an acquittal, and he too does not permit himself to be influenced in his conduct of the case by the guilt or innocence of his client.</p>
   <p>However, English and Canadian lawyers, and those of most of the other civilized countries of the world, have a different conception of their calling. In these countries both the State's attorneys and the defending lawyers desire, above all else, to see right and justice prevail. The State's attorney does not deem it his foremost duty to have the accused convicted, but frequently recommends that the latter be acquitted. If the guilt of the accused is evident, his attorney does not seek an acquittal, by trying to <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>prove that his client is innocent. Owing to this difference in conception of duty, the methods applied vary. Inducement to purjury, bribing of witnesses, and highly dramatic opening of cases, are everyday occurrences here, but they are unknown in other countries. And yet the difference in conception with reference to duty is by no means the deciding factor. The attitude of the public is responsible for the conditions as they exist here. When a cunning lawyer succeeds in extricating his client from the clutches of the law the public admires him,even though it is convinced that the accused is guilty. Americans are accustomed to placing success above justice and right, and all endeavors to exterminate the underminers of justice will be frustrated by this attitude of the public.</p>
