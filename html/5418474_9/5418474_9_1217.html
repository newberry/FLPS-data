   <p>The ladies of the German Division of the Northwest Fair met on Sunday, October 26, at the German House for the purpose of receiving gifts from German contributors. By three o'clock in the afternoon, four hundred and sixty donations had arrived and the ladies had all they could do to estimate their value and to number them.</p>
   <p>Anyone wishing to get an idea of the accomplishments of German industry and perseverance in the cause of the Union, specifically in behalf of our sick and wounded soldiers, need only view the many crocheted, knitted, and embroidered articles which our diligent ladies have made for the Fair.</p>
   <p>It is impossible to describe all the things that have been delivered at the German House; however, we shall mention some that are especially attractive.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>We saw a sofa that was plaited of the finest straw and which will grace any parlor. On one table there were the finest silver spoons, forks, knives, and napkin-rings, and even gold penholders with silver handles--all of them the handiwork of our German ladies. In the embroidery department especially, there are many very fine articles: pillowcases, coverings for chairs, seats, beds, tables, sofas, etc; all in a harmonious variety of colors. There is also much excellent network, and many good knitted articles, such as shawls, mufflers, ladies' and men's caps.</p>
   <p>We could continue telling about other interesting and useful articles that we saw, but we are convinced that our readers will profit more by going to the German House and seeing them. And, lest they forget, these things must be sold, if our soldiers are to be cared for.</p>
   <p>On our "sight-seeing tour" we noted particularly, that men were conspicuous by their absence. The ladies were doing all the work--even decorating the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>room in which the articles are to be displayed. They ought to avenge themselves by making many sales to the men. We hope that the latter will come with well-filled pocketbooks.</p>
