   <p>The Chicago Medical Association has taken steps to expel one of its most prominent members, the widely known urologist Dr. Louis Ernst Schmidt. This action was taken on the grounds of his alleged unethical conduct. The executive body of the Medical Society has accused Doctor Schmidt, president of the Public Health Institute and the Illinois Hygiene League, of having extended medical assistance to patients for either a very nominal charge or, as was often the case, for no charge whatsoever.</p>
   <p>Since the Public Health Institute does conduct a rather extensive advertising campaign in newspapers, his conduct has been regarded as a direct challenge to the Medical Association. This organization, acting to protect its members, states that, as a consequence, medical men with private practices have no <span class="page-break">\2</span>chance whatsoever to remain in the field of competition.</p>
   <p>The Medical Association met last night at 185 North Wabash Avenue to discuss this so-called unethical conduct and to deliberate upon the expediency of ousting Dr. Louis E. Schmidt, the world famous physician. Several hundreds of the 4,500 members of the Association attended the special meeting, which was held behind locked doors. However, the distinguished guardians of the physical welfare became oblivious to everything except their animosity, and thus raised their agitated voices to a high pitch. This was, of course, meat for the reporters, who, in their usual manner, waited on the other side of the door and scarcely missed a word of the lively discussion.</p>
   <p>Doctor Schmidt a distinguished-looking gentleman of sixty years, has faithfully served suffering humanity during the greater part of his lifetime. Now, however, this distinguished medical authority, recognized and honored by colleagues throughout the world, and by his fellow-citizens as well, had to listen to the <span class="page-break">\3</span>accusations brought against him by the assembly, as it ascribed unethical methods to him.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the usual courtesy of giving the accused a chance in his own defense was altogether denied Doctor Schmidt, and when Doctor Yarros, of the Public Health Institute attempted to intercede in behalf of Doctor Schmidt, she was noisily defeated. And because of these parliamentary tactics, Doctor Schmidt was utterly helpless and was unsuccessful in his demand for a hearing. Only after the assembly had agreed almost unanimously upon his ouster from the Medical Association, was order restored, and the accused physician at last permitted to speak.</p>
   <p>Doctor Schmidt pointed out that the institution of which he is president has extended free treatment to innumerable thousands of sick persons in impoverished circumstances. "Furthermore," he said "the institution pursues a different aim than that of making profit." It is also true that, through their connection <span class="page-break">\4</span>with the Public Health Institute, our clinics have achieved outstanding success in combating venereal diseases.</p>
   <p>This venerable humanitarian and unselfish man, who has assisted many a young man in his medical career, and who has treated many of his own private patients without receiving remuneration, was grieved beyond expression as he addressed the assembly. He said: "Is it considered a great wrong if a physician offers his services to an institution which was founded with the purpose of alleviating suffering among mankind? Must I discontinue my efforts and interest in humanity because the Public Health Institute, by means of extensive advertising, has chosen to warn the general public of the seriousness of venereal diseases? If this is requested of me, my reply is that I cannot comply with this request. Moreover, I demand that the executives of the Chicago Medical Association regard my point of view as absolutely ethical, and that they institute immediate action by which medical science would be at the disposal of the great masses." Doctor Schmidt's proposal to submit his case <span class="page-break">\5</span>to a more thorough study, which would result in the withdrawal of his proposed ouster, was given prompt and very swift consideration. The Medical Association immediately announced that Doctor Schmidt had been found guilty, and that his expulsion had been demanded a second time.</p>
   <p>It appears most likely that other well-known members of the Chicago Medical Association are confronted with a similar fate. The physicians thus threatened are: Dr. Hermann N. Bundesen, Coroner; Dr. Rachelle Yarros, and Dr. J. L. Miller, all of whom are members of the Administrative Council of the Social Hygiene League. They, too, wholeheartedly approved of the Institute's extensive advertising campaign conducted in the fight against venereal diseases.</p>
