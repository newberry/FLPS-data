   <p>Mr. Knobelsdorff presents a letter from Ernst Keit of the Gartenlaube in Leipzig and a draft over 1,000 Prussian Thalers ($740. in gold), collected for Germans who have been impoverished by the fire.</p>
   <p>Mr. Knobelsdorff defended the Germans of Chicago against the charge of stinginess. Many German merchants had contributed to the non - German Relief Committee, sums of $500. The German Society should circulate a list, and some eminent Germans, like Mr. Claussenius, Mr. Rosenthal, Mr. Hesing, should put their names with $500 at the top, then soon enough money would accumulate. Mr. Hesing declared instead of $500 in a lump he would like to give $100 annually. Mr. Knobelsdorff said, in this case he would give $50 annually.</p>
   <p>The society then elected officials for next year. President, Geo. Schneider; vice president, Consul H. Claussenius; secretary, Rev. Guntrum; treasurer, Henry Byroth.</p>
