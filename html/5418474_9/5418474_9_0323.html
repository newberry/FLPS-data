   <p>In "Ogdens Grove" , Clybourne Avenue this years picnic for the benefit of the above home took place last night. Beautiful weather favored the festival and a great number of members of different charitable institutions were present. At the present time the number of orphans in the Institute total ninety two. The guests and orphans amused themselves with various plays, assisted by the housefather C. A. Herrmann, and the Women's Club of the Orphanage catered for the refreshments donating the money out of their own pockets.</p>
   <p>Pastor John of "St Paul's Church" gave a speech in which he referred to the loss by death of housefather Leising. He expressed the hope that the home would flourish under the new management. The speaker recommended the orphanage for the benevolence and charity of the Germans in Chicago and hoped that they would contribute as they hitherto have done and so the festival ended in the most pleasant way. Mr. Wilhelm Knocke, John Bauer and W. Schenke deserve special praise for the way they organized and arranged the amusements, and so the picnic at the Orphans home resolved itself into a happy ending.</p>
