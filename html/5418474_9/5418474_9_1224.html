   <p>A report from the Ladies' Aid Society dated March 13, 1863, and signed by Mrs. Julie Butz, treasurer, stated that Mrs. Louise Degenhardt and Mrs. Elise Schneider left for Memphis, Tennessee Thursday, March 12, to distribute the articles which the Ladies' Aid had purchased for sick and wounded soldiers.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Degenhardt and Mrs. Schneider will confer with America's Florence Nightingale, noble Mrs. Harvey, widow of the late Governor of Wisconsin, and it will depend upon her advice whether or not the Chicagoans will go to Nashville. The report of the ladies will be published later.</p>
   <p>Following is a list of articles which have been shipped to Memphis at the expense of the Chicago Sanitary Commission and will be distributed:</p>

   <p>The above articles were purchased on advice of Judge Skinner, president of the Sanitary Commission, who has considerable experience in such matters. The remainder of the money which was contributed will be used for the benefit of sick and wounded soldiers who are now at home (in Chicago), after the expenses of Mrs. Degenhardt and Mrs. Schneider have been deducted. The Illinois Central Railroad gave them free passage to Cairo and back to Chicago. (Telegraph and Union, please copy.)</p>
