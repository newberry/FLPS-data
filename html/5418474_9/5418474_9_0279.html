   <p>Sister Kaethe Fischer, directress of the Infants Home in Hilden, near Duesseldorf, Walderstr. 161, writes: "Our Home takes care of very young children, varying in age from several days up to three years, providing shelter in cases where the mother died, or, where it becomes necessary for her to earn a livelihood. It also includes children who are physically weak and ailing."</p>
   <p>"The poor suffer severely. The cost of milk, coal, light, clothing, and underwear is prohibitive, unsurmountable. May the Good Lord bless the benevolent people who help us."</p>
   <p>Also the Children's home, Newhaus A. Tun, sends a call for help. The Home, built in 1720, needs sanitary improvements, and the directress <span class="page-break">\2</span>does not know how the necessary funds might be procured. Cash gifts are very welcome and would be greatly appreciated by all inmates. M. Theodora Altman, superintendent.</p>
   <p>Doctor Eidam, Chief Medical Advisor in Gunzenhausen, asks help for two benevolent institutions. The Children's school, where children from two to six years are fed in a modest manner, and the Milk distribution department. If these two institutions fail, due to prevailing high prices, then the youngsters are doomed. The older ones will loaf on the streets, and the younger ones die in droves, in the same manner as formerly, before I organized these two projects. The small contribution given by the local community is insufficient to continue this work, and, therefore, I beg you most ardently to help us and to have mercy upon our poor children. God will reward you, and we, as well as the children, will thank you heartily.</p>

   <p>Mrs. Ida Steuer, Altona, Goebenstr. 29, lived in Russia before the War. She lost everything and thus far the German government did not give her any indemnity. What she is enabled to earn is not enough to sustain life.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Caroline Oppolzer, 86 years old, widow of a captain and her sixty-six year old sick daughter ask for help, as neither is able to earn <span class="page-break">\4</span>anything. Both eke out an existence, depending upon the charitable contributions of their compatriots. Wien 2, EH. Karl Platz 20.</p>

   <p>Sister Anna Marie Wenzel quotes from a recent communication: "Allow me to express my heartiest thanks for your present. You would enjoy seeing how we utilized everything. The overcoat was converted into a Sunday short coat, a sort of hunting-jacket for my large boy, and the girl is over-joyed about the white silk dress which I fashioned out of the white silk coat by using a little imagination." Frieda Salmon, widow with nine children, Berlin-Schoeneberg. Grunewaldstr. 71.</p>
