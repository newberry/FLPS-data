   <p>A week ago today a storm laid waste the town of New Ulm in Minnesota, a city which was regarded far and wide as a monument to German diligence and perseverance. Hardly a building remained undamaged. More than 200 families are homeless. The town has only 3500 inhabitants, mostly Germans. Many families have lost their sole support, and many others face the same misfortune, since more than 70 citizens were seriously injured when their houses were destroyed; more than 20 have already been buried.</p>
   <p>When Chicago became a smoldering ruin, New Ulm's citizens were the first to send a carload of flour to our stricken fellow citizens. But New Ulm's catastrophe was proportionately vastly greater than the destruction which the fire caused in Chicago, and furthermore, not a single person was insured.</p>

   <p>The distressing conditions are indescribable, and help is urgently needed; if it is not forthcoming, the entire German community will perish. The Germans of Chicago, who received help from the people of New Ulm when fire drove us from our homes, are bound by gratitude to help the stricken inhabitants of New Ulm now, when they appeal to us and have confidence in us. Duty requires that we give gladly and generously.</p>
   <p>In order to organize a drive for aid, a meeting was held at the Turner Hall Wednesday evening; it was fully described in yesterday's issue. Those present nominated a committee consisting of Messrs. F. Madlener, August Beck, A. C. Hesing, H. Schultz, George Schneider, S. Friedmann, Rudolph Brand, Louis Wahl, A. Schoeninger, Fritz Hartmann, Henry Weber, Jacob Heisler, Theodore Arnold, Charles Wacker, T. J. Lefens, and Henry Hochbaum in order to render organized assistance. The committee was supposed to meet again yesterday afternoon, but because of a misunderstanding about the day the session had to be postponed to ten o'clock this morning.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The above-mentioned gentlemen are urgently requested to come to today's meeting in the clubroom of the Sherman House at 10 A.M.</p>
   <p>Collections had already begun to pour in on Wednesday evening, when the organization was being contemplated; $225 had been received at that time. To this amount the Illinois Staats-Zeitung adds another $55, of which $50 was sent to us by Mr. Schwab, and $5 was received anonymously by A. C. Hesing.</p>
   <p>A nice start, to be sure, but it is only a drop in the bucket. Damage in New Ulm amounts to $300,000, and at least $100,000 is needed to protect the homeless from starvation and cold before the approach of winter. If Chicagoans are able to raise this sum without outside help, they will repay in part what the world sent to this city after the great fire.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schwab's Explanation to the Editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>Today's issue of your paper gives an account of a meeting which was held for <span class="page-break">\4</span>the purpose of organizing aid for New Ulm; the article also mentions that I treated somewhat gruffly a gentleman who came to see me in the interests of the people of that city. I admit making the statement attributed to me, but it would be a great injustice to me if the strong declaration which I made at that time were to be regarded as my true sentiment toward the Germans. I was highly incensed by the Jewish persecutions prevailing in Germany of which I had read; I had also been approached shortly before on various matters involving a considerable strain on my benevolence; in short, I was in bad humor, and when the gentlemen spoke to me about New Ulm, it did not improve my temper.</p>
   <p>I believe that the fact that I have always been ready to do something for the Germans during the twenty-eight years which I have lived here, aiding with money or indirectly, doing whatever it was in my power to do, has given the public a truer opinion of my sentiments toward the Germans than may be deduced from my thoughtless remark.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>To prove that I also am liberally inclined toward New Ulm, and that my heart is in the right place, I am herewith enclosing a check for fifty dollars, which I ask you kindly to hand to the committee in charge.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>Charles H. Schwab.</p>
