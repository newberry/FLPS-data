   <p>Few benevolent organizations have enjoyed such a rapid development as the Bismarck Society, which now celebrates its first anniversary. Organized to provide sick benefits and life insurance, especially for the poorer class, the society not only has a membership of over one thousand persons, but has also given aid to the organization of similar societies in other parts of the country.</p>
   <p>The anniversary was celebrated last Saturday in the hall of the Aurora Gymnasium, where the reception of delegates from Cincinnati, Detroit, Lexington, Philadelphia, Omaha, Ottawa, Milwaukee, and St. Louis took place.</p>
