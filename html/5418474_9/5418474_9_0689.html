   <p>A committee of women has been formed under the auspices of the German-Austro-Hungarian Aid Society, which is particularly interested in the welfare of prisoners of war, the civil as well as military contingents of various countries.</p>
   <p>This new association, which calls itself "The Garners," endeavors to assist the Aid Society in its work to ameliorate conditions among prisoners of war in Siberia and Canada, as well as elsewhere. The women intend to collect money, but particularly, warm clothing, underwear, shoes, socks, and other items of importance to prisoners. Shipments will be sent to the detention camps by the Aid Society.</p>
   <p>It is desirable to increase the activities and, therefore, more coworkers are needed. <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>All women wishing to be affiliated with this work, should write or call in person at the office of the did Society, 154 West Randolph Street.</p>
