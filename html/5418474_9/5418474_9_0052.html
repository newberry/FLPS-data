   <p>At a mass-meeting which was held yesterday afternoon by the members of the Germania society, ten of the sixteen existing local lodges declared their withdrawal from the society. They proceeded immediately to establish the Independent Benevolent Society Germania. Other lodges will follow their example very shortly. Their headquarters will be in Chicago. The reasons for the withdrawal briefly stated are: 1, dissatisfaction with the business management of the society; 2, refusal of the central office in New York to investigate serious complaints; 3, declining to comply with certain requests; 4, the deliberate postponement of licensing the society in the state of Illinois.</p>
   <p>The new society, beginning with three hundred members, promises to keep its agreements in regard to sick and death benefits which had been made with members when they joined. The official of the old Central Propaganda Committee will take charge of the new society until the election, which will take place in June.</p>
