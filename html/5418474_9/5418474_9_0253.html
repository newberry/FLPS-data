   <p>The German-American free drug store is now two years old. During its existence it has provided 4500 persons with free medical aid and free medicines and has in most cases saved the job for the patient and thus averted need and suffering. It gives us pleasure to say that the public has appreciated the work of the physicians who have founded this institution and have been able to keep it on a sound financial basis. It is to be hoped that all who have contributed toward this work will continue to do so, in order that sometimes the dream, i.e., a German hospital may become a reality. The importance of such an institution for German people unfamiliar with the English language has been pointed out by Dr. F. Hotz. May the German people continue to give their full support to this cause.</p>
