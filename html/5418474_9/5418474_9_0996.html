   <p>As winter approaches, requests for aid increase; younger and single people especially have difficulties. This contingent represents seasonal labor, such as farm workers, and now that the harvest is gathered these men are out of work. In October we had many requests (more than one hundred), and we gave board and shelter to thirty-nine persons. Last month we gave temporary aid to sixty-two people.</p>
   <p>Requests for fuel made by poor people living in Chicago also showed an increase. We provided coal for twenty-four families.</p>
   <p>During the month we obtained hospital treatment for nine homeless and destitute persons (7 were single, 2 were married; in one of the latter cases the family still lived abroad, in the other, the family was in the East). We take this opportunity to thank the directorate, as well as the physicians of the Alexian Brothers hospital, who so readily granted our requests in behalf of <span class="page-break">\2</span>the aforesaid men.</p>
   <p>We had many applicants asking for railroad fare and we obtained free transportation for ten, and reduced rates for twenty-nine people.</p>
   <p>There were 273 persons asking for jobs, and we gave 144 addresses to them. During the month forty-seven employers called to hire help. Besides, 288 people sought aid and advice in various matters.</p>
   <p>Our total cash expenditures in November amounted to $331.15.</p>
   <p>During the month immigration was fairly large; 2050 emigrants from Europe reached Chicago, according to available figures. As formerly, the Norwegians, Swedes, Danes, and Russians (Mennonites) are in the majority--then follow the Germans.</p>
   <p>The Norwegians, Swedes and Danes were estimated at 700 in all--300 Norwegians, 300 Swedes, and 100 Danes. Most of them were farmers who went to Illinois, <span class="page-break">\3</span>Wisconsin, and Minnesota to settle on farms.</p>
   <p>There were about 200 Britons (this included Irish and Scotch) whose goal was Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, or Kansas.</p>
   <p>The Russians, mostly German-Russians, were estimated at 250 to 300; all continued their journey to Dakota.</p>
   <p>About 150 Italians passed Chicago, on their way to California. There were about 200 to 250 arrivals from the German Reich; most of them intended to remain in Illinois and Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>French, Belgians, Swiss and Dutch, mostly farmers, were estimated at 250 to 300, all told; they continued their journey to Wisconsin and parts of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Bohemians, Hungarians, and Poles (about 200) went to other sections of Illinois, and also to Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>We had 797 calls at our office during the past month: 507 men and 270 women called.</p>
   <p>We received sixty letters and mailed 222.</p>
