   <p>Yesterday's concert of the Evangelical parishes of Chicago and vicinity, which was given at the Central Music Hall, Corner Randolph and State Streets, was an outstanding artistic, as well as financial, success. The net proceeds from yesterday's income will add a sizeable sum towards the building fund for the annex of the Bensenville Orphanage and Home for the Aged. This institution has been supported by our Evangelical communities for the last five years. The addition is to be built in the Spring.</p>
   <p>The first number of the exceptionally varied program was Burowsky's <span class="page-break">2</span>"March Solenelle," played in a masterly manner by the far famed organ virtuoso, Dr. Louis Falk. The next selection was Lalo's violin solo, "Symphonie Espagnole," rendered by Earl R. Drake which delighted the audience. As an encore, he gave "The Sea Glistened to the Far-Away Horizon." Mrs. Carl Brandt's selections brought well-night unending applause, necessitating an extra offering. She sang the "Aria of the Tage" from Meyerbeer's "Huguenots".....Friedrich Schoensted's piano solo, "La Somnambula" (Somnambulist) by J. Leybach, evoked calls for repetition....</p>
   <p>As a divergent feature, Miss Alma Kaufhold gave several excellent recitations. Although only a school-girl, she showed profound musical talent. The most imposing number of the evening was undoubtedly J. Pache's composition, "In the Spinning Room," wherein the soloists and choir of St. Peter's Parish, consisting of about fifty ladies and twenty five gentlemen, proved their attainments, giving credit to <span class="page-break">3</span>their diligent director, Mr. J. A. Michel. The public accorded them well deserved applause.</p>
   <p>Judge Theodor Brentano then addressed the audience, lauding the philanthropic attitude of the Evangelical Protestants.... We quote part of his speech: "Many of you who are accustomed to seeing me among mundane surroundings will wonder why I should have been requested to speak here. The answer may be found by our standing on common ground, where men of the worldly right should collaborate peaceably with men of the divine law.</p>
   <p>Our vocations in life may show different trends, religions, beliefs separate us, personal interests clash, views and habits prescribe our definite paths, but on one point we should stand united, zealously, <span class="page-break">4</span>unselfishly--in the realm where we meet today--charity. This is our great duty as a human being. Mankind must be possessed with a noble spirit, show benevolence and have good character, and therein alone are we differentiated from other living creatures. But above all, it is a dictate of the religious, the Christians. And if the name of this parish is of any significance, the Evangelical Synod, which desires to imbue us with a spirit of love for its benevolent institutions, then it might be said that it is built on an Evangelical foundation acting in accordance with Evangelical principles in the spirit of Christ, its leader and His apostles; following their tenets it will not attack its enemy, but will love Him instead. It does not only protect the helpless, but actually comes to the rescue--not merely watching the forgotten orphan, it becomes a foster-father and mother, and even provides a loving home for the decrepid and aged.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The wish to ameliorate humanity's position, and practicality in achieving it, is commendable and deserves emulation. In my opinion, not only the Germans, but especially the members of the Evangelical Church glorified themselves in showing their sense of charity whenever the occasion arises, and thereto must be added this genuine Christian institution.</p>
   <p>The creation and maintainance of the orphanage and infirmary represents the recognition of an evident duty. If this work of the various churches and communities proceeds in the proper spirit, then it will prove a great blessing and benefit, because the external and internal success of religious benevolent activities is entirely dependent upon the mental outlook. If the evangelical attitude is applied, then the efforts will be blessed in proportion to our adoption of its commands.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>One notes in the Evangelical Church in particular, that the profoundest blessings in the realm of philanthropy filter down from above. In this creed, which represents the religion of Germany, where the emperor is the ecclesiastical, as well as temporal ruler, one is impressed by his noble example of ceaseless, personal donations for the charitable institutions of his domain and creed.</p>
   <p>And the Evangelical Synod of North America endeavors to follow the path of the church of our old Fatherland. The synod does not only consist of ministers, but comprises all members, and by that I mean the evangelically-minded, who face a great, sacred duty which not only involves them, but it includes all Germans, invoking their generous support for this benevolent institution which has done so much good heretofore, and intends to continue its humane work. The maintainance and successful continuance of these labors are an honor involving us <span class="page-break">7</span>all.</p>
   <p>Even if every tear has not been dried, nor all sorrow swept from the portals of mankind, yet, nevertheless, everyone can do his share to decrease suffering and ameliorate conditions which afflict humanity, whenever called upon to aid the aged, the weak, destitute, the waifs and orphans. It behooves us to help the cause on general principles."</p>
   <p>The Teutonia Male Chorus....and the aforementioned artists contributed selections for the closing numbers....</p>
