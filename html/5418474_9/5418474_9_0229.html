   <p>This new hospital situated in the most beautiful district of the northwest side will serve all people without discrimination as to race or color. The administration of this excellent institution is in the hands of Germany Roman Catholic Sisters, and it was built from contributions by our German citizens of all faiths. The imposing building can justly be called a German hospital, for it was planned and built by German people, and German women, who are willing to devote their lives to suffering humanity. It will be conducted after the pattern of German institutions of this kind. Archbishop Feehan assisted by several clergymen, officiated at yesterday's dedication after which the Rev. Edward Koing of St. Paulus Church in Fort Wayne, delivered the inaugural speech in German. He was followed by many other speakers, each one praising the work of the German Sisters. One of them was A. C. Hesing, who, as is well known, was one of the most ardent and untiring workers in behalf of the hospital. Mr. Hesing joined the preceding speakers in tribute to the Sisters, recalling the year of the small-pox epidemic and its terrific death toll, and went on to tell of the desperate situation in which Health Commissioner Dr. De Wolf found himself, when the attendants at the hospital for infectious <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>diseases deserted the poor victims. Then these heroic Sisters came to the rescue and cared for the small-pox patients. An act of heroism which does not find its equal. Chicago is indeed lucky to have at last, a German hospital, the management of which is in the hands of these noble women. The first floor of the hospital consists of a reception room and office, rooms for temporary mental cases, several rooms for paying patients, the pharmacy, operating room, a ward for male patients, the temporary chapel, a bathroom, toilets, and pantry. The second and third floors consist each of four small wards with six beds in each, and a number of private rooms with two bathrooms and closets, on each floor. Room is reserved in the center of each floor for a conservatory, A water container, with a 9,000 gallon capacity, was placed in the attic and is to supply the third floor with hot and cold water. Another praiseworthy act was that of John W. Rhode, who adorned the walls of the chapel, reception room and office, with picturesque fresco paintings and then announced to the Sister managers of the hospital, that this valuable work was a gift from him. The building cost approximately, $65,000. The rather large piece of property was bought for $20,000.</p>
