   <p>The plan of the Dawes commission has been accepted by the German government, but it is untimely to expect that everything in Germany is "now as of yore." Many months will pass, before its influence will become apparent in the German economic system. We must help the sufferers during the interim. Unemployment and disaster affect the entire German nation. Therefore, continue sending good, fresh, nutricious, strengthening American food to your loved ones, as heretofore.</p>
   <p>The packages of the Central Committee contain carefully selected food stuffs, with the idea in mind to supply products which, due to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>their excellence, will bring undernourished bodies quickly to normal. Our packages contain the best food obtainable in the land and are therefore highly welcomed by Germany's unfortunates.</p>
   <p>Those without relatives requiring help in Germany, should donate the cost of a package to the Central Committee for the sake of the destitute in general.</p>
