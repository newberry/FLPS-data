   <p>Under the chairmanship of its president the German Society of Chicago held its annual general meeting yesterday afternoon. After the detailed minutes of the previous annual meeting had been read by the secretary, Mr. Rudolf Seifert, President Michael F. Girten presented his report for the year. According to the figures submitted the disbursements were considerably greater than the receipts, as has been the case ever since the outbreak of the war. Naturally, the Society was called upon to assist many Germans who have not yet become American citizens, and the sums authorized for benevolence, including Christmas gifts, totaled $8,920 during the past year. The accumulated capital was greatly decreased, owing to unusual circumstances. However, Mr. Girten expressed the hope that the German Society of Chicago would be able to continue its blessed activity, which consisted not only in rendering material aid, but also in obtaining work and giving good advice free of charge. These latter forms of activity were of great value to local German subjects.....</p>
