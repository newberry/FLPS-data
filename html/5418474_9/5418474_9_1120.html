   <p>All the butchers who have suffered through the great fire are asked to visit the undersigned committee on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, between 2 and 4 o'clock, at the corner of Union and Randolph streets. At the same time we ask all Chicago butchers, whose business places have not burned down and who wish to help their burnt-down business comrades, to get in touch with us in order to organize help for the urgent need.</p>
   <p>(Signed): R. Lotholz, Jacob Koch, Moses Berg, and Jacob Schneider.</p>
   <p>(The retail meat business in Chicago is almost exclusively in German hands, and these people must be helped both from here and from outside, because they deserve and need it. Our common interest is to keep this important business in German hands.)</p>
