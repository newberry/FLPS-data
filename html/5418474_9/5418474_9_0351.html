   <p>Our present orphanage is too small to take care of the constantly increasing needs of the German Catholics who desire to place motherless or fatherless children in our institution.</p>
   <p>Only three years ago it was necessary to erect a building to provide schoolrooms and dormitories--and this year a three-story building, 24x74 feet, was added. The lower floor contains the bakery and laundry, the second floor is used as a dormitory, and the upper floor is used as a drying room, etc. This building and other improvements cost about $4,000. In order to raise this sum, we appeal to philanthropic people of the community. On Wednesday, October 8, the annual festival is to be given at the orphanage. An extra train will leave the Milwaukee depot at Canal and Kinzie Streets, at 10:10 A.M., and will return at 5:45 P.M. Admission tickets are twenty-five cents, and if you hold the lucky number you will win a buggy. Railroad tickets cost forty cents.</p>

   <p>As usual, ample entertainment will be provided. The children--under the direction of the sisters--will give recitations, songs, and stage performances, and the committee has made arrangements to serve lunch.</p>
   <p>A cordial invitation is extended in behalf of the orphans.</p>
   <p>Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>The Executive Board,</p>
   <p>L. Biehl, Secretary.</p>
