   <p>The Bethesda Messenger writes as follows about this institution, which is very close to every German in Chicago:</p>
   <p>The hospital was able to close its first year in the new home under very favorable conditions. A total of 228 patients were admitted and nursed, within its walls, and, taken as a whole, the success was very satisfactory in every respect. Thanks to the many friends who so liberally support this institution, the management had no financial difficulties and a considerable cash surplus was on hand at the end of the year. The building fund of course, is not so fortunate because there is quite a deficiency of funds to cover all expenses, yet, during last year over $8,000 were paid out, which the contributions of many friends made possible.</p>
