   <p>The Directors of the German Society held a meeting, yesterday, and passed a resolution requesting the Council of Administration to employ more collectors and to put on a drive for new members.</p>
   <p>American and German wholesale houses shall be visited and solicited for back donations, for the reason that these firms indirectly profit from immigration. As soon as we have enough testimony collected, we will prosecute all employment offices engaging in fraudulent practices.</p>
