   <p>The German Hospital, which is overcrowded with patients, is in a bad plight in regards to space and nursing requirements. Particularly the need of more nurses is felt to be a growing calamity. All nurses, trained at the Bethesda Heim and transfered to the German Hospital, are not sufficient. Therefore the Director of this Hospital is sending out and appeal now to serious minded girls, who wish to become practical nurses. Any applications are accepted at the Bethesda Heim or in the office of the German Hospital, where all particulars can be learned.</p>
   <p>The whole training course, which is supervised by well known, noted physicians will last two years. At the end of the 2nd year, a diploma is given to the trained nurse-graduate, who then can decide to become either a private nurse or a hospital nurse.</p>
