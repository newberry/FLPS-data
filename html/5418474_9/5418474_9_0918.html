   <p>The donations for New Ulm of late have not been very liberal. Perhaps it may be advisable for Chairman Rudolph Brand to call together the members of the various collection committees and remind them of their duties.</p>
   <p>Those gentlemen also who sold tickets for the New Ulm benefit concert should hurry a little in settling their accounts. New Ulm still needs considerable help, and Chicago's Germans have fallen far short of doing their duty toward the stricken city.</p>
   <p>Treasurer Madlener sent $500 to New Ulm the day before yesterday and reported that he had received the following amounts:</p>
   <p>From Inhof and Meyer [collection committee]: Alderman Inhof, $5; [various anonymous contributions]; total $31.</p>

   <p>From T. Arnold [collector]: J. Eckmann, $2; total $8.</p>
   <p>From F. Madlener [collector]: Dr. T. J. Bluthardt, $10.</p>
   <p>From F. Washausen [collector]: Wehner and Company, $5; total $6.</p>
   <p>Up to August 23 the relief committee for New Ulm had received a total of $37,188; $10,819 of this was from Chicago.</p>
