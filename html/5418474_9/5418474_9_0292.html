   <p>The plain but thrilling words of the Angelus: "Behold, I am a maidservant of the Lord," which reveal such unlimited confidence, humility, and submission, such all-embracing love, may have been the motto of that small group of sisters--there were three of them--who,on November 9, 1868, first came to Chicago, to assume a parent's place for those children who had become orphans. They were the Sisters Maria Hyacinta, Maria Bella, and Maria Corona of the Society of the Poor Maidservants of Jesus Christ, whose headquarters are still in Dernbach, in the Diocese of Limburg on the Lahn (Germany). In the middle of the nineteenth century there lived in this place a servant girl named Katherine Kasper, who was deeply distressed by the hard times which then prevailed, the social misery, and the complete lack of adequate hospitalization. Bishop Blum of Limburg was, at that time, active in word and deed among his parishioners in an effort to alleviate the distress and, inspired to action by <span class="page-break">2</span>the enthusiasm of this great man, Katherine Kasper enlisted the cooperation of sympathetic maidens for the relief of the distress which existed at that time. She herself went into the homes of the poor, the sick, and the friendless; helped wherever she could; took care of the children and adults and cleaned their living quarters; supplied the sick with medicine, and praised her Lord and Saviour from the bottom of her heart that He had considered her worthy of performing these services in His name. She and the girls who accompanied her moved into a shabby little house in Dernbach, which was later to become headquarters for the Society of the Poor Maidservants of Jesus Christ, founded August 15, 1851. Later Katherine Kasper became the Mother Superior of this benevolent sisterhood and assumed the name Mother Maria. She was in charge of the order until she died in 1898.</p>
   <p>There are two things which the German has always preserved, no matter where fate has put him, namely, loyalty to his native tongue and adherence to the faith of his fathers. Faith and homeland are, indeed, two closely related ideas! Here, too, in America, the Germans have kept close together regardless of material <span class="page-break">3</span>gains. Thus German communities of the Evangelical and Catholic faiths were established. This sentiment which prevails among Germans prompted Bishop J. H. Luers, of Fort Wayne, to call the Poor Maidservants of Jesus Christ from Dernbach to his diocese. The Vicar-General of the Bishop of Chicago at that time was the Reverend Peter Fischer, a real dyed-in-the-wool German. He was at the same time President of the German Orphan Society and had,a few years before, founded the Guardian Angel Orphanage, which was managed by a married couple. Immediately upon their arrival in America, Father Fisher called the three venerable sisters who have been mentioned above, to Chicago; and on November 9 they took over the Guardian Angel Orphanage. This was their first real settlement in America, as the headquarters in Fort Wayne were not founded until the following year, up to which time the pioneer sisters of the Order resided in the vicinity of Hesse-Kassel, in the Diocese of Fort Wayne. The services which the good sisters have performed here, because of their untiring love for humanity, belong to the history of Chicago's welfare organizations. We shall point out, therefore, only the main items in their fruitful activities.</p>

   <p>The name of the Guardian Angel Orphanage, on Devon Avenue, has become familiar to all Chicagoans. The institution has had a wonderful record. Nearly eight thousand children have been brought up, educated, and clothed by the sisters since the Orphanage was established. Children of all ages have found a good and comfortable home there. The sisters take care of orphans and of semi-orphans who have been abandoned by their father or mother. One has to see with one's eyes how the children, big or small, love the good sisters, really to appreciate this wonderful institution. The president of the Orphanage, the Reverend Georg Eisenbacher, co-operates with the sisters in managing efficiently.</p>
   <p>But the Poor Maidservants of Jesus Christ must do more than merely be of service in the Orphanage. Their love for suffering and starving humanity made them enter other branches of charity also. Faithful to their duty, they went into the dwellings of the sick and helped as much as they could.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>These efforts were climaxed when the sisters opened a cloister in 1875, dedicated to the Mother of God of Everlasting Help, and located on North Avenue near Hudson Avenue, from which thirty sisters served as visiting nurses and provided medical care. In connection with this cloister, the sisters opened up the first day nursery in Chicago in 1879.</p>
   <p>When, at the beginning of the eighties, a smallpox epidemic broke out in Chicago, it was again the Sisters of the Society of the Poor Maidservants of Jesus Christ, who went courageously into the homes of the disease-stricken and administered aid. The fight against that disease was, at that time, not such a simple matter as it is today, and a person afflicted with smallpox was shunned as if he had leprosy. For weeks at a time the nurses had to remain quarantined with the patients in their homes. After the plague had been conquered, the city built the hospital in which patients with contagious diseases were isolated, and the sisters were put in charge. This paved the way for hospital service and, in 1887, the sisters opened the St. Elizabeth Hospital, one of Chicago's model hospitals, under the supervision of the Reverend <span class="page-break">6</span>Sister Polycarpa. Another hospital of which the sisters are in charge is the St. Anne's Hospital at 49th Avenue [sic] and Thomas Street, which was ready for service in 1903.</p>
   <p>The services performed by the sisters in the field of juvenile education can be attested by many able and efficient men today, who have sat at their feet in the various parochial schools of the city. Since 1884 the sisters have been teaching at the St. Augustinus School and for years have taught at St. Heinrich's and at the Heart of Jesus School.</p>
   <p>The seed which was transplanted from Dernbach has borne glorious fruit. The work of the good sisters was blessed because faith and love were their only motives.</p>
   <p>Today we can visualize a long procession of noble nuns who labored as Poor Maidservants of Jesus Christ in that society of sisters. At the head of the list <span class="page-break">7</span>we must mention the good Sister Hyacintha. With only brief interruptions she was superintendent of the Guardian Angel Orphanage until 1885, when the chapter of the Society elected her provincial of the headquarters at Fort Wayne. There she died just three years ago. Sister Blanca was the Mother Superior only a short time, from November 9, 1872 until October 10, 1873, when she died. She was succeeded by Sister Radegundis, who was Mother Superior from 1885 to 1889, and she was followed by Sister Bartholomea, Mother Superior from 1889 to 1895, and at present first assistant at the Orphange. After her came Sister Closinde, from 1895 until 1897, who died in Aviston, Illinois. She was succeeded by Sister Bertina, who was in charge of the Guardian Angel Orphanage until 1916. Her successors were the Reverend Sisters Lucia and Hubertina. The Senior Sister here in Chicago is the venerable Sister Paschalis, who has been active at the Orphanage for forty-six years. No one else is as capable as she in teaching the boys and making them behave. She is now seventyseven years old and is still supervising the garden and conservatory of the institution with untiring efforts.</p>
   <p>It was originally intended to celebrate the sisters' jubilee on November 9, the <span class="page-break">8</span>day when the sisters took over the Guardian Angel Orphanage. But the influenza, and the prohibition of public meetings during the epidemic, frustrated this plan. The jubilee, in which everybody who can appreciate the work of the sisters would gladly participate, will be held on November 26. At ten o'clock a High Mass will be celebrated, which Archbishop [George W.] Mundelein will attend. The Holy Communion will be consecrated by the Reverend Theodore Gross of Blue Island, who will be assisted by the Reverends Louis J. Maiworm, August Nunnewinkel, and Dominicus Diederich. The above-mentioned priests are former pupils of the sisters. The Vicar-General, Monsignor Francis J. Rempe, will deliver the sermon. After a banquet, inmates of the orphanage will give a performance.</p>
