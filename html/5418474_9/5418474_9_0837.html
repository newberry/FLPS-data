   <p>held last night under the auspices of the German-American Charity Ball Association in the auditorium hall, has been a great success in every respect. There were about 4000 persons present, members of the City Councils, Judges of the Court, Representatives of the various Municipal Departments and all the heads of the many German Institutions of Chicago. The great Polonaise was the climax of the evening. The "Hands" Orchestra and the Military Band of the first regiment conducted by Mr. Brooks had been won for the evening, and contributed by their magnificent play to the success of the evening.</p>
   <p>The festival parade started in two columns at 9:30 which was the opening of the ball and all the celebrities took part in it. The net profits as far as can be ascertained at present were about $8000.00. This amount will be distributed principally among the German Hospital, the Alexian Hospital and the German Home for the Aged, but in case of great need, no distinction will be made as to religion, nationality or race.</p>
