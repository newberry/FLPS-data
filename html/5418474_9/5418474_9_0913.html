   <p>The Ladies Aid of the German Society will serve luncheon in the afternoon and evening today at Baum's Pavilion. The affair will appeal to any one who likes German environment. Not only will good entertainment be provided; there is a greater motive. All who come to this gathering will actually help our poor as well as the unfortunate people who lost their possessions in the Michigan fire.</p>
   <p>At yesterday's executive session of the Society it was decided to appeal to the people, to show what dire distress prevails among some of the poor families which the Society is now taking care of; and this proves what a large field presents itself to private charity! At the same time the members of the Society are urged to attend in full numbers and to bring their friends.</p>
   <p>A business meeting of the members is scheduled for this evening at eight o'clock.</p>
