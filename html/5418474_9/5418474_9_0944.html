   <p>As reported elsewhere, the collections for the sufferers in New Ulm proceed in a lively though not oversuccessful manner. Indications are not lacking, however, that the various committees which have not yet reported are doing their utmost to make the affair a credit to Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is highly desirable that every committee member appear tomorrow morning at ten o'clock at the clubroom of the Sherman House, where a session will be held to consider what else can be done for the people in New Ulm.</p>
   <p>In the interim no one desiring to give aid should wait until a committee member calls. Mr. Madlener, treasurer of the Relief Committee, as well as the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, will accept contributions for the New Ulm fund at any time and give a receipt.</p>

   <p>The proposal to give a great concert, presenting combined choral singing as well as separate offerings by our local singing societies, has met with general approval. The committee on arrangements requests all leaders of song clubs to come to the meeting tomorrow afternoon at five o'clock, at Quincy Number Nine, to speed up the preliminary work.</p>
   <p>The ladies who are members of the mixed chorus are urged to appear at Brand's Hall [Germania Hall] on Friday evening at eight o'clock. The committee relies on the participation of the ladies to make the concert a success and hopes that no one will be absent.</p>
   <p>Mme. Peschka-Leutner has unfortunately already returned to Germany, but it is hoped that Miss Cary, the favorite of Chicago's concertgoers, will participate. Mr. Lindau also, who was prevented from appearing in the Song Festival because of his father's death, has promised to participate in this concert.</p>
   <p>The concert will be highly successful if the singers make the proper effort.</p>
