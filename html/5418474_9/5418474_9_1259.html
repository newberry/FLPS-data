   <p>They are extremely worried in Washington because they fear that rumrunning was not completely abolished along with Prohibition. The Federal Authorities are convinced that liquor smuggling has decreased to the same extent as the sale of bootleg whisky or gin which is very little. The Government agents do their best to halt the smuggling from Canada, Cuba, and other countries. However, it looks as though the smugglers are winning in their struggle with the Government agents. The American coast is a long one and the smugglers have excellent motorboats which they use to break through the cordon of the customs boats. The Canadian boundary is difficult to watch, and since the reduction of the customs personnel, it seems impossible to prevent whisky smuggling. At any rate there are great quantities of untaxed whisky and other liquors in the country, the presence of which cannot be explained in any other way. The prices demanded for them are naturally lower than for the beverages regularly imported and taxed.</p>
   <p>It is likely that a larger amount of forbidden wares is brought into the country by airplane. The country is large, and even though the customs officers may become suspicious of an approaching airplane, they lack the equipment to pursue it, or to discover its destination. To trail these ships without airplanes is well nigh impossible, in view of the size of the country, the great uninhabited or sparsely populated areas, and the inaccessible mountain regions which afford many hiding places. It is purely accidental when the police in outlying districts happen to discover these lawbreakers.</p>
   <p>In addition to smuggling there is also illicit whisky distilling which continues to flourish as before. Although today fewer "wild" liquor distilleries are raided than two years ago, this is no indication that the number of these distilleries has decreased, or that less liquor is being distilled; this condition is merely the result of a reduced customs personnel. One hundred officers can work more successfully than only ten or twenty. However, one should not be surprised to read of an occasional raid on illegal distilleries. Sometimes it is just sheer luck when police officers discover a "still". This was the case when detectives from the state's attorney's office, while on the search for stolen autos, hit upon a hidden distillery having an estimated capacity of one hundred and fifty gallons a day. One hundred and fifty gallons a day make about fifty thousand gallons a year--a sizeable quantity, but surely a mere drop in the bucket of the whole country's illegal liquor production. It is alleged that the quantity of whisky produced without the knowledge of the customs officers is no smaller than that produced legitimately.</p>
   <p>All efforts of the Federal and State authorities to put an end to this evil situation will remain futile as long as illegitimate whisky, gin, etc., is sold at prices lower than legal liquor. If we really wish to destroy the business of the bootlegger, we must realize that our method has been faulty until now. The search for and raiding of a few distilleries is as futile as chopping off the heads of the hydra. For every distillery raided there is a new one which immediately springs up in another place, and which, in turn, will have to be snuffed out again. Even punishment of the persons arrested during the raids will not alter the situation. The real owners, the persons who provide the financial support, are rarely caught; and the employees are aware that they always run the risk of being caught, but they take that risk because it is generally quite not so dangerous, and also, because they are apparently remunerated, or at least well compensated.</p>
   <p>The overthrow of the bootlegger can be effected only by a reduction in the prices of legitimate alcoholic beverages. Recently the prices have been slightly reduced, but not low enough to spoil the business for the bootlegger by far.Besides, the whisky which is sold under the label of legitimate business is by no means a source of pure joy. Genuine aged whisky is still forbiddingly expensive, due to its rarity. Most people, not blessed with an abundance of earthly goods, must be satisfied with a liquor which costs less, and since moonshine is seldom inferior to this cheap legitimate whisky, and in addition is much cheaper, it seems that the bootleggers' business is founded upon a secure basis.</p>
   <p>Persons left holding the bag are, for the most part, those administrative officers who joyfully anticipated increased incomes in taxes from the sale of alcoholic beverages. They intended to milk the cow a little too vigorously, and so they are left in the lurch.</p>
   <p>The only way to eliminate the bootlegger is to reduce the prices of alcoholic spirits. This will not be possible without a reduction of the various taxes imposed upon them. The Federal Government, and the State and Municipal Administrations will sooner or later all have to deal with the problem. Why don't they do it as soon as possible?</p>
