   <p>Yesterday afternoon the Agitation Committee of the German Society held its meeting, to find means and ways to assist German immigrants.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kerkel explained in a long speech that it would be of great benefit to Chicago if immigrants travelling through the city formed a favorable opinion of it. According to his views it would not be so very difficult to induce some persons or parties to make donations, let us say: 10 at $100.00, at least 20 at $50.00, at least 50 at $25.00, at least 100 at $10.00. It should be possible to find at least 4000 more who would make annual contributions to the Immigrants' Protective Fund of the German Society.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kenkel then was elected General Agent for the purpose of soliciting new members: as assistant for the Southside Mc Damman will function for the Westside, Mr. Riese.</p>
