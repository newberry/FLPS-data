   <p>Not all sides seem to agree with Judge Altgeld, whose opinion is that young criminals under age should be sent to Reform Schools or ought to have a severe punishment by their parents.</p>
   <p>The Humane Society is pointing to the case of Judge Wallace, who bound young Richard Collaghan over to the Criminal Court for stealing 50 cents and therewith placed the blame on Judge Altgeld. Apparently Judge Altgeld did not know, that the young defendant was arrested before for stealing a horse.</p>
   <p>Also the boys, who were transferred to the Criminal Court by the Judges Doyle and La Buy, had criminal records and obiviously could not be reformed any more by bodily punishment.</p>
