   <p>Although the exact amount collected by the Deutsche und Oesterreichisch-Ungarische Hilfsgesellschaft (German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society) for the relief fund is not yet known, we can say with assurance that the results of this humanitarian and philanthropic movement will certainly not be disappointing. The number of donors and subscribers is considerable, and after the many collection places have been established, the locations of which will probably be published within the next few days, the results will be still more gratifying.</p>
   <p>The manner in which the collection lists will be published has not yet been decided. Last night, during a meeting of the finance committee, under the chairmanship of Karl Eitel, it was pointed out that it would be too much trouble to send a complete daily list to the newspapers, for since the finance officers are performing their duties voluntarily and without aid, it would be impossible for them to make copies of the complete lists everyday. There are also other <span class="page-break">\2</span>pertinent considerations.</p>
   <p>The way this matter is going to be handled will be decided at the meeting next Wednesday in the presence of the entire committee. As proof that the movement is popular we like to mention the fact that this morning Julius Kessler, a member of the finance committee who is out of town at present, instructed his manager to mail a contribution of one thousand dollars to the Aid Society. This was promptly done.</p>
   <p>Those who would like to collect smaller amounts on behalf of the good cause will be furnished with coupon books up to five dollars, with single coupons of twenty-five cents each. These coupons will serve as receipts.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the Aid Society has sent the following petition for incorporation to the state capital:</p>

   <p>1. The name of the company is to be Deutsche und Oesterreichisch-Ungarische Hilfsgesellschaft von Chicago.</p>
   <p>2.

   <p>The management of the German Club of Chicago also held a meeting last night in the Bismarck Hotel. A committee of twenty-five members was appointed to take care of collections among the club members. Collected sums will, of course, go to the main fund. A special circular which will probably be mailed tomorrow will point out to the club members that the time has come to open up hearts and purses.</p>
