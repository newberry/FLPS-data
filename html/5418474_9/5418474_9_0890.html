   <p>The Executive Committee of the German Aid Society held an important meeting yesterday, in order to come to a decision regarding German soup kitchens. There are more unemployed this year than during last winter. The misery is particularly severe among newcomers from Germany, who do not speak sufficient English to contact freely with employers of any kind throughout the city.</p>
   <p>The establishment of soup kitchens would be a great blessing for this multitude of unemployed men who in the majority are single and homeless. The German Aid Society has received, already, generous offers from German groceries, meat markets and bakeries concerning permanent donations of food supplies. This will be a great help towards the upkeep of the planned soup kitchens. There will be a soup kitchen in every district of Chicago. The German Ladies' Society has expressed its willingness to cooperate in every way, to make the humanitarian enterprise a success.</p>
   <p>There will be another meeting next week to hasten the opening of the German soup kitchens.</p>
