   <p>The German lodges of the "Odd Fellows" intend to build with their own means a home for widows and orphans. Discussions concerning the execution of this praiseworthy project have been going on for some time. A committee was appointed to work out a plan for the raising of funds. This plan is now ready. It will be discussed at a meeting of the representatives of all the Chicago "Odd Fellow Lodges" next Saturday afternoon at 2 o'clock in the rooms of the Robert Blum lodge, at the corner of Lake and LaSalle Sts.</p>
