   <p>Not in a long time have as many members come together as last Sunday in the Aurora Hall. The purpose of the meeting was: The receipt of the report of the delegates to the National Grand Lodge meeting which was held in New Ulm, Minnesota, and second: Conference over ways and means to restore the Order to what it was years ago because as is true of all other organizations, hard times and many deaths have caused many gaps.</p>
   <p>After a long report of the Grand President Mr. Aug. Behrens, he declared, that the National Grand Lodge resolved unanimously in their last meeting to come to the assistance of the Illinois State organization, in order that in the shortest possible time all claims for death benefits can be paid to the widows and orphans. After the request was made by several gentlemen to hold truly to the Order and to recall all the good that has come from it during its fifty-seven years of existence, an unanimous resolution was accepted, to arrange a grand "Fair" for the benefit of the widows and orphans of the Order and to entrust the directors with the preparatory work.</p>
