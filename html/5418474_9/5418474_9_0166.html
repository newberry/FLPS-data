   <p>Edward G. Uihlein, treasurer of the Citizens' Committee in charge of the building project, said, "The prospects are auspicious and indications show that the necessary funds can be collected."</p>
   <p>The Tuberculosis Hospital is to be built next spring. The sisters of St. Elizabeth Hospital will take care of the inmates.</p>
   <p>As the building will cost $150,000 the treasurer has just published a prospectus containing a detailed account of the committee's activities, 5,000 copies of which will be distributed among businessmen. It is expected that all those who have thus far not contributed toward this humane work, will do their share now.</p>
   <p>The treasurer reports new contributions to the extent of $454. The total <span class="page-break">2</span>fund available, including interests, amounts to $20,067.</p>
