   <p>The Ladies' Auxiliary of the German Society held its first annual meeting and election of officers yesterday afternoon.</p>
   <p>The president, Mrs. Hedwig Voss, opened the meeting, after the reading of the minutes, and submitted the year's report which we append:</p>
   <p>Report of the President</p>
   <p>To the members of the Women's Club: One of my duties consists in giving a general account of our status at the annual, general meeting. This is a pleasure, indeed, as I have only agreeable matters to speak of, and, much has already been exhaustively covered in the reports of our capable officials, so that I need give only a partial report.</p>
   <p>In response to an appeal of the executive board of the German Society we <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>organized the Ladies' Auxliary in March, last year. On the first Wednesday in May the permanent officers were elected. Their tern expires today. Shortly thereafter the delegates to the German Society were elected. At present we have about 260 members. Some, for various reasons, resigned recently, but every month we have additions on our list.</p>
   <p>Our receipts were about twelve hundred dollars and more than one half of that amount was given to the German Society as required by the bylaws. A large sum was donated by us directly to poor women and children at Christmas; one hundred dollars was sent to the fever sufferers in the South, and the remainder was used to defray various expenses regarding which the treasurer will give you detailed information.</p>
   <p>During the year we had fourteen executive meetings and sixteen regular sessions.</p>
   <p>The club gave four afternoon entertainments and arranged a Christmas celebration <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>at which gifts were distributed to poor children. The latter entailed the most effort, but the members expressed a desire to make similar preparations for this year....</p>
   <p>The other entertainments brought considerable increase to our treasury and also served in uniting our group more thoroughly and in promoting friendship.</p>
   <p>Our efforts were lauded and well appreciated. However, we consider it but a womanly duty to ameliorate suffering, and deem it our greatest reward when we are given thanks by the recipients and perceive their happiness.....</p>
   <p>When cases of distress are reported by our members to the agent of the German Society, then you may rest assured that all possible aid will be forthcoming and the most pressing needs will be attended to immediately.</p>
   <p>The same applies to our newspapers, and many artists, including amateurs who collaborated with us, as well as the public in general. Let it always be said <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of us that we are working in concord and. that we are motivated by a true spirit of philanthropy. Thereby many of similar attitude will become affiliated with our club, and those suffering through adversity may then rely on us for help.</p>
   <p>The Executive Board,</p>
   <p>Hedwig Voss, president,</p>
   <p>Clara Schneider, secretary.</p>
   <p>The Treasurer's Report</p>

   <p>The income from the Christmas festival was spent in its entirety according to the club's resolution and, as shown by receipts, amounted to............ 347.50</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Cash on hand..................................................$ 51.22</p>
   <p>Total..........................................................$ 248.72</p>
   <p>According to this report the club may well be proud of its accomplishments, and the humane attitude of German women becomes quite apparent. In order to ease the suffering of the destitute many a sacrifice was necessary, as the above figures show. I hereby resign from my official duties in accordance with our statutes and thank the club for its confidence in my endeavors.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Marie Lassig</p>
   <p>Monthly Report</p>
   <p>The monthly report of the Clubs delegate to the German Society contains the following items:</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>The expenditures of the German Society for the support of impecunious families or persons amounted to $197.68 during the months of March and April. In March, 41 persons or families received $95. For coal, delivered to the poor, $17.75 was spent; for board and lodging of homeless people $28.18; total: $190.93. (sic) In April cash donations were given to 52 families or single persons amounting to $108. For coal, delivered to needy applicants, we paid $13.75, and for room and board for shelterless persons, $35 was spent; altogether $156.75 during April. How many people were given help, such as free railroad fare or partial traveling expenses, hospital care, medical aid, or free burial, can be ascertained from the agent's report. For the information of our members I am herewith listing the various hospitals which offered their facilities, so that the ladies may know what sources are at our disposal: the County Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital, and Die Heimath der Freundlosen [Home of the Friendles ; whether this is an American or German institution is not explained]. If we succeed in arousing the interest of our Germans to such an extent that they will contribute enough money so that a German section could be established at the Cook County Hospital, then we will have accomplished <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>more for the ailing than can be attained by building a hospital of our own, as such an undertaking would require much money as well as years to complete the work.</p>
   <p>Maria Werkmeister</p>
   <p>After the various reports were adopted the election took place. The club's president, Mrs. Hedwig Voss, was re-elected by acclamation and Miss Clara Schneider is again the secretary.</p>
   <p>As Mrs. M. Lassig declared that she could not again accept the office of treasure, several ladies were nominated, and Mrs. M. Peipers was elected. Mrs. Bluthardt became vice-president.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Werkmeister was elected again as delegate to the board of directors of the German Society; the vote was unanimous.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>The directresses are:</p>
   <p>North Side: Mrs. Ch. Roesch, Mrs. M. Molter, Mrs. F. Ebener.</p>
   <p>South Side: Mrs. M. Mauer, Mrs. M. Loeb, Mrs. Schmidt.</p>
   <p>West Side: Mrs. J. Buehler, Mrs. B. Mueller, Mrs. Matthei.</p>
   <p>The members expressed their appreciation to the retiring officials and particularly to Mrs. Lassig. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
