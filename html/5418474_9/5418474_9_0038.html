   <p>About a year ago seven lodges of the Hermanns-Sisters of the Order of the Hermanns Soehne made themselves independent and founded their own Grand Lodge in order to be able to manage their affairs independently and with more success. That they succeeded in this to the highest satisfaction of all concerned was proved sufficiently by the Anniversary festival that was held yesterday in the Central Turner Hall. The number of the guests was as large as could ever be expected...The well-chosen program consisting of festival orations, concert, etc, was carried through in all its parts to the highest satisfaction. The main speech was held by the Grand President, Mrs. Anna Assmus.</p>
   <p>The seven chapters of the Hermann Sisters have at present 865 members and a foundation fund of $5000.00. In cases of death $200.00 are paid, in cases of sickness $4.00 to $5.00 per week.</p>
