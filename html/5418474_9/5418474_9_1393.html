   <p>An illustrated but misleading article dealing with crime in Chicago appeared in yesterday's issue of the Chicago Tribune. Its chief design was to point out the excellent protection of life and property which Chicagoans are receiving from their so able city administration. It cites the statement of the Chief of Police, Mr. Kipley, that the chances of a criminal to escape the law are becoming less every year. Crime has decreased considerably during the last four years, due to the alertness and watchfulness of our city government. As proof thereof, the Chicago Tribune published the following statistics:</p>
   <p>Arrests made during the year:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>1896</td>
     <td>96,847</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>1897</td>
     <td>83,680</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>1898</td>
     <td>77,441</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>1899</td>
     <td>71,349</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   
   <p>The writer of that article was obviously a credulous individual, or else he would have searched for more definite reasons responsible for this remarkable betterment. An alert newspaperman would have surmised the situation instantly. He would have questioned the cause for this, especially since the city grew so rapidly during the year 1899. Why is it, that irrespective of the miserable city government, 25,000 fewer arrests were made then, than during the year 1896?</p>
   <p>The figures given are by far more enlightening than words could ever be. These figures really accuse our Department of Public Safety, under the present Democratic city administration. Arrests have by no means decreased, because this wretched criminal element feared the consequences. On the contrary, only too often no arrests were made for violation of our city ordinances. This is of course, one of the outstanding reasons which clearly explains the whole situation. The economic conditions have played an equally important part. It is a wellknown fact that there are far less crimes and suicides committed during the years of fair business conditions. Reverse the case, and many an honest and honorable man is driven through unemployment and deplorable living conditions to despair, which invariably culminates in crime. The many arrests made during the year 1896 have been the result of a depression, felt throughout the country. Thousands of tramps and lazy loafers for whom the proper place would have been the jail, sought haven in the large cities, thus adding to the growing crime. Since that time, however, the earning capacity of the average citizen has improved, and with it the safety of the citizens. Strange as it may seem, Mr. Kipley, Chief of Police, indulges in self-glorification for the accomplishment of eradicating crime. Other factors than the expert handling of the police force are responsible for this change. The low numbers of arrests is another evidence of our blind justice. It also reveals the fact how little we can rely upon our protective police force, which, in many instances, goes hand in hand with crime in Chicago.</p>
