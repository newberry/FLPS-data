   <p>The sons of Arminius held a meeting last night at 117 Cornell Street to make propaganda for their lodge. A number of applications for membership were received. Different members explained the purpose of this newly organized lodge, which, indeed, carries the stamp of humaneness. The lodge consists of German speaking men and endeavors to stay aloof from all unAmerican domination. It is cultivating the German language and customs and is promoting social entertainments.</p>
   <p>The lodge also guarantees $400.00 as a maximum sick-benefit. It likewise pays each male member $100.00 on the death of his wife. A plan is in force to insure each male member for $500.00 or $1000 in case of death.</p>
   <p>The system inaugurated for the payment of dues is just because it is arranged according to the relative age of the member when entering membership in the lodge.</p>
