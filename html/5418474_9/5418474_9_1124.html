   <p>Since it had become necessary to give the cow who was supposed to have caused the "world conflagration" a sworn declaration of honor which was published by the press - it was, of course, the next thing for a sensation-frenzied public to discover another, if possible even more fantastic origin. That the fire, as it happens daily in Chicago, should have originated due to some unfortunate accident; that the raging hurricane should have carried it quickly from one wooden hut to the next till the whole "Bohemian quarter" and soon the enormous staple places of the neighboring saw-mills were on fire; that from there a true rain of sparks poured forth onto the barracks of Canal and Wells Street and so started the terrific fire on the South Side; and that the South Sice fire, as one had to expect due to the terrible storm, caused the destruction of the North Side - all this one discards as improbable. So extraordinary an event must have an equally extraordinary cause. The most ridiculous idea, ever born by an overheated imagination, is the supposition that the "International" brought about our misfortune. A morning paper here, that specializes in taking the taste of its readers into account in a truly artful way publishes a letter that is several columns long and which it avers to have received by a conscience-stricken member of the International. To make the thing a little more probable the mad George Francis Train is drawn into it. He is supposed to have closed his address Sunday night in Farwell <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Hall with the words: "This is the last speech that is going to be given in this hall. A dark destiny hangs over Chicago. More, I neither can, nor wish to say." Nothing is easier than to ascribe to this madman such words, because no report of his lecture exists (the papers which published one having been burned), and one cannot well expect either from him or from his few listeners to still remember, the next day, all the nonsense he emitted on the day before. Anybody who, like the writer of these lines, watched the fire from its beginning to its end, and who saw how the storm carried glowing splinters and rafters for miles; how it carried off whole asphalt roofs from the burning houses only to cast them down onto some building, perhaps twenty or thirty squares from the place of the conflagration, - will only have a smile for all such theories.</p>
