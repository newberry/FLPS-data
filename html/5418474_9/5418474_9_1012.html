   <p>The Women's Club of the German Society held a meeting yesterday afternoon. Despite the rainy weather, the attendance was good. After the reading and acceptance of the minutes, Mrs. Wermeister, delegate to the board of directors of the German Society, submitted the monthly report quoted below:</p>
   <p>"During May, the German Society spent $140 to aid thirty-five needy families and destitute single persons; the sum given in each case varied from one to ten dollars. The sum of $7.25 was spent to buy coal for poor people. The total amount spent thus comes to $147.25.</p>
   <p>"The members of our Club have recently complained that poor people referred to the agent of the German Society were not shown the proper courtesy, and in some instances were not given any consideration whatever. I brought the matter to the attention of the executive board of the German Society, and the board immediately appointed a committee, consisting of the board members Pruessing, <span class="page-break">2</span>Hettich, and Buehler, to investigate the cases. A resolution was also passed that the ladies appoint a committee of their own to investigate all cases which the Women's Club refers to the German Society, so that the status of the applicants, as well as the amount to which they are entitled, can be definitely established. In closing, I would like to add that the administration has offered to assist us in arranging a benefit entertainment, and that the president of the German Society, Mr. Schneider, intends to be at our meeting to hear our resolutions and to submit them to the members of the board."</p>
   <p>In conformance with the resolution mentioned in the report, the ladies formed a committee to investigate all requests for aid. The committee members are as follows:</p>
   <p>North Side: Mrs. Ebener, Mrs. H. Claussenius, Mrs. F. Roesch.</p>
   <p>South Side: Mrs. Wedig, Mrs. Louise Langemann, Mrs. H. Wink.</p>
   <p>West Side: Mrs. Bluthardt, Mrs. F. Madlener, Mrs. B. Mueller.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The members then considered the summer festival which had been discussed at the previous session. It was decided that it should be a great affair, a true "German festival," and that it should be announced as such.</p>
   <p>Mrs. J. Buehler, Mrs. Bluthardt, and Mrs. CH. Roesch were named as a committee to select a day for the festival and to do the preliminary work.</p>
   <p>The president of the German Society, Mr. Schneider, made a brief speech in which he expressed his appreciation of the Club's efforts, adding that the proposed festival is particularly appropriate at this time, since it will mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the German Society. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
