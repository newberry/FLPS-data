   <p>The Dance, which was arranged by the Women's Society of the Altenheim for last Saturday night, turned out to be a most successful, brilliant celebration. The concert, which was before the dance, had real artists on the program, and was enjoyed enormously by the visitors.</p>
   <p>Particularly, Mrs. Brontano, Mrs. Emilie Rapp, Miss Amanda Rose, Messrs. Leon Strauss, August Hyllested and Bernhard Mollenhauer were applauded by a grateful audience.</p>
   <p>The Orchestra under its leader, Mr. Weege was at its best. The dance kept the young folks together until late in the night.</p>
