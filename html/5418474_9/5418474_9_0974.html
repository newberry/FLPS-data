   <p>"The Ladies' Aid Society of the German Society hereby expresses its gratitude to all who gave gifts or otherwise helped to provide a Christmas festival for the poor children. The ladies particularly thank Mr. Brand for his courtesy in having provided free use of his hall, and are very grateful to the German press which gave publicity to the event in so liberal a manner, thus helping considerably in making the affair a success. Furthermore, we thank the various businessmen for the presents they contributed and their friendly interest; also the individuals whose donations enabled the Society to have a plentiful supply of everything for the occasion. The ladies also thank Mr. Bauer, who furnished a piano for the occasion, as well as Mrs. Huck, Mrs. Thorwarth, Miss Pick, and Mr. Schmoll, whose combined efforts made a success of the affair. In fact, we thank all who collaborated with us to make the affair a success.</p>
