After the publication of the census, interesting conclusions can be drawn. The population of German descent which was estimated at 112,228 in 1920, has increased to 350,000. The first figures refer only to those people of German descent, who were born in Germany or in German speaking countries, but the latter figures refer to all those who are of German descent, regardless of where they were born.</p>

The arrival at these figures was reached on the same basis as with the people of German descent. The Negro population has almost doubled since 1920. According to estimates, Chicago has at the present time 200,000 Negroes.
