   <p>The German Central Committee for Foreign Relief has issued a very valuable statistical record entitled "Destitution in Germany". The object of the work is to give facts and figures on the impoverishment of Germany and to disprove foreign rumors of exaggerated conditions in Germany by submitting brief indisputable statistics.</p>
   <p>The territory which Germany was compelled to cede after the war represents a greater loss of land than of population. This means that a larger percentage of people must now be supported on a diminished acreage. Aside from this, the agricultural products from the relinquished districts had greatly exceeded local needs, the surplus being absorbed by contiguous provinces.</p>
   <p>The lost areas in 1913 produced about 526 kilograms of grain and 1325 kilograms of potatoes per capita, whereas the remainder of Germany had a per capita yield of only 301 kilograms of grain and 662 kilograms of potatoes. The loss of livestock in the ceded areas was likewise relatively greater than the population loss. The number of horses, cattle, and hogs in Germany dropped thirty-seven per cent [when these areas were lost].</p>
   <p>Along with this loss of surplus-producing units, one must also take into account the lowered productivity of the soil, the fertility of which was sadly depleted during the war period. Lack of fertilizer together with the extensive farming operations carried on at the time left their mark. And after the war the acute need for fertilizer for the exhausted soil could not be met, since the home industries could not produce sufficient potash and nitrogen...... All of these conditions resulted in decidedly poorer harvests..... This lowered productivity also affected the yield of fodder.... and hence the yield of milk..... Before the war the average annual milk yield per cow was estimated at 2200 liters, today it is somewhere near 1800 liters....</p>
   
   <p>The curtailed use of milk will have its harmful effects, particularly since the available supply does not have the same fat content as the milk of prewar days. The decrease in milk consumption is especially noticeable in the larger cities.....Berlin reports that milk deliveries before the war amounted to one-half liter per day per person; in November, 1923 this figure shrunk to one twenty-eighth of a liter. In 1914, the city of Nuremberg used 130,000 liters of milk per day; in 1923, the daily consumption fell to 43,000 liters. The dearth of milk becomes increasingly serious as a result of the lack of purchasing power which prevents parents from substituting other foods to provide a balanced diet.</p>
   <p>Nearly all cities acknowledge that malnutrition among school children has reached alarming proportions....Only seventy percent eat one warm meal per day; many have no warm food whatsoever, because coal prices exceed all bounds. This condition in turn, has resulted in a terrifying mortality rate among infants and children....</p>
   
   <p>In addition to malnutrition, there is the problem of clothing. Nearly all teachers report that children cannot go to school because they lack even the most essential articles of clothing.</p>
