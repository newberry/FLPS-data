   <p>The Austrian and Hungarian Vereine, associated with the German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society, held a meeting last night in the La Salle Turner Hall in order to complete the organization of a [branch] Aid Society. Mr. Schick, cashier of the North Avenue State Bank, was elected treasurer, and all associated vereine were requested to turn all relief money collected from now on over to him. The sum of $789.00 was handed over last night.</p>
   <p>It was also decided to continue with the sale of Red Cross buttons, which had netted two hundred dollars so far, and to put more collection lists into circulation.</p>
   <p>On a suggestion of the chairman, Mr. Neumann, it was decided to have the promotion committee visit all the festivities given by the Austro-Hungarian <span class="page-break">2</span>vereine and to help the Red Cross by putting up collection boxes.</p>
   <p>During the week beginning November 14, there will be a bazaar in the La Salle Turner Hall, the net profits of which will go to the Relief Fund. The members assembled appointed themselves in toto as a promotion committee for the purpose of collecting gifts for a raffle at the bazaar, and every member of this committee will be authorized in writing to accept such gifts. Places of collection are to be established in all parts of the city and will be announced later. Another committee meeting is going to be held next Thursday at the La Salle Turner Hall in order to appoint the necessary subcommittees.</p>
   <p>After it was announced that Director Danner of the Germania Theater would give a gala performance of the play "Hermanns Schlacht" for the benefit of the Red Cross, and that all the members of the Aid Society were to contribute their services free of charge, the meeting adjourned.</p>
