   <p>The Grand Lodge of the Order "Hermann's Sons" of the State of Illinois held yesterday its semi-annually meeting. The Chairmanship consisted of the following gentlemen: Adolf Mueller, President; Friedr. Meyer, Vice President; Henry Diets, Secretary; and Jacob Fleck, Treasurer. According to the rules of the Order all 27 lodges were represented by two delegates from each.</p>
   <p>The Grand Lodge's report to the National Grand Lodge, which will hold its convention at St. Paul on September 26, was read and discussed. From this we see, that the grand lodge of Illinois paid out last year over $10,000.00 for sickness and other relief benefits. While the amount paid out to the surviving family members and lodge members has not yet been figured out.</p>
   <p>Furthermore the report says that the Grand Lodge's property is valued a little over $35,000.00 and the Lodge has 1975 members.</p>
