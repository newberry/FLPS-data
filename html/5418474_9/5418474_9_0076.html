   <p>For many years our Masons have shown us how they celebrate this lovely festival, with due credit to our German lodges of that Order whose inspiring interest in June 24th is highly commendable... Our garden city has as may be known, six German Freemason Lodges and another in development.</p>
   <p>There are 1,200 Lodge members representing to a large extent the best and noblest of our German citizens... The incomplete seventh German Freemason Lodge, expected to be incorporated next fall under the name of "Constantia," holds its meetings at the present time at Golhardt's Hall. It was represented at the festival by a number of members. Among the specially invited guests was F. Otto eighty five years of age, one of the co-founders of the oldest German Lodge the "Germania", to satisfy his own wish to witness once more a St. John's festival, he graciously accepted the invitation to be Guest of Honor.</p>
