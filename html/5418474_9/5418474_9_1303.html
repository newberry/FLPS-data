   <p>Judge Kirsten yesterday freed Ben Leavitt, and Treyser, who have been accused of using immoral pictures as theater announcements-propaganda.</p>
   <p>Judge Kirsten denied any continuance of the case to Alderman Eisfeldt, who caused the arrest of the three defendants. Jusge Kirsten also pointed out the fact, that similar posters, picturing girls in scanty costumes, have been used over 25 years by Chicago Theaters, without causing any attack or ill feeling from the public.</p>
