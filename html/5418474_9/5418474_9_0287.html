   <p>"No child and no elderly person among us shall be without a home." This was the motto chosen by St. Paul's German congregation when the members decided to enlarge the field of their benevolence by founding St. Paul's House, which may be looked upon as a sister institution to the Uhlich Orphanage. Quietly, without the least publicity, indefatigably, day in and day out, the industrious members of the various societies of the congregation worked at the project, and they continue to do so. Owing to the liberality of Mr. Karl Buehler the work has rapidly progressed. Originally it was planned to erect a two-story building next to the church, on Orchard Street, fifty feet south of Fullerton Parkway, on the site of a beautiful wooded corner lot, which the congregation had purchased years ago for that purpose. But now, thanks to Mr. Buehler, this plan has been supplanted by another, more extensive one, for he has purchased the entire <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>square block, bounded on the east by California Avenue, on the north by Byron Street, on the west by Mozart Street, and on the south by Grace Street, and has donated it to the Home. This plot of ground is 267 feet wide and 599 feet long; it is located one block south of Irving Park Boulevard and one block west of the north branch of the Chicago River. The newly organized Park District, River Park Improvement Association, is laying out a public park, which is to be called California Park, on the west bank of the River, thus making the site of the Home ideal for its purpose. All of these streets are paved, with the exception of California Avenue. Since there is a streetcar line on Irving Park Boulevard, the Ravenswood Branch of the Northwestern Elevated is close by, and other lines of the streetcar system are not far away, transportation facilities are as good as one could wish them to be. In addition, the grounds of the Home are removed from the lanes of heavy traffic so that the peace and quiet of the inmates of the proposed institution will not be disturbed. The wide experience and excellent taste of the founders presages the utmost in comfort and convenience as far as living quarters are concerned.</p>

   <p>Now I must refer to past history. It was on New Year's Day, 1908, that Reverend Rudolph John, under whose able leadership the congregation built its beautiful church edifice, which is one of the finest in the country, architecturally and as a religious institution, informed the members that collections made during the preceding three weeks amounted to $8,007, that this sum was sufficient to liquidate the indebtedness of the Church, and that, chiefly through the activity of the Ladies Aid, contributions to the amount of $50,580 had been received over a period of nine years. Thus there was opportunity for service in a new field. Reverend John then eloquently appealed for the execution of a plan which had often been the subject of discussion during the past years--to provide a home for the aged members of St. Paul's and other churches. He called attention to the fact that the Germans of Chicago maintain a home for the aged at Forest Park, but that the congregation should erect and maintain a similar institution, which might serve as supplement to the one which is being operated in the western suburb. He stressed the fact that the primary purpose of the proposed home should be to provide a haven of peace and rest for those members of St. <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Paul's, who have contributed to the upkeep of the church for many years and who need help in their old age. In many cases their children have established homes where there is no room for the parents, and are able to support only themselves and their children. Reverend John also pointed out that it is the duty of the Church to care for its old members, and not to leave them at the mercy of outsiders....</p>
   <p>He continued, "It is true that our congregation could pay to the Altenheim the fees required for the care of its elderly members, but that institution has a long waiting list, and cannot accept all those who apply for admission because it lacks the necessary room and facilities. Therefore, it would be welcome news to the board of directors of the German Old People's Home if St. Paul's could tell the members of the board: 'You need care for our old people no longer; we will do it ourselves.'"</p>
   <p>And Reverend John's appeal was not made in vain. Preliminary work was begun and finished, and if general economic conditions permit, the cornerstone of <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>a very comfortable home for the aged may be laid a year from now.</p>
