   <p>The demands for charity work that are being made on the German Society (Deutsche Gesellschaft), which since the beginning of the war has had to weather the worst storm of its sixty-four-year successful existence, are so heavy that unless the German element of Chicago lends its generous and effective support, the resources of the Society will be exhausted very soon.</p>
   <p>From a compilation of the Society's activities during the last three months, we here give the following data, which speak for themselves:</p>
   <p>From June 1 until August 31 of this year, 188 families with 655 children, and 138 single persons, including 21 women, were given cash support; and for the homeless unemployed 208 meals and 40 sleeping quarters were provided. Through arrangements made by the Society, five persons were put into private hospitals, nine into the County Hospital, and one into the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium, all without charge. Seventeen people received free medical treatment and medicine, etc.</p>
   <p>The expenditures for relief amounted altogether to $2,079.22 and were disbursed during the various months as follows: June, $710.73; July, $729.01; August, $682.43.</p>
   <p>Employment could be found for only 360 persons, including 22 women and girls who were given jobs through the Women's Aid, although 960 jobs were available. The reason for this [discrepancy] is, as the Society has pointed out in previous reports, that Germans [i. e. nationals of the Reich] find great difficulties in being hired, because most employers prefer Austrian subjects in order to avoid going through the formalities which the Federal authorities have provided in connection with the employment of Germans.</p>
   <p>Since the beginning of July, the employment agency of the Society has been under the supervision of the United States Employment Service, 116 North Dearborn Street, to which it has to make daily reports. A great number of people for whom the Society cannot find employment, or who cannot fill the jobs that are open, are referred to the Federal employment service, and cannot be listed as having been put to work by the facilities of the Society. Unfortunately, many people are afraid to apply to the Federal agency, although they are treated courteously and special efforts are made to provide jobs for them.</p>
   <p>In the near future, the regulations of the United States Employment Service (with which the Society has to comply strictly) dealing with lazy people and those who do not care to abide by the rules laid down by the government will be made much more stringent, and those that are unwilling [to work] may be faced with the prospect of forced labor.</p>
   <p>In spite of the great detail of work in connection with providing jobs, the employment agency is only a small part of the extensive and helpful activities which the German Society performs. Its main task is to assist, during these hard times, the needy people who speak the German tongue; their number now exceeds the average, as a result of increased living costs.</p>
   <p>In order to meet these demands, the resources of the German Society, which have dwindled during the war years, are entirely inadequate, and it becomes absolutely necessary to support the Society generously with cash contributions.</p>
   <p>In order to dispel all doubts regarding the attitude which the Federal authorities assume toward the Society, with which, as we have mentioned, they cooperate in the most satisfactory manner, let us once more call your attention to a letter of Mr. Clabaugh, already published last June, in which he talks of the Society in the highest terms.</p>
   <p>The Society hereby kindly asks all employers who are willing to employ Germans to get in touch with our office, 160 North Wells Street, telephone: Main 4026; those who need female help should call the Women's Aid, Franklin 5169.</p>
   
   <p>Money orders are to be made out to The German Society of Chicago, 160 North Wells Street, room 217. We especially call your attention to the fact that the German Society employs no agents or collectors who are entitled to accept money.</p>
