   <p>Hardly one of our charitable institutions does as much good as the Free German-American Dispensary. This institution, the character of which is not completely expressed by the word dispensary was founded by eminent German physicians. There they give free consultations several hours each day. Although the majority of people going there are German, the services of the institution are available to everyone, Many Americans go there regularly.</p>
   <p>But the majority of the people are Germans and it is for them that the institution was founded. Our physicians knew how important it was to have an institution where Germans unacquainted with the English language, might explain their ailments to a physician in their mother tongue.</p>
   <p>Last year, if we remember rightly, four thousand people were treated free of charge from July, 1874 to July, 1875. But the upkeep of the institution requires money. Fro that reason the Board of Directors of the institution ask the German people to donate five dollars each from their annual income.</p>
