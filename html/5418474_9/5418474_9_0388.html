   <p>The yearly report submitted to the general meeting of the executive board by the president of the German Home for the Aged, Mr. Robert G. Scheunemann was, in essence, as follows:</p>
   <p>"Ladies and gentlemen:</p>
   <p>"It is my duty, at the end of our calendar year (Vereinsjahr), to give you an account of our activities and to report on the administration of this blessed institution. I am aware that the management of the German Home for the Aged has been exemplary, so that the administration could submit to closest scrutiny at any time. Nothing was left undone to arrange the lives of the inmates in all the buildings of the institution and its immediate vicinity in a manner which was in keeping with its name: 'A Beautiful Home For Old People'. I have endeavored to go about my duties to the best of my abilities, and in <span class="page-break">\2</span>this I have received the friendliest and most ready co-operation of all my associates, to whom I herewith express my gratitude.</p>
   <p>"While there are some among the inmates who are a burden to themselves and who delight in the exercise of criticism, there are, fortunately, also many upstanding old men and women who at all times are willing to give their help in the kitchen, in the field, in the garden, and in the house.</p>
   <p>"Especially expensive repairs were not undertaken, because all needed improvements had been made the year before. Necessary house furnishings and a large number of new bedsteads and mattresses were purchased.</p>
   <p>"At the monthly meetings of the executive board, the recommendations of the advisory committee were followed in determining all the arrangements which seemed necessary for the business management of the Home.</p>
   <p>"The state of health of all the occupants was, in general, quite satisfactory.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Beyond the ailments brought on by old age, there have been no contagious or epidemic diseases. To Dr. Masslow, who as house physician has been doing his duties conscientiously, I herewith express our best thanks. Similar thanks go to both nurses.</p>
   <p>"Twenty-four pigs were slaughtered, yielding a total of 5,485 pounds of meat, and about one hundred chickens were also killed. Our present livestock consists of three horses, eighty-four large and small pigs, and about two hundred chickens. Owing to the drought, the vegetable crop was not very remarkable. Nevertheless, considerable quantities of vegetables of various kinds were preserved and stored away under the supervision of the matron. The Home saves much through these farm products raised on its own property. Mr. von Waltershausen and his wife, the matron, must be accorded the greatest recognition for their careful administration of the Home and the loyalty with which they have discharged their duties.</p>
   <p>"The customary monthly meetings took place at the Home. Moreover, officers <span class="page-break">\4</span>of the administrative board have been visiting the Home at least once a week. A much larger fire insurance policy was taken out on the buildings; and this precautionary measure was necessary. In the event of a fairly large or even a rather small fire, a new building would be exceedingly expensive, owing to the increased cost of material and workers' wages.</p>
   <p>"The Grove of Louise (Luisenhain) proved to be a source of income which we appreciate highly; the sum obtained amounted to $1,945--more than was ever realized in one summer. The other officers will submit accurate reports concerning the financial conditions.</p>
   <p>"A most deplorable loss was suffered by the executive board and the entire association of the Home for the Aged when the vice-president, Mr. P. J. Weber, passed away. It is largely to his sense of beauty that we owe all the many improvements which were made on the buildings in such a prompt and excellent manner."</p>
