   <p>The German Ladies' Society, on many occasions, has proved its ability to help the poorer elements of the German residents and for this end has become a useful branch of the German Aid Society. We are learning now that the German Ladies' Society is planning to use 10% of its income towards the foundation of a German Hospital. We do not doubt the idealistic and unselfish intentions, which have ripened this plan. But from the financial standpoint we are afraid that a project of this magnitude will not find the necessary backing It is not our intention to discourage the realization of any philanthropic idea. In this particular case we would like to advise the German Ladies" Society to work out the said plan as a German Hospital Department of the County Hospital. The latter doubtless will be willing to lend the necessary space, furniture and material for the start. The Ladies' Society would have to furnish only the physicians, nurses and additional funds for the board for German patients. All further developments of this German Hospital Department could be easily managed in conjunction with the County Hospital.</p>
