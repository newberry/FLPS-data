   <p>The oldest pure German Order in Illinois is certainly the Order of the Hermann's Soehne (the sans of Hermann), which was established here in Chicago, October 6th, 1832, by Mesers Nic. Kastler, Anton Neubert, Mathias Krier, Fried Schmitt and Geo. Baum, who brought about the creation of the Chicago Lodge No. 1.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this Order is: Cultivation of German hospitality and virtues, training of the spirit by mutual advice and exchange of opinions, mutual assistance in cases of sickness or death, besides other conditions of life, presentation, and cultivation of the German language in school and family, also of all good German customs, the distribution of true liberal convictions, and keeping awake of a sacred memory towards our native land. Guided by these aims, the Order has functioned during the past forty-five years of its existence. The Order spent over one and a half million dollars, alone, for charity, and did not restrict its gifts to its own members, but also helped others in need whenever a cry for help was heard. It still practices its charitable functions, indefatigably, and tries to keep its promises.</p>

   <p>But the failure of Dreyer's Bank, where the faithless former Treasurer had $4,000. of widow's money on deposit, and the extraordinary high number of deaths during one year, (50 out of an average membership of 1300) and, finally, the disloyalty of many prominent members, raised a delay in the punctual payment of death claims. The Order could have followed the course practiced by banks and similar institutions - of declaring its insolvency and ridding itself of accumulated debts, but it did not choose this way. Still a genuine German Order, resembling its forefathers, "The old Germans", it keeps a given word sacred and will fulfill its pledges even if it should take years.</p>
   <p>Guided by such an example it was resolved in a mass meeting, of October 10th, to arrange a fair, the surplus of which should be used for payment of death benefits.</p>
   <p>Presuming that the German Press will assist the Order in its undertaking, the Order turns toward the German public with a request to support the fair (December 13th - 14th) by its attendance, donations, and purchases.</p>
