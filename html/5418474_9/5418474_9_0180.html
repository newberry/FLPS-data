   <p>This generally useful Institution has, under its present energetic management, gained rapidly the favor of the suffering public. The hospital is overcrowded, and it happened quite often lately, that patients had to be refused, for lack of room. The Directors had considered the enlargement of the Hospital, by building an addition, but have not come to any decision as yet, because the main factor of such precedure, the "Nerous Rerum" leaves much to be desired, and the monthly balances are still very unfavorable to the Management. These conditions left a very discouraging impression, but in spite of it, the board of directors will have to make a decision in regard to the enlargement of the premises, because the congestion of the patients applying, is steadily increasing. The financial and business affairs, also the internal management of the hospital, are in the hands of reliable and experienced individuals. Cleanliness and order reign everywhere, and the nurses, male as well as female, compete with each other, to furnish the patients, with good care and a pleasant home.</p>
