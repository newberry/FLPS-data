   <p>As a result of the intense cold prevailing during the past month, demands upon the [German] Society were greater than in December, as the appended figures will show, and this brought about a difficult situation, since our funds were almost entirely depleted. We provided assistance only in the most urgent cases, after extensive investigation proved that dire want prevailed.</p>
   <p>The C. R. and A. Society [Chicago Relief and Aid Society (?)] at present gives aid only to needy people who suffered losses in the Chicago conflagration, and very rarely are other persons considered. This, in turn, increased applications for help at our office. Aside from this, the county administration decided that it could give help only to persons who had been residents in the county for a year, and this leaves to the German Society all persons who have not lived here for the required length of time.</p>
   <p>It would be desirable if the attention of our more prosperous Germans could be <span class="page-break">\2</span>aroused to the fact that without adequate interest and help on their part, the German Society will not be in a position to continue indefinitely to fulfill its task in a proper manner. If in some cases, the desired help to the impoverished was not forthcoming, it must be remembered that it is not the fault of the German Society which, after all, is limited by the money at its disposal--money which does not increase of its own accord, and which must be replenished by our German countrymen who are imbued with a sense of responsibility to the community and who have a philanthropic attitude, so that the German Society may function in every case that comes within its jurisdiction.</p>
   <p>Because of the Society's lack of funds and the justified expectation that immigration will increase considerably this year, it is desired that our local Germans take a more active interest in our Society, since this would enable us properly to fulfill the demands which will be made of us within the next few months.</p>
