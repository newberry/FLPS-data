   <p>Last night, at a meeting in the North Side Turner Hall, a crowd of delegates offered various suggestions as to how the local branch of the Deutsch-Amerikanische National-Bund could raise sufficient funds, in the shortest possible time, for the treasury of the Deutsch und Oester-reichisch-Ungarische Hilfsverein (German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society). That the good work was well under way could be learned from the satisfactory reports made by various vereine. The Schlesische Verein had given fifty dollars, and the Verein Saxonia the same amount, as an initial contribution, with fifteen dollars a month thereafter for the duration of the war. The Verein der Handlungsgehilfen (Society of Commercial and Office Employees) has collected one hundred and fifty dollars from forty of its members, the Hamburger Club has raised fifty dollars, and the Katholische Gesellen Verein (Catholic Artisans and Craftsman's Society) thirty-two dollars.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by President Ferdinand Walther, who briefly explained <span class="page-break">\2</span>the purpose of the meeting. He called attention to the establishment of the Aid Society with which the local branch had been consolidated in accordance with the decision of the directors. He declared that the National-Bund was honor bound to increase the funds of the Hilfsverein by raising substantial amounts of money. The executive committee had prepared collection blanks to be distributed among the delegates. The collections would be turned over by the local branch to Mr. Oscar F. Mayor, treasurer of the Aid Society, and would be used mainly to assist the German and Austro-Hungarian war widow and orphans.</p>
   <p>After the steps taken by the directors had been unanimously approved by the delegates, there was a lengthy discussion regarding the manner in which funds should be raised by the vereine associated with the local branch. Proposals and suggestions were made, as, for instance, to put up collection boxes or to arrange benefit performances.</p>
   <p>Finally it was decided to have the delegates request the vereine to form <span class="page-break">\3</span>subcommittees to direct the collection work and to have the collected sums turned over to the directors who would forward them to Mr. Mayer, treasurer of the Aid Society.</p>
   <p>Some other propositions were made. The practicability of selling ribbons or buttons or holding a large fair was argued pro and con.</p>
   <p>Mr. D. G. Brillow held up as a shining example the employees of the Hotel Kaiserhof, all of whom had voluntarily decided to turn over a certain percentage of their wages to the relief fund, and in this manner had contributed about twenty-five dollars a week.</p>
   <p>Mr. Walther announced that the employees of the Bismarck Hotel had collected and turned over one hundred and two dollars.</p>
   <p>Regarding a suggestion made some time ago that during these grave times no verein activities should take place, Mr. Ernst Kusswurm remarked that in his <span class="page-break">\4</span>opinion club activities should not be curtailed, but that a portion of the proceeds should be turned over to the relief fund.</p>
   <p>Mr. Georg A. Schmidt's motion that the membership dues of all new members be turned over to the relied fund, was favorably received, which meant, in effect, that anybody who contributed at least the membership dues during the collection drive, would automatically become a member of the National-Bund without further formalities. The motion was adopted unanimously.</p>
   <p>Mr. Georg Landall suggested that the membership dues be doubled for the benefit of the relief fund, as proposed by several vereine. These were about all the suggestions made regarding the relief work. Beyond these every verein will be expected to use its own judgement.</p>
   <p>A discussion of another topic was started by Mr. August Lueders, who read a report published in the Abendpost under the title "The Irish in Favor of the German Cause". This article stated that German speakers and representatives <span class="page-break">\5</span>of the German element are invited to the annual festival which is to be held next Saturday at Brand's Park. Mr. Lueders pointed out that the Germans, hated by all and sundry, should welcome any friend, no matter whom, and that they should grasp the Irish hand of friendship and visit the Irish affair in large numbers.</p>
   <p>Most of the other speakers were of the same opinion, and a motion was adopted that next Saturday afternoon the members of the executive committee and as many other members as could possibly do so, should go to the Irish festival. It was planned to issue emblems to distinguish the visiting Germans.</p>
   <p>The president of the Schwaben verein, Mr. Hess, announced that at its next festival the verein would put up a collection tent flanked by German sentries, and that a resolution would be adopted at the annual meeting today, pledging generous support of the relief work.</p>
   <p>The following motion, which the president of the Bund, Dr. Hexamer, had <span class="page-break">\6</span>submitted to all the local and state branches with a request for its adoption, was passed as a resolution:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The American nation is composed of immigrants from all parts of Europe, who have made America what it is today, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Approximately twenty-five percent of the people of the United States are either of German birth or of German descent, and that this part of the population, from early colonial times until the present, has done more than its share to safeguard our liberty, to preserve the Union, to develop agriculture, commerce, and industry, and to promote the culture of his nation; therefore be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we, as American citizens, insist on our demand that the American press publish their [war] reports impartially and without any prejudice, and that their editorials be kept free from malice or hatred against any section of American citizens, as far as that is possible, because this nation, while <span class="page-break">\7</span>speaking the English language, is not an English nation, and during these grave times it is not asking too much to apply the American spirit of fair play in order to maintain harmony among American citizens of any race and creed; be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the editors-in-chief of every newspaper in the city."</p>
