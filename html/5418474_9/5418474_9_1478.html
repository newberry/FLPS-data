   <p>The saloon and beer garden located at 5478-88 Lake Park Avenue, for many years a meeting place of Americans and Germans of the South Side, will disappear, as have many other relics of old, free Chicago. Mrs. Marie Koch sold the property for $13,000 to Alexander M. Harrounn, who will build a $20,000 garage on the site.</p>
