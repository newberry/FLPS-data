   <p>The annual report was read and showed an increase in membership of fifty seven; increase of yearly dues of $489; and a decrease of assets of $129. The dues again did not cover expenses, and extraordinary contributions through bazaars and the like, the society could not collect, because the Chicago Germans had to make so many sacrifices for the Fatherland. The report points to the much greater are and greater wealth of the Deutsche Gellschaften in Philadelphia, St. Louis, etc., and expresses hope for more support for the Germans next year. The report was accepted.</p>
   <p>The secretary then read the semi-annual financial statement, showing an income of $1,860; outgo of $1,193. Of this, $247 went for cash relief and $475 as salary for the agent. The assets of the society amount to $3,867, of which 33,000 are in County Bonds, the rest in cash.</p>
   <p>The agent, Mr. Annecke, read the draft for the new statute which contains few new by-laws, for example, one extending the activities of the association to Bohemians, Hungarians, and Poles, and another empowering the administrative council to depose the agent with a 13:9 majority vote.</p>

   <p>Mr. Schneider made a motion to replace the word "jeder" (the masculine form of "each") throughout the statute ("jeder" might join the association, etc.) by "jede person" - so as to make it possible for women to join. The association he said had found much help from the German women, and there must be in Chicago many unmarried women and widows who might join the association and could only be of advantage to it. Mr. Rosenthal emphasized the importance of the point declaring that he was already a member of two associations who admitted women, and seconded the motion, which was thereupon adopted.</p>
   <p>Then the agent, Mr. Annecke, read his yearly report. Six-thousand-seven-hundred and forty-seven people in search of work had applied to the office, but only 801 could be placed, because there were only 1.049 applications for workers; 2,555 applied for advice and assistance; 244 were given free transportation: 63 were hospitalized; 78 families received assistance; almost 50 people recovered lost or stolen baggage; and who had been swindled of $603 were restituted.</p>
   <p>The report was accepted. It was resoled to have 1,000 copies of the new statute printed. Mr. Schneider was elected president; Beyersdorff, vice-president; Biroth, treasurer; Lieb, secretary; directors for the South Side:</p>
