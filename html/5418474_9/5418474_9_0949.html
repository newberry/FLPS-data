   <p>A. C.

He also suggested that German clubs and associations should be asked to participate in the promotion of this cause, and he mentioned that at a meeting of the executive board of the Bavarian Club a motion had been considered to donate $100 from the expected receipts of the Bavarian Festival to the aid for New Ulm Committee. At the same time Mr. Hesing mentioned the contributions which had been sent to the Illinois Staats-Zeitung. [Translator's note: Mr. A. C. Hesing was the president of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung. Publishing Company].</p>
   <p>Complying with A. C. Hesing's suggestion, the committee then nominated the various subcommittees, which were expected to act immediately.</p>
   <p>F. Madlener will call on liquor dealers and distillers; R. Brand and John Hoffmann on county, city, and government officials and employees; A. C. Hesing on newspapers and newsdealers; Theodore Arnold on packers and butchers; F.

   <p>NEWS FROM NEW ULM</p>
   <p>According to a recent telegram, heavy rains on Wednesday evening and the following night increased the damage; those buildings which are still standing are roofless.</p>
   <p>Mr. Weyhe, one of the representatives of the New Ulm Relief Committee, departed for Milwaukee yesterday, and Mr. Loewenthal will return to New Ulm today, encouraged by the fact that Chicagoans will send aid promptly and have not forgotten their own misfortune of ten years ago and the liberal help which was given by this city at that time.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Action up to the Present Time</p>
   <p>The following contributions had been received up to yesterday afternoon:</p>
   <p>S. Friedmann, $100 [highest]; Marshall Field and Company, $50 [three firms gave $50]; E. Rothschild and Brothers, $25 [ten business houses contributed $25]; cash, $1 ..... Total contributions, $ 638.</p>
   <p>This amount has already been sent to New Ulm. J. B. Drake, owner of the Pacific Hotel, gave a hundred dollars. He sent the money to the mayor of the stricken town when first reports of the catastrophe reached Chicago.</p>
   <p>In conformity with the recommendations made by A. C. Hesing the chairman and secretary of the committee issued the following appeal:</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>"New Ulm, a city in Minnesota, has met with misfortune. A cyclone has destroyed the thriving town; 250 German families have been rendered homeless and lack the bare necessities of life.</p>
   <p>"Help is urgently needed. A committee of citizens will visit various business houses and solicit funds for the stricken people.</p>
   <p>"The undersigned committee asks the German lodges and associations also to do their share and hopes that its appeal will not be in vain, since the inhabitants of New Ulm were the first who came to our aid and sent us a carload of flour when we suffered misfortune [the Chicago fire].</p>
   <p>"Kindly send donations to the treasurer of the committee, F. Madlener, 147 Lake Street. "For the committee: R. Brand, president; E. Hoechster, secretary."</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>The Wirthsverein (Saloonkeepers' Association), sent $1.50 to the committee at New Ulm yesterday, and the Thueringer Club will receive a recommendation from its festival committee that at least ten per cent of the receipts to be derived from its trap-shooting event, which will begin tomorrow, shall be given to the relief fund.</p>
