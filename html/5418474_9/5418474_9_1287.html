   <p>The grand jury today indicted William "Dutch" Emmerling, 3821 Emerald Avenue, for murder. On March 7, following a brief altercation, he shot and killed his wife Sadie.</p>
   <p>Emmerling was taken into custody March 1 for allegedly having broken into a house, and was locked up in the county jail. Released on bail March 7, he immediately hurried home and started a quarrel with his wife. He accused her of having had intimate relations with other men during his absence, and gave expression to his displeasure that she had not succeeded sooner in finding someone who would post a bond for him. He lost his temper so completely that he grabbed a revolver and shot down the defenseless woman. He then took to flight but was found a few days later and taken into secure custody.</p>
