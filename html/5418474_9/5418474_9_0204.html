   <p>The eighth annual meeting of the German Hospital Society was held last night in the reading room of the institution.</p>
   <p>From the annual report of F. T. Henning, President of the Hospital Society, we take the following statements: "At the close of the year 1890, the hospital was already in a favorable financial condition, but the year, 1891, was even more outstanding. In 1890 we took care of 550 patients, but in 1891 the number increased to 714. Considering the fact that the institution is still in its infancy, the success achieved is remarkable.</p>
   <p>Of the 714 patients, 336 were male, 289 female and 27 children. Of these 452 were dismissed as cured, 101 as improved, 26 as incurable, and 73 patients, died.</p>
   <p>The president expresses his appreciation for the devoted activities of the attending physicians. The expenses for the maintenance of the institution were higher to the extent of $1.300.00 due to the higher prices of provisions. Nearly four hundred of the patients paid full rates, and 115 paid reduced rates. Two hundred <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>were treated free of charge. Let me state here that many of the patients, paying full rates, paid only $5.00 per week.</p>
   <p>The attendants or nurses at the hospital are females exclusively. A training school for nurses has been arranged in connection with the hospital, which is doing very well. The school is located in its own building. It needs our support urgently, because it is still in debt.</p>
   <p>For the enlargement of the hospital which is recognized as urgent, the amount of $15,000.00 is necessary for the present, making allowance for the expected increase of demands due to the coming World's Exposition."</p>
   <p>The financial report showed a total income, including the payments of patients, of $21,054.53. The expenses during the same period amounted to $20,378.74; therefore a cash balance of $673.79 was on hand on January 1, 1892.</p>
   <p>The hospital received a check for $1,603.85 from the German Press Club, representing the net profit from the benefit concert in favor of the hospital.</p>
   <p>Mr. G. Schneider and C. Emmerich were re-elected as directors of the Hospital <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Association. D. Bakenhus was elected to take the place of the deceased M. Bauer.</p>
   <p>The following is a classification of the patients attented at the hospital during the previous year, according to their nationality and religious affiliations:</p>
