   <p>The Alexian Hospital on the North Side has been totally burned. The seventy patients in it have fled North. Seven persons who were hurt at the last fire have been moved by carriage into the Milwaukee Avenue police station. Dr. Leifert remained to the last minute at the burning house, until all the patients were saved.</p>
   <p>The Alexian brothers have immediately built a provisory hut of boards at the place where the hospital stood and are already back at their merciful activity. We hear they have taken two sick people into their little hut and have sent out two brothers to collect the most needed foodstuff and some bedding for their charges.</p>
