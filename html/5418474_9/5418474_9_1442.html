   <p>The option is a one-sided affair. The holder of an option makes use of it only when real-estate values have  risen, and the owner of the property, who has given an option in this way, loses the increase in the value of his property. Five years ago, when Niles Center had no suspicion that it would become a big city in miniature overnight, Mr. C. F. Guenther gave an option to the Central Cemetery Company on twenty acres on Gross Point Road and Harrison Street, close to the Company's cemetery, at a purchase price of one thousand dollars an acre. The Company has now taken over the property, at a time when its value is at least double or perhaps three times the option price.</p>
