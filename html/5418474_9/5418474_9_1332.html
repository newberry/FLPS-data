   <p>"The Chicago Tribune published an article on May 20th concerning my testimony in the trial of Munn. This article contains so many misrepresentations that I feel obliged to answer it. As guilty as I am, in a technical sense, of violation of the tax laws, I am not guilty in the manner and to the extent that the Tribune would make one believe. This paper has turned my testimony into something sensational. I hope that this paper will do me justice and publish also my answer.</p>
   <p>"First, I wish to explain a few unintentional errors in the reproduction by the Tribune. I have neither levied toll on H. B. Miller nor have I blackmailed him out of such amounts, that his profit was completely illusory. I maintain that Miller has not paid me money, for which he has not received equivalent value. Here are the facts: Mr. Miller was on the brink of bankruptcy. He owed the government $26,000 in taxes for which he was in arrears and he had no cash to run his distillery. In his distress he came to me for assistance. I vouched for the payment of his tax, so that time was given him and that the confiscation of his distillery was postponed. The tax was completely paid.</p>
   <p>"I accepted his notes to the amount of $35,000 so that he was able to continue his business. By accepting his notes, I endangered all my property and I saved him from bankruptcy and ruin. In ordinary times, this would have been called a praiseworthy action, but now even a gesture of friendship is branded as a crime. Mr. Miller was grateful for the service rendered and paid me for the risk I had taken. The fact that some of the money he paid me, came from contraband whiskey, is the only circumstance which makes any criminal proceedings against me in conjunction with Mr. Miller possible.</p>
   <p>"George Miller, the owner of the Lake Shore distillery found himslef in exactly the same circumstances as H. B. Miller. It has always been my fate that friends in distress have continuously come to me for assistance and that I have never turned anyone away. George Miller came to me and begged for assistance; without me he would have become a beggar. I accepted a note from him to the amount of $30,000. When I accepted his note he gave me a partnership in his distillery which I accepted. I did not know anything about the running of a distillery, nothing about its net profit. I had an inkling about the manner in which this distillery was operated and being a partner of the firm I was held legally responsible. Had it not been for this business connection with George Miller, I would have stood trial and I would have expected from my fellow citizens a verdict of 'not guilty'.</p>
   <p>"The Tribune also claims that I bled E. Jussen of $2,000 because I used my influence to have him appointed as collector. This is not so. It is true, that Mr. Jussen was appointed due to my influence but he was in office for almost six months before he paid me those $2,000. At that time the Republican party owed me $9,000 for printed matter and cash I had loaned. Mr. Jussen, who had secured through me a well paying office, had no objection to taking over part of this indebtedness. To this day the Republican party still owes me $7,000.</p>
   <p>"I believe that I have now corrected the main errors of the Tribune's article. Before I step before the judge, who will pronounce my sentence, I wish to tell the public that I fell as deeply as possible the shame to which I may be exposed. But I affirm that I am more unfortunate than guilty. I am no perjurer.</p>
   <p>"Fate has taken my riches. I am poor, poorer than when I started my career.</p>
   
   <p>The severity of a Draconian law is facing me, but poverty and misfortune I shall endure with courage and, in spite of everything, rely on the future."</p>
