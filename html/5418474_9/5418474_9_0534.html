Please rest assured that your most liberal deed created happiness. We kindly convey our heartfelt gratitude to the separate donors who have done so much to ameliorate suffering among blind scholars and children. If our friends across the ocean continue to help us in such a loving manner, then we shall be enabled to assist all who have entrusted themselves to our advice and care." Marburg, A. D.
