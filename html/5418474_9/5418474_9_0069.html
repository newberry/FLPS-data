   <p>The Mutual Assistance Club whose object and purpose are expressed by its name, gave its ninth annual ball at the Labor Hall. The 98 present and former workers of the above establishment are practically all Germans, with the exception of a few German-speaking Poles and Bohemians. The numerous friends and lady-friends of the Club were all requested to be present, which brought a very satisfactory attendance, and the melodies of Peter's orchestra induced them to enjoy lively dancing until the dawn of the new day.</p>
   <p>The Club pays its nembers $5.00 per week during periods of sickness and $50.00 for burial expenses. The capital so far, is nearly $1000.00. The officials are: John Dietrich, President; Charles Gartner, Vice President; Ex-Alderman Robert Engel, Secretary, etc. The arrangments for last Saturday's Ball were taken care of by Messrs. Engel, Retz, Nagel and a half dozen others.</p>
