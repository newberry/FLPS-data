   <p>Albert Wehde, a Chicagoan, sometime ago published a book in collaboration with Nicholas Beffel, which refers to the possibility of forging fingerprints and proves on the basis of trials and experiences, that in the criminal law, finger prints can not any longer be considered as proof of guilt. Wehde made this discovery in 1921, when he served a sentence of three years, as political prisoner in Leavenworth penitentiary. He tried to supply the East Indian revolutionaries in their fight against England with guns and ammunition, and was sentenced for violating the neutrality of the United States.</p>
   <p>During his incarceration, which lasted only nine months, because he was pardoned by President Harding, he had an opportunity to observe how an official from Oklahoma forged a fingerprint in order to obtain a reward of $33,000. This observation led Wehde to the decision to occupy himself with the question as to whether fingerprints could be forged. After several disappointments he finally succeeded in devising a method by which he is able to obtain a deceiving forgery. Although they gave him no opportunity to prove the value of his invention to judicial and criminological experts, it was used in several murder cases quite successfully by the defense, as a means of invalidating the proofs brought forward by the state's attorneys.</p>
   <p>Thus on the occasion of a murder trial in Morrison, Ill., a man accused of murder was acquitted on the basis of Wehde's investigation of his finger prints. The assertion that fingerprints are positive proof of guilt has been fairly well shaken by Wehde. Already courts of justice in New Orleans, Jersey City, and other place have declined to sentence an accused solely on the ground of fingerprints.</p>
