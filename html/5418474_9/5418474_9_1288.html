   <p>The outcome of a murder trial which opened yesterday in Judge John P. McGourty's court, is awaited with great interest. Once again the defendant is a woman, and the experience of the last few years has taught us that females are too often treated far more leniently by the jurors than are men. Consequently, it will be exceedingly difficult to convict her of murder, even more to bring her to the gallows.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Lillian Schaede, the accused in this case, is twenty-eight years old. She allegedly shot and killed her husband, Louis Schaede, owner of a sheet-iron shop at 5317 South Halsted Street. Both the woman and her husband had been married previously. This last marriage, which occurred three years ago, was obviously not a happy one. The man intended to get a divorce and, it is said, had already brought suit for that purpose. They quarreled and bickered frequently. A <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>dispute of this sort occurred on January 16.</p>
   <p>Sam Hamilton, the assistant district attorney, contended in his opening argument that the woman was so carried away by hatred and anger that as soon as her husband had retired and gone to sleep, she fired a bullet through his head.</p>
   <p>Her lawyers, Everett Jennings and Albert Schaffner, will plead self-defense. According to their version of the affair, she was mistreated by her husband, and did not make use of a revolver until her life was in danger.</p>
