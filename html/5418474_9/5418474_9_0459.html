   <p>Feelings of solidarity are not quite extinct among the workers in Chicago, no matter how often the contrary has been state by the working class that adheres to a pessimistic view.</p>
   <p>That this feeling is still alive was proved by the large attendance at a festivity which was arranged by the Workers' Legal Aid Society in Uhlich's Northern Hall yesterday, the profits to be used for the defense of those Bohemian workers who were spotted by Bonfield, the bloody Haymarket slayer, as his latest sacrifices.</p>
   <p>By securing a long term prison sentence for them Bonfield could terrorize the working class and strengthen the power of the slave drivers.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's festival was a success not only financially but, far more, morally.</p>
