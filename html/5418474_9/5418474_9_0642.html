   <p>For Relief Work in Chicago</p>
   <p>At the instance of the German Society, the Abendpost has started a collection of funds to aid those interned who were released and later came to Chicago, so that local citizens of German origin might aid them in their undeserved predicament. The Federal Government transfers these former interned Germans to the German Society. However, the Society's means are not nearly sufficient to care for these proteges properly; moreover, several hundred more of these unfortunates will arrive here soon. It is therefore necessary to gather a fund of voluntary contributions for this purpose, and local Germans will certainly not let it be said that they disappointed people of their own blood who were in need of help. So, open your hearts and your pocketbooks.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost acknowledges receipt of the following contributions which will be disbursed by the Deutsche Gesellschaft:</p>
   <p>Mrs. Mary Gross.................................. $5.00</p>
   <p>William Buettner................................ $2.00</p>
   <p>Total.............................................. $7.00</p>
