   <p>Among the many mutual aid societies, the low-German guilds take an outstanding place. They not only give a life insurance for $500, but also sick aid of $8 per week up to $1432. It is as far-reaching and liberal as any thrifty and economic administration can be.</p>
   <p>The low-German guilds selected the oak as their symbol and, like it, they defy every storm and every danger. Also who is less able can join the guilds because of its low costs and every decent and healthy person, man or woman alike, between eighteen and forty-five years of age and who understands the German language, may become a member of the guilds. The low-German guilds have grown into one of the largest, most popular, and surest types of German aid societies. Its favorable conditions, liberal aid, thrifty administration, and security of existence, make them a very blessed aid and insurance group of our times.</p>
