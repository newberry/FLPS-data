   <p>The Germans and German-Americans of Chicago have noticed for quite a while that the German Aid Society is not able to master the unemployment situation and the urgent need among the poorer elements of the German settlement.</p>
   <p>Therefore a large group of prominent German women developed a plan to form a German Women's Society, which will have the purpose of cooperating with the old German Aid Society in handling all social work programs for assistance to needy German families and individuals.</p>
   <p>The first meeting of the group took place yesterday afternoon in the office of the German Aid Society and was presided over by Consul Heinrich Clausenius, who introduced Mr. Georg Schneider, president of the German Aid Society, as the first speaker. The latter explained in detail a new social aid program, whereupon the meeting adjourned until next Wednesday afternoon.</p>
