   <p>To the Illinois Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>The Ladies' Aid of the Deutsche Gesellschaft announces an entertainment to be given at Baum's Pavilion, corner Indiana and Cottage Grove Avenues, on Thursday, September 22, and hopes that the public will patronize the affair, since one half the receipts will be given to the people in Michigan who have suffered such frightful losses in the forest fires, and the other half will be used for local relief. It will hardly be necessary to lay stress on the benevolent aspect of the entertainment in view of the great distress now prevailing in the burned districts, and undoubtedly every one will do his share. The ladies feel that they can place reliance on the Germans in supporting the efforts of the Society. The festivals given by the Ladies' Aid in the past are still well remembered, and in this instance good entertainment and refreshments will come fully up to the standards maintained in the past. Admission is twenty-five cents, and all ladies who are willing to take part in selling tickets are requested to obtain them at the office of the Deutsche Gesellschaft (German Society), 51-53 La Salle Street.</p>
