   <p>The means of the German Society in Chicago, have been, during last winter, almost exhausted through appeals from suffering countrymen and therefore the society finds itself in a position to have to appeal to the German public for help.</p>
   <p>For this purpose a meeting is called for tonight at 8 o'clock, in the upper rooms of the Germania Clubhouse, and the Society hopes, that a large number of their members, will be present.</p>
