   <p>The festival which takes place every year for the benefit of needy German war veterans, has already become an institution with Chicago Germans. These festivals have been held annually since 1911. Over $10,000 has been distributed among veterans during these years.</p>
   <p>The ranks of the veterans are thinning out rapidly, and today there are only 17 in our midst, who are living reminders of the glorious period of the war, and the founding of the Empire, and when they will follow the merciless laws of nature, and join the grand army then the occasion for arranging these festivals must disappear. And this naturally will mean a loss to the German element. Because these festivals gave hundreds of German men and women an opportunity, to meet yearly, to exchange serious and joyous thoughts, for mutual cultivation of great remembrances and honorable traditions. They came togetherto perform an act of charity, and at the same time they were able to pluck for themselves the most exquisite fruits of spirit and heart, from the tree of charity.</p>
   
   <p>Yesterday's festival was also celebrated in this sense, for which the president of the executive committee, Mr. G. A. von Massow, made all preparations, with great success.</p>
   <p>Mr. M. F. Girten, Austrian Consul, a well-liked personality in Chicago's German circles, presided with skill and humor and welcomed the large audience in the name of the veterans.</p>
   <p>The festival program was started with a prologue, composed and recited by Mr. Paul H. Ortmann. The speech of the day was held by Mr. Ernst J. Kruetgen. In simple but impressive words the speaker pointed out the purpose of the festival. He spoke of the glory of the old German empire and of the terrible suffering of the present Germany. Out of war and peace Mr. Kruetgen wove a number of pictures, which colorfully unrolled themselves before the eyes of the listeners, and if the speaker sometimes made a strong accusation, criticized severely, then the spontaneous applause of the audience proved that he was well understood.</p>
   <p>The musical program offered a series of enjoyments. Mr. Ballmann took over the instrumental part. He selected the program with taste and understanding. Home songs and martial marches, according to the occasion, were preferred by him. He hit on the right thing, as the renewed applause of his grateful listeners proved. In Mrs. Laura van der Locht, the public got acquainted with an excellent singer. The esteemed artist sang a number of songs, some with piano, and others with orchestra accompaniment. All the delightful songs were acknowledged by stormy applause.</p>
   <p>The singing society, "Harmony," was present in full numbers, under the leadership of its president, Mr. Bruno Knecht. They executed a number of his best songs. Mr. Knecht's temperamental direction, carried along the well-trained singers to brilliant performances. Again and again the audience burst into applause, and the singers were obliged to throw in additional numbers.</p>
   <p>An outstanding number of the program was the scene "Fredericus Rex." Four personal guards of old Fritz and his favorite drummer, a small, fat Negro appeared in historical uniforms of thos times and after performing some marching exercises, they sang the delightful ballad "Fredericus Rex" by Loewe. The scene was reproduced by three veterans of the World War: Otto Schwarek, Otto Dolz, and John Pannemann, also two members of the German War Veterans Association, Kurt Stengel and August Wolf. They were greatly applauded for their performance.</p>
