   <p>The first steps have been taken in the enlargement of our Hospital. We have launched a campaign for contributions. Through the generosity of the owners of the Hotel Atlantic, formerly Kaiserhof, (Imperial Palace) we have established an office there. This office serves as the headquarters for the distribution of literature. It is located in Room 118, and anyone who wishes to acquaint himself with our work is very welcome there. The pastors and congregations of Chicago, the Board of Directors of the Hospital, and the Ladies Auxiliary are making strenuous efforts to raise a building fund of at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Since our institution carries on many charitable activities--accepting and treating patients of all races, creeds, and colors, and spending from three hundred to four hundred dollars monthly for this purpose--we have many friends who are not affiliated with our religious organization, and they are also active in our cause.</p>
