   <p>The new St. Agnes Hospital, managed by the Franciscan Sisters, at 693 Halsted Street, has been opened yesterday without ceremony. Carl Baer will act as chief physician of the institution, and he will be assisted by a staff of excellent physicians. The Franciscan-Hospitals in Joliet, Freeport and San Francisco enjoy everywhere the best reputation, and in the local hospital, the patients without doubt, will receive the best care and attention.</p>
