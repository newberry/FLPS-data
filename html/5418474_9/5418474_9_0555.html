   <p>In spite of make believes and assertions, that every one who is willing to work should secure a position, and taking into consideration the comparison of the records of the same three months of last year, a considerable change has taken place, which is quite alarming.</p>
   <p>Although the society was able to secure positions for 361 persons, however, this amount is ten percent less than the previous record.</p>
   <p>The number of persons who were looking for work amounted to over 4,500, thereby showing an increase of eleven per cent.</p>
   <p>It is also noticeable that the employer is inclined to pay smaller wages for unskilled labor than before. For purposes of relief the society spent in the last three months $1,713.29.</p>
