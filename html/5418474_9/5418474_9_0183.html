   <p>The directorate of the German Hospital, consisting of Mr. John Miller, President, John Koeing, John C. Burimeister, Charles Emmerich, George Schneider, Henry Horman and Jacob Huber, announces, that the re-organization of the Hospital-Society has been completed, and that same will become in fact, what it was only in name: " A German charitable organization, which owes its origin to the public spirit of the German citizens of Chicago, and must be managed in such a manner, that it should reflect credit upon the Germans, and do justice to the purpose and aim, which it will serve.</p>
   <p>The directors decided, to publish their own paper, the "Hospital-Messenger", and in it to energetically defend themselves against the attacks, which the former president of the Society directed against the enterprise.</p>
