   <p>German citizens of Chicago!</p>
   <p>The appeal for help from Ohio has also reached our city. Thousands of unfortunates lost all their possessions, now exposed to hunger and cold pray for help!</p>
   <p>Shall we let them perish or, remembering the fire catastrophe of our city in 1871, when we were in the same position should we extend a helping hand to our benefactors? Convinced that the German citizens of our city will extend help to our unfortunate brethren in Ohio, the same as they did last year to our brethren on the Rhine and the Danube, the Chicago Turngemeinde, issues an invitation to the representatives of the different German Lodges and Societies, also to the German citizens in general, to be present at a meeting at the Nordseite Turn-halle on February 18th, at 8 o'clock P.M.</p>
