   <p>There was a good attendance yesterday afternoon at the first annual meeting of the Deutsche Frauen Verein (German Ladies' Auxiliary) of the German Society. The meeting was presided over by Mrs. Hedwig Voss, who has proved to be a most capable leader. The minutes of the meeting were read by Miss Clara Schneider, the secretary, who then submitted the following report of the Auxiliary's activities during the past year:</p>
   <p>"A year ago today the German Society appealed to German women, young and old, to organize an auxiliary which was to be a branch of the Society.</p>
   <p>"On March 7, 1878, fourteen ladies met in response to this appeal, and they arranged a meeting eight days later to complete their plans for organization. On this occasion the various officers were elected: Mrs. Marie Hessert, president; Mrs. Julie Butz, vice-president; Mrs. Marie Lassig, treasurer; and Miss Clara Schneider, secretary.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"Later, in May, an election was held, and with the exception of the presidency, which was filled by Mrs. Hedwig Voss, all other offices were filled as in the temporary election.</p>
   <p>"During the year, fourteen executive and sixteen general sessions were held.</p>
   <p>"The Auxiliary gave three afternoon entertainments and distributed presents to poor children during a Christmas celebration.</p>
   <p>"The Auxiliary now has 288 members. The reports of the treasurer, and the statements of the agent [representative in charge], of the German Society indicate the Auxiliary's value during its short existence, and tell of funds which have been collected, and of the number of friendless and abandoned persons whom the club has rescued, and helped to become useful members of society again.</p>
   <p>"It is possible that an occasional undeserving person might have been give <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>aid, but such cases were rare; after all, even with great care such things cannot be prevented. Whoever wants to be convinced of the effectiveness of the German Society need only spend an hour at the Society's office, where human misery presents itself in its most wretched aspects, and it will be seen that assistance is promptly provided there--commensurate, of course, with the available funds.</p>
   <p>"I do not believe that it is an exaggeration to declare that our city has few benevolent societies which act in a more direct manner, or which can show greater results in their efforts to relieve human suffering.</p>
   <p>"Our Auxiliary can look with pride upon the accomplishments of the past year. The teachings of genuine Christianity are embodied in our activity, and every member should try ardently to foster the growth and prosperity of our association."</p>
   <p>The treasurer, Mrs. M. Lassig, gave the following report:</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>"I consider it proper--since this is our anniversary--to give a brief report on our receipts of the past year.</p>
   <p>"In accordance with our bylaws, a detailed account will be submitted at the general meeting in May; therefore, the members will kindly report all contributions before that time.</p>
   <p>"Thus far six hundred dollars has been donated to the German Society; this amount includes contributions, and entertainments at the Turner Halle and at Clemens' Garden. I shall turn over another one hundred dollars to the German Society within the next week.</p>
   <p>"In addition to this amount, our receipts during the Christmas celebration amounted to $347.50.</p>
   <p>"The above amounts, including $100 which was sent to the South, show a <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>total of $1,147.50, and if all outstanding collections are brought in, our fund will amount to nearly $1,200."</p>
   <p>Mrs. Maria Werkmeister, the delegate to the executive board of the German Society, submitted the following statement, which is a report of the past year:</p>
   <p>"Our Auxiliary was founded a year ago, and so it may be of interest to the ladies who have worked so zealously in behalf of the German Society to learn more about the activity of the organization. As the Auxiliary's delegate to the German Society, I considered it my duty to study the books to obtain accurate information concerning the amount of money spent for charity during the year. I am now happy to present proof of your highly successful endeavors.</p>
   <p>"Through our activity we were able to make a cash payment of seven hundred dollars to the German Society. That this seven hundred dollars was not <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>the final result of all our efforts is shown by the receipts of the Christmas festival, as well as by the contribution of one hundred dollars which was later distributed to the poor, and by another donation of the same amount which was sent to sick people in the South.</p>
   <p>"I do not believe that the ladies would like to make public either the names of those persons who obtained aid, or of those who recommended certain people to the German Society, as that would be humiliating to all who received help from us. I am sure that our members will be satisfied to know that each lady has helped to relieve the suffering of the needy. I stated in a former report that the German Society had made arrangements with a boardinghouse for the care of poor and homeless people. A card given to applicants entitles them to free lodging for a night and one meal. This single charitable act entailed an expenditure of $380.26 last year. Coal given to the poor in the past twelve months has cost $95.63; donations of money, involving 381 cases, families and single people, amounted to $1,172.22. The German Society's total contributions to charity <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>from March 1, 1878, to March 1, 1879, were $1,648.11.</p>
   <p>"During the past year the ladies have undoubtedly been convinced that all my activities in behalf of the Auxiliary have been prompted by one thought: To help our association and work in its interests. Therefore I assume that you have no misgivings about my statements. I assure you that I am convinced that the suspicions which have been directed toward the German Society are unwarranted; the administration of the Society is most capable and irreproachable. Other assistance given by the German Society, which involves no monetary donations, but which depends on the agent's connections with other benevolent institutions, need hardly be mentioned, as the monthly reports of the agent fully cover this phase. Nevertheless, I must say that even if the German Society were to provide no direct relief, the help given to itinerant and local friendless, homeless Germans, stamps the Society as truly benevolent.</p>
   <p>I sincerely hope that the ladies will be successful in their efforts to <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>enlist the co-operation of every Chicago German, for only in this way will it be possible to be effective in combating poverty in the future."</p>
   <p>The secretary then read the following letter:</p>
   <p>"Chicago, Feb. 20, 1879,</p>
   <p>"To the Executive Committee of the German Ladies Club: In view of your activities, the Administrative Board of the German Society wishes to express its profound gratitude to the Deutsche Frauen Verein for the conscientious, effective work performed by your organization, and also for the active support given to our Society.</p>
   <p>"The extent of your assistance to us in making it possible to meet requests for aid within the past year is known only to those who have seen the many poverty-stricken people; therefore we feel obligated to recognize and commend the Deutsche Frauen Verein for its splendid work.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>"As poverty and distress will probably endure forever, your club should never cease its beneficent work....</p>
   <p>"We are confident that mankind will bless your club and recognize it as a lasting creation symbolizing the humanitarian spirit of our German women.</p>
   <p>"We hope that the present friendly relations between the two associations will continue, and that we will be able to work together with even greater effectiveness.</p>
   <p>"Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>"The German Society,</p>
   <p>"Geo. Schneider, president,</p>
   <p>"Max Eberhardt, secretary."</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Mrs. Voss then spoke briefly, thanking the members for their co-operation. She also told the assembly that her detailed annual report will be submitted at the general meeting in May.</p>
   <p>The club then became interested in other subjects. Finally a suggestion that members thereafter discuss matters freely at the end of a session was accepted. The ladies H. Raster, A. Kirchhoff, and W. Werkmeister were nominated as members of a committee to judge the debates. The subject at the next meeting will be "American Womens' Clubs".</p>
   <p>Mrs. C. Butz said that she had visited the Sewing Club of Mrs. Haas on Chestnut Street, where twenty-eight ladies were busy sewing. Mrs. Werkmeister was of the opinion that the founding of a sewing circle was still beyond the present means of the Auxiliary, and so the proposal was not discussed further.</p>
   <p>Adjournment followed.</p>
