   <p>The director of the Alexian Hospital, requested us to make public, that the formerly projected branch Institution on the Southside, would be established shortly, although the money for this purpose, bestowed by the Mother House in Germany, was lost through the failure of the Schweissthal Bank.</p>
   <p>The new Branch Institute of the Alexian Hospital will serve principally to receive insane patients.</p>
