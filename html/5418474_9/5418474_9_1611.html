   <p>Dreyer and Company has bought thirty-seven acres at the corner of Ashland Avenue and 47th Street. The company has built sidewalks (along the streets which traverse the property) on Paulina, Laflin, Loomis, 48th and 49th Streets, and on two additional streets which the company constructed: Justino and Dryer Streets; also, water mains have been installed.</p>
   <p>The company's progressiveness has produced results; thirty-five houses have been built in their subdivision--twenty within the last three months--all of them owned and occupied by stock yards workers. Another five homes will be built soon, and eleven other houses will be moved unto their subdivision. As the subdivision is not within the fire limits, wooden buildings are permitted. The majority of the homes erected cost less than $500 each.</p>
   <p>Lots on Ashland Avenue and 47th Street cost $200 to $300, others are offered for $150 to $175.</p>

   <p>If the buyers pay spot cash, then the company gladly provides a substantial advance to help defray building costs, but so far only three people have availed themselves of the opportunity; most of them use their own money.</p>
   <p>This new subdivision--barely a year old--has good transportation facilities by horsecar to the city, and yet is sufficiently removed from the stock yards to avoid smoke from the many factories in the vicinity.</p>
   <p>It won't take long for every available lot to be sold.....</p>
