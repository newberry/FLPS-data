   <p>[Schlaraffen or Schlaraffenland, a mythical land where baked squabs fly into one's mouth. The acme of Paradise, because its inhabitants, the Schlaraffen, don't even have to pick up the bountiful fruits of this providential and prolific Garden of Eden. Transl.]</p>
   <p>The beautiful large hall of the Germania Club House was so crowded that many were compelled to forego the pleasure of hearing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. The concert was given under the auspices of the Schlaraffia Chicagoana, for the benefit of the German, Austrian, Hungarian war widows and orphans, and it was successful beyond expectations. Albert Ulrich led the 55-piece orchestra, the members of which played gratuitously. Undoubtedly a large sum was realized, which will be given to Almatee Praga for the purpose already mentioned.</p>

   <p>The program consisted of creations by Goldmark, Weber, Hayden, Weingaertner, Liszt, Grieg, De Swert, Popper, Swendsen, Schubert, Wagner, Keller, and Speckin, offerings which were exquisitely played and rewarded with profound acclaim.</p>
   <p>As an introduction, Mrs. Maximilian Herzog recited the prologue, a fine literary accomplishment of Mr. Haenichen.</p>
   <p>The Schlaraffen had the hall tastily decorated in their colors, white and red. The ladies, Luella Sippel and five others, sold a large number of programs.</p>
