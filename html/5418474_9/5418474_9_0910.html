   <p>Carl Moll tendered his resignation because he did not approve of Agent Ender's conduct. The resignation was not accepted because the affair was not considered of sufficient importance.....[Translator's note: Details are given but are omitted in the translation because it was simply an altercation.] The monthly report of the agent follows.</p>
