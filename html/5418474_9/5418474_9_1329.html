   <p>The committee on German of the Board of Education met yesterday afternoon for the purpose of considering changes recently brought against Mr. Widekind, a teacher of German in the public schools. These changes are, in brief, that he furnished untruthful information to the Times, that the Hon. Lorenzo Brentano had rented a house of his on LaSalle Street to be used for purposes of prostitution. And that, according to the allegations of the Staats Zeitung, Mr. Widekind was addicted to certain practices which could be considered only as in keeping with a loose system of morals. There were present at the meeting Messrs. Prussing and Vocke of the committee on German, Mr. Brentano, who really brings the first charge, Mr. Hesing, appearing for the Staats-Zeitung, which brings the second, Mr. Widekind and lastly, the lady to whom, as alleged in the Times paragraph, Mr. Brentano had rented the house in question for the purposes designated.</p>
