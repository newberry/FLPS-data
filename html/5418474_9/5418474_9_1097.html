   <p>The entire English press talks about the charitable enterprises of the German Society and gives, especially much space to the lodging house. It is granted that this form of help for homeless immigrants and citizens is unique. The purpose of the German Society was to dispense help without shaming the unfortunate by giving him alms or making him feel like a beggar. One must not throw homeless people in a cold and dirty room. They must not be treated as if they were criminals.</p>
   <p>But on one point the English press makes a mistake. The Tribune and the other papers say that the Germans have started this charitable enterprise because they do not want their poor ones to become a burden on the "Relief and Aid Society." This is not so. The Germans are doing this because they believe that their poor do not receive sufficient consideration from the Relief and Aid Society. If this lack of consideration is accidental or not, if it is due to the fact that the administrative staff is made up completely of Americans, we do not wish to discuss today.</p>
   <p>But this much is certain, that due to this lack of consideration for their poor the Germans had to organize themselves.</p>
