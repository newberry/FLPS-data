   <p>The negotiations of the Northwestern Elevated Railway Company with the Alexian Brothers Hospital finally came to a satisfactory agreement. The said Railway Company is paying to the Hospital $200,00 for the strip of land, on which the latter was built.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the Hospital was given the right, to use its present building for another two years, in order to have ample time to build another hospital somewhere else. The management of the Alexian Brothers Hospital intends to buy a large piece of land on Wrightwood Avenue and will build there a bigger and more modern hospital.</p>
