   <p>It is a locality upon which a prodigal nature bestowed its blessings and where the aged are at the samt time the enviable recipients of human love and benevolence.

   <p>The foot-races, merry-go-rounds, the swings and the dancing at the pavilion...above all the usual prizes which were given to the youthful winders helped <span class="page-break">2</span>to increase the festive spirit. A list of the little ones who earned recognition for their Terpsichorean accomplishments follows: Tillie Heissler, Ed. Magerstadt.... (eleven altogether). We must also include in our report, that Andreas Thalofer, a watchmaker of No. 108 Van Buren Street, presented a beautiful clock which will be put in the entrance hall of the hospital annex. Mr. Oscar Schmoll's musical composition "Abendruhe" (Rest at the Evening Hour) which he dedicated to A.C. Hesing... has been published. Fice Hundred copies are available and he presented the entire edition to the home. The administration intends to have one of the local German music stores manage the sales campaign.</p>
