   <p>"In faith in God and in good men, in the hope of happy success, and in the name of all-powerful love"--these are the words which were used by Mrs. Clara Rehtmeyer, president of the Ladies' Society and a member of the Board of Directors of the German Old People's Home for fifteen years when, on July 5, 1913, she officiated at the laying of the cornerstone of the addition to the institution. These few words describe the noble spirit in which this gem of Chicago's German population was built, guarded, fostered, and continually developed. And what an enormous amount of labor, time, trouble, and care is involved in this task, which constantly requires new activity and new endeavors! The work has been done uninterruptedly for nearly forty years. To estimate <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and appreciate its full scope is almost beyond the human power of comprehension. And, as the Reverend Rudolph John stated at the occasion mentioned above, the best capital ever to be presented to the Old People's Home was the diligence, the loyalty, and the intelligence of the ladies, who co-operated with the men in complete harmony. The German woman's sphere of activity is revealed at its best in the Old People's Home. Here the inmates receive loving care and comfort, and in this capacity women are superior to men. Anyone who has the privilege of observing the steady and intelligent work of the Ladies' Society of the Old People's Home will think of Reverend John's words.</p>
   <p>Every housewife knows that she must be very economical in order to satisfy the needs of even a small family, to provide sufficient food, etc., so that the household may remain intact. And now consider the household of the Old People's Home, which consists of 257 members exclusive of the operating force! Still, not one inmate has ever suffered from want of sufficient food, and even during the greatest scarcity of food the meals were nourishing. It is true, at times the inmates were on short rations, yet I know from experienced people who are acquainted with the pertinent conditions, that there are only a few institutions in which the inmates are cared for and nourished as well <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>as the inmates of the Old People's Home are cared for and nourished. I have visited a similar institution. It is much more richly endowed than the German Old People's Home is. Its buildings are luxuriously furnished. Yet I heard complaints about insufficient and unpalatable food. They gave me something to drink. I did not know that it was coffee until they told me.</p>
   <p>In a way the German Old People's Home is a mirror of the German community in Chicago and Cook County; it proves that the German element has increased in numerical and in financial strength, and that it delights in works of charity. Although the principle which is based on experience--that the greatest incomes for charitable purposes are derived from amusements at festive occasions--was established many years ago, and has been followed ever since, this fact will not harm our cause. If people want to combine pleasure with charity, well and good. That is entirely in order, despite everything which "moralists" say against it--they do not give anything anyway. And thus we--I mean the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>thousands of friends of our institution--hope that when the trumpet calls to festivities at the Old People's Home early next summer, and again later, many more will come with full pockets....</p>
   <p>As a rule statistics have little practical value for the public; they are not easily remembered and are of interest only to those who make a special study of them. But we cannot avoid them when we review the development of the Old People's Home. When the old building, which has the appearance of being very comfortable, was opened in 1888, and fifty-six inmates were granted admission, the maintenance costs were modest. The exact figures are not available, but in 1892 there were seventy persons in the institution, and the disbursments amounted to $11,066, or $2.50 per week for each person. In 1906 the weekly amount for each inmate dropped to $1.81. The capital of the home had increased from $44,750, in 1888, to $183,850 in 1906. In 1915, when the new building was completed, the number of inmates rose from 124 to 224 and the cost of upkeep from $22,163 to $44,707, or from a weekly average of $2.35 per person to $3.60. This year the cost <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>of maintenance will amount to about $65,000, or $4.00 to $5.00 every week for each inmate. Let each reader learn his lesson, and when the call to special activity for the benefit of the Old People's Home is broadcast, let each one respond. Then these dry statistics will have served a good purpose.</p>
   <p>The Old People's Home as is perhaps not generally known, provides for a part of its needs by farming, for which quite a parcel of the institution's twenty acres have been set aside. Last year there was a good harvest of corn, turnips, rutabagas, carrots, spinach, and beans, and hundreds of jars of jam and jelly were made from the cherries, pears, plums, and gooseberries which were harvested from our trees and bushes. The cows supplied sufficient milk until the price of fodder became prohibitive and made it necessary to dispose of some of the animals and buy two cans of milk daily. A new building was erected to house the chickens, and they supply a sufficient quantity of eggs. A large number of pigs are raised, and there is no lack of pork or sausage. The inmates of the Old People's Home do some <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of the necessary farm work and also some work in the greenhouse for flowers. Still, the cost for food amounted to $11,583 in that year (sic); $8,447 was paid for labor, $1,420 for coal, $371 for medicines (the institution has a well-stocked home pharmacy), $1,425 for dry goods, $435 for laundry, $385 for furnishings, $1,138 for farm and garden cultivation, $476 for live stock, $488 for funerals, $789 for repairs, etc. [Translator's note: The author does not state what year is meant, nor does the sum of the figures enumerated in this sentence coincide with any of the totals which were mentioned in a previous paragraph.]</p>
   <p>And now, dear woman reader, you have a household. Compare the figures above with your expenditures for coal, ice, laundry, clothing, dry goods, food, etc., for your small family. And then think of our Old People's Home and its 250 members. You will agree that the management of the Old People's Home is in the hands of very thrifty people. And the comfort and praise of our dear old people are proof that all is well in our large family....All these costs are defrayed by the members of the Ladies' and Men's Societies. The income <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>of the Old People's Home consists partly of interest derived from the institution's capital of $170,000. The capital again consists principally of endowments, among which there is one of $20,000 which was made by the family of the late Konrad Seipp. The entrance fees of new inmates ($300 each) also increase the income. However the income thus derived is not large enough to take care of all disbursements. Consequently the Ladies' Society arranges various festivities, and when it can report to the Board of Directors that a May festival or a Christmas sale has yielded a net profit of $10,000, there is great joy. Of course, the regular contributions of the members of the Ladies' Society ($3.00 per year) and the many, many presents which are made to the Old People's Home, especially at Christmas time, are a big help. For a time some local breweries contributed beverages, but lately they have done little to satisfy the thirst of the old people.</p>
   <p>The fact that the Old People's Home has survived the first generation of the German element is a monument in honor of those who organized and supported the institution. Now the younger generation is also showing an active interest <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>in the Home. Under the able leadership of President Clara Rehtmeyer a sewing society has been organized and is very actively engaged in promoting the welfare of our old people. She also originated the plan to provide free beds for old ladies who cannot pay the entry fee, and who would otherwise have to spend their days in lonely poverty, after having toiled all their lives. Now they can be admitted to the Home and enjoy its comforts and protection free of charge. And the old ladies of the Old People's Home have rendered excellent service. Think of their work selling in the booths of the Old People's Home Society when the members arranged a May festival for the benefit of the German wounded soldiers and the German orphans....</p>
   <p>The waiting list of the Old People's Home contains seventy names and, as old Mrs. Brinkmann says, "Nobody wants to die to make room for another". Nor do we want anyone to die. We hope that fate lengthens out their declining years and makes them happy and free of care.</p>
   <p>Before the erection of the new building some applicants waited as long as <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>three years for admittance. Others despaired of ever gaining admission and committed suicide, and some died before there was room for them in the Home. In reference to those who are now patiently looking forward to the time when they can be received, Mrs. Rehtmer made this significant statement: "We have much unfinished work to do in the future. Let us face it hopefully....It is apparent that individuals are cognizant of the duty which they owe the community."</p>
   <p>When they act according to their knowledge, it will not be necessary for anyone to wait three years to be admitted to the Old People's Home.</p>
   <p>Time and space will not permit us to name all loyal co-workers within and without the institution. Mr. and Mrs. Waltershausen, who manage the Home, have won well-merited recognition from the authorities of the State. Doctor Masslows and other physicians have devoted much time to the physical needs of our old people. Several clergymen have provided public services (worship) and have cared for the spiritual needs of some inmates in private. But some persons have been especially active in behalf of the Home. Among them are:</p>
