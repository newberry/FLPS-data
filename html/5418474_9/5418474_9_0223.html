   <p>"It is gratifying, indeed, to be able to report that things take their usual course in the German hospital. New patients are accepted continually, and others are dismissed as healed. The angel of death also appears occasionally and demands his victims. Since the latter part of April about 80 patients entered and 40 of them have been dismissed as healed. About 20 operations have been performed during this time, and some of them were very difficult, but all of them turned out very successfully.</p>
   <p>About 50 cases have been treated in the dispensary of the hospital. Dr. J. H. Hoelscher gives his personal attention to the dispensary daily from 10 to 12 o'clock during the forenoon, except on Sunday. Recently, a very sick patient bequeathed to this institution $8,000 and $2,000 to the Old Peoples Home, but the successful medical treatment restored his health again and this, of course, was the end of the princely gifts. Although we need the money very much, yet we are glad for the successful treatments, and we trust others will be induced to manifest their good will toward these institutions."</p>
