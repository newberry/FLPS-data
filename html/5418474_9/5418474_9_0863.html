   <p>The well known Social Club "Erholing" celebrated last night, with numerous attendance of its members and friends in Freiberg's hall, its sixth foundation Festival. The program was simple, but gave general satisfaction.</p>
   <p>Articles donated by the ladies, were raffled. The net profits of the festival will be used as Christmas presents for poor children because the whole aim of the Club is based on charity. Fourteen families are aided at the present time. The officers of the Club, who arranged this Festival are: President Mrs. Dr. Fredigke, Vice President, Mrs. Berger, Prat. Secretary Mrs. Bergersdorf, Finance Secretary Mrs. Loescher and Treasurer Mrs. Rohlfs.</p>
