   <p>The rebuilding of the Rosehill Orphanage, which was destroyed by fire recently, was discussed at a meeting yesterday by priests and laymen of our seven Catholic parishes. The following clergymen were present: Reverends Fischer of St. Antonius Church, De Dycker of St. Michaels Church,....[seven names altogether] and Lorenz Biehl, secretary of the Orphanage, as well as Messrs. H. H. Heating....[three names] and others.</p>
   <p>Reverend De Dycker, president of the Orphanage, opened the meeting, and it was decided to start reconstruction immediately. The new building will be 120 by 50 feet, three stories high, and will be made of stone. Architects Paul Huber, Dillenburg, and Egan will draw the plans, which will be submitted for approval on Thursday, a week from tomorrow.</p>
   <p>How the money is to be raised was not decided--but the matter will be definitely regarded as of German concern. Sympathy has been manifested everywhere. The <span class="page-break">2</span>Vorwaerts-Turner [an association] and Mr. Bernhard Baum have offered the use of their halls for various entertainments.</p>
   <p>A general inspection after the fire showed that there was still shelter available for the children, also food, but there was a serious shortage of clothing and beds; the latter were all burnt. Shoes and boots are needed particularly. Donations of such articles will be appreciated. Nearly three-fourths of the children at the institution are boys.</p>
