   <p>The Executive Board of the German Aid Society held a meeting last night, in the guest room of "Old Quincy No. 9",presided over by Mr. John Feldkamp, who introduced Messrs. Wilhelm Bocke and Henry Hill as speakers. They both took the standpoint that the German Aid Society, even when aided by donations, would not be strong enough, financially, to establish and maintain a soup-kitchen in every part of Chicago. A program of this magnitude can be carried out, only, with the assistance and cooperation of the city administration. Therefore, Mr. Wilhelm Thielepape was intended to write to the Mayor of New York, and ask him for information on the functioning of soup kitchens, which have been in successful operation there many years, each winter.</p>
