   <p>A special meeting was called by the Central Executive Committee of the North American Singers' Alliance yesterday evening at Quincy Number Nine to consider details preparatory to giving a concert for the victims in New Ulm, as suggested by the Illinois Staats-Zeitung. The Central Executive Committee represents the majority of our Chicago singing societies. The Germania, Orpheus, Eintracht, Harmonie, Concordia, Allemania, Freier Saengerbund, South Side Liederkranz, and Schiller Liedertafel were represented by delegates. Franz Amberg, president of the Alliance, acted as chairman, and O. W. Schmidt, secretary of the Alliance, attended to the minutes. After a lengthy discussion of the plan, in which it was shown that Miss McCarthy, as well as Messrs. Schultz and Leivermann, could be relied upon to co-operate, that Hans Balatka would be the leader, and that the program would consist of selections given by the combined choral societies in the last Song Festival and of numbers sung by the separate clubs, it was decided to give the concert and that German folk songs should predominate. A committee consisting of Messrs. J. P. Hand, Philip Maas, Hermann Pomy, A. T. Nussbaumer, A. Bucher, E. Heinze, and E. G. Uihlein was appointed to procure a hall, stipulate the day, and so forth. Hans Balatka and Theodore Gestefeld were added to the committee in an advisory capacity.</p>
   <p>The committee will meet Friday at 5 P.M. at Quincy Number Nine to receive the reports of subcommittees about halls, soloists etc. In the interim the chairmen, the music committees, and the various leaders are requested kindly to communicate with Mr. Balatka before Friday if possible and to submit a list of the songs which the several clubs have selected for the occasion in order to arrange the program. It has been planned to restrict the concert entirely to songs, simple choral selections, since our local singing societies have so large a repertory available. Of course not every club can appear separately because of the limited time available, but several clubs which have the same conductor can combine as a single unit. Enough time for rehearsals is available because the concert can hardly be given before the end of next week. The invitation to participate in the concert applies to all singing societies, whether they are affiliated with the Alliance or not, and the committee expects that every German song club will do its utmost for the success of the cause.</p>
   <p>At the session of the Central Executive Committee matters, pertaining to the Singers' Alliance were also considered, and the president and the secretary were requested to send letters to all who were associated in making the last festival a success. Besides expressing appreciation for the efforts of all participating, the letters all lay stress on the formation of an alliance of all the Chicago singing societies. The secretary was requested to circularize all Chicago singing societies, inviting them to send delegates to the convention which is to be held at some future date to consider the formation of the afore-mentioned Chicago Alliance.</p>
