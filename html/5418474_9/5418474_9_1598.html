   <p>The Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad Company leased a plot of ground 60 feet wide and 319 [feet] long on Union Street, near Caroll Avenue to the Pabst Brewing Company for a term of twenty-five years at an annual rental of $5. The papers were drawn up yesterday. The Brewing Company agrees to build a branch there, and a siding will be constructed by the Railroad Company. If the buildings should be destroyed by fire, then they must be rebuilt within four months. Should the Railroad Company revoke the contract before November 1, 1925, then it must pay for the buildings.</p>
