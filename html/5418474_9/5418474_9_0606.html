   <p>The Columbia and the Lake View Womens' Clubs are willing to do their share to alleviate the destitution of the children in Germany. As their current contribution, they have decided to purchase two hundred dollars' worth of foodstuffs and clothing for the needy youngsters.</p>
   <p>In addition, the two clubs have asked their members to contribute clothes and shoes, old or new, to the good cause. It is imperative to give aid at once, for an immediate contribution is doubly valuable. Contributions by nonmembers are also gratefully accepted. Through the help of one gentleman, the clubs have already received many useful gifts for the good purpose. Mr. Wetterling, 1834 Barry Avenue, will accept contributions for the clubs.</p>
