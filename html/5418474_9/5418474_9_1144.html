   <p>In the last twelve months the German Society has undergone great and splendid transformations. From a crippled state in which it languished without strength even to die, it has filled itself again with fresh and promising life. Even its outside appearance has now become highly respectable. The new place in Washington street is large, light, and attractively furnished. It consists of an office and a writing room in which there is a library for immigrants. Dr. Engelhardt and Mr. Julius Rosenthal have given books. Copies of several newspapers from Chicago, as well as outside, lie on the table.</p>
   <p>The board now consists of men who understand that one must give the only German purely benevolent association more than passing attention, and one can now find daily, the president and some of the directors in the office. The board consists of George Schneider, president; Jacob Beiersdorff, vice-president; Herman Lieb, secretary; Henry Biroth, treasurer; Julius Rosenthal, M. Berg, Louis Wahl, H. Claussenius, W. Hettich, Arthur Erbe, Fritz Rieta, H. Enderis, and Carl Tarnow, directors.</p>

   <p>The board has recently been successful in impressing upon the city officials that they must pay greater attention to the interests of the society. The police commissioners have made an agreement with the railroad that they will announce ahead of time the coming of German immigrant trains, so that one or more German policemen can be sent to the stations where they arrive.</p>
   <p>The Parmalee Bus Company has finally yielded to the energetic protests of the board and promised not only to refund money in future when it can be proven that conductors of the company have mistreated the immigrants but also to employ some German conductors.</p>
   <p>Since April 7, the day when the constitution was amended, women also are admitted as full fledged members and can therefore also be elected to the board. The first ladies received as members are: Frau Louise Degenhardt, Ivan Jacob Beiersdorff, and Miss Clara Schneider.</p>
