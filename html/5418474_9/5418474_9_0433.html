   <p>The charitably inclined Germans of Chicago celebrated a festival, yesterday, which will be remembered as the outstanding festival of the season. Friends of the Altenheim were triumphant over the great success which surpassed even the dreams of an optimist. But the English speaking people also took a great interest in this celebration, and it was not at all surprising to see many of that nationality on the picnic grounds of the Luisen grove. A signal given, late in the afternoon, summoned the guests to the speaker's platform where Henry Greenebaum was ready to give the festival address, in which he highly praised the institution's benefactor, A. C. Hesing.</p>
