   <p>This order is represented in Chicago by 14 lodges with a membership of about 800, all of whom belong to the laboring class. The Harugari Order, has held its first festivity, a mask Ball, at the Vorwarts Turnhalle, last Saturday night, and the decorations used on this occasion bore mottoes, in the real German spirit. Notwith standing the stormy weather, the Hall was filled to capacity, which is the highest assurance of the high esteem felt for this Order, whose banners were inscribed with the motto:"Benevolence, Love and Humanitarianism."</p>
   <p>It has been brought to our knowledge, that the net profit will be distributed among the lodges, for the benefit of the sick and needy members of the Order. We wish them success!</p>
