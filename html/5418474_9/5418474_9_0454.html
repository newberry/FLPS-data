   <p>The shareholders of the German House met yesterday under the chairmanship of President Schmutz. The secretary, Mr. Henry Marwedel, read his annual report. He spoke first of the great hopes that the construction of the German House had aroused fifteen years ago and that, unfortunately, due to the general lack of interest were not realized. The number of shareholders quickly melted away. However, enough remained to keep the German House out of the grip of the sheriff. The original grant of $25,000 was made only very hesitatingly and soon proved insufficient. (The actual cost proved to be $36,202). The shareholders voted no additional money, leaving the task of seeing it through to Mr. W. Schmutz and H. Lamperter who had pledged their own property. Due to that fact the building was completed. It is now an adornment of the North Side even though not all its shops are rented very profitably to the shareholders. There is no theater. The rents have brought more, already, during the first winter than the theater would have returned, and there is no danger of temporary loss of rent and no necessity of paying three or four percent more for fire insurance for a theater.</p>
   <p>The fact that the German House was able to make debts to the amount of $30,000 at least proves that it has credit to that amount. Besides, the outlook is <span class="page-break">2</span>excellent. Already the Sharpshooters' Association and the Germania Male Choir, very pleasant and respectable tenants, had asked for contracts for several years for their locals. That, however, will be up to the next administrative council to decide.</p>
   <p>After the report was accepted the election of the new council was undertaken. The following gentlemen were elected: Schmutz, Lamperter, Bosse, Heide, Wunderle, Kafer, Huck, Schaub, Brachvogel, Waldhauser, Kruger, Marwedel, and Jensch.</p>
   <p>The rooms in the German House, with the exception of one 31 x 110 ft. shop, are all rented. Since then, $4,232 have come in.</p>
