   <p>A meeting was held at the Vorwaerts Turnhalle (Turner Hall), yesterday afternoon, to devise ways and means to help the Rosehill orphanage, since the orphanage was destroyed by fire some time ago. A fairly large number of Germans from the Southwest Side responded.</p>
   <p>Wilhelm Ruehl was named chairman, and Michael Sebastian secretary. The committee decided to give a concert on Monday, November 10, at the Vorwaerts Turnhalle. Fritz Knepper offered the hall without charge for the occasion. Various song clubs and individuals have offered to participate. The committee on refreshments also reported favorably. Aloys Wolf promised to supply all cigars which will be used on that day. The printers, Mueller, Wagner, and Umbdenstock will supply all printed matter free.</p>
   <p>On J. Roeder's motion, a committee was formed to arrange the concert. The <span class="page-break">\2</span>members were: Reverend Kalvelage....[eight in all]. It was then decided to hold another meeting Friday evening, at eight o'clock, in the small assembly room of the Vorwaerts Turnhalle, to receive the reports of all committees, and everyone having the interests of the unfortunate children at heart is cordially invited.</p>
