   <p>A large crew of laborers is at present engaged in tearing down a number of old buildings on the west side of North Clark Street, between Kinzie and North Water Streets, to make room for a large brick building, which will be erected by Mr. Charles Ulich, and which will extend from North Water Street to Kinzie Street. The first story will contain a number of stores, which have already been rented at a very high rental. The second story will be arranged for offices, and the third story, which will measure 25 feet in height, will be divided into two spacious halls. The larger one will be used as a dance hall, and the smaller will serve as a meeting place for the Masonic Order. The cost of the structure is estimated at $100,000.</p>
