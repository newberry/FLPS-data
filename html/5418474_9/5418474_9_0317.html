   <p>All congregations of the State of Illinois, which are members of the German Orphan Home Association, celebrated yesterday the 19th annual Orphan Festival at Addison(Illinois.) The attendance by visitors and guests was unusually large, which pleased exceedingly Pastor Lueche, who was leading the churchservice on this occasion.</p>
   <p>Pastor Budach then gave a speech, pointing out the needs and immense care-requirements of homeless children. Also the pastors Doederlein and Fischer addressed the assembly and appealed to the generosity of the German Lutherans for contributions towards the welfare of the Addison Orphans.</p>
   <p>A well arranged program of music-pieces, chorus-songs and recitals of various kinds concluded the celebration, which netted a profit of $4000.00 for the Orphanage.</p>
