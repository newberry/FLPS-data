   <p>The judges of the local federal district court have appointed a new officer for the department of paroles. He is the thirty-three-year-old Walter K. Urich of Park Ridge, who until recently was employed by the I E R C.</p>
   <p>Urich is the successor of William A. McGrath, who has occupied the office for the past five years, retiring in April of this year, together with his deputy, Thomas C. Smith.</p>
   <p>Smith's place will be taken by the twenty-four-year-old John J. Collins, 6410 Kenwood Avenue. He also has been employed by the I E R C.</p>
   <p>Urich has declared that, in all his official acts, he will be guided by the wishes of President Roosevelt, who advocates the greatest caution in recommending paroles. He hopes that, in all his endeavors, he will be aided by all authorities.</p>
