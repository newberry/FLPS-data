   <p>The monthly report of the German Society's Agent, Chas. Enders, for the month of February, states:-</p>
   <p>1500 Immigrants arrived against 1300 in January.</p>
   <p>Only a small part remained in the city. Extortions by immigrant tavern keepers were not reported. The call from the unemployed at the Bureau is still very large; most of them want to get work in the city, because they don't like to go to the country.</p>
   <p>Good farmhands are already in demand. Employed, mostly farmers and gardeners were 123. 136 unemployed were given work and board, among them 42 woman and girls. Of those who asked for relief 72 were given assistance and for this purpose $406.25 have been spent. 85 letters were received. About 40 persons called for their mail. In one of the letters the heirs to a large legacy in Germany were sought, whom we located in Salem, Marion County, Illinois. The other letters were mostly requests for work and assistance, also asking for information.-</p>
