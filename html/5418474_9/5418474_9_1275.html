   <p>In a weekly paper with a quite large circulation in some of Chicago's suburbs, there is a story written in tones of deepest indignation, but which really deals with but a foolish prank. On closer examination, however, it proves itself as having a deeper meaning.</p>
   <p>A number of children came together and wrote a blackmail letter to a family. They wanted to kidnap their little daughter, or perhaps even kill her, if the sum of $12 is not deposited at an indicated spot.</p>
   <p>The money was not deposited. The local police hunted up the culprits and booked them. Immediate punishment was refrained from, which is remarkable. The youthful offenders, however, were held in no uncertain terms that this <span class="page-break">2</span>booking would weigh quite heavily against them should they again for some reason get into conflict with the police. Together with this affair it became known that about sixty members of the community's youth were booked, children in the ages of from 6 to 16 years.</p>
   <p>Now, the police turns to the parents. Such conditions must be done away with. The parents must prevent their children from getting knowledge of kidnaping stories.</p>
   <p>Aside of the absurdity of such a demand, why are they so craven? Why don't they openly declare their deeds of valor, even though it is hard to do so?</p>
   <p>To be sure, the parents are in part to blame for these things. If they, however, would like to attack the problem as they really should attack, then they would come in conflict with the same police who now bestir themselves on the high horse of moral indignation.</p>

   <p>Children were permitted to do almost anything which for the sake of the children should have been forbidden. Children are burdened with things the value or worthlessness of which they cannot be expected to judge. Just listen once to the so-called "children's hour" as broadcast by the radio stations. Observe the kind of films children are allowed to see, what sort of literature is made available to them. The most irresponsible toward children are those people who have no children of their own, to whom other people's children are toys with which to make their experiments.</p>
   <p>Many parents have become meek. They care little for their children. They leave the children to the school and, what is worse, to themselves, partly because they do not know any better, partly because it is convenient, and partly because they want to keep away from what is unpleasant to them.</p>
   <p>For their bad manners, we have all kinds of excuses today. To be a child is tantamount to being scot free. Good manners are suspicious. The brats are dominant all over. Grown persons have a certain fear of children.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The surprise comes, however, when a generation grows up that has no respect for laws, and is civilized only with respect to the clothing they wear. Criminality is on the increase among youthful persons to an appalling extent. One hopes to get around these things with foolish self-deceptions because we are afraid to do something drastic about it.</p>
   <p>It would be easy to continue showing these conditions for some time longer. There is, however, no point in that. It will change nothing until circumstances will force us to make a radical detour. It is then likely that we will go into the other extreme. At any rate, and until then, let us at least try not to be made ridiculous in the attempt. We would only make things worse in a situation which is sad enough.</p>
