   <p>The annual meeting of the Schwaben-Verein presided over by William Jauss, president of the Verein, took place yesterday in the dining room of the North Side Turner Hall. It is the custom at a meeting of this kind to distribute cash gifts from the financial surplus made at the Cannstatt Volksfest.</p>
   <p>First of all, the minutes of the various board meetings during the last months were read by Mr. Julius Schmidt. He is the former secretary of the society, who had served for many years and who was now substituting for the present secretary, Mr. Heinrich Hieber, now absent on a trip to Germany. Charles Rink, treasurer, and Mr. Roller, financial secretary, then submitted their reports. Mr. Hieber next read the proposals made by the board regarding the gifts to be made at this time to charitable institutions, hospitals, and the like. All of the proposals were approved.</p>
