In February 10,450 in March 16,700 and in April about 20,000 inimmigrants went through Chicago. Of this the Scandinavians constituted the majority; next were the Bohemians and West Prussians. Only a few of the travellers were in need of help and a very small percentage remained in this city. At the office of this Society we had 1924 persons calling, among them 205 employers, mostly farmers and florists. The demand for carpenters and cabinet makers was very lively. Only 271 applicants for work out of 1182 were placed.</p>
