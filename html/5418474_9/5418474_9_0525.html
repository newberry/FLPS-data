   <p>From the American Children's Home in Schleswig, we received the following letter, a grateful acknowledgement for a dollar contribution. The appreciation is directed to Mr. Wilhelm Middelschulte, and Miss E. Ottershagen. "The Home cared for 248 children in the year 1923-24. The following cases find acceptance: General debility, anemia, scrofula, grandular tuberculosis, pulmonary disease in their primary stages, and osteomalacia. [Softening of the bones. Translator]</p>
   <p>"Children sent to our institution this year give the impression of being physically inferior even to former patients; a condition undoubtedly attributable to the ravages of malnutrition which <span class="page-break">\2</span>afflict ever increasing areas. Our home actually proved its efficacious treatment in saving many a tiny inmate's life, and among the older contingents the beneficial influence also became readily apparent.</p>
   <p>"We have happily outlived the chaos of the paper money deluge which subsided in November of last year. But, unfortunately, through the establishment of the Rentenmark [Revenue or liquidation Mark, Translator] our children's home suffered a financial relapse as we are confronted with new difficulties in providing the maintenance capital.</p>
   <p>"Likewise, the children's destiny has not been improved by the Rentenmark, because regardless of the high cost of living, wages and salaries were reduced twenty to forty per cent from former standards, due to Germany's financial plight, bringing family budget problems in its wake, and <span class="page-break">\3</span>inevitably, malnutrition.</p>
   <p>"The continuance of this home, whose beneficial influence manifests itself throughout the entire province of Schleswig-Holstein, is really a dire necessity, and, therefore, we hope that our friends and benefactors will aid us in our task. The compassion of these philanthropically inclined people who so lovingly considered the necessities and sorrows of the German children, is amply proved by the divers contributions we received in the past year, and we herewith express our ardent thanks." Holley, City Councilor, Schleswig.</p>
   <p>"Miss Frieda Koehler, school teacher in Charlottenburg, [a suburb of Berlin,]Christstr. 18, sends thanks in the name of all to whom she distributed presents from the several boxes she received. A package from Miss Schellbach is especially mentioned. A blind soldier, was given a suit of clothing; a Mr. Miersch also received one. A working <span class="page-break">\4</span>woman completed a partly knitted jacket, by dividing the thick wool. Stockings, shoes, clothing, everything was impartially divided, even apparently unimportant items were utilized, only old gloves find few recipients, as most people wear none. All other donations prove veritable blessings. They create boundless joy, and the people are so thankful.</p>
   <p>"It taught us not to be discouraged during sordid times, and that we poor Germans are rich after all, made so by the love of the German-Americans. We again thank you heartily."</p>
   <p>Otto Bartel, Berlin-Schoeneberg [a locality: "Nice Hill"] Sedanstr. 76, [Sedan: Name of the French town, where the final French-German battle was fought September 1, 1870], suffers from epilepsy since birth, and, therefore, never could find permanent employment. Since the last ten <span class="page-break">\5</span>months, he has had no work of any kind, and is expected to support his sickly mother. He asks not to be forgotten.</p>
   <p>Likewise, Siegfried Froehlich, [Froelich: Happy] Stettin, Gruene Wiese [Green Meadow] 11; has no work, and is in dire need.</p>
   <p>Family Lang, Augsburg [Eye-Burgh] Bayern, Neuburgerstr. [New Citizen Street] 47, implores us for some donation. The father was for three and one-half years in the War; wounded in the left lung, out of work at present, mother ailing, four small, undernourished children.</p>
   <p>Help ameliorate the intense suffering and the great distress which afflicts our Fatherland. Send money and clothing to the American Welfare Association, 128 North La Salle Street, Room 47, Phone, Franklin 0339.</p>
