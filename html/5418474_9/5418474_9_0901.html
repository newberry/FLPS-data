   <p>The German Society: The receipts of last month amounted to $183.75.</p>
   <p>A Committee consisting of Messrs. Niehoff, Swissler and Borlin was elected for the purpose of getting in communication with real estate dealers, to find a suitable lot for the projected building of the "German Society." The cost of the latter was estimated at $40,000( the price of the lot not included); the building should have five floors with a high main floor; first of all it should serve the purpose, to offer all immigrants a moderate priced and safe refuge, naturally to contain ample rooms for the German Society's own business offices. Also it should be located as close as possible to the center of the city.</p>
   <p>The elected committee should issue a proclamation to the German citizen, regarding the making of subscriptions for the building... The agent's report says, that the immigration in September of this year amounted to 5300 persons.</p>
