   <p>The Mayor has evoked the license of Fred Dietzsch and Charles Meyer as manager of the "Minnesota House". These contemptible fellows got hold last Saturday of a German couple(immigrants), induced them to go to their hotel and informed them they could not leave before Monday.</p>
   <p>The object of this was naturally to fleece those poor people by charging them an enormous bill for rooms and other items.</p>
   <p>This case was reported through a detective.</p>
