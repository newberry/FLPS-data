   <p>Dr. Simon commented upon the rapid conversion recently of many Chicago Germans to supporters of the Hitler Government. This he attributed to the natural desire of the German to retain his ties with the homeland and his realization that the Nazi Government, whatever its limitations in some respects, has brought about long-needed reforms. The Jewish question he regarded as a purely German one and not subject to the interference of outside groups. Localism, the bane of Germans at home and abroad, has been wiped out by one drastic stroke. As yet, Germans in Chicago continue to isolate themselves in a community with relatively few ties connecting them with similar communities in Milwaukee and elsewhere despite geographic proximity.(The influence of the new orientation towards the Hitler Government upon provincialism among German foreign groups in Chicago and elsewhere remains to be seen, and very shortly:--comment by interviewer, Dr. Harvey Wish, Asst. Supervisor, Foreign Language Group Survey.) Heretofore, according to Dr. Simon, the process of assimilation among Germans had been exceptionally rapid due to the cessation of immigration on any appreciable scale.</p>
