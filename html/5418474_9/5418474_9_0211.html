Every week, one or two lectures are given by experienced physicians, on the subject: "Care of Patients" and in connection, therewith, general work at the hospital provides the practical application for a thorough training. Uniforms are furnished gratuitously. At the end of the second year, each nurse is given a diploma and $100.00 in addition.
