   <p>The Victor Lenel Foundation, a children's recreation home in Mannheim, Germany, acknowledges our recent contribution in the following communication:</p>
   <p>"We thank you heartily for your donation .... we have thereby been enabled to keep our portals open ....</p>
   <p>"Germany's plight becomes steadily worse .... new terrors arise. The sorrow afflicting children is indescribable .... and therefore we are so grateful that you have helped us to alleviate suffering among them. After all, they are not responsible for present conditions.</p>
   <p>"The contribution you so kindly sent has been a great help to us. Even the bare necessities of life are lacking .... Merchants everywhere demand payment, but we have no money. In the past, our German philanthropists <span class="page-break">2</span>gave us ample support, but these good people are now also poverty-stricken as a result of the terrible currency depreciation. And since we must depend upon the benevolence of others, we are sorely pressed. However, we trust and hope that the good Americans will come to our rescue as they have in the past, so that our misery will be lessened. Again, our sincerest thanks for your donation."</p>
