   <p>The press is a powerful weapon for justice, but may also become a serious impediment in the promotion of justice. Numberless crimes which are committed in secret would never be punished if the press did not publicize them. The press acts as a spur for the Police Departments and States-Attorneys and forces them, and in thousands of cases against their will, to investigate and trace the crimes and to punish the criminals. But when the press has accomplished this end, it starts to destroy its own good work. Instead of cooperating with thepolice and the courts, the press frustrates their efforts by indulging in sentimental spells, thereby making it difficult to get the necessary evidences, and not infrequently the guilty become aware of the threatening danger by the reports of the press, and are therefore in a position to escape in time.</p>
   <p>We have an outstanding case of such unwise actions in the present investigation by the courts of the city council. It can not be denied that the press was chiefly instrumental in starting this investigation. This is commendable, and should have been final. But instead of this they publish material patent with untimely evidences, in their effort to furnish news for their readers. By <span class="page-break">2</span>their action they destroy the source of information from which proofs have been produced, and would have yielded more if kept secret. The press also mentioned the names of those who are under suspicion, thereby warning them, and inducing them to destroy the evidences of guilt and to bribe witnesses. The States-Attorney the Grand Jury, the witnesses are interviewed, and what should have remained a secret until the court-proceedings take place, becomes an open secret widely published.</p>
   <p>If the prosecution of the scoundrels in the city council fail, the press will have to be partly blamed for it.....</p>
   <p>Of course the press is not to be blamed alone. The public wants sensational news, and strongly seasoned food. Every newspaper which does not furnish it, must suffer losses in the struggle for existence. Therefore the cry for the sensational by the people is more or less responsible for the continuation of prevailing conditions.</p>
