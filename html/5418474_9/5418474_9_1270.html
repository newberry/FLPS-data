   <p>By means of the radio, the former attorney, William Schoch, thirty-seven years old, managed to secure the addresses of well-to-do people whose houses were subsequently broken into. According to his own statement, 125 houses were robbed in this manner during the last year, and clothes, jewelry, etc., valued at about $500,000, were stolen.</p>
   <p>Schoch's pretty, twenty-two-year-old wife, Marvel, and William Fitzgerald, forty-seven years old, were also arrested.</p>
   <p>Louis W. Anderson, who has a jewelry store at 3559 Armitage Avenue, and three other men whose names are still kept secret by the police, will have to stand trial as fences in the same case.</p>

   <p>In the statement of the police, Schoch is one of the most cunning criminals that they have encountered recently. He was the leader of a well-organized gang of thieves, and went about his robberies in a systematic way.</p>
   <p>He sat in front of his radio in the evening and wrote down the names and addresses of all those who sent in requests to the radio station for the playing or singing of particular songs, musical pieces, etc. Schoch figured--and in most cases he was correct--that it would be profitable to pay a visit to these houses. While he was engaged in pillaging these houses his wife sat behind the steering wheel of her automobile, and kept watch in front of the house.</p>
   <p>Schoch and his associate, Fitzgerald, will also have to stand trial for attempted homicide. Last month they wounded the private policeman Joseph Vavra when he surprised them in the act of breaking into a physician's home at 3643 North Avers Avenue.</p>
