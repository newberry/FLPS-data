   <p>According to the construction plan, the new building, covering a space of 100 x 40 square feet, will have three stories and a basement. The northern main front will be made of pressed brick with a terra cotta filling towardsthe roof, bearing the inscription: Deutsches Hand im Neuen Land, Schirmes Gott mit <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>starker Hand, which translated, means: German House in this new land - May God protect it with his strong hand.</p>
   <p>Otherwise the construction will be simple and fireproof. The basement will contain the apartments of the manager and his assistants, also a dining room 52 x 121/2 ft., two kitchens and a toilet, furthermore, a store room.</p>
   <p>The first floor will have eleven bedrooms, one parlor, one waiting room, one office, one bathroom and one toilet.
