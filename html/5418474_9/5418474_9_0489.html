   <p>The benefit performances in the Lorelei Theater, from which the proceeds go entirely to the needy of German extraction, suffered from the inclement weather which kept many at home; nevertheless, it yielded good results.Thus, many families were provided with Christmas joy.</p>
   <p>The financial outcome which had been verified by a committee consisting of representatives from the German-Austro-Hungarian charities committee of the German Society and the Abendpost amounted to $228.60 for tickets sold and $102.40 in cash, making a total of $331.</p>
   <p>From unnamed donors came $2.40 in gifts. Mayor Cermak contributed his share, as in the preceding years. His real estate firm sent a $100 check for the Christmas fund.</p>

   <p>Today the sum of $331 was distributed equally between the German Society of Chicago and the German-Austro-Hungarian Charities Committee. This afternoon, the charities committee began the distribution of its money, whereas the German Society, whose list for special charities has nearly fifty families, will start its distribution today, but will continue it next week, as all the needy cannot be reached on one day.</p>
   <p>Those who planned the drive use this opportunity to express sincere thanks to all who gave a hand.</p>
