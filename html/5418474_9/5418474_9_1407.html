   <p>In Germany, complaints about arrests, for investigation of "suspicious" persons are numerous; here, however such procedure does not happen often, as only such persons who are believed to have committed a serious crime are refused the privilege of bail. Such barbaric acts, as imprisoning innocent people, merely because they happened to be unlucky witnesses of some heinous offense, are fortunately the exception. In general, one may say, that the principal mistake of American legal Administration is not its harshness against the accused, but to the contrary, its exaggerated leniency towards actual criminals.</p>
   <p>The just benefits derived from the granting of bail, which should be restricted only to those, whose innocents is apparent or probable, is considerably abused at present, giving special advantage to undoubtedly guilty scoundrels. A convincing example is the case of that jury-briber, GRAHAM, who was virtually "caught in the act" and yet, he was given his liberty, after furnishing very moderate bail and questionable security.</p>
   
   <p>Naturally he absconds before his trial. Now, the whole world says: that was to be expected and if the prosecutor accepted bail, he should not have recognized Graham's attorney or Alexander Sullivan, the defendant's partner.</p>
   <p>Such a system makes an army of police useless. etc.</p>
