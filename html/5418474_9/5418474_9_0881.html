   <p>Yesterday was the monthly business meeting of the board of directors of the Deutschen Gesellschaft in Niehof's bank offices.</p>
   <p>The impudence with which this so-called benevolent society makes its statements public is indeed touching. From total monthly receipts amounting to $362 only $57.42 were spent for the original and correct purpose.</p>
   <p>And what will become of the rest? Our readers are asking.</p>
   <p>Well, there are the officers and clerks, receiving each $80.00 per month, and there is the rent, a very important item, as Mr. Niehoff, the owner of the building, himself is a prominent member of the society.</p>
   <p>He shows himself, though, once a year, as a great benefactor, by considerably reducing the rent on December 31st and then raising it again on January 1st. This procedure does not show any advantage for the society as far as we could figure out with our modest and limited abilities.</p>
   <p>During winter the society is forced to spend more for charity, but on the other hand the receipts are larger. All in all, we do not think it an <span class="page-break">2</span>exaggeration to state that for every dollar paid out for charity, your dollars are being used for other purposes.</p>
   <p>But in another direction this society's blessings show very effectively. When anyone of the slave drivers cannot procure a slave on the market, mostly because he is known or on account of some strike, he confidentially applies to the Deutschen Gesellschaft, for this society always has a number of these unfortunate ones on hand, who can be bought for any amount. This is, in short, the humanitarian activity on the part of the Deutschen Gesellschaft.</p>
