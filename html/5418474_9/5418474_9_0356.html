   <p>An orphans' benefit festival will take place today in Wright's Grove. The well known sympathy of the Germans for orphans will undoubtedly make a success of this celebration. The festival will benefit Uhlich's orphanage, the charitable institution of one of the oldest German settlers. Although the institution is an important one, the interest is not sufficient to cover the current expenses and the debts incurred in rebuilding after the great fire.</p>
   <p>In order to reproduce family life as closely as possible, the children do not wear uniforms. The institution makes no discrimination against any children on account of religious affiliations. Every one should gladly give his support to this institution and we are confident that today's festival will be a success. It would be a sin to stay at home on this beautiful day and so we hope that at least ten thousand will go today to Wright's Grove.</p>
