   <p>The German Young Men's Christian Association met last night in Room No. 13 Farwell Hall building, Mr. M. J. Gut in the chair and W. Niestadt, Secretary. The principal business of the evening was the hearing of reports of committees appointed at a previous meeting. One committee, to whom had been referred the matter of a concert to add to the financial strength of the Association, reported in favor of giving the concert in the third Tuesday in June in Lower Farwell Hall. The report was adopted, and the price of admission fixed at twenty-five cents. Another committee reported in favor of the publishing of a paper to be called the Bundesposaune, to be issued semi-monthly and devoted to the interest of Christianity in general and the German Y.M. C. A. in particular. Mr. F. W. Martine is to be placed in the position of editor-in-chief, and the first issue will be out in all probability, in the early part of June. A great deal of discussion preceded and followed the adoption of the reports of the committees.</p>
