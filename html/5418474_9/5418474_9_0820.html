   <p>The Board of Directors of the German Society held their monthly business meeting yesterday. Their business manager, Charles Spaeth gave the monthly report from which the following is quoted:</p>
   <p>During the month of November 167 applications for support were received and 161 of these were considered. Assistance were rendered to 110 families with 267 children and to 51 single persons. Cash spent for charitable purposes during the month amounted to $561.40. Board and lodging were given to twenty people, and twelve others received help along other lines.</p>
   <p>A total of 235 persons were able to receive jobs through our agency. The applications for support or assistance are increasing steadily and alarmingly since the cold season has started. The Society appeals to all German citizens who can spare used wearing apparel for men, women and children, to let the Society distribute them to the needy. The Society will be glad to send for these things, if notified.</p>
