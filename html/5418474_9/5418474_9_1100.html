   <p>After efforts of almost two months it has finally been possible, (due primarily to the assistance of Mr. Georg Schneider), to import free of duty those books and instruments which have been collected by various German universities, from professors, physicians, publishers and instrument makers, and have been sent to me with the direction to distribute them to those German colleagues who have graduated from German universities and have suffered losses from the "Great Fire."</p>
   <p>Three days after publication of this announcement I will ask Doctors Schaller, Merkle, Hessert and Wild, to constitute themselves with me as a committee and to decide which of the claims are to be regarded as valid, and immediately to proceed with the distribution.</p>
