   <p>A short time ago the local Legal Aid Society was founded with the help of the Arbeiter Zeitung. The purpose of this society is to protect poor people, not versed in legal procedures of this country, against exploiting employers and swindlers.</p>
   <p>Two lawyers, Joseph W. Errant and Christ. Meyer, all day long give legal advice and help to people who are forced to resort to the law. During the short time of its existence, the society has handled an average of 110 cases per month, of which a great majority have been won by the society.</p>
   <p>The lawyers are paid for their efforts by the Legal Aid Society The funds are contributed by people who do not want to see their fellow men taken advantage of by ruthless scoundrels. The good accomplished by this society is appreciated by everybody.</p>
   <p>But the society cannot continue its useful activity for the downtrodden if it does not receive the fullest moral and financial support. Law-suits, as a matter <span class="page-break">\2</span>of fact, are being accepted free of charge if the complaint is just and the client above reproach. It is evident that every client must acknowledge gratefully the favor received according to his means and first of all must not voice any suspicions against the officials of the society, thereby making them lose interest.</p>
