   <p>A meeting of former inhabitants of Nassau was held last night in the hall at 77 Blue Island Avenue to devise ways and means to aid the people of Westerwald, Germany, who are facing famine.</p>
   <p>Jacob Boths was elected president of the assembly; Otto Peuser, vice-president; and A. Soehngen, secretary. The problem was considered at length, and it was finally decided to organize a club, with membership confined to people who formerly lived in Nassau.</p>
   <p>The following gentlemen were named directors: M. Gottfried from Flornau, F. Kempfer from Dietz,....[15 names].</p>
   <p>The club resolved to express its appreciation to the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, since the newspaper published the appeal gratuitously in its Sunday edition.</p>
