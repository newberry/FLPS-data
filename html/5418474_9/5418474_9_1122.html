   <p>The motion Alderman Buhler made in the City Council, prompted by a demand of the German Aid Society, had met with success. The conditions prevailing in the distribution of victuals on the North Side that gave cause to complaint, will be corrected. The superintendent, Chamberlin, has taken on a capable and energetic helper in the person of Mr. Peter Hand. By the middle of next week a new depot will have been created at Wells and Clark streets, and it is to be hoped that then no justified complaints will anymore be received.</p>
   <p>The superintendents of all five districts have already appointed a great number of German inspectors and clerks, and stand ready to appoint some more.</p>
