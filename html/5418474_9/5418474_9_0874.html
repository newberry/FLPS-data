   <p>Mr. Friedrich Gehm, of 141 S. Water Street, who has tried his utmost to personally ameliorate the suffering in that State, has sent the first allotment of clothing and funds. Although the present amount is small, it will help to alleviate some of the distress. To contributors he gave receipts; a total of $13.50, and for this amount he issued his personal check for $21.00. Besides this, Mr. Gehm sent 140 circulars to the ministers of the city, imploring them to come to the rescue of their "sister community," Vermont City, Edmunds County, So. Dakota.</p>
   <p>We may predict that this call for assistance will not remain unheeded. The Ch. M. &amp; St.Paul Railroad announced it will deliver gratis all articles which are bonafide donations to their destination.</p>
