   <p>Inspector Heidelmeier addressed the members of his department in an inflammatory speech yesterday, saying, that the slot machine evil must be eradicated, at least in his own district. Thus, a great number of innkeepers were frightened by the watchful eye of the police. "Every one of these devilish contraptions within my district must be destroyed," said Mr. Heidelmeier, "even if I have to accomplish the deed with my own hands."</p>
