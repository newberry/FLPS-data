   <p>The Zentral-Bund der Russland-Deutschen von Nordamerika (Central Association of the Russo-Germans of North America) is calling a meeting for August 15, at 8 P.M. in the Zion Church, 5000 West Lawrence Avenue, between Lavergne and Gunnison Streets. The purpose of this meeting is the organization of a relief committee for the starving German element in the hell that is Soviet Russia. Everyone of German descent is extended a hearty welcome to attend this meeting.</p>
   <p>The distress of the Russo-Germans in the Soviet hell is appalling. It is therefore the duty of every true German to support this demonstration of German charity by being present. Well-known German leaders will speak, while Russo-Germans will give a detailed description of the deplorable conditions prevailing among their fellow Germans in Russia. A motion picture of the German fatherland will be shown in an effort to re-awaken and strengthen the love for the old country among the Russo-German element.</p>
