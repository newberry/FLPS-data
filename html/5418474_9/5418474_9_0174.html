   <p>p. 5.. Dr. Walter Wever, the German Consul of Chicago, paid a visit to the Alexian Brothers Hospital recently. In a letter to the Brother Provincial of the order, Dr. Wever said:</p>
   <p>"Right Reverend Brother Privincial:</p>
   <p>"Pressure of business is the only reason for the tardiness of this acknowledgment of my appreciation to you for showing me your splendid hospital, maintained by the order of the Alexian Brothers. To you, Right Reverend Brother Provincial, I wish to express my admiration for your excellent work. The size of this hospital surpasses that of any other similar institution I have seen thus far. I was also informed that your kindly services are being extended to my countrymen, for which I am most grateful.</p>
   <p>Wever</p>
   <p>Imperial Consul."</p>
