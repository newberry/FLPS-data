   <p>Christmas gifts will be distributed at Uhlich's Orphanage on Christmas Day. This simple statement may suffice to induce our good-natured Germans to act in behalf of the poor children who have no loving parents to arrange a pleasant festival.</p>
   <p>Uhlich's Orphanage takes care of sixty-four children at present--youngsters who have the same longings at Christmas time as the offsprings of a wealthier class, or the more fortunately situated children who bask in the love of their parents.</p>
   <p>We appeal to the hundreds of well-to-do German families in our city to think of these poor orphans. Give just a little, your own children will never miss it, and you will earn sincere gratitude. Give what you can spare, clothing, toys, cake, candy or food--everything is welcome.</p>
