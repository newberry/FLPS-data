   <p>The German Veterans Aid Fund announces a prize dance on Monday evening, October 13, at the gymnasium of the Lincoln Turner Hall, for the benefit of destitute former German soldiers of the wars of 1864, 1866, and 1870-71. [Conquest of Denmark by German-Austrian troops, 1864; Austro-German conflict, 1866; French-German hostilities, 1870. Many Germans were fighting in the American Civil War in 1864 but the article does not state if these veterans are included. Translator.]</p>
   <p>The Veterans Aid Fund was founded in 1912 by members of the German Veterans Club of Chicago and by the recently dissolved Alliance of the Veterans of the Germany Army, in order to give a comradely, helping <span class="page-break">\2</span>hand to old German veterans in dire hours of distress.</p>
   <p>During its long existence the Fund has been a source of untold blessings, and the executives therefore implore the German citizens of Chicago to help the poor old German veterans of the German wars of unification.</p>
   <p>Please send all voluntary contributions to our secretary of long standing, George Meyer, co-founder of the Fund, 1711 Otto Street, or to the treasurer, Paul Hallmann, 2708 West Washington Boulevard, who will issue receipts and express their gratitude in behalf of the veterans.</p>
