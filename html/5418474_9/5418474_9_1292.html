   <p>Yesterday the police turned to the Abendpost to help in apprehending a shameless swindler. The fellow who, in the last weeks, made himself some considerable pocket money, restricts his activity exclusively to newly arrived German-speaking Chicagoans who, ignorant of conditions, are being duped by him.</p>
   <p>More than twenty complaints about the impostures of the scoundrel have been made to the police in the last few days. The police are doing their best to catch him, but have not been successful because the swindler changes the field of his activity from one part of the city to another.</p>
   <p>Three of his latest victims, Frank Mengelbauer, Nick Riff, and John Meininger, tell of his method as follows:</p>
   <p>The man knocks at the docr of the house and inquires whether Mr. So and So <span class="page-break">2</span>lives there - - he reads the name down stairs from the letter box. He then shows a police badge and an order for arrest, which the swindler had filled out by himself upon a printed form stolen from the municipal court. When asked for the reason for the accusation, he pretends not to know, as the judge had not informed him. The persons become intimidated and want to know if there is no way out of the affair. In answer to this, he says a decisive "No!" But he is ready to disregard the arrest if bail could be placed in his hands. In the majority of cases he is satisfied with $25 and goes away.</p>
   <p>That the victims have fallen into the hands of a swindler is not revealed until they go to court. The police request that everyone on whom the scoundrel should attempt to try his fortune again must notify the nearest police station. It may even be possible to detain him until the police arrive.</p>
   <p>No one, not even a policeman or an officer of the court, has a right to accept money beyond the premises of a police station or a court building for the purpose of obviating an arrest or for bail.</p>
