   <p>New York has begun to war on professional crime. This is not one of the sporadic outbursts of indignation that we in America have become accustomed to, and that subside after a short time. This time the authorities mean business. They also have the support of Governor Lehman, who is ready to mobilize the power of all the forces of the state in order to ensure success in the fight. The management of this campaign against crime has been conferred upon a certain Thomas E. Dewey. He will have the aid of a dozen lawyers and of a large staff of detectives, clerks, and other assistants.</p>
   <p>Dewey has lost no time. He made a long speech in which he told all the world of the many and great things he intended to do; and he acted. He is firmly convinced that our civilization is seriously threatened by professional criminals and, therefore, he informed the entire world, and especially <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the inhabitants of New York City, that he is firmly resolved to exterminate the so-called policy game, a sort of lottery game on a small scale.</p>
   <p>No doubt there are people who think that murder, homicide, kidnapping, robbery, theft, blackmail, embezzlement, counterfeiting, and a number of other crimes are much worse than lotteries; but these people are ignorant fault finders. They have no conception of the real dangers that threaten our culture. And we would be doing Mr. Dewey and his able assistants a grave injustice if we thought that they intend to confine their activity to policy games. They are just as much opposed to prostitution, for instance, as they are to gambling in general. For the time being, however, they intend to concentrate their power upon destroying policy games.</p>
   <p>It always has been thus in our country. Our good City of Chicago too, has undertaken many a campaign against crime. For instance, the mayor ordered that all saloons be closed on Sunday. That was a long time ago, but matters have not changed in this respect, at least not in New York. Nor is the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>situation in Chicago any different. Only a few days ago a judge felt called upon to demolish one of those machines into which people place a nickle, and--should Dame Fortune look upon them with favor--receive one or more nickles in return.</p>
   <p>Thereupon, Mayor Kelly gave police orders to be less zealous in the performance of their duties, to overlook harmless games played in private homes or in saloons, and to concentrate their efforts upon the suppression of the real gambling dives. Strictly speaking, he acted contrary to the law, for the law prohibits every kind of game of chance; according to the law it is not even permissible to play sixty-six for nuts. Such are the deplorable results of the influence which so-called reformers exert upon the lives of Americans. These reformers will surely show great enthusiasm for the procedure of Mr. Dewey. But what has the suppression of policy games to do with combating real professional crime? Nothing whatever. Instead of taking action against the latter, our wise authorities endeavor to suppress harmless pastimes, and since this is not possible, this method opens the door to one of the worst crimes prevalent in America, namely corruption.</p>
