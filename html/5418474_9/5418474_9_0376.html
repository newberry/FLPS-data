   <p>The great ball for the benefit of the Altenheim was held Saturday at the fashionable Medinah Athletic Club. It was well attended, in fact, it was much better attended than might have been expected considering general business conditions. The Altenheim is popular, not only among German-Americans, but also by persons far outside their circles; therefore, entertainments in the interest of this institution may be expected to draw large crowds.</p>
   <p>Harry Soenik's famous orchestra provided the dance-provoking music, and before long the floor was filled with dancing couples. The gayety of the happy guests increased as the hours passed. Perhaps one of the greatest advantages of the Altenheim entertainments is that almost all participants know each other; a cordial lack of formality prevails as a result of this familiarity.</p>
   <p>Card tables were placed on the balcony, and guests who did not care to dance <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>settled there to enjoy a pleasant game of bridge or to try their skill at a crack game of skat. The ball proceeded with this merrymaking until long after midnight when most of the participants reluctantly started for home.</p>
