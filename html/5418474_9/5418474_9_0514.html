   <p>The unusual weather conditions during March were the cause of considerable demands, greater than usual at this time of the year, upon the charitable activities of the German Society of Chicago. It appears from the monthly report that it had to meet the needs of forty-eight families, with 167 children, and of twenty-one single persons, among whom were seven women. The Society gave 118 meals to unemployed, and ninety-three lodgings to shelter-less persons. It procured free acceptance into private hospitals of six persons, into the county hospital of eight persons, seven into Oak Forest, and one into the tuberculosis sanitarium. Besides, sixteen persons received free medical treatment, and three families received a coal supply.</p>
   <p>The chances for obtaining work continue to be rather remote. Work could be provided for 103 persons by the Society, but the numbers of those seeking <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>employment kept increasing--more than 3,000 persons came to the office applying for work.</p>
   <p>For all kinds of aid the German Society spent $704.24.</p>
