   <p>The editor of the Illinois Staats Zeitung, Herr Raster, visited yesterday morning the pile of rubbish into which his house at 600 N. Dearborn has been changed. As souvenirs he brought back a string from the piano and some pieces of iron. All his furniture, library, pictures, collections of newspapers, and a carefully kept correspondence of thirty years with friends, writers, and statesmen; all the hundreds of small objects wherewith Germans use to adorn their houses, have been destroyed. A few clothes, some laundry, and a chair is all that he has saved.</p>
   <p>Bauer and Co. are already able to fill all orders for pianos and musical instruments, at 270 Milwaukee Ave. - The Great Western Band is about to start on a recital tour through the neighboring states. - Israelites find aid at Mr. Haas, corner of Peck Court and Wabash Ave. - Mr. George Schneydter, accountant, is being expected by his worried brother-in-law and his whole family, in Cincinnati, 192 Western Ave. - E. H. Michelson (Aurora Turn Hall) seeks his wife and children. - So does A. Schoebel. - Christine Scherer, 11 years old, is in the Aurora Turn Hall. - At the same place is 8 year old Anton Zimmermann, who lived in Liberty St. - The father of the 6 year old Fred Uhiem can get information about his son's whereabouts at the W. Chicago Police Station. - The Chicago Sharpshooters Association has its headquarters now, in the Aurora <span class="page-break">2</span>Turn Hall. - Milkman Miller, 138 Ontario Street, unloaded his wagon on which he had put all his furniture, in order to save Mrs. Butz who was about to give birth. He saved her, and permitted all his goods to burn.</p>
   <p>The sick wife of Mr. Raster was saved by being taken from her house to that of Mr. Vocke, by an American who passed in his buggy, who would not even give his name, much less accept any payment. While others (Germans too) accepted up to $50 for such a favor.</p>
   <p>Anybody who has had a house on the North Side, with a brick basement, and does not intend to rebuild it before next Summer should put his lot unconditionally at the disposal of those fire victims who would like to erect a hut on it. Basement walls are always better than none at all. - The editor of this paper, Mr. H. Raster, offers for use the ruins of his house, 600 N. Dearborn Street, until May 1 (but not longer, because he hopes then to be able to build himself). He who comes first today, can get a certificate of permission.</p>
   <p>The remark that the American German press has done nothing to help the German press in Chicago should be modified. The destruction of the Staats Zeitung has immediately moved the publishers of a large Western paper to send money for the founding of a new German paper that shall use this good opportunity <span class="page-break">3</span>to kill the Illinois Staats Zeitung. After all, that is something!</p>
   <p>Miss Dora Sieck, seamstress, who lived at Mr. Richard Michaelis', former editor of the Union, permitted everything she had to burn, in order to save the children and a part of the possessions of Mr. Michaelis. - Mr. Hahn, one of the best known Germans in Louisville, plans to invest the better part of his fortune in real estate on the South Side. As he is, at least by name, a German, he would do better to think of the North Side.</p>
