   <p>The members of the German Waiter's Benevolent Society assembled last night with their wives and friends in the large hall of the North Side Turner Hall. They celebrated their seventh anniversary, which turned out to be a pleasant festivity.</p>
   <p>The society pays its members substantial sick benefits, etc., and this has increased its membership rapidly. The society can look back with pride over seven years of successful activities. The members of the society are also brought in closer contact socially. Yesterday's affair was convincing proof that they understand very well how to arrange a festival, and to entertain their guests....</p>
