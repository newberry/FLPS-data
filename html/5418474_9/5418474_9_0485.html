   <p>The Russo-German Alliance of North America has been organized to aid needy Germans of Russia. It asks all German societies to participate in this worthy cause. Ten million Germans are faced with death by starvation. We must save those who still can be saved. Organize for this noble work.</p>
   <p>Every gift, no matter how small it is, will be gratefully accepted by the Russo-German Alliance of North America, located at 1922 Irving Park Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois. A record of donations will be published. Collection lists will be mailed upon request.</p>
   <p>True German greetings,</p>
   <p>Eduard Dorazil, President,</p>
   <p>Reverend J. Schoenberger, Vice-President</p>
   <p>Alex Dubs, Treasurer.</p>
