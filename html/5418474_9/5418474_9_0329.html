   <p>The board of directors of the wonderful charitable institution which has become better known lately as the Uhlich's Orphanage, declared at its yesterday's general meeting, that it could not afford to lose Mr. Mauermann.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mauermann is said to have promised to inflict corporal punishment on the children in a more discreet manner. He also will serve better food whenever inspectors should come around. He also was advised to treat reporters more courteously in the future so there would not be any repetition of this scandal.</p>
