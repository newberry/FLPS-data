   <p>The members of the German Society held their general meeting yesterday with Max Eberhardt presiding. As usual, the president had prepared an annual report, on the activities of the Society.</p>
   <p>According to the report, the Society had 1,001 members a year ago. One hundred and twenty-eight joined during the previous year. Since 113 members died or left the Society, a total of 1,016 members remained.</p>
   <p>The report also gives interesting information about German immigration. To judge by the activity of the German Society along that line, it was very <span class="page-break">\2</span>large although cholera restricted immigration from Germany in September, October, and November. However, the fact that immigrants who seek employment on farms have been fewer, and older or weaker persons, such as clerks, bookkeepers, etc., have come to us in larger numbers than before, is rather detrimental.</p>
   <p>Other difficulties for the German Society consisted in finding the husbands' unknown place of residence for many women immigrants, who came to us for information and help, and who were without means of support for themselves and their children. The German Society took energetic measures to protect German immigrants against fraud by employment agencies. Circulars were distributed in Chicago and, especially in New York, at landing places, where the immigrants, bound for Chicago, were advised to come to the German Society.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The demand for labor during the past year was unusually large; especially farm hands were greatly needed, and as already mentioned, the number of strong, healthy immigrants, suitable for farms, was very small. About 3,450 employers requested help through the agency of the German Society, and 3,353 workers procured employment. The following is a record of the employment division of the German Society for the last eight years:</p>

   <p>Of these, 595 obtained jobs in their trades, and 2,758 as farm hands and day laborers. As far as nationality is concerned, there were 2,849 Germans, 271 Austrians, 174 Swiss, 59 Russians. Employment was obtained in Illinois for 3,261; in Indiana for 3; in Iowa for 3; in Michigan for 5; in Minnesota for 3; in S. Dakota for 1; in Wisconsin for 16.</p>
   <p>It was necessary to write 1,910 letters to make these negotiations possible. The needy were aided, as usual, according to our best ability. The Society spent during the previous year a total of $2,423.22 in cash, $272.05 for fuel, and $59.00 for board and lodging, aiding 450 families with 1,287 children, and 197 single persons. The German Society received valuable aid in this relief work from the Chicago Aid and Relief Society, from the County Agent and the Bureau of Justice. Also German physicians <span class="page-break">\5</span>and pharmacists, as well as the German and the Alexianer hospitals, were always ready to help. Likewise the cooperation of the German Societies in New York, San Francisco, and Milwaukee were in many cases very beneficial.</p>
   <p>The total income of the Society was $14,662 - which consisted of $6,283.72 in membership fees, of $90.50 in gifts, and $1,659 in interest.</p>
