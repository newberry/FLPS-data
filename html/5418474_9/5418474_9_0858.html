   <p>The Hamburg Club appeals to all its members and patrons to assist in reducing the great misery existing in their hometown in the old country, by helping them with cash. The misery in the home town on account of the Cholera, has grown to such an extent that people are also starving to death.</p>
   <p>All business has been suspended and there is no work. Speedy help is essential and the Hamburg Club hopes that this appeal will find a good reception. All details about collection lists will be made known by further publications.</p>
