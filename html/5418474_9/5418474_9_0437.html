   <p>Mr. A. C. Hesing, President of the Old People's Home, yesterday handed Mr. Weege, the General Director of the Wisconsin Central Railroad, a petition of the Directors to open a depot near the Old People's Home. Mr. Hesing left with the promise that a depot within one hundred feet of Madison Street will be erected and that it shall carry the name "Altenheim". He also received the promise that the territory East of Altenheim Boulevard will not be built on, but that it will be laid out and planted, so that in the summer small picnics may be held there.</p>
