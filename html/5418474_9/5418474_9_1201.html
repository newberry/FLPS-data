   <p>Friederich Hecker, an old friend and war comrade of Theodor Moegling, writes:</p>
   <p>"In Germany people always have money for various kinds of amusements and sports, but it has long been a custom there to let patriots starve.</p>
   <p>"Moegling, who resigned from a lucrative office for the sake of the people, and who fought for liberty not only in parliament but also on the battlefield, where he courageously led his band against the enemy, was wounded severely and crippled permanently. He has a just claim to immediate help from all patriots. And even if the Germans in Germany have nothing but pleasant words to offer him, Americans of German descent will set a good example for their former countrymen. We Americans of German parentage will give no one just cause to say that we permitted German patriots to succumb to misery and need."</p>
   <p>In this connection, we wish to inform our readers that the noble example set <span class="page-break">2</span>by the Chicago Turngemeinde has not been in vain. The St. Louis Turngemeinde has taken the necessary steps to join in helping Moegling, and in Cincinnati, at a meeting of Germans under the chairmanship of Gereral Wilich, it was voted to render the "German patriot in Germany" all possible aid.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, $1501.25 has been contributed to date; and although Chicago leads all other cities in the United States, there are quite a few local Germans who have been blessed with this world's goods in no small measure but who have not yet opened their hearts and their pocketbooks to lend a hand in this worthy cause. We hope they will respond to our appeal very shortly.</p>
