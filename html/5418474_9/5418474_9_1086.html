   <p>The constitution of the German Society of Chicago for the protection of immigrants, obliges its president to make a yearly report of the activities of the German Society. Mr. George Schneider, the preident, submitted his report which was accepted.</p>
   <p>The German Society was founded about twenty years ago, at the time of the reaction in Germany, when a great stream of immigration flowed toward the West. The German Society was founded to help the immigrants.</p>
   <p>After the great fire the German Society was combined for a short time with the Aid and Relief Society. When the latter society was dissolved, the German Society broadened its activity, by also taking care of the needy ones. For this reason it opened last winter a lodging house for the homeless.</p>
   <p>Worth to be mentioned also is the founding of the German American Dispensary.</p>
   <p>The Irish, spurred on by the example of the German Society of Chicago have founded an Irish immigration association.</p>
