   <p>The question of a lodging houses for homeless Germans make considerable progress yesterday. Present were: C. Knobelsdorff, Emil Hietzsch, Arthur Erbe, K. Clauscenius, Julius Heiersdorff.</p>
   <p>The German lodging house is not going to be a place where young people and families will be fed throughout the winter, but it has as its purpose the offering of a refuge for the completely careless until they have found some other lodging.</p>
   <p>The committee decided to rent for that purpose at $75.00 a month, the building formerly used by the Northwestern Railroad, 140 Union Street near Milwaukee Avenue. The building gives the impression of a little castle. It has gas, water, several halls and thirty rooms are provided with bathtubs. Until now the yearly rent was <span class="gap">[gap]</span>,000.00. To the owner, Fritz Kuhn, full recognition is due for his kindness by charging only a nominal fee for the rent of his house.</p>
