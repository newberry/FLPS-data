   <p>Federal authorities are making an effort to collect a $10,000 fine imposed on former alderman Titus Haffa of the 43rd Ward, now serving a two year penitentiary term at Leavenworth. Haffa was found guilty of transgressing the Prohibition law. The penalty was an additional punishment imposed upon him.</p>
   <p>The United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company, who pledged to give bond for Haffa, when he declared himself dissatisfied with the sentence of the lower court, will now be held responsible to satisfy the judgment. According to information from the office of the Attorney General of the United States, an agreement was reached that in case Haffa's appeal to a higher court would not prove successful, the $10,000 penalty would be covered by the bond deposited by Haffa's guarantor.</p>
   <p>However, the attorney for the United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Company was given twenty days grace for a reply in this case.</p>
