   <p>President Girten points to the necessity of new members; extraordinary circumstances, he asserts, reflects upon the Society which causes tremendous expenses, referring to congestion of business, the closing of the stock exchange, a result of the world war; furthermore, the arrival of many German reservists from other cities, which owing to the impossibility of being sent to Germany, remain here; <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the majority, however being without any means whatsoever to exist, must be taken care of, thus causing a tremendous strain upon the society, although the German Consulate effectively secured employment for a few; nevertheless, the heavy burden rest upon the society, therefore the necessity of securing new members and acceptance of donations of all kinds are commendable.</p>
