   <p>The Grand Lodge of the Order of the Harugari held a meeting yesterday for the purpose of discussing ways to strike back at the life insurance companies which operate solely in the interest of their shareholders. The attacks of these life insurance companies are directed against benevolent societies which are concerned with the welfare of their members, and therefore, maintain, aside from the sick benefit, a life insurance department.</p>
   <p>A recent article in the Illinois Staats-Zeitung in defense of benevolent societies was read to the assembly. Appreciation for the warm support in that <span class="page-break">\2</span>matter, given by the Staats-Zeitung, was voiced by all present.</p>
   <p>It was decided at the meeting to urge all secretaries of Grand Lodges of a benevolent character, especially those with life insurance service, to sign the following petition for submission to their respective Senators:</p>
   <p>To the honorable Mr. .....</p>
   <p>Senator from ....., ..... district.</p>
   <p>The undersigned citizens of Cook County, State of Illinois, urgently request that you exert all your energy toward the passage of bill No. 423.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>This bill is designed to protect the interests of more than one hundred thousand independent voters of this State. There is no better way to show your supporters your interest in their welfare and your willingness to contribute toward it than to vote for the proposed bill.</p>
   <p>This bill is intended to protect people against the despotic rule of the rich monopolies, and it requests absolute freedom for every employee to choose the life protection he wishes with the least possible expense.</p>
