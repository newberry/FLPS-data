   <p>The Mutual Benefit Association of the German musicians held a festival last night at the Northside Turnerhalle (Gymnasium) of which it can truly be said, that it was full of music. Music and humor were the guiding stars of the evening. No discord disturbed the beauty of mutual cheerfulness. The entertainment was never interrupted and the hours passed away very rapidly.</p>
   <p>This association was founded nearly six months ago. It has already 135 members and pays a sick-benefit of $5.00 per week, which will be materially increased in the near future. Likewise, there will be a stipulated definite amount which members will receive in case of death.</p>
