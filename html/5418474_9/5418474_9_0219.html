   <p>The German Hospital, - that splendid structure on Larrabee Street, north of Webster Avenue, has been entirely completed and is worthy of inspection. It was dedicated in the spring.</p>
   <p>On the ground floor of the five story building are the free drug dispensary, the apartment of its superintendent, Ernst Stremmer, the kitchen, the dining room for the employees, several rooms for patients under observation for contagious diseases, that means cases where maladies of a contagious nature have not yet been proven, one way or the other; below this is a well stocked vegetable cellar, potatoes, etc. - mostly donations from grateful patients. In the rear is a separate addition, the one story boiler room, which serves as a heating plant for the entire building. It is connected with the laundry and the repair shop. The morgue is also located there.</p>

   <p>On the first floor, to the left of the entrance, is the general waiting room, followed by the receiving room. The rest of this floor, as well as the other two large stories, contain the rooms for the patients. The lower and part of the second floor is reserved for surgical cases, in the other parts, patients suffering from internal ailments are taken care of. On the eastern end of every floor a large infirmary is located with a spacious veranda, adjacent to it. Each floor is provided with the necessary linen, lavatories and bath rooms; the latter are equipped with an excellent special device, which produces hot water quickly, even during the summer months, when steam heat is not available. Near the head-end of each bed, electric bells have been installed, besides one or more in every room, so that the patients can call for help.......Any one who has visited similar institutions, will notice that the ventilation is excellent, that cleanliness and order are exemplary.</p>

   <p>On the top floor the sleeping rooms of the employees are located, also the ironing and sewing rooms, as well as the operating room with skylight, contiguous to this is the apothecary for surgical supplies. An elevator, large enough to deliver a bed, makes it possible to bring the patients to the operating room from any of the lower floors, without rebedding them; also a special food elevator (dumb-waiter) connects every floor. In fact, all the improvements are excellent. Everything which science and experience have shown to be desirable, has been included.</p>
   <p>The building cost was about $40,000. Unfortunately the entire amount has not been raised. A balance of approximately $12,000 represents a mortgage, and probably $1,000 will be needed to complete the interior equipment. Considering the great blessings which this hospital provides for the German contingent, the succor it brings to many (there are thirty-seven patients at present) the splendid cures which have been effected, especially those which required surgery, --- the fact that it is the first German institution <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of its kind,............should make it a simple matter for proud Germans.... to pay the few dollars........which are still needed. The maintenance cost has been nearly defrayed by the annual contributions of the one hundred and thirty members of the Hospital Association. When the directors call upon the German inhabitants in the near future, let us hope, that they will be greeted with generous hearts and open pocketbooks.</p>
