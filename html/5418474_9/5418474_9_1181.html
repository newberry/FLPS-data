   <p>The undersigned held a meeting last night in the Chicago Turnhalle (Turner Hall), and decided to call a mass meeting of German citizens for the purpose of organizing to aid the unfortunate people who lost their property when the city of Johann-Georgenstadt, in Saxony, Germany, was destroyed by fire.</p>
   <p>All who are interested in this benevolent project, especially those who emigrated from Saxony, are requested to meet at the store of Oertel and Foerster, which is located at the corner of Clark and Indiana Streets, on Monday evening, December 12, 1867, at half past seven.</p>
