   <p>The Welfare Committee for War Prisoners, through its chairman, Adolf Kuttroff, 24 North Moore Street, New York City, requests the Abendpost to open a depot where money and clothing for German prisoners of war and interned Germans can be deposited.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost gladly complies with this wish and requests that all who wish to help bring their gifts, money or clothing, to our place of business, 223-225 West Washington Street. Day by day we will acknowledge contributions in the Abendpost and send the money and clothing to the Committee in New York at once.</p>
   <p>This is a good and urgent cause. "A dollar today is worth ten tomorrow."</p>

   <p>From Carl and Emil Eitel.........$100.00</p>
   <p>From A Friend....................... 25.00</p>
