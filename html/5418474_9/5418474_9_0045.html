   <p>At the Northside Turnerhall this association celebrated yesterday its 25th Anniversary. On May 13, 1871 this Club was organized under the name "Bismarck Bund." Justice of Peace Eberhardt who acted a quarter of a century ago as the first president of the Club, delivered the festival speech in which he related its founding and gave a delightful picture of the efficiency which it unfolded. The organization counts at present 12 sections with 1234 members. It pays a weekly sickness benefit of $10.00 and a death benefit of $500.</p>
   <p>During the last year 14 members died. $9,753 were paid in sick benefits.</p>
