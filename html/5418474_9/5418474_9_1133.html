   <p>Alderman Buhler of the 15th Ward deserves a large part of the honor of having saved the West Side. Tirelessly he organized the fight of the fire engines against the conflagration. During that terrible Monday night he gave hundreds of people shelter in his house. To his splendid wife many a sick woman owes her life. Buhler, whose colleague McGrath is dangerously sick, has established exemplary order in his ward.</p>
   <p>Leading Germans are trying to prevail on the Supply Committee to vote money for lumber to people whose houses have burnt down and who wish to rebuild their lots. Mr. Schintz stands at the head of this movement, and it is pleasant to report that he is particularly taking care of his countrymen on the North Side.</p>
