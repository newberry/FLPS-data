   <p>A concert, rare in beauty and elegance, was given at the Auditorium Theater yesterday afternoon for the benefit of the German Hospital. Much of the success was directly due to the efforts and energetic work of the Arrangement Committee, which made this an outstanding event. The Chicago Singing Society, a young institution founded just recently, is composed of German singers all of whom are endowed with fine vocal qualifications. With vocalists of that type at his disposal, it was not difficult for the society's director, Mr. Boeppler, to obtain excellent results.</p>
   <p>The first number on the program was Beethoven's Hymn: "Glorification of the Founder of Eternity," followed by the less known but equally as effective composition "You Shepherd of Israel" by Bortniansky, which, <span class="page-break">2</span>although extremely difficult, was a brilliant achievement of the Singing Society. Stormy applause was the audience's response to the brilliant offering. The height of enthusiasm was reached however, when such artists as Mrs. Schumann-Heink, Mrs. Bloomfield-Zeisler, and Miss Muenchhoff, contributed their services toward this worthy cause. Mrs. Zeisler's offerings were three compositions by Chopin, and Mendelsohn's "Wedding March" and "The Dance of the Fairies," from "A Summernight's Dream," transcribed by Liszt, for the piano. The accomplished technique and the gloriously expressive style of this celebrated artist brought forth a storm of applause, lasting in its intensity until Mrs. Zeisler condescended to play an encore.</p>
   <p>A storm of applause also greeted Mrs. Schumann-Heink upon her appearance on the stage. She chose for her offering the great aria from the prison scene, from Meyerbeer's opera "The Prophet." Her powerful and gloriously shaded voice took her audience as usual by storm. Thus, this great <span class="page-break">3</span>artist dispelled any doubt that her recent illness might have had an ill effect upon her career. She chose as an encore Goethe's "Erl-King," set to music by Franz Schubert. Graciously, as ever, she shared the applause as well as the gifts of flowers, with her able accompanist, Miss Hofmann.</p>
   <p>Another excellent vocalist also heard during this highly inspiring concert was the soprano, Miss Mary Muenchhoff. She sang compositions by Schumann and Henschel. To pay her the well deserved tribute, it may be said truly that although she was co-starred with that world famous artist, Mrs. Schumann-Heink in the execution of that charming duet from "The Merry Wives of Windsor," she was quite able to hold her own.</p>
   <p>Taking into consideration that the Auditorium Theatre was nearly sold out on that occasion, the German Hospital will probably receive a <span class="page-break">4</span>handsome sum from the net proceeds, which was the purpose of the concert. As the financial success is a matter of interest to the public, we would appreciate the results published.</p>
