   <p>The recently proposed club Nassovia hereby repeats its appeal, to all people who were born in Nassau, to attend the next meeting, on Monday, December 15, at 8 P.M., at 177 Blue Island Avenue, to arrange details for forming a permanent organization and to communicate with the Nassau clubs of New York and Cincinnati.</p>
   <p>The German Reich has been asked to extend all possible aid, because of extensive crop failures and the consequent famine now prevailing in Silesia, Erzgebirge, and other districts. Althoug Nassau is one of the best agricultural districts of Germany, certain parts, such as Westerwald, Amt Rennerod, Herborn, and Marienberg had total crop failures; the people are on the verge of starvation, and the present winter is exceptionally severe. According to statistics of the Department of Agriculture of the German Reich, these localities have suffered more than any others, and this opinion is concurred in by all who have seen the district.</p>
