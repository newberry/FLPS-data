   <p>The German Societies Agent Mr. Enders, reports:-</p>
   <p>Last month's immigration was a very small one compared with that of December. While in December 6500 persons arrived and left again only 1500 persons did so last month, the majority of them continued their journey to follow their countrymen, who preceded them to settle in their midst. Most of the immigrants came from Western Prussia, Poland, etc. All had very little means.</p>
   <p>The requests for assistance were considerable. Out of the many who applied 65 were found worthy of help and $410.85 was distributed among them. Besides 10 poor families were helped with heating material. 99 employers asked us to supply them with workingmen and we furnished work and lodging to 172 unemployed, among them 14 women and girls.</p>
