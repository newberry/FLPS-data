   <p>The undersigned held a meeting yesterday in the Germania Maennerchor Club-house. It was resolved to invite the chairmen and secretaries of all German societies of Chicago and Vicinity to a conference which will be held at eight o'clock this evening in the clubhouse of the Germania Mannerchor, Clark Street and Germania Place, to discuss plans for a mass demonstration and for collections for the benefit of the German Red Cross. The various societies were notified by mail yesterday, but the letters may not reach them in time; therefore, they may consider this appeal to be their official notice.</p>
