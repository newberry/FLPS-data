   <p>The majority of the people living in the United States hardly have an adequate conception of housing conditions in Germany. A pamphlet entitled Wretched Quarters in the Occupied Districts gives the following account: "The dearth of habitable rooms in occupied areas is immediately apparent. The scarcity of dwellings has at last become a terrible menace, and it is difficult to see how the evil may be mitigated, since all newly erected buildings must be properly furnished and reserved for the use of the administration in charge of the occupied areas. The dubious results of such crowding are already evident in the occupied territory. Numerous families, often with more than nine persons, must live in a single room. [The pamphlet goes on to describe the wretched plight of the German people in the occupied areas as a result of the demands made upon the populace by the French Army of Occupation.]</p>
