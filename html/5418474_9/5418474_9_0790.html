   <p>German women, German men, no matter from what province you hail, your former fatherland is calling! Jealous enemies have forced Germany and Austria-Hungary to take up arms! Young and old men are in the fray--thousands upon thousands of them will never return from the battlefields, and untold numbers will be crippled.</p>
   <p>It is our duty to assist in the work of alleviating eventual pain and distress. Therefore we invite you Germans, no matter whether you come from the north, south, east, or west of Germany, to attend a meeting at the North Side Turnhalle, at 8 o'clock, to devise ways and means of helping our former fatherland.</p>
