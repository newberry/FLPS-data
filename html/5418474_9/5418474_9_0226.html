   <p>The management of the German Hospital held its fourth annual meeting on January 3rd, at Niehoff's Hall, 49 LaSalle Street. After reading the year's report and statements of other officials two directors were elected for a period of three years. The address was delivered by the President, Mr. Henning..... He stated that the location at 242 Lincoln Avenue is unsuitable and too small for the requirements.... Under "achievements" the following are enumerated:</p>
   <p>Twelve beds only were available, but 103 patients were treated during the year....a number of ailing persons could not be admitted for lack of space; 53 were cured,....23 improved in condition, 11 were dismissed as incurable and 9 died. Of these about two-thirds died within two to three days after admission; hence, they were hopeless cases from the beginning.....3215 convalescent days are listed at a total cost of $2,357.65 or 73.66 cents per day; an average of $22.88 per patient and an average detention period of 31. 20 days for each patient. This includes all expenditures of the hospital, surely a very low figure. The demand for treatment is constantly increasing, as these figure show:</p>
   
   <p>82 Germans; 10 German-Americans; 4 Swiss; 3 Bohemians; 2 Norwegians; 1 English and 1 Irish......The following denominations in reference to the above are shown: 52 Evangelical-Lutheran; 24 Catholic; 10 Evangelical; 5 Methodists; 4 Engl-United; 2 Reformed; 2 Jews; 1 Episcopalian; 3 belonging to no church. Of these 56 were female and 47 male patients. Gratuitous treatment was given to 51....The liberal support from local German sources was such, that no recourse to "collections for the Hospital" was necessary last year. Great credit is given to Dr. Schaller, staff physician, for his untiring efforts and promptness. The Superintendent Mr. E. Stremmel has been a great factor and all the members have tried to do their duty.... Plans for the future are mentioned in the next paragraph and the ideal..... a Bethesda for all the ailing....They shall sense, that it has been created to alleviate the suffering of humanity....</p>
   <p>The monetary requirements...$23,500 are assured by subscription; $16,500 are still needed to take care of the debts, including the five lots. The Germans in general, have been very generous, with few exceptions....The President closes his annual report with expressions of gratitude and invocation to God, for his blessings.</p>
