   <p>The steps taken by the Chicago Medical Society to deny the privilege of further membership to Doctor Louis Ernst Schmidt, director of the Illinois Social Hygiene League, because of his philanthropic activities, was unanimously condemned by members of the Chicago Association of Commerce, in a special meeting called to protest against the expulsion.</p>
   <p>Business men of Chicago thus expressed their disapproval of the action of the Medical Society, saying that the action was opposed to the best interests of the public welfare. The Association appointed a special committee, which will attempt to serve as mediator in this affair.</p>
   <p>A strong supporter of this plan is Dr. Frank M. Billings, of the University of Chicago. He is the author of the ethical principles, designed chiefly for the Medical Association, on the basis of which Dr. Schmidt has now been disciplined. Doctor Billings recalled the outstanding philanthropical endeavors of the high-minded ousted physician, and paid him a great tribute....Numerous other prominent Chicagoans addressed the meeting in protest against the ouster.</p>
