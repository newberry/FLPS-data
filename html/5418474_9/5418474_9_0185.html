   <p>President Henning of the German Hospital, has lately, as reported previously in the Abendpost, obtained an injunction against the Board of Directors of the Hospital Society, from whom, according to his opinion, he does not have to stand interference with his authority. Judge Neely, yesterday suspended the order of Judge Hanecy, after several hours of pleadings. The Judge decided, that the Board of Directors, are the only conpetent ones, and that the President, as executing officer has to obey the decrees issued by same. During the conferences, many very unpleasant facts about the high-handed actions and peculiar financial methods of the president, were disclosed, who will have more attention paid to his work hereafter, than before.</p>
   <p>The changes in the medical Staff which were contemplated by the Board of Directors, will now be carried out, and Miss Anna Wehner, who was discharged as Superintendent of Nurses by President Henning, will resume her position. The Committee, whose duty is is, to control and look after President Henning's work more strictly, consists of Messrs. George Schneider, John Burmeister, Charles Emmerich, John Miller and Jacob Huber.</p>
