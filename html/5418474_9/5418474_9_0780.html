   <p>Many people who attended the mass meeting at the North Side Turnhalle last evening left the Hall singing "Die Wacht am Rhein" and continued to sing it along the streets on their way home. This meeting was called to discuss ways and means of helping Germany and Austria-Hungary. Both the hall and the galleries were filled beyond seating capacity when the appeal was read by H. L. Brand. After Mr. Eugene Niederegger was elected chairman, Ballmann's Orchestra played "Die Wacht am Rhein," and the entire assemblage joined in the singing. Upon the recommendation of Mr. August Lueders, a veteran of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, it was resolved to organize on a permanent basis. Reverend Rudolph John then addressed the assembly as follows:</p>
   <p>"Fourteen days ago we buried a war veteran; according to custom the band played 'Ich Hat' Einen Kameraden Einen Besser'n Find'st Du Ni't' (I Had A Dear Old Comrade, and You'll Never Find a Better One), while the casket was being borne to the hearse. Only a few veterans were present at the time, but they all said, 'We are burying a good man, and he was more than that to me'. I was deeply moved, shaken to my innermost being--my heart was touched, and I spoke then, as now, with deep sincerity. Every word that I say comes from deep within my heart.</p>
   <p>"During these crucial moments, while world history is in the making, our speech should not only be influenced by calm judgment and keen intellect, but also by our heart, our faithful German heart.</p>
   <p>"Many years ago, there came from the southern regions of the United States long trains bearing great numbers of sick and wounded who were being brought home to be cared for and nursed back to health, or to die in the arms of their loved ones. At that time I was a small boy and my mother allowed me to assist the nurses who were under her supervision. It was my work to shred lint; this was a very humble chore, but it taught me that all people, even small boys, can aid in charity work.</p>
   
   <p>"At times higher powers may place an entire nation under a very severe strain, and at such times it cannot be emphasized too strongly that cooperation is necessary, that unity is vital, and that petty differences of opinion must be forgotten!</p>
   <p>"Much has happened across the Atlantic during the last two days that will not be revealed until later, but we have been informed of one occurrence that evokes our admiration and astonishment--a great people have united. A short time ago, when we dedicated a monument to the memory of a great German genius, many of us probably felt that this memorial should have taken a different form, especially in view of the fact that many thousands of people had come to pay homage to the poet (Goethe); but we were all in perfect accord in our belief that he had earned this distinction. We were united when we built the Altenheim, we were united also when we erected the Hospital [German Deaconess]; and now we again hear the cry--this time from across the seas--'Help our widows and orphans!'</p>
   <p>"Warmay bring honor, but it also brings misery and care. We cannot solve world-wide problems, nor can we take up arms, as the old soldiers among us would like to do, but we can furnish dressings for the wounded, bread for starving families, and consolation for the sad, the downhearted, and the mourning. Friends, though we cannot follow the standards of battle, we can serve under the flag of the Red Cross. Thus the old song 'Dear Fatherland, No Fear Be Thine' may develop a new meaning."</p>
   <p>An equally enthusiastic reception was accorded the address of Mr. Leopold Neumann. He pointed out that great events have always brought harmony into the ranks of Chicago's Germans. "Let enemies try to trample on German culture," said Mr. Neumann, "and we will show our sympathy for our German brothers abroad by rendering all possible aid, both moral and financial." In his closing remarks the speaker cautioned the gathering to put forth united efforts in this cause, and he berated the American press for attempting to incite members of various nationalities in this city to enmity.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of this speech the Austrian national anthem was sung. Mr. H. O. Lang was the next speaker. He declared that the situation was very grave. He said that in 1870, when the Franco-Prussian War broke out, a similar meeting was held in this hall, and that young Turners had assembled here before leaving for the Civil War. "Today," he said, "the situation is much more serious. Americans of German descent should show their gratitude for the many benefits which they have received from their brothers in the old country." Mr. Lang concluded his talk with the request that everyone present attend the meeting at the Auditorium this evening.</p>
   <p>The Austro-Hungarian and German Consuls sent greetings and expressed their regret that they were unable to attend the meeting.</p>
   <p>The Westseite Harmonie [Gesangverein] announced that it has doubled the amount of its dues for the duration of the War, and that one half of the total amount will be donated to the Relief Fund....The Allied Austro-Hungarian Societies contributed one hundred dollars as an initial payment; the Deutscher Krieger Verein donated two hundred and fifty dollars; an anonymous American donated one hundred dollars and promised the same amount every month, as long as the war lasts; and the firm of Eitel Brothers pledged one thousand dollars per month.</p>
   <p>The following resolutions were then passed:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Germans, Austrians, and Hungarians have been forced to abandon the field of regular activity and to enter upon the arena of a bloody struggle, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Every war, even though it be carried on in the interest of the highest human ideals, is accompained by occurrences which appeal to the sympathy of every human being, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The horrors of war have descended upon those in Europe who are flesh of our flesh; therefore be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we Germans, Austrians, and Hungarians assembled in the North Side Turnhalle on the fourth day of August, 1914:</p>
   
   <p>"1) Organize as the German Red Cross;</p>
   <p>"2) Express our deep regret that war has broken out, and our hearty sympathy for our brothers who are fighting for national ideals and justice;</p>
   <p>"3) Do our utmost to alleviate the distress attendant upon the conflict--to accord the wounded proper care, to aid those who are in need of food, clothing, shelter, or mental and spiritual comfort, and</p>
   <p>"4) Elect a committee of twenty-five or more members to carry out our plans and to devise ways and means of collecting and duly forwarding money to attain our noble object."</p>
   <p>Short but well-recieved addresses were also made by Mr. Emil Weidener, Mr. Josef Schlenker, Mr. E. G. F. Brill, and Mr. Julius Meyer.</p>
   <p>The following were elected members of the Committee: Mr. Eugen Niederegger, Reverend [Jacob] Pister, Mr. Fritz Hess.....</p>
   <p>Resolutions of the Germania Club</p>
   <p>The Executive Board of the Germania Club met yesterday to organize a society for the purpose of soliciting funds for the support of the German war victims. The following resolutions were recorded and read by the secretary, and approved by the members of the Board:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We, as American citizens, deplore the horrors of war and would rejoice if war were made impossible forever, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We, are convinced that the German nation is acknowledged to be the leader in industry, progress, and civilization, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We believe that the Emperor of Germany is a true advocate of peace and a watchful and wise defender of the security of his subjects, and that he would not begin hostilities without valid reasons, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, We believe that all Americans of German descent will desire to aid their former countrymen who have espoused the cause of civilization and are defending it against the onslaughts of the enemies of progress; therefore be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, By the Executive Board of the Germania Club, that a general meeting of the members of Germania Club be called for the purpose of organizing a society to undertake the task of collecting money for the support of German war sufferers, and that all other German organizations be invited to lend their moral and financial support to this worthy cause."</p>
