   <p>The same ethical motives which prompted Doctor Bundesen to withdraw from the Chicago Medical Association have led Doctor Yarros to sever her connection with that organization. Dr. Yarros, a colleague of Doctor Louis Ernst Schmidt, has thus added to the city-wide perplexity over the case.</p>
   <p>The following announcement was made yesterday by President Scott of Northwestern University: "Alleviation of suffering is the chief interest in life for Doctor Schmidt, who never analyses the financial status of his patients. This institution was privileged in having Doctor Schmidt's unequalled services, freely contributed to the University over a period of thirty years. He serves as director of the Urological Department of Northwestern University, notwithstanding the fact that his practice requires almost all of his precious time.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"This institution publicly expresses its highest regard for that recognized medical authority, who gives of his knowledge so unreservedly for the general benefit of mankind. Northwestern University wishes to make it generally known that the expulsion of Doctor Schmidt from the Medical Association is no reflection upon his reputation as an outstanding humanitarian, and that he shall remain the highly esteemed teacher and associate of this institution."</p>
   <p>Then commenting upon physicians' fees, which, in his estimation, are already too exorbitant for the poor and the middle-class alike, President Scott said that moderate fees must serve as the foundation for the expansion of the practice of the reputable physician. "Lamentations of the incapable servants of public health must not be permitted to exert a detrimental effect upon the high purposes of medical science."</p>
   <p>Doctor Louis L. Mann, professor at the University of Chicago, in his comment upon the much discussed case, said the time has come when the medical profession <span class="page-break">3</span>must accept new ethics. He also asserted that while Doctor Schmidt's illustrious achievements have dimmed his popularity with the Medical Association the future will reveal him to have been the pioneer of a new era.</p>
   <p>The Association of Commerce also announced its intention of making public the stand taken by the organization regarding the ouster of Doctor Schmidt.</p>
