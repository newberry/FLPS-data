   <p>A cheerful ball was held last Sunday in Albert Lorenz Vokshall on Cornell St. The Society had made a lodge for people who neither could nor would join lodges already in operation; hence this Lodge was to help such persons. The party was very interesting and entertained by Fritz Reuter Grote and Zumbuch--Comrade Ed Cook made short speech in his mother tongue.</p>
   <p>Later on all the young people enjoyed themselves by dancing, to tunes of a very fine orchestra.</p>
