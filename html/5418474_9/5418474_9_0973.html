   <p>We have heard the death rattle of the German Association, that society which always did good work by talking big. It has been an enemy to the poor workman and has been notorious in assisting to break down strikes from their safe hiding place. We are reminded of their infamous participation in the strike of the "Pocikelhous" (Pickle-House workmen.) Their fate is deserved and in a very short time this stigma of German nationality will be gone forever. At yesterday's general meeting of the Association only nine members were present, a proof that the members regard their charity as humbug. Practically no results have been obtained by the Association and the funds that were collected were given to favored persons.</p>
   <p>It is therefore a great satisfaction that for the general welfare this Association is dissolving. Charity is the curse of the Society. In its place must come the conviction that it is the duty and obligation of every human being to help their brothers as best they can.</p>
