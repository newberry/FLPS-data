   <p>It will be remembered that on October 9th, in the Great Fire, the chimney sweep, Franz Heiselmann, a well-known German, who helped most heroically people to save themselves and their possessions, lost his life by the collapse of a burning house on Division Street, where he tried to save a sick woman. Only a few days ago the carbonated bones of Heiselmann were found, and identified by some trinkets he used to carry in his pocket, found nearby. The burial took place, Sunday afternoon, a large crowd participating in the procession.</p>
