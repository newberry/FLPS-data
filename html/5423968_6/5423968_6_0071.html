   <p>Mr. St. Osada, well-known writer, has finished a second novel entitled, "From a Pennsylvanian Hell," a story based on the conditions of our miners in that state, those who have read this new work of Mr. Osada claim that this novel is rather interesting and faithfully shows a picture of our Polish life. The printing of this book was begun by Dziennik Narodowy, but will, no doubt, appear in print in Warsaw and Galicia. We congratulate Mr. Osada.</p>
