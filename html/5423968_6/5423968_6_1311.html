   <p>Brethren:</p>
   <p>If all the Poles are helping to erect a monument to Thaddeus Kosciusko in Chicago in the near future, then we, the exponents of Polish singing cannot afford to lag behind.</p>
   <p>If we devote ourselves to singing Polish songs not for mere applause, but because of our appreciation for them; if we love them because they are an expression of our native soul, then we should also utilize all our efforts to help erect the Kosciusko monument as soon as possible. With this idea in view, the Lutnia Choir sent an appeal to all Polish singing societies in Chicago, to arrange a combined concert for the benefit of this monument fund. This beautiful thought, although it has been publicized in the papers prominently, has so far found support from only five Polish choirs.</p>

   <p>We feel, that there are many more choirs willing to help this cause, and consequently we are once again appealing to you. Don't hesitate, but come and join us now, and the beautiful idea of the Lutnia Choir will be realized.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Committee,</p>
   <p>M. Marcinkowski, president,</p>
   <p>M. Witkowski, secretary.</p>
