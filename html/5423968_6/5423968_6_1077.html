   <p>The Young Men's Society, of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, held a "literary evening" yesterday in the hall of the school building on Bradley Street.</p>
   <p>The affair began quite late and, because the Dramatic Circle was scheduled to hold its meeting in the same hall on the same evening, the program was shortened considerably.</p>
   <p>The president of the Society, Mr. Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, called the meeting to order, and explained the aims and purposes of the Society, and the work it has accomplished to date. He then invited Mr. Henry Nagiel to speak.</p>
   <p>Mr. Nagiel spoke of the aims of poets and their poems and then drew an interesting word picture of our three greatest poets, and in particular of Adam Mickiewicz and his "Grazyna". After giving a synopsis of the poem and pointing out its beauty, the speaker appealed to the young people, especially to the ladies, to emulate "Grazyna" and become, as she was, the defender of the honor and patriotism of her husband and brothers, and thereby become heroines for the sake of peace, unity, and the glory of our country.</p>
   <p>The speech was interrupted often by applause, which was proof that the words of the speaker found an answering echo in the hearts of the listeners.</p>
   <p>A young member of the Society, Wroblewski, recited "Noc Natchnienia" (A Night of Enchantment), to the pleasure of everybody. Although it was a difficult poem to recite, this young man performed his task in an excellent manner.</p>
   <p>The chaplain of the Society, Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek, then gave a sincere talk in his usual eloquent manner and touched the hearts and minds of the audience with his fitting remarks.</p>
   
   <p>A pleasant duet, sung by Miss Theresa Bock and Miss A. Drzonek, concluded the evening's pleasure, with the promise that a second such evening will be held soon, with an even more extensive program.</p>
