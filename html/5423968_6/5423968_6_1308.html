   <p>According to information reaching our offices, the directors of the Kosciusko Monument Fund decided, at a meeting held on December 31, to accept the bid for erecting the monument sent in from Cracow by the artist Chopzinski. The cost of this work is estimated at $16,000.</p>
   <p>The artist is to come to Chicago and personally supervise the construction of the monument.</p>
   <p>The directors are making every effort to collect the necessary funds. A special play, "Zwiazkowiec" (A Polish Nationalist), written by Zbigniew Brodowski, is to be staged within the near future. The proceeds are to go to the Monument Fund.</p>
   <p>The St. Martin Society, of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, contributed ten dollars. Further contributions are welcomed.</p>
