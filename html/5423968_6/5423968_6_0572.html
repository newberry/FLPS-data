   <p>On November 8, after a year of prolonged delay, a jury in Judge Payne's court reached verdict of guilty against Stanislaus Segers, publisher of the former Djabel (Devil), now Kropidlo (Sprinkler), who was charged with libel. The charges were brought by Andrew Kwasigroch, well-known choirmaster of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. Details of this verdict appeared in the November 9 issue of the Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>We give below the entire text of the decision of Judge Payne, who sentenced Stanislaus Segers yesterday to four months imprisonment for criminal libel.</p>
   <p>Judge Payne, in sentencing Segers, said: "Mr. Segers, the law as to libel is as follows:</p>
   <p>"'Libel of the press is a malign defamation, expressed through the printed word or sign or picture or in some other manner, having for its aim the defamation of the memory of one who is deceased, or the injury of the honor, honesty, virtue, or reputation, or the revelation of the natural shortcomings, of a living person, by which that individual becomes exposed to public humiliation, debasement, ridicule, or material loss; everyone, whether a writer or a publisher, found guilty of such libel will be fined to the extent of five hundred dollars or sentenced to not more than one year imprisonment in the county jail.'</p>
   <p>"As to the present case, the court has come to the resolute opinion that you, sir, have published this libel and purposely intended to defame the character of this person [Andrew Kwasigroch], or in order to aid your attack on the priest [Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish] in charge of the church in which this person is employed as an organist; or that you, sir, are guilty of criminal negligence, since you have not considered the gravity of such a serious charge. According to your own claims, you had been informed about Mr. Kwasigroch at least a week before the matter was published; according to the claims of the witnesses this happened a month before.</p>
   
   <p>In every instance, sir, you maintain that some of your friends had complained about this but these complaints were not published.</p>
   <p>"Subsequently, the poorest person upon this soil, in the event he is charged with a felony, has the right to have that charge presented before him and competently proven before twelve jurors. To each person his reputation is more important than that of another; and as I have already stated, sir, you had either purposely or through negligence decided to publish in the paper the worst kind of libel that has ever been seen. The plaintiff is a person who is employed as an organist--a position that not only requires ability but honesty and good character--in a church that numbers from six to ten thousand members. Naturally, any reproach cast upon the reputation of this individual might deprive him not only of his position but also of the respect of all good people. You live eight blocks from this person. The news came to you days before the publication of this article. You have taken the responsibility of its publication upon yourself. You had various opportunities of defending yourself before the court. But despite this you have not presented any defense, perhaps through your attorney--but this means that you have given no explanation of the facts; you did not have the conviction that this man was in the least degree guilty of the crime of which you accused him.</p>
   <p>"Now it is my duty to pronounce sentence upon you for this act. There is probably no one who has greater respect than I for the freedom of the press; no one who abhors its abuse more. This is a serious difference. The press has the right to publish the truth about everyone for just purposes. It has the right to judge the facts more or less critically if its motives are good. But in this case I cannot find anything that would show that I should give a less severe sentence.</p>
   <p>"It seems to me that a certain controversy exists between some of your friends and the church; this exists among the Poles as well as the Bohemians. You have the right to criticize the Catholic Church. You have the right to maintain that it is not the church that conforms to your ideas. You have the right to advise the people not to belong to this church. But the minute you attack the reputation of a priest or the organist or a member of the parish, you draw upon yourself the same responsibilities as if you had attacked the court or any citizen, no less and no more.</p>
   <p>"Not so long ago I adjudged another case of libel--and the parties in question took an oath before me that they had committed this act unknowingly. The claims of the accused were false nevertheless. Mr. Bittner should have been sentenced, since his charges against Abbot Jaeger were as false as those that you published against Mr. Kwasigroch. If this is supposed to represent the freedom of the press then the less we have of it the better. Such publications do not elevate the press; instead they lower its reputation and standing with all good, thinking people. In this country we all have the same right: the right to freedom, the right to the freedom of religious pursuits, even the right not to possess any of the various religious beliefs. But the fundamental principle of American freedom is to give to another person that which we would demand for ourselves. This is proof that we understand the idea of freedom. You have not given this proof.</p>
   
   <p>"I do not have the intention of sentencing you for the mere pleasure of punishment, but it is necessary to establish it as a fact, as a precedent, in this country, that a paper has no more right to attack one's character than an individual has."</p>
   <p>After announcing his decision the judge asked Segers if he had enough money to pay the two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar fine. When he replied that he did not, the judge imposed upon him a four-month jail sentence.</p>
   <p>It must be added that prior to the judge's announcement of the decision, Mr. Segers' attorneys pleaded for leniency for their client. But Nuchin Korngold-Zlotnicki, former editor of the Djabel and Kropidlo, and the former compositor, B. J. Wasowicz, plainly stated in English that they told Mr. Segers not to print this libelous story about Mr. Kwasigroch because it was contrary to the facts. Mr. Segers, according to them, however, replied that he would publish it despite everything, "even if he must go to jail". This last statement caused the court to give the above decision.</p>
