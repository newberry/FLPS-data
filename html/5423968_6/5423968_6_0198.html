   <p>The recent appeal for further contributions of books for the Educational Department of the Polish League has brought a favorable response. Recent contributions are as follows: A. Ostrowski has offered four books; a certain Mr. X has given two books; Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek gave another two tomes; and Szczesny Zahajkiewicz has graciously donated twenty-six books, including three copies of his collected poems.</p>
   <p>Sincere thanks are extended to the kind donors.</p>
