   <p>Contributions of books for the proposed libraries and reading rooms of the Educational Department of the Polish League are coming not only from the Poles of Chicago but also from those in other cities. This enthusiastic support is definite proof that the Polish people of America realize the need for spreading Polish culture.</p>
   <p>Reverend Witold Buhaczkowski, in the name of the Polish seminary in Detroit, has sent sixty copies of books published by the seminary. Polish novels, as well as historical and religious books, make up the list of books received. The latest book contributions are as follows:</p>
   <p>I. Kowalski, three books; August Troscian, of Lemont, Illinois, four books; Bartholomew Pszczola, one book with a letter wishing success to the library venture; and B. Klarkowski, one book.</p>
   
   <p>Sincere thanks are extended to the kindly donors.</p>
   <p>Thus far over two hundred books have been received.</p>
