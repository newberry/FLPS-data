   <p>The name of Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States, Liberator of Poland, honored deeply by the Poles in both hemispheres, will in the near future appear as an everlasting memory on a monument, which will stand in a short time at the intersection of Chicago, Ogden and Milwaukee Avenues.</p>
   <p>A few months ago in the city council the alderman of the 31st ward, S. Adamkiewicz, brought up a motion that the city allot a parcel of land for this purpose. The resolution was passed, as well as another that Mayor Dever appoint a committee, which would take up the erection of that new monument.</p>
   <p>Mayor Dever, in compliance with that resolution, appointed a committee, at whose head he placed Mr. J.C. Hansen, President of the Security Bank, and besides that, he called upon the presidents and representatives of the most prominent Polish organizations, on our Polish congressman and Polish aldermen, as well as a number of prominent neighborhood business men, to enter into the composition of this committee.</p>

   <p>The president of the committee, acting on the recommendation of the mayor, called together yesterday afternoon, a meeting of the committee, which the following persons attended: J. Hansen, President of the Security Bank; M. Schulz of the factory, Schultz Piano Company; Robert Falconer; Chas. Severinghaus; A.F. Lakowka of the Dziennik Chicagoski; B. Hecnt, president of the West Side Commerical League; K. Piatkiewicz of the Dziennik Zwiazkowy; Harriet Vittum of the Northwestern Settlement; J. Jankowski of the Dziennik Zjednoczenia; J. Przybylo, candidate for County Commissioner; Graham Taylor of the Daily News; W.L. Petrykowski of the Alliance of Polish Singers; Alderman S. Adamkiewicz; Miss E. Napieralska, president of the Polish Women's Alliance; and A. Romano, representative of the Italian organizations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hansen was elected chairman, after which, a resolution was unanimously adopted to honor the great president and to perpetuate his memory to future generations of how noble the figure of the leader of our Republic was during the period of the great World War, by erecting a monument for him, which <span class="page-break">3</span>should stand at the intersections of the streets, according to the resolution of Alderman, S. Adamkiewicz in the City Council.</p>
   <p>The project of the monument met with the enthusiastic support of all those present. The question of financing the building of the monument was raised by Alderman S. Adamkiewicz in a lengthy talk; that there exists here in Chicago, a two million dollar Ferguson Fund, especially designated for the building of monuments to deserving persons. Therefore, the committee must make an appeal to the Ferguson Fund for the money. Besides that, the committee will make an appeal for donations from citizens, who have preserved their worship of a great president and are also in favor of perpetuating his figure in bronze. The committee will make another appeal to the finance committee of the City Council to assign funds for building the base and socle. The local Art Institute will make an effort to see that the monument is an artistic masterpiece. It is willingly supporting the project. C. Wacker, the creator of the famous drive, and president of the committee on beautifying the city, has declared himself in favor of building the monument.</p>

   <p>Mr. G. Taylor spoke on the meaning of Woodrow Wilson's activity during the period of the war, reminding that Wilson died as a martyr to his ideals, as a hero like every soldier in war and fully deserves to have his memory honored with a monument. The most suitable place for such a monument is surely in a Polish neighborhood, because Wilson has done much for Poland and is deeply respected by the Poles. Nothing could more beautiful than the building of the monument by way of public subscription, this would indeed give tone and meaning to the monument, which would stand as a result to the offerings of the people, in whose hearts has been preserved honor to a lover of liberty.</p>
   <p>The committee on the building of the monument consists of: Mayor Dever honorary president; J. Hansen, president; Alderman S. Adamkiewicz, first vice-president; H. Vittum, second vice-president; G. Taylor, third vice-president; E. Napieralska, secretary; A. Schultz, cashier; also A Kazmierczak, president of the Polish R.C. Union; K. Zychlinska, president of the Polish National Alliance; J.F. Smulski, T. Soska, president of the Polish Alma Mater; W. Petrykowski, president of the Polish Singers Alliance; J. Jankowski, A. Lakowka, K. Piatkiewicz, Reverend Kowalczyk and A. Romano.</p>
