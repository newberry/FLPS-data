   <p>The Polish Roman-Catholic Library was organized in 1915. It contains more than 7000 volumes-most of which are Polish. Books printed in English can also be had, but they are mostly reference books and books of a scientific nature. More than 500 people, including 300 school children make use of the library and its facilities regularly. Rules for borrowing books from the library are the same as those of the Chicago Public Library.</p>
