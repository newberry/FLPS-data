   <p>The Polish Sokol of the White Eagle at St. Stanislaus parish has organized for the coming season a football team consisting only of members of the Sokol. The captain is Francis Jedzejek; and manager August Kowalski.</p>
   <p>The first contest will take place Sunday at 2:30 P. M. against the Cyclones, at the field in Kimball and Belmont avenue.</p>
   <p>Although football is very popular in this country, and considered the first-ranking American sport, one Polish football team exists, organized by the Sokols.</p>
   <p>Every one wishing to watch Sunday's contest between these two teams is cordially invited.</p>
   <p>All young Polish people should make it their duty to be present at this inaugural Polish football game, and give the team their heartiest support.</p>
