   <p>(We have received the following correspondence with a request that it be published in the Dziennik Chicagoski.)</p>
   <p>The undersigned committee has the pleasure of inviting all societies to take part in the summer outing to be held on Saturday, July 4, 1896, in Schuetzen Park.</p>
   <p>The entire proceeds of this outing will be turned over to the Kosciusko Monument Fund. Our national honor demands that the project begun a few years ago be brought to a successful conclusion as soon as possible. This monument should be erected soon. Let us all help to build it; let us show the devotion and respect due this hero of two worlds. Let us get to work willingly! We hope none will be missing from this outing, for by their presence we can be <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>certain that the monument will be built sooner than we expected.</p>
   <p>The committee hopes that these words will appeal to all societies receiving this invitation and that all their members will attend the picnic.</p>
   <p>All societies and organizations coming to this affair in a body will be admitted free of charge.</p>
   <p>Address all inquiries to the secretary. Once again we call the attention of the societies to the importance of this matter. We remain,</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>J. Palczynski, president,</p>
   <p>S. Wojtalewicz, treasurer,</p>
   <p>A. X. Centella,</p>
   <p>W. Lejman,</p>
   <p>I. Pulkowski, secretary,</p>
   <p>817 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
