   <p>Scenes of the Passion Play were presented by stereoscopic slides last night for the first time at the Polish Hall, Bradley and Noble Streets. The pictures were based on the dramatization at Oberammergau, Bavaria.</p>
   <p>The large auditorium was filled to capacity, including the gallery and standing room. The beautiful and amazing pictures were received with great enthusiasm. B. Klarkowski acted as commentator while the pictures were shown on the screen.</p>
   <p>To say the least, the public was enchanted by the presentation.</p>
   <p>The performance is to be repeated this evening and tomorrow. It is anticipated that all those who have not seen the Passion Play will take advantage of the next two showings. Truly, the magnificent colored slides are worth seeing.</p>
   
   <p>Incidentally, the proceeds from these performances are to be turned over to the Polish Hospital and St. Stanislaus Kostka College.</p>
