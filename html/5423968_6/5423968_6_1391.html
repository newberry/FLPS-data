   <p>The project to erect a monument for Thaddeus Kosciusko has found hearty support among Americans also. Proof of this is the letter received yesterday by Mr. Zbigniew Brodowski from Mr. Thaddeus Dean, president of the Central Lumber Company in Chicago. The letter reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Honorable E. Z. Brodowski,</p>
   <p>President of the Association to Build a Monument to Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>One of my patriotic forbears had the opportunity of being closely associated with the great Kosciusko, in consequence of which I was honored by being given the name of this great man. I therefore claim the right to make a donation for a monument for this true patriot.</p>
   <p>"I am enclosing a check for this purpose.</p>
   
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>Thaddeus Dean"</p>
   <p>A check for one hundred dollars was enclosed with the letter. This descendant of a companion of Kosciusko deserves our heartfelt gratitude for so generous a gift.</p>
