   <p>Announcement of the winners in the first literary contest of the Educational Department of the Polish League was made at a meeting Saturday, April 13.</p>
   <p>Although we are not in a position to make the official announcement of awards, we are able to give to our readers the final results of the judges' decisions, which have reached us through a private source.</p>
   <p>As has been previously announced, the idea of the contest was to write an article in journalistic style on "What are the obligations of Polish youth in America?"</p>
   <p>Fourteen entries were received.</p>
   <p>The members of the Educational Department rejected some entries after examination <span class="page-break">2</span>because they did not follow the prescribed form, and announced that three awards and three honorable mentions would be given.</p>
   <p>An extra honorable mention was decided upon because of the worthy work of a young feminine contestant.</p>
   <p>The awards were as follows:</p>
   <p>First prize (four volumes of the works of Adam Mickiewicz); Manuscript bearing the word "Studiosus." After opening the envelope the name of the author was revealed as Walter B. Polarczyk, 18 years old, student of St. Paul Seminary, Merriam Park, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>Second prize (three volumes of the works of Ignace Chodzki): Manuscript bearing the slogan "Multum in parvo" (Much in little). The author was Francis E. Fronczak, A. B., Ph. S., medical student, age 21, of Buffalo, New York.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Third prize (Life of the Saints): Article marked with two spiral lines. The author was Joseph H. Zawodny, age 20, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>Honorable mentions were given as follows:</p>
   <p>First honorable mention: Article earmarked "Deborog" [Literally this word means "oak horn", but I believe it has reference to an ancient Polish tribe]. The author of this article was Stephen Nowakowski, 18 years old, member of the Niedziela (Sunday) staff of the Polish Seminary at Detroit, Michigan.</p>
   <p>Second honorable mention: Article designated with the word "Enem" [?]. The author was Maximilian Dabrowski, age 21, of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Third honorable mention: Manuscript was marked with the following title, "Tulacz Polski," (Polish Refugee). J. S. Bobinski of Toluca, Illinois, was the author.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>An extra honorable mention went to a young Polish girl of Chicago, Miss Helen Krus, 16, for her beautiful article marked with three triangles.</p>
   <p>These were the results of the contest.</p>
   <p>Perhaps tomorrow we will be able to publish the official results of the literary contest staged by the Educational Department, and within the near future the three prize-winning articles will be published.</p>
   <p>The article of Mr. Nowakowski of Detroit, as well as that of Miss Krus, will appear in the Gazeta Katolicka (Catholic Gazette), through the courtesy of the Educational Department.</p>
   <p>Excerpts from two of the articles that received honorable mention will be published in Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
