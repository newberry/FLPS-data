   <p>The J. I. Kraszewski Library was opened to the public on Jan. 25, 1904, with the aid of 21 Polish organizations. A committee was selected to promote a movement for its expansion. This library at the present time contains 514 bound, and 60 unbound books for which it owes its thanks to the energetic work of the committee.</p>
   <p>The largest contribution towards its development came from the educational department of the Polish National Alliance, which from time to time, supplied the library with the best volumes of the most prominent Polish authors. Credit for the increase of books in the J. I. Kraszewski Library is given to the Poles in the vicinity of St. Adalbert's Parish. A daily average of about 80 readers receive the benefit of this Library. The Library is open Monday and Friday from 8 to 9:30 p.m.</p>
