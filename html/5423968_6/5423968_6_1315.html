   <p>One of the liveliest meetings of the main committee in charge of arranging the Kosciusko Festival was held last night.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, the Saint Stephen Martyr Society expressed its desire to participate in the festival. The Thaddeus Kosciusko Fraternal Benefit Society of South Chicago sent a letter to the committee stating that it would not take part in the festival because it had already arranged a picnic of its own, but that the profit of this picnic would be turned over to the Kosciusko movement fund.</p>
   <p>To deliver the speeches for the opening of the festival the following speakers were chosen: Mr. Hesing, postmaster general of Chicago; Judge J. LaBuy, and Mr. [F. H.] Jablonski, editor of Zgoda.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to make arrangements with the streetcar company for <span class="page-break">2</span>a sufficient number of streetcars.</p>
   <p>The committee to purchase the cigars reported they had been ordered from different Polish cigar-makers. Wines and whiskies were ordered from Paul Giersz, Polish wholesale liquor dealer.</p>
   <p>The soda water will be supplied by Lomax at a discount of ten dollars for each one hundred cases.</p>
