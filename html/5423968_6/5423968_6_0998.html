   <p>As we all know, the Polish Catholic Congress is to be authorized to organize a teachers' seminary.</p>
   <p>Is there any need for such a seminary here in America?</p>
   <p>In order to answer this question, let us first consider school conditions as they exist today.</p>
   <p>It is well known that in the smaller parishes the organist is also the teacher. Of course, they are organists by profession, and if they serve as teachers, it is because of necessity.</p>
   <p>This suggests two uncomfortable facts: First, the purpose of a grade school <span class="page-break">2</span>is not only to teach children how to read and write, but also to broaden their minds and hearts as much as possible, and this is a very difficult task for those not qualified. In addition, all pedagogues agree that it is easier to teach in the middle grade schools or lecture at a university than to instruct children of tender age, those small egoists in whom the soul and heart are still asleep, and in whom the one and the other must be awakened and led on the proper path of enlightenment.</p>
   <p>Second, an organist performs the duties of organist efficiently because that is his profession, but he considers teaching a secondary matter and teaches only because he must.</p>
   <p>Can this be beneficial to any school? The answer is simple.</p>
   <p>Are the priests or the parish at fault?</p>
   <p>No, because we know that most of the parishes are in a comparatively difficult <span class="page-break">3</span>financial condition.</p>
   <p>Practically every church is mortgaged, so it is out of the question to spend large sums for teachers' salaries--so think some parishioners....Hence, from necessity, they try to be satisfied with the kind of teacher they can afford.</p>
   <p>In our opinion, this is not proper.</p>
   <p>The parishioners ought to remember that they should avoid making their children's training a business proposition and they should not regret spending money for their education. These children will form our future communities and the parents will some day give an account to God and fatherland for their deeds....</p>
   <p>Not everyone understands this, and it is too bad. But things must remain as they are.</p>
   <p>Where is it possible to secure professional qualified teachers here in America?</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>To import professional teachers from the old country will not settle the question definitely. These teachers' usefulness, at least at the beginning would be limited to large schools where provision is made for a separate English teacher. They themselves do not understand this language.</p>
   <p>The poorer parishes cannot afford this, especially because these "imported" teachers, besides their ignorance of conditions and the language, know nothing about the organists' profession.</p>
   <p>We can see from the above that the parish either has a good organist and a poor teacher, or a good teacher who cannot perform the duties of an organist.</p>
   <p>This is the hub of the matter.</p>
   <p>Present-day conditions demand that we get--all in one person--a good Catholic, a good organist, and a good teacher able to speak both Polish and English.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Such a person can be supplied only by a teachers' seminary, established here in America, that would answer the purpose.</p>
   <p>It is too early yet to discuss this plan in detail; but when the time comes, we should be ready to express our opinion. Sometimes one solitary suggestion may be most beneficial.</p>
   <p>At any rate, the teachers' seminary in America is necessary, and when it becomes a reality, we can expect that the teacher-organists graduating from it will not join hands with the malcontents or be opposed to the pastor, as has been the case in the past. In addition to this they will be able to perform their church and school duties satisfactorily.</p>
   <p>It is for this reason that we hope the Polish Catholic Congress will be a success and that one of its fruits will be a teachers' seminary.</p>
