   <p>St. Casmir Young Men's Society, in St. Stanislaus Parish, donated $50 to the parish library fund. This fund will be used for enlarging the parish library, especially the establishment of a reading room. The library is in charge of the Polish Patriots' Club, and this fund is at its disposal. The young men of this society certainly deserve due credit and hearty support in every respect. They are a good example to our Polish youth, and we hope they will be Polish patriots, even though some of them are born in America and will remain here.</p>
