   <p>We wish to inform our readers that, beginning April 17, the Saturday issue of Dziennik Chicagoski will be an eight-page issue. News, feature articles, and other interesting items will fill the added pages. The continual increase in number of readers and in advertising copy has made this change possible. In this way both the reader and the advertiser benefits. Separate sections will be set aside for [material of interest to] readers.</p>
