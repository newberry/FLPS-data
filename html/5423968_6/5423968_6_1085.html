   <p>Yesterday afternoon, at four o'clock, the second patriotic program of the Educational Department of the Polish League was staged at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish School hall, with the co-operation of the St. Casimir Young Men's Society.</p>
   <p>The gathering was opened by B. Klarkowski, who delivered a short address. He compared Poland to a huge edifice whose foundation, like the people of Poland, is sound; but whose walls are cracking, while the tower--the nobility--is ruined. From this point on the speaker traced the fall of Poland.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of his speech, Mr. Klarkowski called upon Stanislaus Szwajkart, secretary of the Polish League, to act as chairman; L. Szopinski was called to act as recording secretary. A song, "Dzwonek Maryi" (Mary's Bell), was sung by the members of St. Stanislaus Kostka College. This was followed by a declamation by one of the students of St. Stanislaus Kostka School. Young Krepiec (sic) stirred the audience with his presentation of "Modlitwa" (Prayer).</p>
   <p>Two students, Miss A. Kozlowska and Miss M. Kosinska, sang a duet under the direction of the Sisters of Notre Dame. The piano playing by students from the same school left nothing more to be desired in the form of musical entertainment.</p>
   <p>At this point in the program, I. Kowalski delivered a lecture on the partition of Poland. Mr. Kowalski cited the various causes of the partitions, including the early history of Poland, and the rise of the Polish spirit which led to the drafting of the Constitution of the Third of May. The lecture on the whole was thorough and interesting, as was evidenced by the generous applause.</p>
   <p>Miss Martha Kosinska followed with a recitation of "Tesknote Za Krajem" (A Yearning for the Homeland) which was enthusiastically received by the audience.</p>
   
   <p>Enthusiastic applause greeted Misses Helen Jankowska, P. Klatecka, B. Kwasigroch, M. Szulc, Clara Panten, and Frances Ostrowska for their piano renditions of national airs.</p>
   <p>The students of the St. Stanislaus Kostka College gave their version of the Polish song "W Gore Sztandar" (Raise the Banner). After that, Peter Ligman expressed his thanks to the large audience for its support and attendance at these programs. He urged the Polish youth and the parents to attend the various planned lectures which are to be given in the future. Mr. Ligman asserted that these affairs arouse the patriotic spirit in our hearts and also bring great benefits to us.</p>
   <p>A short prayer concluded the program.</p>
   <p>The next patriotic exercise will be held in the New Polish Hall; for the school hall in which the previous meetings were held cannot accommodate all the people. The Sisters of Notre Dame should be given credit for their co-operation in making the program a success.</p>
   
   <p>The large attendance of Polish youth at these occasions indicates that it is beginning to grasp the Polish cause. Let us gather and learn at these affairs, and in this way conditions will turn for the better for us. A correction should be made as to the fourth number on the program. It was arranged by the Sisters of Notre Dame and not by those of the Nazareth order, as previously announced. [Reference is made to the program published in the March 6 issue.]</p>
