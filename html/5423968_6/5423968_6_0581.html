   <p>Beginning tomorrow there will be a definite change in the Saturday editions of the Dziennik Chicagoski, and the Sunday editions will be suspended because of technical difficulties.</p>
   <p>These changes, however, will not be a loss to the subscribers. The Saturday edition hereafter will embody the same ideas as the former Sunday editions, and all literary features will be intact.</p>
   <p>Besides the regular news, all serial novels and regular articles will be continued in the Saturday editions. In no way will this Saturday edition deviate from the policy of the Sunday edition.</p>
   <p>The Saturday edition, instead of carrying twelve pages of copy, will carry only eight pages, but more will be added if necessary. The cost of the Saturday edition will be one cent a copy, as heretofore.</p>
   <p>One can readily see the advantages of this change. We are of the opinion that this step, taken in the interest of the readers, will in no way affect the support of our subscribers.</p>
   <p>The publishers.</p>
