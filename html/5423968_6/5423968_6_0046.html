   <p>Our Circle held another literary recital yesterday. There was no admission charge, so that the church hall was completely filled.</p>
   <p>The members of the Circle and the local priests occupied seats on the stage.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's program was quite varied. Besides solos, duets, and choir singing, there were recitations, speeches, a comical recitation, etc. Especially noteworthy were the speeches by F. Osuch (on education), F. Gibasiewicz (on the need of organizing societies for the young people), and Chmielewski (on the patriotism of our forefathers).</p>
   <p>A member of the Circle, Rydwelski, entertained the audience with his tricks and jokes. Some of the songs and recitations were not bad. All of the amateurs in yesterday's celebration showed evident improvement. Here and there a criticism would be in order, and at times the pronunciation was poor. But these are matters that can be corrected by hard work.</p>
   <p>The members of the Circle are working hard and it is evident that they have the desire and good will--as shown by yesterday's celebration--to devote themselves earnestly, for their own good and for the education of our people. Praise to them! Keep up the good work and you will reap a rich reward. Do not seek praise in words, but rather let the deeds themselves praise you.</p>
