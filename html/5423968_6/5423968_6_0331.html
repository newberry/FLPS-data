   <p>The Dziennik Zjednoczenia, will appear on the twenty-second day of September. Only a few days separates us from the great day when the long anticipated Dziennik Zjednoczenia will appear. This will happen next Thursday, the twenty-second day of September 1921. It will be a memorable day in the history of the Polish, Roman-Catholic Union of America.</p>
   <p>Brother, a great happiness will come into our ranks. We will have our own daily paper. Do we realize what it means? Our very own, not somebody else's. One that is not hostile toward us; not capitalistic, not socialistic, not perverting, not sexless,or sexy but, our own, healthful, well meaning, our dear, Polish, Cathoic paper.</p>
