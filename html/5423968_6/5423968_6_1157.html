   <p>The wrestlers of other nationalities are conducting an elimination tournament, which will take in all the heavyweights. Why not have an elimination tournament for the Polish heavyweight championship? and decide once and for all, who is the best among the heavyweights at the present time. The winner to meet Strangler Lewis, the present heavyweight champion of the world.</p>
   <p>In the heavyweight ranks among the Poles we have the following: Joe Malcewicz, Stanley Stasiak,Stanislavs and Walter Zbyszko, last, but not least, Frank Jedlinski. We have enought talent among them, and the sooner we do this the better the game will prosper and stop all this "ballyhooing" that is going on.</p>
   <p>We have enough promoters here in town who would only be too glad to put on such a tournament. We hope that this will mature, and for the Polish-American sportsmen it can't come to soon.</p>
   
   <p>The different sport writers here in the city have been flooded with mail demanding this tournament. If we, the sport writers, have any influence we will with the aid of the American press, to bring about the wrestling dimination bouts.</p>
