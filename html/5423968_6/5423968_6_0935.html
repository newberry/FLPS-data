   <p>Wherever one cast an eye during these present wartimes, there is a great demand for skilled labor. The present moment is a very important one for craftsmen, and, especially, for our Polish craftsmen.</p>
   <p>Guiding itself by the fact that, in order to rebuild industry and prosperity in our freed homeland, a great number of skilled craftsmen in all kinds of trades will be needed, the directors of the Institute have decided to offer one more technical course, covering the construction and operation of automobiles. Students may enroll starting February 4 in this course as well as in courses previously established.</p>
   <p>Since the time of its establishment, the Institute has sent out into the world a great number of trained mechanics who today are occupying good positions as machinists, toolmakers, pattern makers, and draftsmen. These men, thanks to the Polish National Alliance, are now self-supporting and are <span class="page-break">\2</span>generally respected; some have even gained very well-paid Government positions.</p>
   <p>A given trade can be learned to its very fundamentals at the Institute;for the Institute is well equipped with machines, and has a faculty of instructors directed by a Polish engineer, a specialist in the American factory system. Our school is not an institution for profit and does not try to exploit the Polish workingman, as various Jewish-owned schools do; instead, it has the workingman's future and the future of Poland in mind. This aim was established by the members of the Polish National Alliance at the time the school was founded, and for this reason the school offers a selection of courses; its few score students are being educated not only as good mechanics but also as good citizens.</p>
   <p>The Institute offers courses in the machinist trade, tool and diemaking, patternmaking, drafting, and construction of automobiles and gasoline engines. Courses in the operation of lathes, drill-press, milling machines, and planers are also offered.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>In addition to practical shop training, the student is required to study mathematics, drafting, English, and the principles of mechanical engineering.</p>
   <p>The courses are open to all Poles over sixteen years of age; elderly applicants are accepted with pleasure, for the Trade Institute was designed for the purpose of helping all elements of Polish society, for the benefit of Poland.</p>
