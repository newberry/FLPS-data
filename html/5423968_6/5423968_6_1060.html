He also received invitations to lecture, from the University of Nevada, at Reno, The University of Nebraska, at Lincoln, and the University of Wisconsin, at Madison.</p>
   <p>Besides lecturing on Poland, in general, and the renowned Plato, he announced - that in the near future, in both California Universities, he was to lecture on the following subjects: "Socialism in Poland", the "Constitution of Poland", "Hindoo Reincarnation", "Polish and Greek Poets", "Willpower", "The Yogi System in India", "Ungodly comedy of Krasinaki", "Darwins predecessor of Poland", "The Polish Theory of Evolution and their Method of learning foreign languages".</p>

Due to his grand education and practiced use of the American language, Professor Lutoslawski is one Pole from Europe to whom the doors of American Universities are readily opened.
