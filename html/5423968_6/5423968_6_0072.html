   <p>In America we have very few Polish literary men outside of the ones who are editors for various newspapers and, of course, find very little time to produce the so called "wonderful" literature.</p>
   <p>Among the poets, one person, Mr. S. Zahajkiewicz, really deserves the gods gifted title, even though he is handicapped doing other work instead of devoting his full time to his talent, as we would desire him to do. Another poet, who we claim deserves this title also, is Mr. S. Lenpicki, who gave us the sonnet "Spirits." Others, who were educated in European schools, do not merit the title of Polish-American authors or poets.</p>
   <p>Therefore, with joy we must greet the talented efforts of our young Polish youth who educated themselves here in parochial schools and Polish colleges, and whose literary compositions prove the youth is inoculated with the love of their country and the love of their native tongue.</p>
   
   <p>To these poetic beginners belong Mr. S. Kolanowski, a former student and now a teacher of St. Stanislaus College in Chicago. We had the opportunity of publishing some of his work.</p>
