   <p>During its 10 years of existence, The Educational Department of the Polish National Alliance has established 120 libraries for groups in various settlements, and supplied them with books containing special subjects, also distributed 20,000 books among the existing libraries in various communities, being regarded as a useful factor in furnishing tuition to students in institutions of higher education.</p>
   <p>These 20,000 volumes in circulation among our people and the increasing demand for more books on science is evidence that our people are willing and eager to learn. We are hoping the convention will increase the number of volumes as the demand for books is daily increasing in this Department of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
