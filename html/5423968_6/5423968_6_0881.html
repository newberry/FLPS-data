   <p>The Catholic Almanac for the year 1894, published by the Polish Publishing Company (Spolka Wydawnictwa Polskiego), will be on sale early next month. Prepared this time with special care, the Almanac will undoubtedly satisfy its subscribers entirely. It will be distinguished by its careful selection of beautiful illustrations, much more numerous in this issue than in any previous Almanac.</p>
   <p>The calendar section, edited most carefully according to church rubrics, is especially valuable in that it also lays stress on all of the more important Polish and American national holidays. As an innovation, the calendar contains a section called "Slavonic Names".</p>
   <p>The humor section that accompanies each month is very rich. There is also a very interesting article entitled "Almanac Mysteries," which explains clearly the meaning of such terms as "epact," "golden numbers," "Sunday letters,"</p>
   
   <p>"Roman post," etc. Other interesting features are "Polish Queen's Crown," concerning the Kosciusko Insurrection of 1794; a beautiful dramatic play, "Our Father," by Copp, and many more, all of which will be read with interest. There is no lack of household hints.</p>
   <p>A good part of the Almanac is devoted to the Chicago World's n, and there are considerably more advertisements than usually.</p>
   <p>The Almanac is such that it should be found in every home in America, and we have no doubt that its sales will reach tens of thousands of copies. Orders will be taken at the Polish Publishing Company, 141-143 West Division Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
