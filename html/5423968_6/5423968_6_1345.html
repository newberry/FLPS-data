   <p>Already last week--according to articles in American and German newspapers--we published a news item to the effect that certain swindlers were selling some kind of fifty-cent tickets for the "benefit of the Kosciusko Monument Fund", and we mentioned that Mr. E. Z. Brudowski, president of the Monument Building Committee, warns everybody against these swindlers.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as some people have formed a wrong opinion--that the warning was intended for the Polish entertainments arrainged in good faith for the benefit of the monument--we therefore feel it our duty to make the following explanation:</p>
   <p>These spurious 50-cent tickets, mentioned above, were printed in English and put into circulation by some English-speaking hoodlums; they had no mention of any ball, picnic, entertainment, or anything of the sort, but simply stated: "Fifty cents for the benefit of the Kosciusko Monument."</p>

   <p>Mr. P. Pulkowski, the secretary of the Celebration Committee in charge of arranging a picnic on July 4th, secured one of these spurious tickets and gave it to the police.</p>
   <p>As to the tickets for picnics and Polish concerts for the benefit of the Kosciusko Monument, they are good and authoritative.</p>
   <p>One of the letters sent out by Mr. Brodowski, president of the Monument Building Committee, has been submitted to us.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brodowski announces that his warning was intended for the American public, who is being swindled, and says that he had no intention of interfering with any social affairs, theatrical performances, or concerts arranged for the benefit of the monument. On the contrary, he heartily endorses all efforts of Polish societies or private individuals who wish to help the cause.</p>
   <p>In view of the above, all doubts vanish.</p>

   <p>In the near future there will be held in Chicago for the benefit of the Kosciusko monument a concert given by the Nowicki brothers; also a great picnic by the Polish National Alliance societies, as well as other affairs. Tickets for these and other genuine social functions may be purchased without fear by the Polish people.</p>
   <p>Let us try and do all we can, so that the monument be erected as soon as possible....</p>
