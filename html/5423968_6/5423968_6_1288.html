   <p>Dear Fellowmen:</p>
   <p>These days letters pertaining to the erection of a monument in honor of General Pulaski were mailed to you to be forwarded to your congressmen. After filling out these letters they should be immediately mailed to Washington. You should attempt to get your congressman indorse it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Smolinski writes our committee that when the congressmen receive a great deal of these letters from groups and societies, they shall give them some consideration and help us in our efforts in erecting a monument of our great hero.</p>
   <p>The present session of Congress will soon come to an end, and so we haven't much time to lose. That is why we request and wish you to mail out these letters so promptly.</p>
   <p>T. M. Helinski, Head of the ZNP Monument Erecting Committee.</p>
