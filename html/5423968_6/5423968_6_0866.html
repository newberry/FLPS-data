   <p>Index of Polish Firms in Chicago, a book containing information and relative data, has come out of print compiled by Mr. K. Olszowy (owner of a book bindery establishment located a 810-14 Milwaukee Avenue), where it can be purchased. There has been printed over 10,000 copies. The guide presents itself very well and contains advertisements and information of Polish firms exclusively.</p>
   <p>The Index is worthy of recommendation, especially to our countrymen outside of the city, visiting Chicago on business.</p>
