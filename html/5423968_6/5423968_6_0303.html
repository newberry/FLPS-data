   <p>With this issue we commence the publication of a new weekly in Chicago under the name of Przebudzenie.</p>
   <p>Although there are three dailies and two weeklies in our metropolis, we sincerely believe that there is a great need for a journal which would provide the half million Polish population here with honest and frank informations on the most vital problems of our immigration in America.</p>
   <p>A journal which would discard the methods of informing the public falsely because of some "diplomatic" reasons. That kind of journal will be Przebudzenie.</p>
   <p>Przebudzenie will firmly guard our national spirit. We will discuss all problems of our cultural, social and religious life in the light of truth and progress. Przebudzenie will be non-partisan, but will promote the <span class="page-break">\2</span>individual efforts towards the welfare of all of us.</p>
   <p>In social problems our attitude will always be based on justice, and decided pressure will be put on the most vital questions and needs of our immigration.</p>
   <p>In our attitude towards our new fatherland, we will distinguish between Americanization and "Irishization." While the proper and natural task of Americanization is to direct our efforts for the welfare of our new fatherland, the "Irishization" reveals a quite distinct tendency to utilize us as a fertilizer for the degenerate national Irish organism.</p>
