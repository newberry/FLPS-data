   <p>We are going to say nothing about the death benefit, the first of a twelve-point program arranged by the censor of the Polish National Alliance for the coming convention. This matter is primarily an internal function of the organization and concerns us not at all. However, it must be admitted that [failure of] a successful solution of this problem would result in further losses for the Alliance as an insurance association with a relatively small number of Polish youth, who joined it to save the society of old invalids from bankruptcy. This end is inevitable because of the ever increasing death-benefit claims and the growth of sick benefits being paid to those who are ill or unfit for work.</p>
   <p>And now let us focus our attention on the second point, which deals with the proposition of publishing Dziennik Narodowy (National Daily). This project <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>was recently discussed in the columns of Zgoda (Harmony) and other Polish American newspapers. The result of this journalistic discussion was such that the Zgoda has denounced the plan; however, some of the patriotic knights, including some editors, have sharpened their pencils for action upon the ungrateful whetstone of patriotism without religion and beautiful worthless phrases. Such persons desire to grow fat at the expense of the treasury of the Polish National Alliance and are little concerned whether the proposed daily is going to be a success or a failure; whether it is necessary or not; whether it is going to damage or exhaust completely the treasury of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>That complete ruin is facing it, is a matter that we don't doubt in the least. Proof of this is the publication of Zgoda, a venture that has been consuming large sums of money from the very start and has failed to win a following for the newspaper, whose unpatriotic pages not only come out after great difficulty but are also pointless. Today the Alliance members are still <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>reluctant to read Zgoda, although they pay for its subscription. Its income is so small it is not worth mentioning. Conditions there are probably comparable to those of the Independent newspapers. [Newspapers connected with the Independent Church movement--independent of the Pope]. The instigators are rather noisy but lack the power to reason. It seems that these newspapers get along somehow even if they are not read.</p>
   <p>Conditions are worse among the dailies, whose future depends upon many years of experience and a large capital, as for example, in our case. How many dailies have already failed, causing bankruptcy to many of their publishers? Our Polish dailies did not rise to their present status suddenly, and they were established in communities where no competition existed. The Milwaukee Kuryer (Courier) rose upon the ruins of several weeklies, and at the beginning it was very small in size. It was published in a town where the small Orzel Polski [Polish Eagle] gave it so much competition that it would have folded up had it not been for the official advertising it received, without which it <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>could not exist today, for if it would cease to be Catholic it would cease to be Polish.</p>
   <p>We don't know whether or not the Polak w Ameryce [Pole in America] brings a profit to its publishers. We do know that until recently it was published three times a week and that now it is a daily. And this in the city of Buffalo, where the subversive Echo is a competitor.</p>
   <p>Our Dziennik Chicagoski did not grow overnight. The Polish Publishing Company had to experiment for many years, gradually working up from the weekly Wihra i Ojczyzna [Faith and Fatherland]. When business interests had been expanded, it was decided to venture upon a daily publication. This attempt was graced with marked success. Dziennik Chicagoski has grown upon a solid foundation and has no competition because it leans upon the immovable rock of religion and nationality, treats all parties impartially, looks after the best interest of every faction, does not favor one organization at the expense <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>of another, and serves the interest of all.</p>
   <p>What kind of competition did the late Dziennik Polski (Polish Daily) give the Dziennik Chicagoski? It expired in less than a year after a waste of $20,000. What kind of competition will Dziennik Narodowy give us, unless it will try to spoil everything that is Polish, Catholic, and true? We will defeat it by the force of our arguments, not deeming if necessary to increase the size of our newspaper or reduce its subscription and advertising rates. Instead of publishing Dziennik Chicagoski in the afternoon, we are free to have it out in the streets in the morning, if it is necessary, or twice a day for that matter. This will be of better advantage to us, and what will happen to our liberal competitor?</p>
   <p>Applying some common sense, it is safe to wager ten to one that no Polish daily will be able to compete with Dziennik Chicagoski. That being the case, will there be a person willing to invest his money for a new daily in Chicago?</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>If not, why then does the censor of the Polish National Alliance have this project in mind, when he knows full well that as an insurance organization the association he heads has no right to speculate?</p>
   <p>The censor's project in this case seems to be an attempt at tapping the Alliance treasury for personal gain. This is how the situation presents itself to us and many other persons of sound reasoning, with whom we had an opportunity to discuss the question of the Dziennik Narodowy.</p>
   <p>As to the moral motives of the group of Polish National Alliance members who are supporting the project of establishing a new daily for the purpose of sowing winds and gathering storms, we wish to remain silent. There will be such persons at the coming Polish National Alliance convention as will take up this matter properly.</p>
