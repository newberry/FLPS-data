   <p>We are here. We live. We speak. We are going ahead.</p>
   <p>We have begun our work in the name of God. We are ready for the fight.</p>
   <p>We extend our greetings to the four million Poles in America. We greet cordially the hundred thousand members of our Polish Roman-Catholic Union. We render homage to the Republic of Poland.</p>
   <p>We ask the Polish clergy, Polish cultured groups, Polish youth, the whole Polish community, for their cooperation in our constructive work.</p>
   <p>The questions are: Why are we here? Whither are we going? What battle are we going to fight? What work have we begun? Same as any other newspaper.</p>
   <p>The Polish Union Daily must describe its program, reveal its purpose, <span class="page-break">\2</span>so the public will know with whom it deals. We are in a better situation than many newspapers, because the public knows us. The ideals of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, the publisher of this paper, are not strange to any one. The ideals of our organization are closely connected with the ideals of the Polish Union Daily; we will not abandon them, but spread them among the masses and make them more prominent.</p>
   <p>We are here because such is the will of the public expressed at the conventions of our organization. We are here to spread enlightenment among the people, to serve with good advice, to unite, to create national strength. We are here to spread the doctrine of mutual aid, to inform others what is going on in the world, to encourage good work in the nation, to propagate healthy democratic principles and to make good citizens for this country.</p>
   <p>And, will we go?</p>
   <p>Yes! We will follow the straight and narrow road. No partisan influence.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>No personal interests, and no promises of the enemies shall change our course. We are with the people and for the people.</p>
   <p>There is a great field for a Polish Catholic newspaper. There are many neglected Polish settlements. Our young generation is cared for by people of other nationalities, and they present our case in a bad light; they split us into small parties. Our Catholic camp is not united. There is too much jealousy and hatred among us, too much artifice. We complain about the Catholic strength, but at the same time we are weakening it by our separated, egoistical action. All that should be counteracted. We will go to all Polish homes, to the old and the young. We desire to establish friendship with all American Poles. We are not in political business. We do not worship false gods. We stand by that which is good.</p>
   <p>We said that we are ready for the fight. What fight? This is interesting. We are to unite and join together on one side, and fight on the other. Perhaps this needs some explanation.</p>
   <p>In order to accomplish something good, it is necessary to remove all <span class="page-break">\4</span>obstacles. In other words, if one decides to unite society, he must first remove everything that leads towards disruption. We intend to do the same thing. We will oppose all egoism and all subversion in order to bring a cooperation in the desired direction. With what means we shall fight the evil only future can tell. To be sure, we will not use any unfair methods. We will adopt Christian principles in our dealings. We would rather fight with a good example than with a sword.</p>
   <p>Our masterpiece will be a great Polish Catholic newspaper in America, very popular, will read and properly understood. We will endeavor to improve this masterpiece every day. It would be impossible to occupy at once the height which we intend to attain. Anyhow, we are putting out a newspaper which is equal to any Polish newspaper and better than some of them. In other words, we are creating a masterpiece which all members of our Polish Roman-Catholic Union may be proud of.</p>
   <p>We cannot present our whole program here. We will do this every day.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Every word, every sentence appearing in our columns will be the expression of our program. Therefore, we ask you to read it every day. Let our newspaper be a permanent guest in every Polish Catholic home.</p>
   <p>We are entering into the field of journalism with great faith in our success and the future. We anticipate and hope for the help of God and good people. Onward with faith is our slogan.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Zjednoczenia (Polish Union Daily) is a non-partisan newspaper in respect to America and Poland.</p>
   <p>What is the meaning of this? It means that the actions of the publisher are not controlled by any political party. The Polish Union Daily is and will be an impartial newspaper. It does not depend on either the Republican or Democratic parties in America. It has its own judgment of their actions and will support any party whenever it sees fit to do so.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>However, this does not mean that the Polish Union Daily will not be interested in the political affairs of American parties. Indeed, it will report everything of interest that is going on, so its readers can form their own opinions. The same attitude will be held in regard to the political parties in Poland. The Polish Union Daily is not and will not be controlled by any political party of Poland.</p>
   <p>We have explained our non-partisanship.</p>
