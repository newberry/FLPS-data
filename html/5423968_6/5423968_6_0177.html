   <p>The Catholic Book Store and the Polish Publishing Company gave from twenty-five to fifty per cent discount on all book purchases.</p>
   <p>Sincere thanks are extended to all kind contributors for their offerings and an appeal is made for further donations.</p>
   <p>As in the past, so in the future, the Educational Department will make every effort to carry out the task it undertook last March, and an appeal is made for material assistance, for without this assistance it is impossible to make any headway.</p>
   <p>Hope is expressed that all those who feel concern for their fellow man will support this work and will contribute, and thereby will make it possible to erect a permanent educational institution, work on which was started earlier this year.</p>

   <p>In the name of the Educational Department.</p>
   <p>Reverend J. Kasprzycki, vice-president,</p>
   <p>I. Kowalski, secretary,</p>
