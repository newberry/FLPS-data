   <p>Thanks to the efforts of Reverend Pawlikowski and the committee of Holy Cross Parish in Bridgeport, a public reading room for the perusal of Polish and Lithuanian newspapers will be opened next week for the parishioners and general public. A large number of members of the Polish National Alliance is grouped about this parish, and, therefore, the new reading room will also serve as a gathering place for them.</p>
