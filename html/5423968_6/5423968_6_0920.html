   <p>A benefit dance sponsored by the St. Stanislaus Kostka's College Alumni association will be held January 10 at Guyon's Paradise ballroom, Crawford Avenue and Washington Boulevard. The proceeds of the dance are to go toward the school fund.</p>
   <p>The dance committee has arranged a variety of entertainment. It is their contention that no one attending the dance will regret it. They claim that this is one of their finest affairs. Judging from past performances, a treat is in store for everyone.</p>
   <p>Tickets are $1.00 per couple. They may be obtained at the offices of the Dziennik Chicagoski, from any Alumni member, or at the College headquarters.</p>
   <p>This dance is worthy of your support.</p>
