   <p>In addition to the material for our recent article on the results of the examinations held by the Sisters of Nazareth High School, we have received the following correspondence:</p>
   <p>"You have often published articles about the Sisters of Nazareth High School on Division Street, Chicago.</p>
   <p>"We do not know whether these articles have convinced our Polish people of the necessity for such an institution. At any rate, today, after the examinations just completed, and convinced of the wonderful results the school has achieved, we feel it advisable to bring once again to the attention of all Poles the importance of this matter.</p>
   <p>"We speak much of the value of education, and would like to do wonders; we wish our youth the greatest degree of enlightenment; we want to inculcate in it the spirit of the pioneer, hewing his way to greater knowledge and self-respect; we wish to perpetuate the Polish spirit.</p>
   <p>"We find all this in the Sisters of Nazareth High School.</p>
   <p>"How the heart rejoices at the sight of these young people imbued with the true Polish spirit; the pleasant and melodious sound of the Polish language can be heard from the classrooms. The listener just naturally knows he is in a Polish school.</p>
   <p>"The pronunciation of the Polish language is pure; the knowledge of the history of our fathers and forefathers is excellent; our native literature is known here as thoroughly as the catechism.</p>
   <p>"We find it necessary at times to ask: How was it possible, in these hard and difficult times, for the Sisters to have been able to instill and keep up this Polish spirit so successfully? There can be but one answer to this question: It is the result of the labors of our reverend Sisters.</p>
   <p>"We are very sorry that only a small proportion of our Polish people take advantage of this institution, which surely deserves the support of everybody. Those who send their children here, we are sure, are not sorry and see for themselves the fruits of the teachings of the Sisters.</p>
   <p>"In writing these few remarks, we do not in the least wish to minimize the good work of the parochial schools, no matter under whose direction, because they are equally as good and important; we merely wish to emphasize that the Sisters of Nazareth School is a high school, and the only one of its kind, and that the Polish children here are taught in the Polish spirit. And certainly, we wish to perpetuate this spirit, because it is a guarantee that our nationality will not die.</p>
   <p>"We therefore urge the wealthier Poles to send their children to this institution instead of sending them elsewhere, and they will never regret it. They will be repaid a hundredfold.</p>
   <p>"Committee."</p>
