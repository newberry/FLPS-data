   <p>We received the following letter for publication from Zbigniew Brodowski:</p>
   <p>"I have read the two notices published in your paper by Mr. J. Rogosz, well-known Polish novelist and journalist. These notices concerned the projected publication of Wielka Ksiega Narodu Polskiego[Book of the Polish Nation] , which is to contain all of our cultural and historical treasures--a memorial to our work, our creative efforts, and our honor. I am willing to admit that this project, so splendidly described by Mr. Rogosz, aroused my enthusiasm.</p>
   <p>"A work of this kind would certainly take its place in Polish literature if only it were executed along the proposed lines. It will be our pride and the pride of our children--a handbook from which we and our posterity can learn of our nation's moral and cultural activities. Everything that is beautiful and praiseworthy in our past and present will undoubtedly <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>find a place in this book, which will teach our children, in Poland as well as here in America, of the greatness of our nation. Such a book should be in daily use in Polish homes; it should become a textbook teaching patriotism and faith in our nation's future.</p>
   <p>"The Book, then, will deserve recognition and support on the basis of its own merits. It is the more deserving of our support in that Mr. Rogosz promises to devote the last volume to a history of Polish culture in America; thus, in this way, our deeds and efforts will be perpetuated in the pages of a memorable work.</p>
   <p>"What does he ask of us? Our support. In my opinion, he has every right to demand our support. A work of such scope and importance as the Book of the Polish Nation is even more necessary to us than to the people in Poland. There, among their own people, on Polish soil, the past and its contributions are brought to mind by numerous historical relics, crosses and graves, churches and old castles, names of places, traditions and folk songs. The fields of Grunwald, Raclawice, Grochow, the walls of nn, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Warsaw, and other fortresses all bespeak the past; museums and schools tell of the present. Here in America, we can only have memories of these places and things that are dear to us. Our children, raised here on foreign soil, never saw them; they are not familiar with our folk lore and songs. Here, in America, such a book will be of tremendous service; it will place before the eyes of the younger generation all those things which the older people cannot portray in words. And so, since we have the most to gain from this memorable work, we should be the first to support it.</p>
   <p>"Another reason why this duty rests with us is that our American Polonia enjoys conditions of unrestricted freedom which permit it to support a project of this kind. The Poles in Russian-occupied Poland, if they are to read the Book at all, will have to do it in secrecy, thus making it impossible to count upon their support. There remain only Galicia[Austrian occupation] , Poznan[German occupation] , and ourselves. Let us take up and fulfill the duty which so logically rests upon our shoulders.</p>
   <p>"You may ask: How may Mr. Rogosz' project be supported? The answer is <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>quite simple. Mr. Rogosz does not ask for money in advance. Since he represents a reliable publishing house, since he has worked efficiently for many years in the literary field, he asks for no special trust, no advances. He asks only that we guarantee him eight hundred to fifteen hundred subscriptions to the Book. The million odd Poles in America should be able to do this. When the work is published, when the first installments reach us, then will we pay. Today we need only to assure him of our support. We must make up a list of those who are willing to contribute to the realization of this great work.</p>
   <p>"This is the duty of every Pole who can afford it. I have hopes that none of us will neglect it; from the bottom of my heart, I urge everyone to discharge himself of this duty.</p>
   <p>Chicago, January 11, 1893."</p>
