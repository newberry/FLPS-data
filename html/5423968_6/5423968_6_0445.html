   <p>As president of the Polish National Alliance, for some time past I have been the object of attacks by Mr. Michael Kruszka, publisher of Kuryer Polski of Milwaukee. Other publications have been repeating these attacks, sowing the seeds of hatred of my person among their readers, frequently members of the Polish National Alliance, creating distrust of my activities as duly constituted officer of the organization, elected at the twenty-first convention of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>I pass over all personal attacks and malicious insinuations which have appeared and continue to appear in letters from Chicago, written for the most part by members of the Alliance or people working in the Alliance Building, because these cannot affect me. I must, however, as president of the Polish National Alliance, call your attention to those things which might hurt the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Alliance if I were to keep silent about them, namely, the reasons which cause the Kuryer Polski to hurl itself at the Alliance and at my insignificant person.</p>
   <p>These reasons can best be explained to you, fellow Alliance members, by a letter written by Mr. Michael Kruszka to Mr. J. J. Chrzanowski, editor in chief of Dziennik Narodowy and former director of the Polish National Alliance, of which I am enclosing a photostatic copy in order to prove its authenticity.</p>
   <p>I have had this letter in my possession for a long time, but I did not want to make use of it. When, however, Mr. Michael Kruszka's attacks against the Alliance and myself began to exceed all bounds of decency, I decided to make use of this document. I announced my intention to the members of the Central Board of Directors. At one of the meetings of the Central Board of Directors of the Polish National Alliance I announced that Mr. Kruszka would be very <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>favorably disposed toward our organization, and that all its officers would be angels in his eyes, if we were to discontinue publishing Dziennik Zwiazkowy, which is a thorn in his side.</p>
   <p>In reply to this statement, which was published among the official minutes in Zgoda, Mr. M. Kruszka published an article on January 20 entitled "President [Casimir] Zychlinski and His Evidence," in which he challenged me "to publish in the very next issue of Dziennik Zwiazkowy" this letter, but complete from beginning to end, including the date, the address, the body of the letter, and the signature, and other evidence, concerning which he stated that he would reserve his comments for the future. (See Kurjer Polski of Sunday, January 21, 1917.)</p>
   <p>Since I am not too prone to obey commands of this sort, even if they be dictated by Mr. Kruszka himself, I let this article pass in silence, just as I <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>had allowed many others to pass before. This evidently must have reassured Mr. Kruszka that I really did not possess such a letter, and on January 28--that is, a week later--the publisher of Kurjer Polski repeated his request for the publication of this letter, writing in his article, entitled "Mania for Falsifying Everything," as follows:</p>
   <p>"A week ago the publisher of Kuryer [Polski] challenged Mr. Zychlinski to publish word for word the letter containing this "terrible plot."</p>
   <p>"But the president remains silent!</p>
   <p>"Why?</p>
   <p>"Because he does not possess such a letter!</p>
   <p>"The publisher of Kuryer [Polski] has never written anything in any letters <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>which has not been published in Kuryer repeatedly. Therefore, that which the letter contained could be no secret nor any sort of plot."</p>
   <p>Furthermore, judging on the basis of these opinions, Mr. Kruszka reaches the following conclusions:</p>
   <p>"1) Either Mr. Zychlinski has no letter and for the hundredth time maliciously announces lies about Mr. Kruszka;</p>
   <p>"2) Or he has falsified some sort of letter and signature--such as some sort of official minutes--and is afraid of being caught in the forgery.</p>
   <p>"One cannot judge otherwise from his actions."</p>
   <p>Thus did Mr. M. Kruszka, model of all civic virtues and of the honesty of all <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>public figures, speak on January 28.</p>
   <p>It is to prove exactly this that I am today enclosing the letter of Mr. Michael Kruszka in its entirety, together with the envelope, heading, and body, from beginning to end, with the personal signature of Mr. Michael Kruszka, which is surely known to everybody, in order to prove who is telling the truth and who is audaciously denying it.</p>
   <p>Judge all this for yourselves, fellow Alliance members, and pronounce your sentence. When you are convinced as to who is honest and who really has the good of the Alliance at heart, after having become thoroughly familiar with the motives of the so-called "defenders of the interests of the members of the Alliance," read the attacks which will appear in Kuryer Polski with intelligence and understanding. You will then really understand these protectors of the Alliance's interests, who, unasked by anyone, insist on <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>appointing themselves guardians of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>With fraternal regards,</p>
   <p>Casimir Zychlinski.</p>
   <p>"President of the</p>
   <p>Polish National Alliance."</p>

   <p>[Official letterhead of Kuryer Publishing Company]</p>
   <p>Milwaukee, Wisconsin,</p>
   <p>March 23, 1915.</p>
   <p>Dear Mr. Chrzanowski:</p>
   <p>I have learned that certain people in Dziennik Narodowy (and naturally certain gentlemen in Dziennik Zwiazkowy) look upon our Kuryer Niedzielny [Sunday Courier] with great disfavor.</p>
   <p>Evidently these gentlemen do not see what is going on about them, nor <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>do they understand the situation.</p>
   <p>In the first place Kuryer Niedzielny is not intended to be a competitor of Dziennik Narodowy or Dziennik Zwiazkowy, but merely a supplement to Polish national journalism. If we wanted to create competition for Dziennik Narodowy or Dziennik Zwiazkowy, we would send packages of the daily Kuryer to Chicago. But we are not doing this. I would not permit this to be done, because I would not want to cause both the national dailies competition.</p>
   <p>A Sunday edition is another matter entirely. I do not believe that either Dziennik Narodowy or Dziennik Zwiazkowy will ever come out regularly on Sunday. But I do believe this, because I have heard it from authoritative sources, that the Resurrection Fathers intend publishing a Sunday edition. In that event the readers of Dziennik Narodowy would <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>be left without a Sunday paper, if the Sunday Kuryer did not step in to fill the gap.</p>
   <p>Secondly, there are things about which neither Dziennik Narodowy nor Dziennik Zwiazkowy can write under their present publishers, even if need for this were to arise in the Narodowy camp. Kuryer, on the other hand, is so situated that it can write whatever it sees fit. And although sometimes it might even criticize certain Polish leaders, even this fact has its good points, because then the reading public is convinced that Kuryer is impartial, and therefore when it severely chastises the opponents of the Narodowy camp it has a sufficient reason for so doing.</p>
   <p>We surely need not tell you, sir, that we make nothing on the Sunday Kuryer which we send to Chicago, and we would not make anything on it <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>even if we had a good many advertisements. But I am not nearly so interested in making a profit in Chicago as I am in keeping up the Narodowy camp's prestige, which, as you yourself will admit, has decreased considerably in recent times through flirting with the clerical camp, which has always been false to the Narodowy camp, always aiming at returning the Narodowy camp to the clerical yoke.</p>
   <p>At any rate the Sunday Kuryer in Chicago will continue, no matter what it may cost us. And we will not retreat before those who want to injure us by underhanded methods. Naturally, I do not have in mind anyone from Dziennik Narodowy or Dziennik Zwiazkowy, only someone else of whom it is said that it was he who stole the packages of the Sunday Kuryer a week ago. When we have more substantial evidence, we will prosecute him.</p>
   <p>So much for the Sunday Kuryer.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>Now for the problem of Dziennik Narodowy's relation to Dziennik Zwiazkowy and to yourself.</p>
   <p>I had supposed,sir, that you had agreed to accept office in order to see to the balancing of the Polish National Alliance's budget. I believe that the office workers there are trying to hang on to their jobs tooth and nail. But if the Alliance (or the Board of Directors) wants to gain greater trust and the support of other newspapers, it will have to discontinue Dziennik Zwiazkowy, and return to the state which existed at the time of and following the establishment of Dziennik Narodowy, that is, to have Dziennik Narodowy, with its moral support, as its semiofficial organ. During that time Kuryer and all the other Polish papers supported the Alliance unconditionally. The irritation and the perfectly natural bias developed only after the Dziennik Zwiazkowy began to be published and [Thomas] Siemiradzki [editor of Dziennik Zwiazkowy] announced that he would put all the other Polish newspapers in America out of <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>business. From that time on Dziennik Zwiazkowy was the thorn in the side of all the other newspapers, besides being a constant drain on the Alliance treasury. And thus it will continue as long as Dziennik Zwiazkowy remains in existence.</p>
   <p>I believe that you too share my point of view. Besides, the interest of Dziennik Narodowy demands that such a change for the better take place.</p>
   <p>I have heard that you were here Sunday, but you did not call on me or let me know of your visit. Why?</p>
   <p>Wishing you the best of luck--and the election of a better censor--I remain,</p>
   <p>Respectfully and cordially yours,</p>
   <p>Michael Kruszka</p>
