   <p>The new Sunday edition of the Dziennik Chicagoski made its appearance yesterday for the first time.</p>
   <p>Although the first attempt in this new field is always coupled with difficulties in the editorial as well as in the administrative departments and, as in this case, in distribution, our first endeavor managed to overcome these difficulties in time so that the paper was able to appear on the streets as scheduled.</p>
   <p>We are proud to announce, from the publication point of view, that our Sunday edition was a real success. Thousands of copies were distributed all over Chicago. And even today many have inquiries about the Sunday number and purchased copies.</p>
   <p>Many letters have been received by our office commending us for our efforts.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Such response makes this new venture in Sunday publication a certainty.</p>
   <p>It is not for us to extol the value of this new issue. Suffice it to say that it has some merit. We wish to point out, however, that we have found a number of errors in this first Sunday issue, mistakes that cannot be separated from an initial attempt. But we can make certain that these mistakes will be eliminated in the future. Efforts will be made to make the Sunday editions more interesting and appealing to our readers.</p>
   <p>Apologies are offered for the mistakes that were overlooked in composition, and also because of difficulties in the printing department, which were caused by shortage of time, many issues were not made according to our expectations. All these minor errors will be overcome.</p>
