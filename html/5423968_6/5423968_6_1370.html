   <p>We have received a copy of the Polonia and find in it an article that objects to the admission of the "independent" group from Cleveland as members of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The editors of Polonia, along with our editorial department, condemns acceptance of the "Progressive" group, headed by Kolaszewski and others, into the Polish National Alliance, and adds:</p>
   <p>"Vice Censor Ladislas Welzant protests against the admission of this group of independents and appeals to all good thinking members who are concerned about the future growth of the organization to make a strong and solid protest against this move."</p>

   <p>In this respect Polonia promises more detailed information.</p>
   <p>We will publish this additional protest for the good of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
