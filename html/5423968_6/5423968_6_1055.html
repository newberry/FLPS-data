   <p>Dr. Anna Wyczotkowski will lecture on The Rights of Women in the United States, on Friday, Aug. 4th., at 7 P.M. The lecture will be held at the large settlement hall, corner of Augusta and Noble Streets. All women interested in the subject of this lecture, regardless of the fact whether they wish to belong to the women's movement or not, are invited, and will be welcome. Such a lecture is not only interesting and educational, but also necessary, on account of the comments in the press which are quite often misleading. Dr. Wyczotkowski promised to give also a lecture on women's solidarity. There will be a discussion after the lecture.</p>
