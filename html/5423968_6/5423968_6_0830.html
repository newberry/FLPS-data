   <p>We have before us the first issue of a new publication for Polish-American youth. Its title is Przyjaciel Mlodziezy (Youth's Friend) and it will be published weekly in Chicago. This new paper contains eight pages of unusual interest. The subscription price is one dollar a year or two cents a copy.</p>
   <p>The publisher is Reverend John Piechowski, Hoyne and Webster Avenues, Chicago.</p>
   <p>We have thoroughly digested the news in this first issue and we can safely say that it is an excellent piece of reading matter. Religion is its foundation. The Przyjaciel Mlodziezy ardently desires to bring good to the young Polish people; it tries to teach them to love God and the fatherland, and to live a Christian life and work for the ideals of the Polish nation.</p>

   <p>The first page is beautifully made up. Its illustrations are both artistic and interesting (one of them is reprinted in this issue) [a picture of St. Hedwig drawn by T. Zukotynski].</p>
   <p>The illustrations were drawn by our own local artist, Thaddeus Zukotynski. The publisher's note explains the meaning of the picture of St. Hedwig which will stand as a symbol of the paper. Other articles of interest are "The Word of a Priest", by Reverend Dr. B. and "Our Faith."</p>
   <p>We wish all the luck in the world to this new publication which is so necessary for our youth.</p>
