   <p>To all Polish Business in the United States:</p>
   <p>In connection with our newspaper it is our earnest desire that all our members support all Polish business as well as defend all matters pertaining to our organization, the Polish Roman Catholic Union which is Catholic and the oldest organization in the United States. Our organ is received and read by more than 10,000 members here in America and other parts of the world.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the editor of our newspaper offers a proposition and also a request that all business people support our organ, by advertising their business in our paper. American business is spending millions of dollars in American newspapers to advertise their business and it is very evident that this advertising must be profitable or they would not continue.</p>
   <p>So this appeal is made to the Polish business men in order that their business may flourish and prosper but that our newspaper may increase its circulation. The Polish people have under this new arrangement of committees at least one representative in eleven wards.</p>
