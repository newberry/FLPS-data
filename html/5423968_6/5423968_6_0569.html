   <p>The Dziennik Polski, after calling practically all of the Polish pastors in Chicago robbers, again goes into its immodest song and dance, attacking, in yesterday's issue, the Reverend Francis Lange, pastor of St. Josaphat's parish, using such vile epithets as robber, swindler, liar, etc.</p>
   <p>We urge the Dziennik Polski to write a few more libelous articles of the same sort. The Polish people are gradually seeing the light, and when they finally see through this affair, they will take care of defamers without a trial.</p>
   <p>Such systematic attacks on the financial condition of the parishes, where honesty rules, is scandalous. Wherever there appears to be a parish debt, they accuse either the priest or the archbishop of stealing the funds.</p>
   
   <p>Churches and schools purchased, for cash paid in advance, the building lots mentioned, and it would seem that the greater part of this cash was contributed by make-believe patrons and shysters, according to the writers of the Dziennik Polski.</p>
   <p>There surely can be no greater crime committed against our Polish people than continually to incite our parishioners against the Polish priests. Who will substitute for the fortresses of Polish nationalism, if our churches and schools fail financially? Maybe the Dziennik Polski will.</p>
