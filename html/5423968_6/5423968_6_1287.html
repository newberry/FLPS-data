   <p>The last issue of Zgoda is appealing to the Polish press to take up the matter of erecting a monument of Gen. Casimir Pulaski and to explain to all groups and associations that only throughout united action will it be able to influence the government to build this monument.</p>
   <p>The Central Committee of the Polish Roman Catholic Union has sent form letters to different groups and they in turn, and according to the instructions, have sent them to their congressmen. The Central Committee is already receiving letters from the congressmen with their assurances that this project has their cooperation and full support.</p>
   <p>If the groups in the parishes have not yet received the printed circulars pertaining to this matter they are urged to immediately ask Mr. Krolik, general secretary, for them, and they will be sent to them without delay.</p>
