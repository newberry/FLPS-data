   <p>The Polish National Alliance's censor official critic has made the following statement regarding the proposed high school of the Alliance:</p>
   <p>"In view of the fact that the high school fund has reached a substantial amount we can now realize our plan by establishing the institution itself. If the 19th convention of the Polish National Alliance, after getting acquainted with the work of the school commission, comes to the conclusion that the time for carrying out the plan is ripe, we must not lower the special assessments or discontinue donations for the Polish National Alliance school.</p>
   <p>"It would be altogether unnecessary to enlarge any further on the necessity and usefulness of such an institution. This matter has been given consideration in at least three conventions and gained additional support every <span class="page-break">2</span>year among the members of the Alliance, and today it would be impossible to find a member who would oppose this proposition.</p>
   <p>"Today the realization of the Polish national high school is only a question of time - and money."</p>
   <p>Analyzing the censor's recommendation we can readily see that he is not in favor of the immediate erection of a school with the funds already accumulated. He does not care whether a school, much as the Polish National Alliance can afford now, is erected today or tomorrow, he would rather see a large up-to-date institution, equipped with all modern needs.</p>
   <p>Whether the school should be built now or later on, when more funds are available, will be decided by the convention and not by the censor; he does not wish to force his opinion upon this important matter.</p>
   <p>The censor is right. Only the convention can decide whether this first <span class="page-break">3</span>institution of learning of the Polish National Alliance, devoted to higher studies, should begin on a small scale and grow gradually, or whether it should appear in the form of an imposing structure.</p>
   <p>We should bear in mind that the requirements of a high school are altogether different than those of a common elementary school, which can be organized at any time and in any manner. An institution of higher learning has many requirements and they must be met at its beginning; otherwise it could not compete with other similar institutions which are well established.</p>
   <p>Such a school must be built in a healthy and beautiful location and on a large tract of land, not very for from a large or middle-sized city inhabited by many Poles; it must have a good transportation, gas, electricty, its own post office station, and other modern conveniences.</p>
   <p>The school building should be estimated and designed with the express purpose of housing a large student body and members of the faculty.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Such a school should also have a library, a chemical laboratory equipped with necessary apparatus, a machine shop, a gymnasium and other necessary departments.</p>
   <p>These things are indispensable in a first class institution, otherwise it will not appeal to the public.</p>
   <p>The censor knows this and for this reason he favors special assessments.</p>
   <p>A special assessment is necessary, not only for the purpose of providing a building fund, but also as an endowment of the institution.</p>
   <p>A higher institution of learning accepting indigent pupils cannot be supported solely from the tuition fees during the first few years. By accepting a very low tuition fee which our public can afford to pay and by lowering it for the very poor, the income from this source will not cover the expenses. Only after many years, when the number of students will <span class="page-break">5</span>reach a thousand or more, will the institution be able to support itself. If the members of the Polish National Alliance have decided to give the Poles living in America a first Polish high school, free from any outside influence, they should be prepared to regard this as a serious obligation, and present the public with something that will answer the purpose.</p>
   <p>There are no millionaires among the Polish element in America, who could donate a bag of gold to such an institution, as Mr. Rockefeller does. But a hundred thousand people can accomplish by small donations that what millionaires do by giving millions of dollars; and sometimes the people can accomplish it even better.</p>
   <p>Let us keep this small assessment for the upkeep of the best cause our immigration in America has, namely for education and enlightment.</p>
   <p>Let us save on something else - on entertainments and other enjoyments - and give our people an institution from which will come great men, protectors of our race.</p>
