   <p>The Reverend Leon Paul Szybowicz, Assistant Rector of Holy Trinity Parish, presented the Museum of the Polish National Alliance with a notable gift. The contribution was in the form of forty-five pieces of coin from the countries of Poland, Germany, Russia, Austria, China, France, and the United States. The coins, although some of them are very old, are well preserved. There are real antiques in the group which possess a high value, and they will constitute a valuable souvenir for our Museum. Sincere gratitude is due the Reverend Szybowicz for his priceless gift. An itemized list of the gift received will be presented later by the directors of the Library and Museum of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
