   <p>Last Sunday, January 19, the pastor, Reverend [Adolph] Nowicki, donated his library under the protection of St. John Cantius to the Kosciusko Society library. The administrations of all the Polish societies in the parish were present at the ceremonial that joined these two libraries.</p>
   <p>Praise be to you, esteemed priest and patriot! Would that God gave us similar peace and co-operation in all our Polish communities, as the Poles of South Chicago are justly proud of.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Thaddeus Kosciusko Society, we extend a hearty, old-fashioned God Bless You to Reverend Nowicki.</p>
