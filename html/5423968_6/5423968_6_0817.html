   <p>The Dziennik Zwiazkowy has received the first edition of a new Polish weekly known as Narodowiec (The Nationalist), edited in Cleveland, Ohio. The publisher and editor of this periodical is Mr. S. Dangiel, an arduous and well-known worker in behalf of the Polish National Alliance, and former manager of many Alliance newspapers. The Dziennik Zwiazkowy hereby extends its sincere congratulations to its brother member, Mr. Dangiel, in his endeavors.</p>
   <p>The city of Cleveland, with its thirty groups affiliated with the Polish National Alliance, a municipality possessing numerous capable, energetic people who are loyal to the Alliance, is quickly gaining recognition as one of the outstanding centers of our organization. Formerly it only lacked a good local periodical that would work for the cause of the Alliance. This need has now been satisfied.</p>
   
   <p>The entire staff of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, together with all the members of the Polish National Alliance, wishes success to the Narodowiec. Success will undoubtedly be attained, if the first edition is to serve as a norm. It is also hoped that our fellow members of the Polish National Alliance will co-operate in the efforts of this new periodical.</p>
