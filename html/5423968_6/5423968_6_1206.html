   <p>On the 17th of this month, the delegates of the Polish Falcons gathered in Chicago and decided to take energetic steps to encourage the establishment of Polish Falcon organizations in every Polish community throughout the continent. In order that this important matter be thoroughly considered, the delegates decided to call a mass meeting of Polish Falcons for August 27, to which all well-wishing Poles are invited to attend. As a result of this decision, the following article, explaining the reasons for the mass meeting, was submitted for publication:</p>
   <p>"'A sound mind is a sound body'--this is the principle upon which all gymnastic and Falcon societies have been founded. The mind can be strong and active only if the body is strong and healthy. A deed conceived in the mind can only be executed by a strong, enduring hand. Thus, the body should be trained so that, through its physical strength and health, it may constitute the foundation for action. The aim of the Falcon organizations is to provide this training, but ordinarily they serve still another purpose--that of giving <span class="page-break">2</span>us a chance to work and struggle together. By bringing us together, they foster a greater sense of brotherhood among young men, binding them in friendship and teaching them discipline. 'Unity is life, disunity death' (Jeonosc zycie, smierc rozbicie), is the motto adopted by some of the Falcon nests.</p>
   <p>"It is needless to explain further the usefulness of Falconry. Its usefulness was well understood in Poland. In Galicia and Poznan [Austrian and German occupation respectively], wherever political conditions permitted, hundreds of Falcon nests have been organized--hundreds of Falcon banners unfurled. Solemn days such as those of the Falcon Jubilee in Lwow last year awaken and elevate the spirit; they strengthen the ties of brotherhood and tend to give the Falcons the character of a national organization. If this example is insufficient, let us look at the Bohemians and Germans. Hundreds of Falcon and other gymnastic organizations, both in Europe and in America, keep them physically fit and united in spirit.</p>
   <p>"Are we American Poles to remain forever in the background? Do the examples set by our brethren in Poland and by our Bohemian cousins mean nothing to us here in America? Does our own personal gain mean nothing to us?</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"No! We Poles, occupied with a desperate struggle for existence, perhaps do not lead in certain respects, but in this case, we can keep up with others. Here on American soil,....our physical development is probably more necessary than elsewhere--this is the principle upon which the Polish Falcons exist.</p>
   <p>"Let us therefore spread our wings in flight! Polish Falcon activities have already begun in Chicago, and though the number of Falcons is still small, there will be enough for a nest from which young Falcons will fly to settle in other cities and towns wherever Polish hearts beat, wherever the Polish language is spoken. It needs but ambition, work, and perserverance.</p>
   <p>"To form Falcon nests wherever any number of Poles live is not an impossibility.....A few dollars for gymnastic equipment; good will on the part of the youth, who instead of spending their time in saloons at immoral pastimes will find decent recreation and spiritual and physical gain in the Falcons' hall; a teacher or organizer, whom any existing Falcon nest can supply--this is all that is necessary for the creation of a new Falcon nest.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"Then, onward! In unity and with perserverance, we shall achieve our aims.</p>
   <p>"We are calling a meeting for the 27th of this month to talk over this matter. Let every Falcon, every well-wishing Pole attend and tell us what needs to be done to spread Polish Falconry from the Hudson to the Missouri......to make our youth strong, united, and ready for a struggle with the enemy, should occasion arise.</p>
   <p>"We trust that great numbers of our countrymen will attend this meeting, which will be held at Anthony Groenwald's hall, 668 Holt Street, corner Blackhawk, at 7:30 in the evening. The matter to be discussed is very important and should be the concern of everyone. Our future depends upon our Falcon organizations.</p>
