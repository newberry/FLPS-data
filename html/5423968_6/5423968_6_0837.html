   <p>We have received a copy of the first number of the new weekly Sztandar (Banner), which has just appeared in Chicago. The publisher and editor is Mr. J. I. Migdalski. The weekly is published in St. Adalbert Parish and will be the official organ of the Polish Roman Catholic Union under the protection of the Holy Mary of Czestochowa. The Sztandar will be published every Friday. Subscription is one dollar and fifty cents. The editor's address is 775 South Ashland Avenue.</p>
   <p>The first issue (sample issue) is quite imposing both as to the print and editorial matter. According to an announcement to the public, although the Sztandar will be primarily devoted to local matters, it will also support matters of general interest. Its aim is to unite the Poles in America. We wish this new paper success!</p>
