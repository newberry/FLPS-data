   <p>Baseball! baseball! that dynamic call, heard everywhere now that the season is here, has everyone agog from the lowly-paid clerk to the highest office holder in the land.</p>
   <p>And the Polish Roman Catholic Union of America is no exception to the rule. It could not hope to be excepted, for its fundamentals are American and baseball is as basically an American fundamental as is the Constitution of the United States. Perhaps it is even more so than that bill of rights of ours, for not even Landis, the great czar of baseball, could hope to violate the 18th Amendment to this fundamental sport. And as to those at the helm of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, and the bulk of the membership, this is not the first time they realize what a hold baseball has on them and on the American youth in general. They realized it long ago; in fact, knew it all along; but this is the first time that they really voice the idea and come to its aid.</p>
   <p>The result is the Polish Roman Catholic Union Commission of Sports and Youth. When President John J. Olejniczak, in carrying our the will of the last convention, appointed a Commission of nine to look after the needs of the youth within the organization, the move rejected like a cure-all or an intravenous <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>injection. The stimulant did more than stimulate, it released a dynamic force, as it were, that lay dormant for a long time in the hearts of the youth of the organization. North and South, East and West resounded with hurrahs for the Union. And the present drive for membership must acknowledge the fact, regardless of anyone's view on the matter, that the stimulant that the Sports Commission used contributed greatly to the barometer of membership which periodically adorns the pages of the Polish Union Daily, and Narod Polski (Polish Nation), a weekly.</p>
   <p>With the appointment of the Commission of Sports, additional pressure was felt from the youth of the organization. Mr. John Rostenkowski, son of Peter Rostenkowski, former president and treasurer of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, was named chairman of the Commission, being literally steeped to his ears in work. Mrs. Wlodarski, elected secretary of the Commission, shares the gigantic task of answering correspondence. Likesise, other members of the Commission are deluged with requests from thousands of sport organizations of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, scattered from coast to coast.</p>
   <p>The organization of sports clubs is but a minor matter; there is enough new material within the organization to form all sorts of clubs. There is also plenty of managerial talent. The duty of the commission is to supervise their organization and look after the job of financing these clubs and sports units. Finance is a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>small word. But as John Czech remarked in his summary, "the budget of the commission is as intricate a problem as the German debt question," to which it can be added that it is worse than the European tangle, for there at least is some money, while in the case of the Polish Roman Catholic Union the fund is limited and exceedingly shrunken.</p>
   <p>And yet, clubs all over the country must be supplied with uniforms; calls for financial aid are heard from all directions; persons, who know neither the meaning of sportsmanship nor the pleasure of indulging in it, spring up here and there and make the work of the commission still more difficult, yelling, "We want prizes, or we quit." Girls' clubs all over the country are beseeching the women members of the commission for money, aid, and prizes. Uniforms must come from this limited fund; one penny from each member was recommended by the last convention and so it was provided at subsequent deliberations.</p>
   <p>The Sport Commission and its troubles are analogous to the task of relieving the poor American farmer. We say the question of relief is but analogous, for there is no such thing as a poor American farmer in the strict sense of the word; if he is poor, it is because he is careless and brought this condition upon himself.</p>
   <p>And likewise with the question of sports in the Polish Roman Catholic Union; <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>if it is, or let us say, was impoverished as far as sports is concerned, it is so because the organization in the past brought about this condition upon itself. But again we say here comes the analogy of relief; relief can be given, but those seeking to bring about this relief cannot find adequate means to combat the forces that make relief necessary.</p>
   <p>The farmer is his country's provider; if the country is to subsist, it must keep the farmer, and even adopt, if necessary, relief measures to satisfy him in order to keep him on the farm and in order to make him realize the folly of his ego and of following unscrupulous methods. The youth of our organization is likewise our organization's provider, inasmuch as it is the future body of our organization; if the organization wants to subsist, it must keep the youth and adopt, if necessary, relief measures to satisfy it in order to keep it in the organization.</p>
   <p>But despite the gigantic task placed on the shoulders of the commission, sports in the organization bids fair. For you cannot get around a question which is in the blood of American youth, and which soon also penetrates the veins of those who come from abroad.</p>
   <p>Love of sport is ideal. It builds the sturdy body necessary to the sturdy soul.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>A country busy with sports has no time to devote to international cupidity or its offspring, intrigue.</p>
   <p>And, as the youth of the land is the one called upon to save their country, and not the corrupt and misshapen lobbyists and political perverts, so it is the youth in any organization that can preserve it, not the perennial and lukewarm patriots, no matter how big mouthed racketeers they might be.</p>
   <p>With the organization and its sports commission so weighed down with problems of cash, youth can come to the rescue immediately instead of saving its energy for posterity.</p>
   <p>There is the question of the journal. The journal is not a paying proposition; no American paper printed in a foreign language is. It is like an ideal, admirable but taxing. And youth can do its bit by patronizing, not slamming its organization's journal. It even behooves them to do so.</p>
   <p>No metropolitan paper will take pains to present the case of the youth of an organization. The metropolitan press is money-mad, which on their part is not exactly a custom but an obligation to their stockholders.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Foreign groups must realize that they are only the stepchild, and must not be so unreasonable as to expect recognition from the metropolitan press, for no matter how many of their grandsires may have been born here, no matter if they are lineal descendants of Kosciuszko or Pulaski, whereby, they could avail themselves of the perpetual citizenship granted them and theirs by Congressional grant, in the eyes of the predominating chauvinistic trend in our country, they will stay foreigners for all eternity. As we stated above, our journal, as any other American journal printed in a foreign language, like the Commission, must put on a juggling act with its funds.</p>
   <p>To properly function, the management would have to employ twice the number of workers. Even though cooperation is an old-fashioned word, it still lives in a journal like ours; of course, a discordant note is manifest now an then, but taking all into consideration the work is admirable and the results far-reaching. One of the past conventions of the Polish Roman Catholic Union deemed it wise to publish a page in English in its journal; arguments galore pro and con even now re-echo regarding this step, but the page in English shall be an additional feature, as it were, to attract the youth, who by reading the sport news in the language they hear on all sides and in which, therefore, it is easier for them to express themselves, inadvertently turn to the other pages and recall the language heard from their mother, or grandmother or the nun teachers in the <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>grammar grades. As far as the language of the sport and social page of this journal is concerned, the properly termed squawkers and would-be patriots should be tempted some day to institute a referendum on the question.</p>
   <p>And now to the cooperation from the Commission, the readers, and the various sports' organizations. It was stated above that funds and resources are limited. Let us speak of this page alone for the present. What is said herein is not an apology in any sense. It is not meant to exaggerate or minimize. Only facts are meant as facts. Here they are.</p>
   <p>One man alone is in charge of the page in English; his time is not devoted exclusively to this page, for of necessity he must cooperate with the other departments; if furnished with that material, he will publish all the news of the various clubs, circles, and teams. All a team has to do is to send in the scores, for we have a very limited force and cannot send reporters to any of the games; undoubtedly, every club has one or more amateur journalists who would enjoy seeing the child of their brains in print. Therefore, send in your contributions, and we will publish them in corrected form, or rewrite them if necessary. The important thing is to cooperate with the paper as the paper cooperates with you.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>This is a plea to our readers, who will surely realize that the situation of their page is analogous to the situation of this paper. The officers of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, from President Olejniczak down to the lowest clerk in the general offices of the organization, are back of the youth program, and the Sports Commission is wholeheartedly behind the youth of the organization, from chairman Rostenkowski down to the last commissioner. But again, you must realize the staggering load the officials and the commission are tackling and come to their aid in order to help yourselves and find relief.</p>
