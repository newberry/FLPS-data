   <p>Sunday, tomorrow, as an annual custom of the Polish National Alliance, the Library and Museum are arranging a summer outing, the so - called picnic. The proceeds are designated for the purchase of new books, and to increase the collections in the museum. This institution of knowledge is controlled by the Central Board of the P.N.A. and renders priceless service in all communities, especially in Chicago. If some of our readers would visit the Alliance Library, they would see the many persons reading Polish writings and books without charge to them. The Library is not supported by special donations from philanthropists who contribute liberally to educational causes; neither does it possess special funds, nor demand financial assistance of conventions of the P.N.A. However, it unfolds the functions of its financial support, which comes mostly from Polish citizens of Chicago, in a splendid manner. The Library and its collections in the Museum are an honor to all members of the P.N.A. It was founded by the late Dr. Kalusowski of Washington, an upright man and a great patriot who saw enlightenment, in the future, of those people who are of Polish birth. This Library grew from its modest beginning to considerable strength; and, we can boldly say, is today, the largest and best equipped Polish Library in America.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The development of our Library can be credited to the good will of our brethren of the P.N.A. in Chicago, who sincerely assisted its growth, through concerts and outings; obtaining therefrom funds to increase its size and strength from year to year until, today, this Library contains six- thousand select works, which are principally by Polish authors; besides these, it contains a liberal collections of English, French, Lithuanian, German, Latin, Italian, Russians and Spanish works. The Library also shelteres the splendid National Museum, containing a valuable collection of relics. There are letters written by Polish kings and prominent men before and after the partition of Poland; there are beautiful photographs of famous heroes of Polish insurrections, maps, statues, medals, pictures, hand paintings, precious stones, and a splendid numismatic collection of Polish coins, from the time of Boleslaw Chrobry, to the present day. The Library is conveniently located in a room of the P.N.A., 102-104 W. Division Street and is operated by a librarian and custodian. The daily average of persons reading Polish, European, and American literature, is about 50; books are loaned, each month, to about 3,000 persons. This treasure of knowledge is entirely dependant upon the good will of its community. A special commission, or department, which has jurisdiction of the Library and its collection of relics, also the collection funds for new works, is appointed by <span class="page-break">\3</span>the Central Board of the P.N.A., at each convention. Thanks are due to the advocators of knowledge, who donate several hundred volumes each year. The funds, as we have previously stated, are raised by arranging - evening socials, concerts, picnics, other entertainments; contributions are also accepted.</p>
   <p>Our institution is sincerely enjoying the support of the community, which is shown by the large attendance of Poles and non - members of the P.N.A. Money derived from these entertainments replenishes the treasury of the Library. So this year, as has been the custom in other years, directors of the Library are arranging a picnic and are hoping that our community will remember this temple of knowledge, by giving financial aid to this worthy cause. Every book acquired by this Library is another torch light of knowledge. So, dear countrymen, do not forget that it is your sacred duty to support this treasure, morally, and materially!</p>
   <p>American people donate millions for educational purposes, knowing that in progress lies the strength of the Nation. Therefore, let us follow their example by laying our contributions on the altar of knowledge; surely, we will not regret it! Let our countrymen attend the picnic in large numbers, on August 2nd, and <span class="page-break">\4</span>add a stone to the foundation of enlightenment; a cause that will serve pleasant memories. We appeal to you, and solicit the attendance of all members of the P.N.A., at this picnic, to rejoice in the fact that we will receive the benefit of the vast store of knowledge, that we helped make this great educational institution a grand reality in Chicago.</p>
