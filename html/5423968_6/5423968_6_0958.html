   <p>The Women's Auxiliary of the Polish National Alliance nurtures Polish children with particular care and solicitude, seeing in them the future pillars which will uphold our homeland. Particular attention is paid to inculcating in the hearts of the little children love for the homeland and the native language and regard for the heroes and the glorious deeds of Polish history. The work undertaken for this purpose has been rewarded a hundredfold, as the examinations given at the summer schools indicated.</p>
   <p>The schools in Bridgeport and Holy Trinity parishes deserve particular mention. The teacher of those two schools, Miss Agnes Wojcik, deserves special recognition for her work.</p>
   <p>Listening to the recitations and songs, and especially to the answers to questions on Polish history, the spectator who visited these schools <span class="page-break">2</span>received the impression that these children not only had studied their lessons well, but also had understood, assimilated, and developed a love for what they had learned. I am not exaggerating in the least, when I say that perhaps many young men and women are not as well informed about the most important events in our history, as these summer school children are.</p>
   <p>The little schools in Holy Trinity parish and Avondale had the largest number of children attending.</p>
   <p>Mrs. M. Sakowska, Mrs. M. Szeszycka, and Mrs. J. Dunin were present at the exercises of the little schools at Bridgeport and Town of Lake, as representatives of the Women's Auxiliary. Mrs. Sakowska addressed the boys and girls earnestly and told them who supports these schools and tries to give them the means of learning and understanding those things which every Pole should know. Mrs. Sakowska went to the little school at St. Adalbert's parish in order to show the children that the grown-ups are interested in <span class="page-break">3</span>their progress.</p>
   <p>A great many parents attended the exercises of the little school at Holy Trinity parish, glad to hear what their pride-and-joy had learned. They were astonished. Mr. Zukowski, father of one of the little girls, declared that the children deserved praise for their eagerness to learn, and that the Women's Auxiliary of the P. N. A. [Polish National Alliance] deserved recognition for conducting the schools. After Mr. Zukowski, Mrs. W. Milewska and Mrs. Dunin addressed the children, appealing to their little hearts to contribute to the Independence Fund from the pennies their parents had given them for sweets.</p>
   <p>As soon as the words of encouragement were uttered, two little Polish girls made their contributions, Isabell Sobieska giving fifteen cents and Eugenia Dankowska five cents.</p>
   <p>At the exercises of the little school in Avondale, where Miss Sophia Mroczynska <span class="page-break">4</span>is teacher, the commissioner, Mrs. W. Lipczynska, Mr. J. Zembal, and Mrs. Sakowska were present, as well as a goodly number of parents.</p>
   <p>The exercises were performed very well and the program was varied. Mrs. Lipczynska was charmed by the performance and, in a sincere speech, voiced her satisfaction at seeing that our children are so truly Polish. Mrs. Sakowska appealed for contributions to the Independence Fund and collected $2.33 from the grown-ups and children.</p>
   <p>The Women's Auxiliary had bought lovely prizes, copies of "Grottger's Album," to give the children for industry in their studies.</p>
