   <p>The sub-committee of schools of the Polish National Alliance reports, that $22,926,25 have been collected towards the new High School of the P.N.A. Very good results have been attained in this short time, considering the financial status of contributors. Donations of one to five cents are accepted and will not impoverish anyone, but it helps to raise a large sum, besides proving to us that in union there is strength. These small donations, however, do not indicate a great enthusiasm for the creation of secondary schools.</p>
   <p>The P.N.A. with its 60,000 members is a large organization; it can, with just one brilliant move-build such a large high school which helps to provide a better future for the children of the donors, and it may be accomplished by merely increasing our penny donations three or four times.</p>
   <p>This would in all probability be sufficient to complete this work; however, to finish what we begin requires perseverance-and it will, perhaps, be necessary to be somewhat generous. Such a sacrifice does not make us destitute; yet, it could produce wonders. We will prove that presently.</p>
