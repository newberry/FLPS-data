   <p>One hundred and fifty years ago, the original colonies in America numbered thirteen; these colonies announced to the world their independence of the British rule, which resulted in the war for the freedom of this country, in which our national heroes Casimir Pulaski and Thaddeus Kosciuszko became known in the history of America.</p>
   <p>From the time of Kosciuszko and Pulaski, the people of Polish descent participated in the various wars of America, the Civil War of 1861 to 1865, the Spanish-American War, and the World War in which thousands of Polish youths had taken part.</p>
   <p>In honor and memory of these heroes who lost their lives on the battlefields in France, a monument was erected by the Polish-American mothers and fathers of the Gold Star Society, who have for the past several years collected funds for this monument.</p>
