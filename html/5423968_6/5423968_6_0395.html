   <p>"A slowo stalo sie cialem" (and the word became a body)--a short and very simple sentence, but full of meaning. Yet, what does it mean? It is a sentence that could easily lead into a discussion in analytic and deductive philosophy, but we will not delve into philosophy here.</p>
   <p>The word is a special privilege of the highest creation of nature--man. It is the offspring of thought, and thought, the creative force, is derived from God. It is thought that planned and created worlds. And since the word is the product of thought, it is as immortal as thought itself; it helps thought in its own development and itself is not lost, tending always toward perfection. And since, according to the laws of nature, nothing is ever lost, every thought that is expressed in words produces a reaction, creates new thoughts, new life. Everything tends forward, nothing moves backward nor ceases in its forward motion. "Eppur si muoue" (Nevertheless, it does move).</p>
   
   <p>The introduction of writing was a great step forward, a great triumph for thought and word, while the invention of printing was a still greater triumph. It is not so long since that which everyone is taught today was accessible only to a privileged few; to the great majority of the people it was a treasure, enchanted and unattainable. After all, it is relatively but a short time ago that kings could not write--Charlemagne, the powerful king of the Franks, could not sign his name. And today? Today we have public schools.</p>
   <p>The printed word has done much, very much, to help humanity in its forward progress, and we, children of the twentieth century, no longer realize what enormous benefits the printed word has given us, the momentum it has gathered today, the new currents of thought to which it has given rise. There are even those who complain that literature, and especially journalism, has spread to such an extent as to curtail individual thinking. Since we will return to this point later, I will leave it, for the moment, without further comment.</p>
   <p>In this article, it was my intention to discuss the far-reaching educational significance of two of the most important branches of literature--the novel and the newspaper.</p>
   <p>Let us begin with the novel. To begin with, let us consider the question: what is a novel? The novel is a component part of that which we designate broadly as art. It is one manifestation of beauty, for art and beauty are synonymous. We admire beauty in nature, we admire the beauty created by human minds, such as poetry, music, sculpture, painting, and devotion to science and to great ideals; for their aim is to ennoble the world, their tendency is toward perfection. It is for this reason that humanity will always worship the Creator as the highest ideal of perfection and beauty.</p>
   <p>One of these manifestations of beauty, namely, art, as we have said before, is the novel and its inseparable companion poetry, which need not necessarily rhyme to present itself in its greatest glory; similarly, everything that rhymes is not necessarily poetry.</p>
   
   <p>A novel may be written purely for the sake of art, for beauty itself, or it may be tendentious; that is, it may be written with a social problem in mind, with the idea of pointing out an existing fault and suggesting how it may be corrected.</p>
   <p>A novel written for the sake of art, to make a comparison, is like a sculpture of Venus de Medici, or Zeus, or Apollo, or anything else created by the artist for art's sake, in which we admire the beauty of the work and the genius of the artist. A tendentious novel, however, can be likened to an architecturally beautiful building--beauty put to practical purpose. Here beauty and usefulness are combined.</p>
   <p>If I should be asked what sort of novel I prefer, I would reply without hesitation that I prefer the tendentious novel because it is more useful; for, after all, beauty and usefulness can be combined. I will say more: I would rather lose artistic value in a novel than give it literary qualities without giving it a deeper meaning by which others might benefit.</p>
   
   <p>There are great differences between novels, differences as great as those between a thatch-covered, smoke-blackened peasant hut and the magnificent architecture of a basilica or theater, as those between an inn and a church, depending upon their intellectual, spiritual, and moral value, and upon the genius and ability of their creators.</p>
   <p>In a novel, everything can be expressed. All of the spiritual and scientific gains of our civilization can be popularized, the imagination awakened, a love for knowledge, research, and experiment created. The novel stimulates the mind, it awakens patriotic feeling. It reaches the poorest peasant hut, and if it is a good novel it educates and ennobles its peasant readers. Because of this, novelists have a great responsibility. They must be apostles, high priests of our Polish faith; they must stand guard over our national ideals; they must guard the purity of our language and thoughts; elevate and uphold the national spirit. In a word, they must steel the nation to struggles and difficulties, and work tirelessly toward one sacred end--the freedom of our homeland. Let us bow our heads before them; for, with the exception of a few so-called modernists who abandoned their national duty "for the sake of art", they have done this.</p>
   <p>The Polish novel has its own special task, and for this reason it differs so greatly from the novels of other nations; it must be admitted, however, that that difference favors the Polish novel. The novelists of free nations can permit themselves to write "for art's sake", to write of immortality and licence; we, in threefold slavery, our enemies seeking constantly to inject into our nation the poison that will disintegrate it, cannot permit ourselves such "art". The words of [Marya] Konopnicka should ring constantly in our ears:</p>
   <p>"Nie damy ziemi skad nasz rod,</p>
   <p>Nie damy pogrzesc mowy....."</p>
   <p>(We will not give up the land of our forefathers,</p>
   <p>We will not allow our language to be destroyed.......)</p>
   <p>"Rota" (The Oath), Marya Konopnicka.</p>
   
   <p>The value of a novel depends upon the novelist's artistic form, his style, his ability to create a word picture, his color effects, his originality of expression, and his ability to present dramatic scenes in such a way that they will react properly upon the reader. Philosophy, logic, and psychology, especially the last, play an important role in the writing of a novel. One must be a competent psychologist, one must have a great knowledge of human nature in order to portray characters correctly, in order to have them behave in accordance with characteristics previously decided upon, in order that their actions may be in keeping with their psychological make-up.</p>
   <p>We can classify novels as materialistic, romantic, idealistic, as positivistic and modernistic--every philosophy can find its outlet in the novel, every direction of thought can be represented.</p>
   <p>But we will not attempt to analyze and classify all these types of novels, for we would digress too far. I am interested only in a general view of the novel itself, and in its value and importance in social education.</p>
   <p>We can now pass on to journalism, which also plays a responsible part in the education of today's generations. Some say that the newspaper is the school of life. Although this cannot be taken too literally, it contains much truth. The statement might be corrected to read thus: newspapers should reflect the life of modern society. Newspapers reflect the progress of a social and intellectual nation. There are even times in a nation's existence when important social and political steps depend upon the stand taken by publicists. And sometimes newspapers are not merely a reflection of a given society's spiritual state; when they are directed by individuals who think more deeply, who are devoted to a cause, they can create a new movement, a new line of thought, new life--they can elevate the nation to higher levels.</p>
   <p>The press of today is a powerful force, and its favor or co-operation is sought by governments and parliaments of all nations. The press molds that which today constitutes one of the greatest powers--public opinion. Someone has said that if St. Peter were alive today he would found a daily newspaper for the spreading of Christ's teachings.</p>
   <p>Is it necessary to prove today what a powerful factor the press constitutes in social education? I think not, for it is self-evident. Literacy has reached a high degree of development, and will continue to spread as the general level of educational standards continue to rise.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Line missing due to typographical error in original.] The ever-growing literacy of the people gives ample promise of this better future. In raising the educational level of the people, on social and national problems, they [newspapers] bring the nation closer to the ideal. It is here that journalism's great responsibility lies. Here is the thankless, misunderstood field in which the wielders of the pen serve; it is their priesthood of national ideals, the field in which they can give free rein to their minds and spirits.</p>
   <p>It is understood, of course, that the mental capacity, the journalistic ability and activity of the editors, and the extent of their education, are all factors that contribute to the worth of a given newspaper, and are conditions for its growth for they guarantee the ethics and measure of each undertaking.</p>
   <p>The field of activity in which a newspaper can operate, however, is so vast that it can come under no code of ethics. The value of a given newspaper depends entirely upon the moral and mental worth of the people who direct it; that is, upon the manner in which it is edited. Naturally the question of money plays a very important part here, for the technical value of the paper and the salaries of the editors must also be considered. A badly paid editor will never give as much work, as much mental and spiritual effort, as an editor who is fairly paid.</p>
   <p>The technical and professional perfection which the press has attained can be seen in an American newspaper....Is there anything it does not contain! It is a veritable encyclopedia. The American newspaper is a faithful reproduction of the energetic, rich, but at the same time feverish and nervous American physical life, which dominates the mental life. It will not be complete, however, until general education takes in the entire nation, until a balance is reached by raising the intellectual level of the people. Henryk Sienkiewicz, our great author,said in one of his works (I think it was in "Without Dogma") that we are a society consisting of two elements: one, the dominant element, overcivilized, nervous, completely modern; and the other, entirely primitive. Yes, despite the dreams of poets.... there is an abyss between the two elements that is not so much one of class as of intellectuality. Admitting the advantage of having an upper and a middle class, we must also admit the incontrovertible truth that we will reach the full bloom of our national life only when general education is given to the entire nation, when the common people....stand upon a higher mental level.</p>
   <p>The press is a great champion of this forward movement.....</p>
   <p>That the deeper-thinking Americans themselves can see this is proved in the following excerpt from a book by Dr. Toulouse, entitled "How to Live":</p>
   
   <p>"A very important reason why people have ceased to think for themselves is the enormous expansion of today's newspaper business. The ease with which one can inform oneself of everything, the ready accessibility of great sheets of paper covered with news items, and the readability of newspaper articles, have so developed the newspaper reading habit as to make the newspaper well-nigh indispensable to a great many people. Whenever the average man has a free moment, he reaches for a newspaper; he reads everything; in it with enthusiasm, starting always with the more sensational items. In this way, our minds become accustomed to domination by other minds and gradually become incapable of independent action. Any attempt at independent thinking becomes extremely difficult and unpleasant."</p>
   <p>We will not stop to consider to what extent Dr. Toulouse may be right. His words point, however, to an apparent contrast [with our point of view]. While we yearn for a powerful press and a continuous expansion of literacy among all classes of people, this American thinker regards the spread of literacy and the growth of the newspapers as a disaster that will render the American people incapable of thinking for themselves--thinking in the higher sense of the word, for spiritual advancement; in materialistic endeavor, no one can surpass the Americans.</p>
   <p>We have no reason to fear this incapability of independent thought, since we are by nature dreamers, romanticists, poets, philosophers; we are lovers of beauty, and we will never need to cope with such a problem. Let us therefore bend all our efforts toward expanding our press and the literacy of our people; for our future depends in large measure upon this expansion. Anyone who is interested in seeing the tremendous, inexhaustible force that sustained us under the chains of threefold slavery can find it in the post-partition history of our literature and journalism--the product of a thousand-year-old culture and civilization. He will find all questions answered there. The nation's genius, that "King Spirit" of ours, has always manifested himself in various ways according to our needs; the last period was marked with an increased literary and artistic activity that was a real source of strength and resistance during our nation's struggles against its enemies. Through literature, a powerful though restrained message went out to the nation, keeping up the spirit of the people and giving them the strength to persevere.</p>
   <p>"Nie damy ziemi skad nasz rod!</p>
   <p>Nie damy pogrzesc mowy!</p>
   <p>Polski my narod, Polski lud,</p>
   <p>Krolewski szczep piastowy!"</p>
   <p>(We will not give up the land of our forefathers!</p>
   <p>We will not allow our language to be destroyed!</p>
   <p>We are the Polish nation, the Polish people,</p>
   <p>Of the royal clan of Piast!)</p>
   <p>"Rota," (The Oath) Marya Konopnicka.</p>
   <p>We will not give up our homeland! We will not give up our language! Even should the descendants of the Knights of the Cross drain Hell of all its perversity and barbarism, even though Polish lands should again fall temporarily into their hands, we will not give up our homeland, our language--those greatest of all Polish treasures. They jeer at us, saying that the future generations in Poland will be German. But they reckon without Polish mothers, without the Polish spirit, and they do not know the power of the Polish word. This youngest generation, that they boast will be German, will produce more than one Wincenty Pol, Smolka, Chopin, Mickiewicz, Kosciusko. They will all be Poles, body and soul; for Poland and the Polish spirit constitute an original creative force so powerful as to assimilate even foreign elements with ease, making ardent Poles of people who have nothing in common with Poland by blood or by natural characteristics; at the same time, it is highly resistant to denationalization. The Germans know this and therefore fear and hate us.</p>
   <p>The reader will pardon me for this digression from the original subject, for since it ties up with the original subject in thought I trust the digression will not be held against me.</p>
   <p>We will stop to consider for a moment the Polish-American press, for during the last ten years it has played a very important role here. One cannot complain of illiteracy among the American Poles; as a matter of fact, it can even be proved that literacy is in a high state of development among our people here. To what do we owe this? In the first place, to a very small percentage of ignorance. The majority of Polish immigrants to America for the past few decades have been able to read and write, while among American-born Poles illiteracy does not exist. Furthermore, city life, relatively high earning power, low subscription rates for publications, and the infectiousness, or rather, the good example set by the native literacy here, have all served greatly to develop Polish journalism in America. As a result, we have a dozen or more daily newspapers and a few score weekly publications.</p>
   <p>The task of the Polish-American journalists is a great and important and extremely difficult one. In truth, we have an ideal field for the development of literacy, and in spite of our three millions of people, of the fullness of our social and intellectual life that gives us our so-called "middle class", or intelligentsia, it can be felt. And it reflects itself strongly in our press. And so the responsibility of those at the head of our newspapers is greater. In addition to observing the cardinal principles of journalism, they must be the guardians of Polish honor; they must make good citizens of the Poles of this country, and yet guard the purity of their Polish spirit; they must spread love for the motherland, and stand watch over our national traditions, and they must prevent denationalization in this foreign sea of people; they must elevate the people to an ever greater spiritual level and to a brighter future. A difficult, an extremely difficult task, but it must be admitted that in recent times our newspapers have, with but few exceptions, undertaken it, and it is to be hoped that the good results will be steadily greater. The great responsibility of a task ennobles those who work at it, and there is no lack of worthy and capable editors among us. We already owe much to our press. We need but mention, for example, the social-political union of all our organizations into the Polish Central Relief Committee, of which the National Department is the political agent. And the Polish Press Club could be a center for new thought and new activities if--if it could only reform and become a purely scientific, literary, and journalistic group.</p>
   <p>On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, it is impossible to pass on in silence over the great services rendered by this champion of enlightenment and herald of our national ideal in its ten years of praiseworthy existence. It would be superfluous to enumerate these services, for they are apparent to everyone, and are appreciated best by our powerful organization, our beloved Polish National Alliance. That the Polish people have appreciated their newspaper's great social, educational, and nationalistic services is proved by Dziennik Zwiazkowy's growth and by its present independence. The people pay with their hearts for zealous service. All honor is due those who have been and who are now at its head.</p>
   <p>Perhaps not everyone realizes exactly how great a power the Polish National Alliance wields in the field of publicity and in the molding of public opinion. One hundred and twenty-five thousand copies of Zgoda are sent out every week and these are read by perhaps as much as a half million people. Forty thousand copies of Dziennik Zwiazkowy are rolled off the presses daily.</p>
   
   <p>"Skarb! Skarb ogromny! Potega!</p>
   <p>"Cudze chwalicie, swego nie znacie,</p>
   <p>"Sami nie wiecie co posiadacie!"</p>
   <p>(A treasure! A great treasure! A powerful force!</p>
   <p>You praise that of others, yet you do not</p>
   <p>realize what you yourselves possess!)</p>
   <p>Nicholas Rej, 16th century Polish poet.</p>
   <p>If the Alliance conventions realized what great power the organization has at its disposal, they would give more attention to their publications, and especially to the Alliances official organ, Zgoda. What such a paper as Zgoda could not accomplish! Imagine Zgoda as a first-class weekly, containing not only dry reports of meetings, nationalistic gatherings, administration changes, and statistics, but informative articles as well. What an influence it could be! A Zgoda of this sort should have at least three editors. [Translator's note: Editorial staff consisted of one man.]</p>
   <p>Since there is little hope that it will ever come to this, let us place all our hopes in Dziennik Zwiazkowy; and on this tenth anniversary of its founding let us express our best wishes that it persevere in its difficult task in the field of social, nationalistic, and educational endeavor. This task should involve our entire spiritual and intellectual life, and should tend unceasingly in one direction--toward a free, independent, and united Poland.</p>
   <p>Stanislaus Zaklikiewicz</p>
