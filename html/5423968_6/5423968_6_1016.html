   <p>The evening school at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, Noble and Bradley Streets, has been opened recently. There are several divisions of classes.</p>
   <p>There are preparatory classes for boys who are to receive their first Holy Communion. Besides getting religious training, the boys may also join the Polish language and arithmetic classes.</p>
   <p>Classes in the English language are given separately. Children and adults are eligible for these classes. The beginners are instructed by a Polish teacher, in order that persons who speak only Polish may grasp the subject better. The advanced course in English is given by an English instructor.</p>
   <p>The German language is taught by a Polish teacher who has had years of training in this field with the German government, where he had to conduct all affairs in the German tongue.</p>
