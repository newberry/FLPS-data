   <p>A meeting for the purpose of judging the entries of the Copernicus Literary Competition in Polish novels and short stories based on the life of Poles in America was held last night at the Polish hall near Emma Street.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Attorney M. Drzymala, president of the Competition Committee, who asked Ralph Modrzejewski [Modjeski] to act as chairman of the meeting.</p>
   <p>S. Slupski, the secretary of the Committee, read the reports of the competition. He stated that the committee in charge of the competition consisted of the following persons, besides himself: M. Drzymala, president; A. LaBuy, J. F. Smulski, and J. Xelowski, members.</p>
   <p>This competition was started at the beginning of last year, but it was <span class="page-break">2</span>extended, and the requirements were changed so that, instead of novels containing no more than two thousand lines, works of any length could be accepted.</p>
   <p>Ten manuscripts were received by the Competition Committee. Two of them were recalled by the authors. One was rejected because it was incomplete, and one could not be accepted because it was a comedy.</p>
   <p>This reduced the number of manuscripts eligible for reward to six; namely, a large story, covering two hundred and fifty pages, entitled A Politician, and the short stories, The Amorous Editor, Differences Adjusted, Across the Ocean or in Heaven, Mr. Xavier's Revenge, and For the Ideal or for Gold.</p>
   <p>These manuscripts were judged by Mr. Andrzejkowicz and Professor Boeck of Philadelphia, Pennyslvania, Dr. H. Kalusowski of Washington, D. C.; and S. F. A. Satalecki and R. Modrzejewski of Chicago. It should be added that <span class="page-break">3</span>formerly, besides the three outside judges, there was also in Chicago a competition jury consisting of six persons. This jury resigned on account of a misunderstanding with the secretary of the Competition Committee. The two Chicago judges were appointed later on. The participants in yesterday's competition knew about this circumstance, not from the reports of the secretary, but from the deliberations at the meeting.</p>
   <p>Subsequently, Mr. Slupski, the secretary of the Committee, read the decisions of the judges separately, without any understanding with other judges.</p>
   <p>Professor Boeck of Philadelphia awarded the first prize to the story A Politician, the second to Across the Ocean or in Heaven, the third to The Amorous Editor, the fourth to Mr. Xavier's Revenge, and the fifth to For the Ideal or for Gold. The story Differences Adjusted was not judged because the writing was illegible.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stalecki [sic] awarded the first prize to the story A Politician, the second <span class="page-break">4</span>to Across the Ocean or in Heaven, and the third to The Amorous Editor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Andrzejkowicz of Philadelphia awarded the first prize to A Politician, the second to Mr. Xavier's Revenge, the third to Across the Ocean or in Heaven, the fourth to For the Ideal or for Gold, and the fifth to The Amorous Editor.</p>
   <p>According to Dr. Kalusowski of Washington, D. C., the story A Politician deserved the first prize; Across the Ocean or in Heaven, second prize; and The Amorous Editor, third prize.</p>
   <p>Finally, Mr. Ralph Modrzejewski gave the first award to A Politician, the second to Across the Ocean or in Heaven, the third to Mr. Xavier's Revenge, and the fourth to The Amorous Editor.</p>
   <p>This shows that the story A Politician received five votes for first prize, <span class="page-break">5</span>that Across the Ocean or in Heaven received four votes for second prize and one vote for third prize. The Amorous Editor received three votes for third prize, one vote for fourth prize, and one vote for fifth prize. The story Mr. Xavier's Revenge received one vote for second prize, one vote for third prize, and one vote for fourth prize. The story For the Ideal or for Gold received one vote for fourth prize and one for fifth prize.</p>
   <p>This places these works in the following order: 1) A Politician, 2) Across the Ocean or in Heaven, 3) The Amorous Editor, 4) Mr. Xavier's Revenge, and 5) For the Ideal or for Gold.</p>
   <p>Before the final awarding of prizes, the Committee decided to open the envelopes containing the names of the authors for the purpose of verifying whether the conditions of the competition had been observed. This task was assigned to the following members of the Committee: LaBuy, Satalecki, and Drzymala.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>This disclosed the following facts:</p>
   <p>1) That the author of A Politician is Sigmund Slupski, the secretary of the Competition Committee.</p>
   <p>2) That the author of Across the Ocean or in Heaven, listed under the pseudonym of "Sylvia Depilla", ordered the Committee to pay the awarded prize to Mr. Sigmund Slupski, the secretary of the Committee.</p>
   <p>3) That the author of The Amorous Editor is Martin Rogowski, a student of the Polish Theological Seminary of Detroit, Michigan.</p>
   <p>4) That the author of Mr. Xavier's Revenge, who writes under the pseudonym of Joseph Piotrowski, is willing to reveal his identify and establish his real name on demand of the Competition Committee.</p>
   <p>5) That the author of For the Ideal or for Gold is Miss M. Siedlaczek of <span class="page-break">7</span>Lwow, Poland (Austrian occupation), who participated in the competition without the right of receiving award.</p>
   <p>Finally, at the request of the author of the comedy The Unhappy Wives, which was not judged, the envelope containing his name was opened. The author of the comedy is Anthony Zdzieblowski.</p>
   <p>This was followed by a long and lively discussion as to whether the secretary of the Competition Committee, who is at the head of it, is entitled to any award, and whether an author using a pseudonym and not revealing his identity, thus giving no assurance that he lived in America for more than one year or that he is not a member of the Committee or the jury, can receive any award. This question was debated by H. Nagiel, Broel, F. H. Topor, J. F. Smulski, Ignace Kowalski, and S. Slupski. The winners of the first and second awards defended themselves against the charges.</p>
   <p>A suggestion was even made to bar the work A Politician from the competition, <span class="page-break">8</span>and the work Across the Ocean or in Heaven should also suffer the same fate if its author cannot prove that he lived in America at least one year and that he is not a member of the Competition Committee.</p>
   <p>Finally, Mr. Drzymala, the president of the Competition Committee, declared that this problem will be settled by the Committee itself, and he also told those who were present that they had a right to make a protest. Indeed, following the suggestion, Mr. Nagiel, supported by Mr. Broel, did make a protest against awarding the first prize to the story A Politician and against the story Across the Ocean or in Heaven if its author refuses to abide by the conditions of the competition.</p>
   <p>This protest was accepted unanimously because there was only two or three votes against it.</p>
   <p>Presently, the Competition Committee (probably with the exclusion of S. Slupski as one who is interested) will declare whether the protest made at <span class="page-break">9</span>yesterday's meeting will be taken under consideration or not. In awaiting this decision, we are certain that it will be made according to the principles of justice which are very evident here. In the meantime, we will refrain from making any comments on the subject.</p>
