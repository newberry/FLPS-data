   <p>The Liberty League, formed by a group of Polish-American journalists, has made arrangements to hold a convention at Omaha, Nebraska, on April 10, During the course of the conference, the platform of the organization was scheduled to be announced. An announcement was also planned relative to the acceptance of the Polish National Alliance into the Liberty League. Arrangements were also made by all the associated papers to make a triumphant rebuff against the Dziennik Chicagoski and the Wiara I Ojczyzna, the two papers that politely opposed the principles of the League. We quitely and politely ask what has happened to this convention?</p>
