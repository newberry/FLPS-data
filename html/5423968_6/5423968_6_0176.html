   <p>The Reverend John Piechowski, pastor of St. Hedwig parish, has purchased 150 Polish books for a parish library. Many outstanding works are included in this collection; namely, those of Sienkiewicz, Kraszewski, and others. There are also a number of books for Polish youth.</p>
   <p>This is indeed a surprising gift for the parishioners, one that will increase in value as the years go by.</p>
