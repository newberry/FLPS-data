   <p>We have received a new appeal from the committee to build the Kosciusko monument in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The committee, it seems from this appeal, has decided to bring the matter of building the monument to a head. The committee reports that the building of a greater monument, as was originally projected, is impossible because of inadequate contributions for the purpose; it will be necessary to be satisfied with one much more modest in appearance. The fund lacks a few thousand dollars for even such a monument.</p>
   <p>Greater donations for this purpose were expected on the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the birth of our immortal Thaddeus Kosciusko. Certain sums were donated, but not as large as expected; they are not sufficient to build the monument.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The committee, therefore, appeals to everybody for more donations, and especially urges all the Poles in Chicago to take part in the picnic which is to take place July 4 in Schuetzen park, under the auspices of Polish societies.</p>
   <p>An itemized report of funds gathered for building the monument is included in this appeal.</p>
   <p>The report follows:</p>

   <p>As can be seen from the above report, the committee possesses a sum of $7,389.53, which is not sufficient to build a monument. This sum should be increased.</p>
   <p>Concerning this, the appeal continues: "At least three or four thousand dollars more are necessary to build even a modest monument. One half of this sum, it is expected, will be raised at the picnic, and the other half we hope will be donated in Chicago and other Polish colonies. The committee will then be able to bring the plan projected four years ago to a successful conclusion, and will be very happy when this is accomplished."</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the committee once again warmly appeals to the Polish people for additional donations for the monument. We heartily endorse this appeal.</p>
   <p>The monument must be built. This should have been done a long time ago. The Kosciusko monument should be built in Chicago as soon as possible.</p>
