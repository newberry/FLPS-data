   <p>A branch of the Polish Library was opened in the building adjoining the Polish national newspaper offices, at 98 N. Division Street.</p>
   <p>This library will be open from 8 A. M. to 9 P. M. It has the best and largest selection of books obtainable anywhere in Chicago. Every Pole, not a member of the Z. N. P. but fond of reading Polish books about our country or about Europe, can borrow these books by leaving a deposit with the librarian. Those not wishing to take books out can read them in the library.</p>
