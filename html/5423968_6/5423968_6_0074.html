   <p>The undersigned as a literary committee, in the name of the Educational Department of the Polish League of America, have been given the privilege of announcing to the Polish public, especially to the Polish youth of America, the following:</p>
   <p>One of the primary aims of the Educational Department of the Polish League is the spread of education among the Polish youth of America. As a step in this direction the Educational Department has prepared an announcement of a literary contest for young people.</p>
   <p>This measure, we are certain, is a step in the right direction. The first literary contest for Polish youth, which was held a few months ago, was on the theme "What are the Duties of Polish Youth in America?" The contest board received a great number of entries from all parts of America. Those manuscripts varied in <span class="page-break">\2</span>literary value, but all were imbued with ardent love for God and the fatherland, along with a tendency to elevate the morals, success and national independence of the Polish people of America. A number of awards and honorable mentions were given. Most of the winning works of the contestants were published, in part or in whole, in our local papers.</p>
   <p>These results enabled us to show the Polish public the value of our first literary contest. Encouraged by these initial results, we are pleased to announce a second literary contest for our Polish youth in the United States.</p>
   <p>Deviating from a less difficult theme to one that is more complicated, the second literary competition will be on the question, "What Has Kosciusko Accomplished for the Polish People of Poland?" This theme is perhaps no more difficult than the previous one but it is strongly charged with emotional content.</p>
   <p>In order to write on this subject, there is need for certain factual information on the history of Poland of the past century. But this information is easily <span class="page-break">\3</span>available, as is indicated by the number of books and pamphlets published about Kosciusko last year. This material is also abundant in the local Polish papers and in those from Europe a year ago. There probably is not one Polish library that does not have at least one book on this immortal Polish hero.</p>
   <p>It is not the intention of this contest to get just the principal historic facts; there is concern only about the presentation of such facts, by bringing them to light, pointing out their importance and weaving about them personal comment.</p>
   <p>Having made clear the meaning of the theme, we now present the conditions of the contest. They are as follows:</p>
   <p>Only Polish-Americans or those of Polish descent who have been in America at least one year are eligible to enter the contest. All contestants must be under twenty-two years of age, and this age limit applies to both girls and boys.</p>
   <p>The manuscript is not to be longer than five columns of print--long primer--such <span class="page-break">\4</span>as is used by Dziennik Chicagoski. It can be considerably shorter, depending upon the contents of the article.</p>
   <p>The contest deadline is set for August 25. (The envelope bearing the manuscript must be dated not later than midnight, August 25, 1895.)</p>
   <p>The manuscripts should be sent through the mails and addressed to: Secretary of the Educational Department, Ignace Kowalski, 141-143 West Division Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The text is not to be signed, but a pseudonyn of some kind is permissible, or a number or sign may be used. A separate envelope should be enclosed bearing the same mark as is used on the manuscript, and giving also the name, address and age of the contestant.</p>
   <p>These sealed envelopes will remain intact until the prize-winning entries have been announced. Then the envelopes will be opened and only those belonging to <span class="page-break">\5</span>the contest winners will be retained; the remainder will be destroyed.</p>
   <p>The contest will be judged by a committee from the Educational Department.</p>
   <p>Announcement of awards will be made a few days after the close of the contest.</p>
   <p>The authors of the three best works will be awarded the following three prizes:</p>
   <p>First Prize: Complete works of T. Lenartowicz, Polish poet.</p>
   <p>Second Prize: Nauka Wiary I Obyczajow Kosciola Katolickiego (The Teachings and Customs of the Roman Catholic Church). This work is beautifully bound and contains 1238 pages.</p>
   <p>Third Prize: The Kings of Poland in Pictures and Stories. The sketches are by Eljasz [Polish artist] and the poetry is by S. Duchinska, Polish poetess; the book is published by Kozlowski, Posen.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>The Educational Department also reserves the right to offer more awards in the event that the entries warrant it. In the event that there is a lack of contestants, one or all awards may be withheld.</p>
   <p>The winning manuscripts will be published, in their entirety or in part, by the Polish press of America, as was done in the previous contest.</p>
   <p>These are the conditions of the second literary contest.</p>
   <p>In the hope that this contest will bring equally as good results as the first, we are inviting the Polish youth of America to take part in this intellectual and patriotic endeavor; for in this way it will be able to inform its elders that it thinks, works and harbors love for Poland.</p>
   <p>Therefore, dear sisters and brothers, arise and take part in this appeal; demonstrate to us that sincere and understanding thoughts about Poland lie buried in your hearts.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>In the name of the Educational Department:</p>
   <p>Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek</p>
