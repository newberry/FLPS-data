   <p>Heralded a long time ago, Dyabel, presumably a humorous newspaper, at last made its appearance today.</p>
   <p>We have had an opportunity to look over the first issue. It is a satirical sheet of scandalous tendencies, which has no right to exist in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Its special characteristics are soft, red paper, abominable orthography, a complete absence of sense or style, and millions of idiocies.</p>
   <p>Stanislaus J. Seegers is editor of the Dyabel.</p>
   <p>This newspaper will undoubtedly end where it started--in the gutter.</p>
