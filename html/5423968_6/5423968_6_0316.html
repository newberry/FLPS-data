   <p>Dear Mr. Editor -</p>
   <p>Since I have received the first number of a true Catholic paper, I cannot afford to be without one. I came to the conclusion that the information given by your paper, concerning either our adopted America or our motherland across the seas, is unquestionably the latest; besides it is presented in a popular form, easy to understand by all. It is my opinion that a newspaper edited in this manner will exert a very good influence over our countrymen and will help them to form a very good conception of matters concerning every Pole. It ought to be a most ardent wish of every one that this paper should be a welcome guest in every Polish home.</p>
   <p>Let merciful God pour His blessings upon this well-begun work, that the good seed planted by this Catholic newspaper should fall upon a good soil and bring good fruit.</p>
