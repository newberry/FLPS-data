   <p>Chicago, February 26, 1895.</p>
   <p>A few years ago a large number of people got together and proposed the building of a monument in one of our parks in Chicago to our immortal hero of two continents, Thaddeus Kosciusko. This movement received great impetus from the Polish people from the beginning, but the enthusiasm dwindled. Sporadic attempts at reviving this spirit failed. With each attempt the contributions became smaller.</p>
   <p>Our committee has finally established itself on a lasting and firm foundation, for it has already collected a substantial sum of money. And, what is more important, measures have been taken so that this fund will not be endangered, <span class="page-break">2</span>and sooner or later the aims of the committee will be realized. Our committee, with serious concern, has made an investigation of the Polish press, which has not been very favorable toward us. All of its allegations have been taken under consideration and dealt with objectively. No personal feeling has entered into their treatment, for they are regarded with the utmost respect and not with condemnation, since they express a cross section of Polish national feeling.</p>
   <p>I wish to acknowledge the fact that in reality our committee had been asleep for a certain time, as the press charges, but the causes which brought this about will probably justify the lethargy which may have been mistaken for negligence in other directions. For although the past two years of depression brought hardships to all throughout America, and brought unemployment to a large number of the Polish people, the Poles were able to muster enough strength to rally their spirit toward the making of sacrifices. Reference is being made to the contributions for Polish Day at the World's Columbian Exposition, the Polish Hospital, the many parish fairs, and the Lwow Fair. All this was no easy task amid constant unemployment, but the Polish people <span class="page-break">3</span>quietly donated pennies and dollars for the various worthy endeavors. This committee, realizing the tremendous pressure the Poles were undergoing, decided to abandon temporarily its drive for funds for the Kosciusko monument until a more favorable time.</p>
   <p>A statement showing the amount of money received is regularly published in the organ of the Polish National Alliance, Zgoda, Gazeta Katolicka (Catholic Gazette) and Dziennik Chicagoski. All the contributions accounted for in this respect are deposited in the bank of P. O. Stensland, a reputable individual, who has been endorsed by many of our leading citizens. Mr. Stensland has insured the safety of the funds. He has been purposely chosen treasurer, although he is of another nationality. This eliminates any excuses harbored by our enemies, especially a few of the Polish papers that have opposed this drive, and any unfavorable insinuations about the way the committee handles the contributions.</p>
   <p>Almost a thousand dollars (2250 gulden) has been paid out of the funds for the Kosciusko Monument Contest. The three models that received awards may <span class="page-break">4</span>be seen at our Polish Museum, 574 Noble Street, Chicago, Illinois. Mention also must be made of the five thousand dollars that has been loaned to Holy Trinity Parish at five per cent for one year. This money was loaned to the parish because of its sincere efforts to foster Polish culture through the building of a new Polish school. When a critical moment arose that threatened the completion of the school building, the committee decided to loan the money.</p>
   <p>Whatever has been done has been done openly. All of our actions have been turned over to the Polish press for criticism, and efforts have been made to remedy any objections that have been honestly and sincerely criticized. At no time were there any derogatory remarks made about the suggested changes.</p>
   <p>The Kosciusko Monument Fund Committee, which has opened the drive by substantial contributions from its directors, has been performing all its duties gratis, and it is determined to finish the work it has started with the support of the Polish public.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>At the present time it is impossible to start work on the monument because there are not sufficient funds. We have learned from past experience that once something is started with inadequate sums of money it always brings untold troubles and problems. As to the cost of the monument, this will be decided in the future. Discussions about this will be held later. However, one thing is certain--the monument which is finally erected must leave a lasting impression upon the American public. In order to attain this, there is only need of good will, desire and patriotic understanding of this project.</p>
   <p>Therefore, in the name of the Kosciusko Monument Fund Committee, I appeal to you, brothers, as spring brings with it better times, to think anew about the monument for our hero, Thaddeus Kosciusko. This action will cover our nationality with honor before the American public, and will act as a manifestation before our enemies; for although Poland has been in captivity for a century her indomitable spirit has not been defeated--rather it is reviving through sacrifices and patriotism made by her children on strange soil.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Let us become active, brothers! During this year of national mourning when the thought of ostentatious social celebration has been set aside in our patriotic hearts which are filled with this tragic loss far beyond the seas [1895 was set aside by the Poles to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the third partition of Poland], let us turn our hearts to reminiscences of Poland and the fostering of Polish spirit in America at the various planned national affairs, lectures, etc., and remember the Kosciusko Monument Fund drive. Let everyone contribute several pennies for this noble cause. God will reward the generous donors, and the monument will stand as a manifestation of the poor Polish refugees in America.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Kosciusko Monument Fund Committee,</p>
   <p>Zbigniew Brodowski, president</p>
