   <p>Work on the monumental volume entitled, Polonia Americana Album And Directory, which is to cover, by word and picture, the half-century history of American Polonia and show the results of its efforts, is nearing completion so far as gathering material is concerned.</p>
   <p>After two years of effort and of traveling the length and breadth of almost the whole United States, we have managed, with the aid of a camera, to compile the principal portion of these materials. We have more than twelve hundred photographs of our churches, schools, monuments, orphanages, hospitals, and other public buildings. It is a mass of historical and statistical material that is now being carefully classified.</p>
   <p>Having been given the official support of the Polish Association of Priests of America and the sincere goodwill of all of the pastors, newspapers, and organizations, and in addition, having in our possession nearly fifty thousand signed orders for the album and, therefore, a guarantee that the work will be carried out to a successful finish, we would like it to be as magnificent as possible, not only in its external appearance (artistic drawings and high-grade paper are assured) but also in its complete and accurate statement of our acquisitions.</p>
   <p>Today, in view of the fact that a free and independent Poland may arise at any time and take the place it deserves among free nations with its own national organization, our publication becomes something of a collective report, in which we will show our resurrected motherland by pictures, statistics, summarized histories, and names, everything that American Polonia has built in more than fifty years and what and where its resources are.</p>
   <p>Our conviction as to the significance of our publication spurs us to every effort, so that the work, which we are now completing, will not only be the most magnificent but the most complete work of its kind, and this cannot be done without the aid of the general public.</p>
   <p>The compiling of material from settlements organized into parishes was completed in a relatively short time, thanks to the parish priests; from our multifarious organizations, political, fraternal, charitable, educational, and others, we expect to receive the necessary material (such as we do not already have), by means of adequate questionnaires and advertisements in the Polish newspapers, which favor our enterprise; there remain, however, a great many Polish colonies scattered throughout the United States that are not organized into parishes but where, nevertheless, Polish life throbs. There are also thousands and tens of thousands of Poles who are far from any Polish community; and even these should be mentioned if our work is to be a faithful picture of the whole.</p>
   
   <p>In order to accomplish this, only one course remains for us--to appeal directly to them, which is the purpose of this article. In the first place, we appeal to all Poles living in cities and in American communities where there is no Polish parish, to cut out the accompanying questionnaire and, after filling it out, to mail it to our offices. Actually, there can be no thought of absolute accuracy here, and we will have to be satisfied with an approximation. If we receive a few such questionnaires from a locality, we can arrive at figures that will be most nearly correct.</p>
