   <p>We have received the following correspondence, with a request to publish it in the Dziennik Chicagoski:</p>
   <p>"Kosciusko Court, No. 285, of the Catholic Order of Foresters, at their regular meeting on February 11, debated the question of how properly to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the birth of Thaddeus Kosciusko, our immortal chief and the hero of two hemispheres--and finally decided to contribute twenty dollars from the treasury for the contemplated Kosciusko monument in Chicago. This sum will be given to the monument building committee. In addition, it was decided that the court will appear in a body at the Kosciusko celebration in the Holy Trinity parish hall. We herewith wish to acquaint the Poles in Chicago of these decisions.</p>
