   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>I take pleasure in announcing that we, the committee, visited the studio of Mr. Antoni Popiel, yesterday afternoon, and inspected his full-size model for the Kosciuszko statue. We found it an admirable work, realizing well the promise of the sketch which is throughly worthy of your acceptance.</p>
   <p>Respectfully submitted.</p>
   <p>Charles J. Mulligan,</p>
   <p>Lorado Taft,</p>
   <p>Ralph Clakson.</p>
