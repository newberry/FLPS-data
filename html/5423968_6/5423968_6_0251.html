   <p>We have learned that the Saint Stanislaus Parish will soon have a reading room in connection with its library. The room, designed for that purpose, in the new building, is nearly completed. The reading room will be supplied with various newspapers, domestic and foreign. And twice a week selected stories, poems, and other literature will be read aloud. We support this undertaking wholeheartedly, and hope the program is realized as soon as possible.</p>

   <p>The long winter evenings are already with us, and many persons instead of passing their time in saloons, will gladly accept this new entertainment in which they will find pleasure and great benefit. This will help the growth of the library and probably create a desire for reading which is unfortunately, so little practiced by us now.</p>
   <p>The management of the library complains that only a small number of people take advantage of books which were imported at high cost. This small number of readers is composed principally of young people. The number of older persons who should set an example for the young by borrowing books from the library, is so small that they can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Not even one young woman has sought to borrow a book. Have <span class="page-break">3</span>young women forgotten how to read Polish, or do they read only English?</p>
   <p>Right now, while we are writing this article, we have been informed that the reading room is almost ready and will be opened in a few days.</p>
   <p>We will inform our readers when the room is ready for use. The opening of the new quarters will increase the number of patrons of the library, and our fellow-citizens, young and old, men and women, boys and girls, will enjoy many happy and profitable hours in the new reading room.</p>
