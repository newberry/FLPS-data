   <p>If a feeling of malcontent is growing among the Polish-American people it is due to a large extent to the Polish-American press.</p>
   <p>In our ranks there is a great shortage of the element of political maturity, experience in the school of life, and possession of enough power for tact, reasoning and understanding to have the right of steering the trend of public opinion. In certain instances there is a lack of elementary honesty and decency, and at times even orthography. But at the present time we do not wish to discuss these extreme deficiencies.</p>
   <p>There is concern, however, about the better qualities of our press which must be considered; for it has an important sphere of influence, and is not dishonest in the main. But even this portion of the press has the weight of many sins on its conscience. At times it creates evil involuntarily, and often does not pursue its standard to the highest extent. The cause for this is found in part in the character and training of the representatives of the press, and in part in the unusual or special situation in which our Polish society and press may be found in America.</p>
   <p>A careful study of this situation reveals that, whereas the newspapers at large are the fruits of a combination of editors and feature writers, our papers are manned by a one-man editorial department. Our papers are too poor to employ a large staff; as a result the one-man editorial room of our papers plays all the parts of a large staff; paraphrasing Louis XIV, "I am the press." This, among many other things, is the greatest defect.</p>
   <p>In part it is individual and in part it is subjective (sic). The Polish-American editor, carrying all the work and responsibility on his shoulders, identifies himself, in short, with the paper. He accustoms himself to dictate to society its rights; he does not answer to anyone's dictates; he has the right to judge and condemn everything; he considers his personal protection above all general questions. Upon him falls the entire burden of attack against his opposition--in fact he must be responsible for everything From one side he is a martyr, from the other, an autocrat.</p>
   <p>Naturally, such a state does not add value to his work. The editor is only a person--one that is overworked, nervously overtaxed, and attacked from all sides at that. Where then can be found the peace which is necessary for pronouncing impartial views in the many daily, international and other complicated affairs? His ego is compelled to fall back on the first plan that comes to mind, with inseparable foibles and prejudices, sympathies and antipathies, and ardent personal ambitions. And the paper which should act as the tribunal of truth, light, and justice becomes a shambles of corruption.</p>
   
   <p>Unfortunately, this occurs too often. To make this clearer, a few examples will be given. (N. B. It is not our intention to accuse anyone directly, but merely to point out the character of the evil.)</p>
   <p>Editor X pursues a good and practical thought. If Y would support this it would be a success. But Y is a personal enemy of X, and then, too, he considers himself the more mature and the one to handle the situation in question. Consequently, he kills all the good thought with his irate criticism.</p>
   <p>Editor Z has evolved a plan to save humanity. If it were possible to have this copyrighted under his name he would do so. From this point on there is no other idea that he would wish to support. His idea is the horse that he rides, neglecting the wide sphere of his general work. Thus he spoils whatever good others are doing. Why? Because he wants to be a "great person."</p>
   <p>Editor Q is stricken with a liver ailment, or has some physical deficiency.</p>
   
   <p>Because of this he sees everything as dark, and even accuses everyone of dishonesty.</p>
   <p>Editor V works for a certain idea in some field of work with the utmost earnestness. At times someone is mentioned to assist in this work who is V's political enemy--or something personal is said against him. The results in either case are not very favorable. As a result of this V is ready to change into an enemy of the work he was defending. He makes accusations, ruins his own work, and casts at his allies the worst kind of nonsensical abuse.</p>
   <p>Many more examples could be given.....And this is the way these individuals carry on. They are not at all dishonest but only nervously irritated, and influenced a little by the power of their ego.</p>
   <p>It can easily be understood from these situations that it is impossible to bring about complete order in the ranks of our press at once. At times quiet and peace reigns. We start to think about co-operative and orderly work. But soon an ill wind begins to blow because of some difference..... A bolt of editorial anger strikes--and all is over.</p>
   <p>And yet we must think about removing this evil, and try to bring about a solution.</p>
   <p>A radical change would be to change the conditions of the Polish press. Make our editorial department on the same order as that of the European papers, that is, a combination of talents. More talented and important heads are necessary to bring about this reform.</p>
   <p>Before this comes about (whether this ever will is a question) we, the editors, must start an educational program among ourselves. We ought to train ourselves to such an extent that the nerve-wracking onsets and furies relative to the protection of the ego may be replaced by sincere consideration, from which can evolve profitable work for the general good of our people.</p>
   <p>The work involved in such an educational program (at least to a certain degree) is very difficult, but it is feasible. The power of the mind can do everything, and in this direction much can be accomplished.</p>
   <p>We do not wish to moralize in this respect. But we all ought to call to mind that the newspaper is not a wastebasket for the accumulation of personal differences, but a collection of valuable information, a tribune for public matters, combined with educational diversions for the people. The Polish press will reach this stage only when we will be able to discard the ego with all its weaknesses from the general matters of importance, for the benefit of the readers. We ought to make a daily effort to reach this stage.</p>
