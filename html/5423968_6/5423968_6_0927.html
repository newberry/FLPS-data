   <p>In the summer of 1918, acting on a proposal of the Federal Government, the School Council of the Polish National Alliance, decided to open special courses for soldiers of the U. S. Army, with instructions on mechanical trade at the Trade Institute of the P.N.A. College. That was the first summer course at the Alliance College, the plan of which was worked out by federal authorities.</p>
   <p>That course was a very great success and our institution was highly praised by the U.S. instructors, because, in a considerably short time many soldiers were graduated as good mechanics in all branches of trade.</p>
   <p>This year the summer course will give instructions for machinists, tool-makers and automobile mechanics.</p>

   <p>The machinist course consists of instruction in operation of lathes, milling machines, shapers, planers, grinders and drill presses, also including mathematics and blue prints. Tool-making course: Mathematics, blue prints, trigonometry and practical bench work. Automobile course: practical operation and repair of motors, transmission, ignition and operation of automobiles and tractors.</p>
   <p>The duration of the course is two months. According to our previous experience, two months of training is sufficient time to give the pupils a basic knowledge of the trade as machinists, tool-makers, or automobile mechanics and the more practical experience awaits them at real work in factories.</p>

   <p>The summer courses are organized especially for those who cannot afford to attend a regular school. Our charges for instruction are very low, write today. We employ the best experts in their line: Mr. J. S. Kozaczka, civil engineer; Mr. M. Adamaitis and Mr. E. J. Kruszka, mechanical engineers and other experts. These courses are organized not for profit but to serve the Polish workers and to help them to get a better job.</p>
