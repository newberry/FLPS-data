   <p>Last Saturday, November 19, a large number of friends of E. Z. Brodowski, former editor of Zgoda and present associate of Peter Kiolbassa, gave him a birthday party at his home on Thomas Street. Many Polish journalists and politicians attended the affair.</p>
   <p>After the dinner was over, a toast in the name of everlasting friendship was given. The party came to an end when a collection for the Kosciusko Monument Fund was taken. A fair sum was donated.</p>
