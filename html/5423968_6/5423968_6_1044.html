   <p>This was the second of a series of Sunday lectures arranged by the third commune of the Polish National Alliance at Holy Trinity Parish. The purpose of these lectures is to educate the citizens here in the most important civic matters and acquaint them with the laws here. This time Judge Edmund Jarecki lectured on the municipal courts, their sphere of action, and how to proceed before them. In his interesting lecture Judge Jarecki brought up the matter of the especially difficult position in which the Poles who do not speak English find themselves and the painful experiences they have. The large number of people gathered at this civic lecture found it very interesting. They rewarded the lecturer with great applause.</p>
   <p>The next lecture which will be on the subject of the tax system here, will be delivered by F. Koraleski, Tax Assessor, on Sunday October 18.</p>
