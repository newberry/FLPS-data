   <p>A fair crowd attended the free Sunday school class at the St. Stanislaus Kostka School Hall yesterday--more than last Sunday. This is a good indication that the subject matter has a definite appeal.</p>
   <p>The listeners took especial interest in the lecture delivered by the Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church. It was of a philosophical and theological nature, dealing with the Creator, creation, and reasoning, and the ties between man and God. Lectures presented by Stanislaus Szwajkart, Casimir Neuman, and Boleslas Klarkowski, were of equal interest. All were applauded.</p>
   <p>Between lectures the following students gave declamations: Bombera, Jakobowski, and Kipkowski.</p>
   <p>Hope is expressed that the School Hall will be filled to capacity next Sunday.</p>
   
   <p>A number of prominent Poles were in the audience at yesterday's meeting.</p>
