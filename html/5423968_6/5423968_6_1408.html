   <p>Today's issue of the Staats-Zeitung contains a very friendly article about the Kosciuszko monument. As usual before elections, especially now that the publisher of the Staats-Zeitung (W. Hesing) is seeking the mayoral nomination, the Germans are becoming more friendly towards the Poles. At any rate, whatever the motive may be the article is very complimentary. We quote a few paragraphs.</p>
   <p>"Surely no nation honors its heroes more than the unfortunate Poles, whose country was torn apart a hundred years ago. The memories of the great king Jan Sobieski and the poet Adam Mickiewicz, whose works have been translated into all languages of Europe, will always remain dear to them. But the most important place is their hearts is occupied by the great defender of liberty, Thaddeus Kosciuszko. His birthdate, the anniversaries of the battles in which he fought, are solemnly observed by his countrymen. A few months ago, a committee was organized in Chicago for the purpose of erecting in Humboldt <span class="page-break">2</span>Park a monument to this hero, who fought also for American liberty. Not only Poles, but all people who love liberty should contribute to this good work--as they probably will."</p>
