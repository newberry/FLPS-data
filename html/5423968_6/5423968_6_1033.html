   <p>The Poles of America and the citizens of Chicago desire to express their gratitude and appreciation to you for this splendid deed. The honor you are paying at this moment to the immortal hero of the oldest republic, here on the soil of the most powerful republic in the world, is the best testimony of the brotherhood that these nations have established in order to spread the principles of democracy, universal peace, and independence. [Reference is to Thaddeus Kosciusko, at whose monument reception was held.]</p>
   <p>We stand here today at the monument of a hero who is the personification of liberty. Born within the boundaries of the Republic of Poland, raised in an atmosphere of freedom, educated at a military school, he dedicated his sword and his strength to the cause of human liberty. He fought for the <span class="page-break">\2</span>freedom of America and for the independence of Poland. Both America and Poland honor his memory. And now you, Mr. Ambassador, as a representative of the new Russia, the latest member of the great family of republics of the world, have chosen the modest monument to this great man, this great hero and champion of liberty, as the place at which to honor the memory of his deeds and at the same time, to give proof that today's Russia applauds those deeds and recognizes him and honors his memory, expressing its readiness to fight for the same principles for which he fought.</p>
   <p>We know that the new Russia has expressed itself for a free Poland. We believe that free Russia desires neither to acquire new territory nor to rule over its neighbors. We take your presence here as a guarantee that the new Russia desires to correct the errors committed against Poland in the past, and that Russia will continue the struggle against our mutual enemy, shoulder to shoulder with the other free nations of the world, until the final victory of democratic principles as expressed by our great President, until the time <span class="page-break">\3</span>when victory over autocracy and despotism is certain--until the moment when victory and justice are achieved, when all nations, great or small, powerful or weak, find their places upon this earth, governing themselves, with the same rights to development as are today possessed by this great, beloved land of ours, the United States of America.</p>
   <p>The loyalty of Poles to those who sympathize with their aspirations has been known for centuries in the history of the world. The Poles in America, in gratitude for the way in which they have been received in this land, have always shown their readiness to lay down their lives for America's cause. At the present time, they are in the ranks of the American army and navy, and there are many young Poles from America in the expeditionary force now in France under the command of General Pershing. They have answered the call to arms with an enthusiasm that fills us with pride.</p>
   <p>However, there are still thousands of Poles in America who are not yet citizens, but who would also like to do their parts in this great war for humanity, <span class="page-break">\4</span>having in their hearts the hope that they, too, will have the opportunity of serving in Polish legions on the battlefields of Europe.</p>
   <p>In your country, Mr. Ambassador, a long step has been taken toward recognition of these aspirations, and Polish legions are already forming there. Your government has given the sacred Polish flags, removed from Russian museums where they have been kept, to these Polish legions. In the great sister republic of France, a similar step has been taken, and the Polish Eagle already flies before the Polish legions that have been recognized there. Polish volunteers are being trained in England and Canada, and in America; those Poles who because of noncitizenship have been barred from service in the American army are looking to the near future, with hopes that the Polish Eagle will soon fly beside the American Stars and Stripes, and that, with the official sanction of the American government, they will be able to unite with their brethren from Poland, Russia, France, and England to form a great Polish Army that, in pursuance of the ideals of our forefathers, will fight for those ideals under the leadership of men such as he in the shadow of whose monument <span class="page-break">\5</span>we are gathered this afternoon.</p>
   <p>This is an historic occasion. Not only have you placed a wreath at the foot of the monument to Kosciusko, you have in spirit placed wreaths upon the graves of thousands of Polish heroes who have died upon battlefields all over the world.</p>
   <p>Once more I thank you, sir, for this splendid act. May your mission here meet with the recognition it deserves, and may all the hopes of the Russian people be fully realized. May the union of the world's republics, old and new alike, make possible the correction of old errors and bring peace to the world, awakening the impulses of civilization.</p>
   <p>Long live free Russia!</p>
