   <p>We are informing all the Polish residents in the neighborhood of Holy Trinity parish to take part in the fair to be held in honor of Kosciuszko, to raise funds for the completion of his monument.</p>
   <p>These fairs will be held every evening at eight o'clock at the Holy Trinity auditorium</p>
   <p>We are sure that the Poles will give wholeheartedly and help us bring this dream to reality.</p>
