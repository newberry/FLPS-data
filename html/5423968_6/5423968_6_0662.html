   <p>In the very near future we will publish in the Dziennik [Chicagoski] the history of the formation of the various Polish organizations in America. We are now collecting the necessary material and at present possess a considerable amount of it. In order to get this material, we wrote letters to all secretaries of organizations whose addresses are known to us, requesting them to forward all relevant information.</p>
   <p>We do not make any exceptions on account of affiliation, it making no difference whether the organizations are independent or constitute branches of larger bodies. We are concerned only with the facts, which under no condition will be altered regardless of our likes or dislikes. We will not indulge in criticism or praise, but will present the true facts, on the basis of the information given us by the organizations themselves.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>We might have waited until all the material had been collected and arranged, and then have published the histories of the organizations in an order determined either by the size of the latter or by their location. After a more through consideration, however, we decided to abandon this plan, since it would have required too much time to gather all the necessary data. In addition, certain shortcomings in our presentation would inevitably appear as a result of the indifference or unwillingness to co-operate on the part of some of the secretaries. Consequently, we will follow no definite plan in the presentation of the material, publishing the reports of the secretaries as they come to us. Later on, after the material is all in, we will publish a resume of the histories of the Polish organizations, arranging it according to whichever plan we may decide upon.</p>
   <p>We will start publishing these histories either next week or the week after. We could begin the publication of these histories today, for, as we have already stated, we now have a great deal of material, at our disposal. This material, <span class="page-break">3</span>however, is in several instances incomplete, with the result that we are compelled to wait for the replies to our letters asking for further details.</p>
   <p>The addresses of the secretaries of several organizations were obtained from Wiara i Ojczyzna (Faith And Homeland), Zgoda, and the Reform. We do not know the addresses of all the associations belonging to the [Polish Roman Catholic] Union. Also, we lack the addresses of associations that do not belong to the larger organizations.</p>
   <p>We are therefore requesting the secretaries of these organizations to send their addresses to us, together with the required information about their organizations.</p>
   <p>We wish to thank the gentlemen who have already answered our letters, particularly those who were so courteous as to send us a list of several organizations whose addresses are not found in any publication.</p>
