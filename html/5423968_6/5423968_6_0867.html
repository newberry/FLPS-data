   <p>History of the Polish National Alliance, an edition to honor the 25th anniversary of the Polish National Alliance, written by St. Osada, has already left the press. The book is a pretty large volume of several hundred pages, in which we find the history of the general emancipation movement among the Poles in America, to which only the proper history of the Alliance is related; reference to the history of that organization, takes up evidently a considerably smaller space in this work of Mr. Osada, and in parts of it we come across some copies of very interesting documents, correspondence, portraits, statistical collections, etc. The complete book, the fruit and the result of the serious studies of the author, is an important contribution, and the contents of it will certainly be interesting to everybody.</p>
