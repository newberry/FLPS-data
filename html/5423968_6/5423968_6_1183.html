   <p>After each 'sokol' football tournament you can see that there is a lack of strong and suitable opponents. Either some teams are too strong or some are too weak, making the contests one-sided. To avoid this, the Polish societies and groups are asked to help improve and build up stronger teams to produce keener competition.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow the 'sokol' tournament comes to a close. It is the last time this year that the people will have an opportunity to see a football game. Tomorrow's contest is between the "White Eagles" and the "Falcons," at Crosse Park, at Elston and Western Avenues. The game will start at 3:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>This park can be reached by taking either the Western or the Elston Avenue street car to the gate. All people are cordially invited to attend. Admission is free.</p>
