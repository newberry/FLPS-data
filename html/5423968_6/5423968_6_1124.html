   <p>In order to help those parents who cannot personally take care of their children during vacation period, I will open a Polish kindergarten for children from four to eight years of age. The school will be under the supervision of my wife and two daughters, who were educated in Europe, and have suitable qualifications for this work.</p>
   <p>The school will open on Monday July 13, in the large garden adjoining my residence, located at 315 West Division Street.</p>
   <p>The children's time will be occupied in the following manner: Reading, story telling, garden work, all kinds of games and handwork, according to age. Good behavior will be strictly observed. Tuition will be $1.50 a month. My daughters give private lessons in music, and teach the Polish, German, and French languages for a reasonable fee.</p>
