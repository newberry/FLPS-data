   <p>The last of a series of lectures on Polish history and literature took place last Sunday, April 11, in the St. Casimir Parish Hall. Professor Kozlowski delivered the final lecture.</p>
   <p>Young men and women, as well as adults, attended these lectures. There never was a shortage of listeners. There were ten lectures in all and each was attended by at least forty persons.</p>
   <p>Today, all those who attended these lectures admit that their time was well spent. They are satisfied because they were given an opportunity to familiarize themselves with all the great kings and heroes of Poland. Besides this, they were also made familiar with the works of Polish literature and its authors.</p>
   <p>Professor Kozlowski presented the lectures in such a pleasant and interesting fashion that they will long remain in the minds of the listeners. Thanks should <span class="page-break">\2</span>be extended to the Reverend Furman, pastor of St. Casimir Parish, for making these lectures possible. The pastor not only permitted the free use of the parish hall, but also remunerated the professor for his efforts.</p>
   <p>The undersigned wishes to extend heartfelt thanks to the pastor and to the professor for their efforts.</p>
   <p>V. J. Pijanowski</p>
