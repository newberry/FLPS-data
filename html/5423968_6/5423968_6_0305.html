   <p>Every day we print plenty of news, to the disgust of our competitors (legitimate and illegitimate) and for the pleasure and the instruction of our readers. To the question "What's new?" we always answer automatically,</p>
   <p>"Only read Dziennik Chicagoski, and you'll learn everything worth knowing".</p>
   <p>By saying "only" we do not mean that we are advising you to read our newspaper exclusively; on the contrary, you should also read many other Polish newspapers, for instance Tygodnik Illustrowany (The Illustrated Weekly), from Warsaw, or other fine dailies, weeklies, and monthlies. And so our saying "only" means that we are asking you to read the paper and not to use it merely to wrap lunches with, even before it is read, which is the fate of other local Polish newspapers. This state of affairs gives rise to their melancholy complaints as well as to their never-ending deficits. And so we repeat again,</p>
   <p>"Read Dziennik Chicagoski".</p>
   <p>There is a good reason why we should say it. Of late you have been getting more good reading in our paper than ever before. For quite a while now our newspaper has been not only greatly enlarged but immeasurably enriched in content. Though we do not print our paper in red, green, or any other color....we print incomparably more material than any other journal, and it can easily be proved simply by measuring the contents. It is not the ordinary stuff that fills our paper but first rate material in the real meaning of that word, for we carefully select what we print and put it through the sieve several times. We do this, and we say it emphatically, because the space in our paper is valuable and expensive, costlier than that in other newspapers. We therefore cannot and will not print any little trifle. This is the reason why we so frequently answer, when some one asks us to have this or that "inserted" in our paper, by requesting him to have it "inserted" somewhere else. They tell us that other newspapers have printed "such stuff", but we still reply,</p>
   <p>"Let others continue to do so; we know our business, and we shall not imitate others, nor can we afford to waste valuable space in printing asininities."</p>
   <p>When, as at present, we have enlarged our paper, regardless of cost, we have done so in order to give to our readers plenty of useful material. We are striving to make this the oldest local Polish daily, appear magnificently as to form, contents, quality, and all the other points that a good newspaper should possess; we are striving to attain that level honestly and without trickery, without the cheap angling for subscriptions practiced by the yellow American press, without aping strangers, and finally without the dollar-chasing practiced here by all.</p>
   <p>Of course we do not mean that we despise the dollar when it flows toward us; we certainly shall not try to chase it away. On the contrary, we are here, as others, to make this business profitable; and we are doing it, but we are doing it honestly, and the money made by us is not stained with the stigma of exploitation, dishonesty, and swindling, as is so frequently the case with the American press and not uncommon only with the Polish-American press.</p>
   <p>Our strict and unequivocally ethical conduct hurts all the jealous people who are amazed at our success. And so they accuse us of shady intentions and practices--their own--they reproach us frequently with ridiculous accusations and in their sallies--as our competitors--against us they make up the wildest and silliest inventions, which leave us cold. The yapping of dogs we shall not stoop to answer; we are marching forward and doing quite well, thank you.</p>
   <p>And now let us come to the point. We shall print plenty of news in Dziennik Chicagoski this coming year. We shall print two novels, one taken from Reymont's trilogy, the third volums, and the other a novel by Lada, which should prove very interesting, since its theme is of current interest. Further, we have a whole string of splendid short stories, bought exclusively for us, which we shall print one after the other in our short story section. In the near future we shall begin to print a new play for the use of our amateur dramatic clubs. Finally, we have already begun to publish in our paper the history of the United States, written exclusively for us by Dr. Ladislas Wayda, a work that fully deserves the great interest which it has awakened. This is the second work by this highly esteemed author to be published by our paper; we remind our readers that last year we serialized his letters written on his voyage to Australia, entitled "Under the Southern Cross".</p>
   <p>We have also introduced a whole series of valuable departments in our paper, as for instance, the Woman's Department, the Children's Department, the Economic Department, the Literary and Scientific Section, and others. In the section of the paper devoted to current news we have introduced new features to mention only "The Last Mail" printed daily, in which information received by mail, mostly from Poland, is printed on the same day on which it is received. Our "News from Poland" is,at present, unquestionably the most complete collection of information, beginning with the most important and ending with least valuable news. Further, in "News from the Press" we print small news items gathered from the Polish and the foreign press. All this gives to our readers the contents not of one but literally of several newspapers.</p>
   <p>Finally, we must mention our section of local news, which has been enlarged to include short biographies under the title "Our own", sketches of the lives of prominent personages who have made valuable contributions to our community, and who are old friends of our paper. Here we shall also print serially the history and, the Description of the Polish neighborhoods and parishes in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Health Section will be continued as before.</p>
   <p>Several local newspapers, imitating us, tried not only to introduce a similar department but even to "beat" us, if possible, but those ambitious attempts proved futile and resulted in complete failure. We have enumerated only some of the present attractions of the Dziennik Chicagoski. We have not exhausted them, and we have not finished our innovations. We have others in reserve, and we do not lack the ingenuity requisite for inventing more. In this respect we do not fear that any competitor will"beat" us with all his bag of tricks.</p>
   <p>Every issue of our Dziennik Chicagoski will be an attraction for our readers because of its form and its pleasant and varied surprises. We shall spare neither expense nor labor. It's up to you to read it.</p>
