   <p>A third in a series of literary lectures was given last Sunday, April 11, at the Polish National Alliance Hall, by the Polish Youth Alliance, Group II. John Smulski presided as chairman and A. Jasinski as recording secretary.</p>
   <p>Addresses were given by Mr. Smulski and F. P. Danisch. Declamations were rendered by M. Brod and Mr. A. J. Kowalski. J. Gays gave a reading. Mr. Kozlowski, who said he would speak on patriotism, began to speak about socialism, and his speech was interrupted. The protest was timely.</p>
   <p>A large crowd attended the lecture; among them were many members of the Polish National Alliance. Groups I and III of the Polish Youth Alliance were also present.</p>
   <p>The foregoing information was imparted by the Sztandar (Banner), which has, of late, decided to perform useful service.</p>
