   <p>Good health not only supplies the body with energy, necessary for work, but it also helps to make the body beautiful and attractive. Real beauty cannot be improved with external applications, it comes from within. Good health is the source of real beauty. Its foundation is a healthy mind and body; and it is expressed with bright eyes, clean complexion, attractive body, and an active mind.</p>
   <p>Every girl likes to be popular. The only popular girl of today is one who is full of life, one who can swim, dance, and take active part in all kinds of open air sports, one who has sufficient energy after her day's work, for recreation. Good health-because it assures a pleasant disposition, vitality, and an alert mind, is the best ally with which to gain popularity. Proper physical exercises, fresh air, plenty of sleep, frequent baths, three full meals a day, proper posture at all times, sitting, standing or walking, and comfortable clothing-these are the factors which assure us health and good appearance.</p>
   <p>There are many forms of exercises which are helpful in the preservation of health, and for developing physical strength. Regular and systematic exercises for one year, will be necessary for good results.- Of the various kinds of exercise, walking to and from work, taking long walks, on the outskirts of the city, rowing or swimming, are some of the most beneficial.</p>
   
   <p>Of the open air exercises, basket ball, volley ball, hockey and tennis stimulate the body and mind; besides being beneficial as a health promoter they afford very pleasant entertainment. Blood circulates better, in those parts of the body which are stimulated by proper exercises; weakened muscles are also strengthened. Girls working in factories and offices or attending school do not get enough exercise; they exercise only certain parts of their bodies. Therefore, it is essential that they have special exercises for stimulating those parts of the body which are not active during the day.</p>
   <p>Fresh Air And Sleep-- It is not only essential, but it should be a strict requirement, that all work be performed in well ventilated rooms. We should spent some time, every day, in the open air. Sleep in a well ventilated room assures us much fresh air, without any special effort. Sleep provides for the mind and the nervous system, complete relaxation. A growing girl, from 8 to 9 years old, needs 8½ to 9½ hours sleep every day. An older girl may need just a trifle less.</p>
   <p>Bath-- The body exudes large amounts of impurity through the pores of the skin. To keep these pores open, it is necessary to bathe frequently in warm water and soap. A hot bath should be followed by a cold shower. If a cold shower not available it may be substituted by taking a cold sponge bath and followed with a brisk rub. A cold shower is wonderful, rubbing with a coarse towel immediately after, restores warmth, freshness and contentment.</p>
   
   <p>Correct Diet-- A healthy body requires nourishing food, taken regularly. Three meals a day are sufficient. Meals should consist of fruit, vegetables, cereals, bread,- especially whole wheat or corn bread, butter, eggs, milk and puddings. Meat once a day is quite sufficient. At least 8 glasses of water a day, proper physical exercises and proper function of the stomach will eliminate constipation.</p>
   <p>Proper Posture-- A bent posture not only mars the appearance, but also may cause headaches, stomache disorders or faulty breathing. For correct posture, the chest should be raised; the back should present a straight line from top to bottom; and feet should be parallel to each other, so that the toes point forward. A girl with the proper posture makes a good appearance, commands respect and arouses confidence.</p>
   <p>Clothing should not be too tight but comfortably warm and bright; it should be worn loosely from the shoulders. Shoes with high heels should be avoided. Low heels afford better posture.</p>
