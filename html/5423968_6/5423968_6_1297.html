   <p>Many questions are asked regarding the measurements, the shape and picture of Kosciuszko's monument. According to the model made by our Polish artist in Crakow, Mr. Chodzinski, the monument in all will be twenty-five feet high, the base will be twenty-nine feet square, and will be cut from dark granite.</p>
   <p>Kosciuszko and the horse will be one and a half times as high as their natural height, with inscriptions in both Polish and English in the best bronze plates obtainable.</p>
   <p>To complete this monument a sum of about $8,000 is needed. The committee is asking all churches, clubs, organizations and societies to run affairs, dances and bazaars to raise the much needed cash to bring this dream to reality.</p>
   <p>The Polish people should not take this plea lightly, but stop and consider that this work is being done for our hero of two countries, Thaddeus Kosciuszko.</p>
