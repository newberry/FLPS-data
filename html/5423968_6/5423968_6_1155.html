   <p>Being cognisant of the great interest the Poles take in sporting activities we appeal to all of them, to help in upholding the Polish name by giving their whole hearted support to the thirtieth annual Illinois Bowling Tournament, which will be held at the Romeo Recreation Rooms, 1133-41 Milwaukee Ave., beginning April 18, 1927. Because the Illinois Bowling Tournament Classic, was held in the Romeo Recreation Rooms the defeated competitors throughout the city questioned the facilities of the Polish establishment, for staging the tournament, which will decide the bowling championships of the State of Illinois. They even went so far as to slur the Polish name, with the remark "the Pollacks don't know enough about bowling; and the tournament will be a failure."</p>
   <p>We are familiar, through the sport pages of the Polish press, with all athletic activities of the Polish parishes. The bowling scores especially impress us. Why not send some of our Polish boys to take part in this tournament, and bring prestige to your community, as well as recreation to them. The expense is small; and the returns are great. Milwaukee Avenue businessmen are offering various merchandise prizes, besides the attractive prizes of the tournament.</p>
   <p>Mediocre bowlers have a splendid chance to win the coveted prizes by entering the boosters squads. They are placed in a squad with other teams of an equal rating; their chances are even.</p>
   
   <p>We are sure that some businessman in your community will be glad to pay the entry fee to help our Polish boys, and at the same time gain publicity for himself.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we ask your cooperation in helping us uphold the Polish-American name. It is the first time in thirty years that an establishment owned and operated by Poles has been awarded the Illinois Bowling Tournament.</p>
