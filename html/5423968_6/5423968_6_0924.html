   <p>A benefit program for the sisters of Resurrection Academy was held at the Bohemian hall, Sokol Chicago, Kedzie and 24th Street, last Sunday. The affair was sponsored by Polish groups of St. Casimir's parish.</p>
   <p>The Joyce Kilmer players were engaged. They presented an English play entitled "The Watcher at the Gate." This play was written by Anny E. Bradley and W. Roeder. The actors who participated in the play were Catholics.</p>
   <p>Although this play was presented to a Polish audience for the third time, the Bohemian hall was filled to capacity. Needless to say that this engagement was a success.</p>
   <p>The net proceeds of the play will go to the Resurrection Sisters Academy.</p>
