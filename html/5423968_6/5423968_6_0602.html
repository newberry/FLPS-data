   <p>At the present time, more than ever before, the Poles are stepping to the fore on the American political scene.</p>
   <p>As yet we have not gained materially in the fight to compete on an even basis with the other nationalities. The present unemployment problem and the recent financial crisis did not alleviate this situation among Poles, but greatly impaired it.</p>
   <p>As a nationality we have given various evidences that we are alive. We have made ourselves familiar with the many conditions of this hospitable America. Among our accomplishments, good and bad, we have given sufficient evidence of our lack of experience in the political field.</p>
   <p>The school of life through which we passed did not season us in the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>understanding of the defects and mistakes of humanity; it did not perfect within us the knowledge and power of politics, nor did it uproot from us the faults which we inherited from our fathers.</p>
   <p>The persecution and torment which we have undergone, and which were forced upon us by our enemies, have not led us to the road of harmony and unity, but to the crossroads that have split us to such an extent that if we do not awaken soon from this blind groping we will never find our way out.</p>
   <p>Arguments, disturbances, scuffles, light-minded living, mutual derision, and the throwing of mud among ourselves have today sprouted such roots that it will require a long time to uproot all of these evils, which, in the meantime, are ruining us morally and materially.</p>
   <p>Many evils, arguments and differences spring from the diverse opinions on common questions, but even more damage is done by our papers.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Our press, substantially large, just as our relations, is not as powerful throughout the world, nor is it the voice of public opinion as is the press of other nationalities. Among us the press is the ego of the editor. Reference is not made to all our papers, for not all deserve to be called newspapers, but to that portion which can be classed among the more important.</p>
   <p>The papers which aim only at slandering other persons, sowing discord and inciting commotion, do not belong to the press in the true sense of the word; and it would be better if the more important part of our press did not mention this trash.</p>
   <p>I am in full accord with Dziennik Chicagoski's opinion expressed in the article "One of the Greatest Faults of Our Press" of May 1, relative to the better portion of our press. It is true that it possesses no small amount of sins.</p>
   <p>This brings to light the lack of the element of political maturity which <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>would steer the trend of public opinion, lack of comprehensive training by the representatives of the press, and, what is worse, the fact that our papers do not represent the work of several individuals but of one person.</p>
   <p>No wonder then, says the Dziennik Chicagoski, that in practically every paper the first plan to be projected is the editor's ego. Each editor wishes to be the initial wiseacre, experienced and matured. Every editor desires to lead the way in the movement of public affairs, and although the approach by one would be the best and most practical it would fail because it not only does not find support from the other editors but instead it is attacked by them.</p>
   <p>If on the other hand one question is pushed ahead with great force by one side and does not receive immediate support from the other, the proponents of the issue will receive such compliments as will cause them nothing less than embarrassment and humiliation.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>We rarely find constructive criticism in our papers because the editors' personal motives do not always adhere to the matter in question, but only to the persons who have issued it.</p>
   <p>Everyone wishes to teach, yet no one wishes to accept the lessons. Everyone favors his own opinion and attempts to instill it in every person, and if opposition is encountered he resorts to personal attacks which, instead of helping the matter, cause it damage. As a consequence, the paper which should stand out as a tribune of truth and the seed of education and justice becomes a shamble of corruption.</p>
   <p>No wonder that there is much wrong among us. This wrong will continue until the editors stop personal polemics. They should write in such a way that the readers will learn the way to harmony, will respect mature and experienced individuals, and will learn the proper way to judge and recognize that which deserves credit, although it comes from a person of different convictions.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>They ought to teach, enlighten and protect the people, instruct them to appreciate worthy causes, and urge them to closer harmony and unity. This should be the objective of the editors of the Polish press--not the casting of stinging remarks at each other.</p>
   <p>Mutual work among our editors would create more good, but individual dislike, envy and conceit ruins all the work. Such behavior will not elevate the position of our immigrants in America.</p>
   <p>That our society has not advanced itself in late years, but instead has fallen, is the fault of our press, which has been concerned more with personal matters than with public affairs for the general good. My proposal for an editors' convention has gone for naught. Leave your ego behind and tackle the general matters, out of which good will result; and this will be a spiritual convention, beneficial to you as well as the readers who are tired of polemics and individual quarrels.</p>
   <p>In conclusion I wish to state that this article is not directed at anyone <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>in particular. It is my one desire to have our Polish press give evidence that it is not only capable of handling our own affairs but the ones at large as well. The newspapers are important documents which give our children proof of our political maturity and our work in the national field.</p>
   <p>Let the press become a school for the people and the people will become different. Today the press teachers us to quarrel and leads us to the creation of disturbances within our own ranks. No wonder then that in America the people consider us as secondary citizens.</p>
   <p>I. K.</p>
