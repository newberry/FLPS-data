   <p>The Educational Department of the Polish League has recently opened three libraries. Each library has one hundred volumes, representing one hundred and eighty works: some volumes have more than one story.</p>
   <p>The first library to be opened is located at the Polish League Agency, Mill Creek, Wisconsin. Stanislaus Szwajkart will leave for Mill Creek next week to complete arrangements and appoint officers.</p>
   <p>Details about the other two libraries will be given later. Arrangements for the fourth and fifth library are also being completed. Because of this, donations of books are needed more than ever.</p>
