   <p>Yesterday's Dziennik Polski (Polish News) writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"The [lectures sponsored by the] Polish People's University are drawing smaller crowds each time. This is a sorrowful sight."</p>
   <p>The newspaper refers to the Polish People's University, organized by the Polish National Alliance and operating at present in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Let us discuss the reasons for this state of things, as mentioned by Dziennik Polski.</p>
   <p>First of all, let us ask: Would it not have been entirely different and a fiasco avoided if the program of lectures had been less pretentious; if the type of lectures had been lowered to conform to the mental needs of our <span class="page-break">2</span>people, as we hinted in an article in our newspaper the day before the inauguration of the university? Would it not have been better if the program had included practical subjects instead of philosophy, anthropology, anatomy, history of France, etc.? Finally, the high-sounding name of Polish People's University should have been dropped and replaced by a sensible name, like "School for the mature Poles."</p>
   <p>We submit the question. Its answer is not difficult to find.</p>
