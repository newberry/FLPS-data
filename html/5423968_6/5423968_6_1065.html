   <p>Last year we had an opportunity to see how successful the Sunday school classes were in St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. It was discovered at that time that four volunteer lecturers had attracted about three hundred persons every Sunday during the duration of the classes. Close attention was paid the lectures on religion, astronomy, Polish history and literature, and American history. The speakers were never applauded too enthusiastically; however, the steady patronage was applause enough.</p>
   <p>The fall months herald the advent of winter. In their wake we would like not only to lay plans for the reopening of Sunday school but also to make arrangements for a broader program, a program that would reach all Polish parishes. We hope that the conscientious Polish priests and secular intellectuals will see the feasibility of such a plan.</p>

   <p>The first objective to the realization of such a program would be the organization of a local society or circle to help promote Sunday school attendance. The name of such group is not important at present, since as soon as it is formed, a suitable name will be easily found. The group, however, should be composed of twenty persons qualified to give lectures on the above-mentioned subjects every Sunday. These lectures, of course, would have to be systematically arranged, so that unity in each topic may be reached. Under this plan, each lecturer would have to be prepared to give three or four lectures on a particular subject. Such speakers, once having completed their series of discussions in one place, would go on to other parishes. Thus a continual rotation of lecturers would be possible in each parish.</p>
   <p>Under this plan, no volunteer lecturer would have to be prepared to give more than four lectures on his particular subject. Thus complete mastery of the matter would be easily attainable and presented to groups in various Polish parishes. School halls will be turned over free of charge for such purposes. Admission will be free as an added incentive for attendance. It is also certain that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>there will be no shortage of speakers.</p>
   <p>This thought is presented for all to consider. Who will be first to pick it up and support it is a lesser thing, as long as it starts on the road to realization. No interference will be found, and much co-operation will be offered. What has proved successful in one parish can easily be repeated in others. Many parishes throughout the United States will follow suit once this example is supported locally.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us get busy for the benefit of our Polish youth, which will make up part of the future citizens of this country. The more knowledge we may be able to impart to it, the better we will be able to make our youth understand and respect the obligations of good citizenship.</p>
   <p>Let us put heart and soul into making this plan for Sunday schools possible in all Polish parishes.</p>
