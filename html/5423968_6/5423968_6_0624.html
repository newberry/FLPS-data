   <p>Stanislaus J. Segers, publisher of the satirical local paper Kropidlo (Sprinkler) (under whose name the Dyabel (Devil) has been hiding for some time), has been sued for libel by A. J. Kwasigroch, organist of St. Stanislaus Church, before Judge LaBuy. Mr. Kwasicroch brought the charges when the Kropidlo printed an article in which he was accused of robbery and of having served a-three-year prison sentence.</p>
   <p>The story, as usual, is a base lie. Such articles have been published previously by this malicious paper.</p>
   <p>The accused Mr. Segers has been arrested and placed under a fifteen-hundred-dollar bond. He should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. This professional slander has been artistically carried out too long by the Kropidlo.</p>
