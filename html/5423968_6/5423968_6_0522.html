   <p>The last number of Zgoda (Harmony) does not give complete details of the meeting held at the Polish National Alliance headquarters relative to starting publication of Dziennik Narodowy (Polish National Daily). Our "friendly" weekly discreetly kept silent on the fact that a majority of the one hundred and six groups of the Polish National Alliance that sent their opinions were opposed to the plans of launching a daily. It was the consensus of opinion that this wild scheme would not have the slightest chance of success.</p>
   <p>Thus far only $160 has been received for the proposed sale of 1,040 shares of stock at $2 a share. The question now is, who is going to sell the rest of the stock or collect the remainder of the money, and who is going to guarantee the collection. Those present at the meeting wanted to know whether or not the declared stock (1,040 shares), at two dollars per share, actually represented <span class="page-break">2</span>$2,080, or one tenth of this amount.</p>
   <p>In order to avoid snags in the course of this plan, a license was obtained from Springfield for the committee in charge of the sales of the stock, but difficulty was met when the effort to get signatories for the stock was made. Fifty dollars was necessary for this purpose, but after a strenuous effort by the committee to get the money, only seventeen dollars was collected. This sum was hardly sufficient, and the result of various debates on this question is as follows:</p>
   <p>According to estimates made by experts, $6,000 is needed for a printing shop and beginning the enterprise. Therefore, 3,000 shares at two dollars each are necessary.</p>
   <p>Thus far no action has been taken in this direction, and barely $160 has been collected from the sale of a block of 1,040 shares. The rest is but a dream.</p>

   <p>The further one enters into the woods, the more trees one encounters; consequently, the more the suggestions the greater the difficulties. Even to the present signatories, the plans for the proposed Dziennik Narodowy were vague--but their eyes have opened and they no longer can see the possibility of success. The large majority of supporters of this idea will oppose it, and agitation will be started in that direction, even if this will not occur until the fifty dollars for the license is collected.</p>
   <p>Who will come under the present circumstances to the aid of the unfortunate initiators of an unfortunate project?</p>
   <p>It's like pouring water in a barrel and then discovering it has no bottom!</p>
