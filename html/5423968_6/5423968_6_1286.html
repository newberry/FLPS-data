   <p>We beg to follow the instructions in the above matter, to speed up the action of Congress.</p>
   <p>At present it is most important to have the bill passed by Congress for the building of a monument,which bill is now in hands of a committee called Committee on Library, which committee has to insist on the passing on the bill bearing the number 16 by the House of Representatives.</p>
   <p>The Central Committee empowered Col. Smolinski, at Washington, D. C., to have a meeting of senators and congressmen representing a large number of Polish constituents, to assist the passing of Bill 16 in due time.</p>
   <p>Local committees have to be organized which have to be in contact with the Central Committee.</p>
   <p>Countrymen, we have the opportunity to erect a monument of one of our outstanding heroes in a foreign country at the expense of the United States. We have to show by our work that Poland still lives in us.</p>
   <p>Central Committee.</p>
