   <p>The women of the Polish National Alliance will open several summer schools in various neighborhoods throughout the city of Chicago for the benefit of those Polish children who attend public schools.</p>
   <p>The purpose of these schools is to teach these children to read and write the Polish language, and acquaint them with the history of their ancestors' country. These schools will be located in the following neighborhoods: In the Holy Trinity district, in the Peabody School; at Augusta Boulevard and Noble Street, classes will be held from 1:00 P. M. to 4:00 P. M.; teacher, Miss Farbiszewski.</p>
   <p>In the Bridgeport vicinity, at P. D. Armour school, 33rd and Morgan Streets, the children will be taught to read and write the Polish language and sing Polish songs; teacher, Miss E. n. Classes will be held each week-day except Saturday, from 9:00 A. M. to 12:00 Noon.</p>
   
   <p>In the Avondale district, in the Avondale Branch building, at Milwaukee and Diversey Avenues. Children between the ages of seven and sixteen may receive,without cost, instructions for reading, writing, singing, and history of the Polish language; the teacher is Miss Kobylanski.</p>
   <p>In the Town of Lake district a summer school was opened where Polish children will be taught Polish history and language; Miss Krasowski will accept this responsibility. Classes will be held in the building of the Steward School, at 46th and Hermitage Avenue, from 9:00 A. M. to 12:00 Noon each week-day except Saturday.</p>
   <p>It would be deplorable should we fail in our endeavor; we, the women of the Polish National Alliance, therefore, appeal to all Polish parents who live in such sections where these schools are located to take advantage of this opportunity which will be very profitable to your children not only now, but in time to come.</p>
