   <p>(We have received the following letter from South Chicago for publication.)</p>
   <p>The Kosciusko Library, which is giving such great service to the Poles in South Chicago, will be divided in two parts, one for adults and the other for children and young people. Parents wishing to have their children take advantage of this library should fill out an application blank and have a property owner sign it as a guarantor or make a one-dollar deposit. This deposit will be returned to the owner whenever he gives notification that he intends to discontinue the borrowing of books. Application cards may be had at the library, 8454 Superior Avenue, South Chicago.</p>
