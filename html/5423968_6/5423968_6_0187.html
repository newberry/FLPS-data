   <p>Last Sunday, November 3, the Thaddeus Kosciusko Society held a ball for the benefit of its Polish Library.</p>
   <p>This library has been rendering a public service for some time. It contains over one hundred Polish books, many of which are outstanding literary gems.</p>
   <p>Every Pole should take advantage of the free services offered by this library.</p>
   <p>The dance was a success and the net proceeds amounted to $150.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ignowski, well-known businessman, won the door prize, a rifle. He announced that he will donate this rifle as a prize to be given at the next dance held by the Kosciusko Society.</p>

   <p>The plans of the library are progressing much better than anticipated. Credit for this should go to Mr. Pacholski, who has devoted much time to the library.</p>
