   <p>The first organization meeting of a New Polish gymnastic society in Chicago was held on Sunday, November 26, in Leon Czeslawski's hall, corner of Laurel and 32nd Streets, in Bridgeport.</p>
   <p>It will be known as "Sokol Polski Number 8".</p>
   <p>Members of Sokol Polski Number 1 were invited to this meeting. Mr. Casimir Zychlinski and Mr. Mieczynski encouraged the young men to join the new group.</p>
   <p>"How numerous are the ranks of the "Sokols" in the old country!" said the speaker. "Let them become just as numerous here in America. Exercise not only hardens the body, but the evenings are occupied profitably and the young are instilled with feelings of brotherhood."</p>
   <p>The speakers were enthusiastically applauded, and then the new Polish gymnastic society, Sokol Polski Number 8, in Bridgeport, was organized.</p>
   <p>The following administration was elected at this meeting: Mr. L. Czeslawski, president; Mr. Bemke, vice president; Mr. J. Bauer, recording secretary; Mr. C. Gieraltowski, financial secretary; Mr. C. Marczewski, treasurer.</p>
   <p>So get to work, Polish youth! Join in the greatest possible numbers. You may call on me personally or address all communications for further information to J. Bauer, recording secretary, 3230 Laurel Street.</p>
