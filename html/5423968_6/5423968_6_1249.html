   <p>A Committee arranging the erection of Kosciuszko's monument in Washington, D. C., held its meeting yesterday evening. The chairman, Mr. M. B. Steczynski, advised the committee to withhold the decision that the American Art Bronze Foundry Company is best qualified to mould and cast the group-figures for the monument, until that firm give the committee a guarantee that will completely cover the artistic production, safe delivery and accurate mounting of the group-statues on the pedestal, as demanded by the Committee.</p>
   <p>A representative of the Kyle Co. a stone-cutting firm was present at the meeting to take measurements of the statue, and to figure with the Committee on the contract to build a pedestal for the statue. Owing to the grave importance of these matters, the Committee resolved to call a special meeting, of a larger attendance, to give the subjects a more thorough attention.</p>
