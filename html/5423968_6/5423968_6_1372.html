   <p>Through the efforts of our outstanding lawyer, Max Drzemala [also Drezmal], who has been very active on the School Board, the newly finished public school located at Chicago Avenue and Leavitt Street, between Lubeck and Coblentz Streets, will be called "Pulaski Public School". This motion was made and approved at the recent meeting of the members of the Board of Education.</p>
   <p>The speakers contended that recognition should be given Casimir Pulaski, Polish and American patriot, who gave his life on the field of battle at Savannah during the American Revolution.</p>
   <p>Credit should be given to Mr. Drzemala for having this school named after Pulaski.</p>
