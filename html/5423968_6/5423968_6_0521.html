   <p>The editors of Dziennik Chicagoski are preparing a special illustrated edition of their newspaper, for the end of the year, December 31.</p>
   <p>They want to encourage editors of other newspapers to cooperate in producing this number, and invite other "knights of the pen" and anyone wishing to contribute, to send in their work before December 24. Articles can be either political, of general interest, historical, travel, or stories about Polish settlements.</p>
   <p>For the best article not over 300 lines of print, also for smaller articles not over 60 lines, a reward is promised, which, although modest, is very useful.</p>
