   <p>The author of this article, in reviewing some of the Polish-American newspapers which pose as having a pretext of leadership over the others, has frequently read the bombastic phrase: "Education of the people." Every editor who takes over a newspaper makes the most lengthy comments on the need of reformation in our press. He accuses his colleagues of lack of qualification, charges them with inconsistency, ill will and the like. He, himself, on the other hand, promises constant adherence to an avowed course, and promises to extend his efforts only in behalf of the American people. This praiseworthy attitude, however, soon undergoes a change. The highly enthusiastic editor fails to fulfill his administrative oath, which was solemnized by the words--"so help me God." He more often selects the different paths leading to money. Enlightenment is then set aside as being inopportune. The newspaper finally becomes a mere copy of the other papers, differing only in name.</p>

   <p>By reading only one of our Polish-American newspapers, one can truthfully say that one has read them all. And what about the promises? How many Polish-American newspapers are there in America? True, there are a score of them, but have any of them kept within the scope of their assigned sphere of action? The personal ambitions, greed, and desire for a sudden amassing of wealth, like weeds, smother the mere budding of the good intentions of the vigorous crusader. In a Don Quixotic fashion, he begins to war with windmills and works to the detriment instead of the welfare of this countrymen.</p>
   <p>What, then, can the besmirching of the private lives of our scholars and their past create? What gain can accrue from the differences of other people or from the arguments of the editors, which, at times, occupy several lengthy and expensive columns? Of what benefit can these be to others? There are people of good will among the Poles, who endeavor to fulfill their obligations conscientiously. These, however, are few in number. The news of their efforts is lost in spacious columns dedicated to the results of administrative elections, meetings, announcements of societies and the like, or, what is even worse, to a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>comical (if not painful) game of reciprocal face slapping by the "knights of the pen."</p>
   <p>Gentlemen! I am not, in truth, a literary person by vocation, and much less an editor or an aspirant for that position (I assure you of this, on my word of honor). As a person of a little more foresight, I note and state that you are far from the goal toward which it is your duty to aspire. Cease your private arguments. Set aside your self-love and personal ego. Don't work merely for money or glory, but with a view that your efforts may be beneficial to the people. It is time to terminate your scandalous antics. Cease making the other the greater sinner that you may appear "whiter." Give greater care to the selection of this mental food which can be either poison or health-giving medicine to the people. You gentlemen have combined in some type of an organization, but to me it seems to be ineffective. That is unfortunate. This union would be good and greatly beneficial, providing it did not end in factionalism. We have had enough of this! If such union does exist, then we will heartily exclaim: "long may it live!".</p>

   <p>Although unasked, for once I have taken it upon myself to give counsel--I cannot, however, omit one further statement. Everyone will admit that the Dziennik Chicagoski and the Faith and Fatherland are the two newspapers closest to the Polish-American ideals. The more wholesome work and conscientious administration of these two papers are deserving of recognition. Although there are people of ill will who would obstruct our activity, they should be disregarded in their outbursts of jealousy and personal unwillingness, while the good work should continue to progress. These two newspapers serve so great and so holy a cause that they cannot and should not deviate from their once chosen course merely to satisfy individuals. Thus far, they are the leaders among the Polish-American newspapers. They should not work only with a view toward material profit but also for the benefit of its readers. Believe me, if the writings of J. Verne were not interesting, the works of Kraszewski, the poems of Mickiewicz and many other Polish authors would bring greater reward. Nature studies, the discussion of old inventions and the noting of new discoveries, with particular reference to those of Polish origin, would be more desirable than a list of the societies of some particular faction. Thus my advice is: increase the scope of your educational work as much as possible; in <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>your columns under the heading of "Feuilleton," print the works of our authors and do not order the annihilation of those articles. These two departments--"Feuilleton" and educational topics--should be printed in supplements so that a collection of them could be bound and preserved.</p>
   <p>I trust that you gentlemen will accept this counsel in a favorable light since it comes from the heart of a well-wishing individual, from one who allows himself the liberty to offer you advice. This he does because, on several occasions, he has investigated the opinions and views of others regarding this matter.</p>
   <p>I conclude with the words: "Let not my plea remain as the voice of one calling in the wilderness.".</p>

   <p>(This newspaper has submitted the above correspondence without change, thereby indicating that it is ever attentive to the voice of its readers and is not antagonistic to criticism. It does, however, reserve the right to recommend to the author that he listen first to many voices that he may later be in a better position to give a proper decision. We hear these voices frequently. There are many readers who prefer political articles; others, again, desire information from their mother country; still others, favor brief local news, etc.. The newspaper must endeavor, as much as possible, to satisfy all its readers and it, therefore, cannot dedicate all its space to educational articles. When the Dziennik Chicagoski becomes sufficiently developed to be on a par with the English type of newspaper then sufficient space will be found for everything.</p>
   <p>Verne's story has been printed in this newspaper upon the direct request of its readers. The original Polish tales, such as: "The Tomb's Cross" (Krzyz Mogilny), "The Gray Dust" (Szary Proch), and others, have been printed in the Dziennik Chicagoski at some previous date. As soon as the Verne serial is completed, this newspaper will begin to publish the already prepared work of Boleslawits, entitled: "The Wanderers.")</p>
