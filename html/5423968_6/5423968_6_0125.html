   <p>In 1891 Dr. Harry Kalusowski, resident of Washington D. C., summoned the representatives of the Polish National Alliance and offered them his private library his rich museum collection and beautiful numismatic and archaeological specimens, and the representatives of the Polish National Alliance gave him a solemn promise that the library and the museum initiated with his noble gift would be continued and funds provided for its continued growth.</p>
   <p>A year later, in April 1892, the library was opened in two rooms on the second floor at 1154 Noble St. Later the library was moved to the headquarters of the Polish National Alliance at 1406-08 W. Division St.</p>

   <p>An appeal was issued to Poles in America for gifts of books and specimens for the Museum. Individual members and groups of the Polish National Alliance from different cities and states of America began to send gifts and donations for the new institution of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>A festive opening of the library and museum took place October 22, 1892. The first librarian was Miss Helen Sawicka.</p>
   <p>The list of the books in the library at that time was as follows:</p>
