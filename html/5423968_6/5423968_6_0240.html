   <p>It is with great pleasure that we wish to announce the fact that the donations to the Polish National Museum and Library have not ceased pouring in.</p>

We name a few, such as Mr. Czaplinski, who donated Webster's Dictionary, in English; Mr. Stanislaus Walewski, who gave seven volumes of Tarlo; Mr. Wendycz gave Licht und Schattenbilder Des New York Lebens, by James McCabe; the Kosciuszko Organization offered the complete works of J. I. Kraszewski, consisting of sixty-one books; and Mr. S. Nicki gave a piece of metal from the original coffin in which Adam Mickiewicz the greatest Polish poet, was buried.</p>
   <p>For these gifts we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
