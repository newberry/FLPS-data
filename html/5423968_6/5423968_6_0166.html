   <p>To the Honorable Societies and Groups of the P. N. A in Chicago and vicinity:</p>
   <p>Because the funds of the library of the P. N. A. which were obtained from the summer picnics of last year were used up by the purchase of books and the paying for binding of same, the board of directors, in order to provide the library each year with a new supply of books, the shortage of which we feel, decided to get funds for that purpose and is preparing, together with the management of the P. N. A., a grand picnic on the 9th of August, 1903, in the most beautiful of Chicago neighborhoods, Brand's Park.</p>
   <p>We trust that the societies and groups of P. N. A. also this year will not decline from the support of such useful purpose, which is the enlightenment of the people.</p>
   <p>The board of directors requests the honorable societies and groups not to arrange for that day any amusements, in order to avoid hindrance to this undertaking of the board of directors.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>The Board of Directors.</p>
