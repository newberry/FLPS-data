   <p>We have already written of the creation of a fund for literary competition. We have the pleasure of informing our readers now that this plan has taken definite shape. The foundation has been organized and announcement of the first competition appears below.</p>
   <p>"Announcement of the Competition Committee</p>
   <p>"This announcement is addressed to our countrymen in general and particularly to Polish societies, especially dramatic societies or such societies as present theatrical performances.</p>
   <p>"No one can deny that literature, if it is to perform its entire duty, must present a faithful picture of the life of a given element of society. We American Poles have already ceased to recognize ourselves among the types appearing in the contemporary literature of our homeland. Living as we do in another hemisphere, under different political, economic, sociological, and even climatic conditions, our general character has changed to a certain extent. So have our habits of thought changed, our manners and customs, even our language, which has acquired new virtues and new faults. Thus, the literature of our homeland is no longer adequate, and a real need arises for the creation of our own literature, based upon the lives of our countrymen here in America. Such a literature will constitute a school that will teach a greater love for drama and books, at the same time giving our brethren across the sea a better opportunity of acquainting themselves with us, thus strengthening the bonds between ourselves and our homeland.</p>
   <p>"But is it possible to create a literature of our own under present conditions? Do we have the requisite literary talent? Indubitably. There are a great many talented people among us who could work profitably in this field. Unfortunately, in the constant struggle for existence, they cannot devote their time to anything in which there is no hope for material gain. We say "no hope" because there is practically no market here for original literary work; therefore nobody attempts to write.</p>
   <p>"There is only one remedy for such a state of affairs: a prize competition. The hope of winning a money award will undoubtedly prove a stimulus for those who have any ability in this field.</p>
   <p>"Accordingly, a competition committee has been organized, consisting of M. Drzemala, chairman, Sigmund Slupski, secretary, Peter Kiolbassa, treasurer, J. Xelowski, and M. La Buy.</p>
   <p>"The committee has already acquired the necessary funds for a start and it hopes that with the proper support of the public, it will be able to announce two competitions yearly in novels, short stories, or satires, or in playwriting dealing with Polish-American life, perhaps even in scientific discourses on subjects of general interest to American Polonia.</p>
   <p>"The committee, therefore, having demonstrated the usefulness of the task it has undertaken, appeals to the public in general and especially to societies and dramatic organizations. A contribution by the last-named in particular may prove something of an investment, for the public will no doubt hasten to view prize-winning plays, thereby bringing profit to the theater. Only such societies as make voluntary contributions to the Foundation will be permitted to produce prize-winning plays; independently of initial contributions, each society will be required to pledge a certain percentage of its receipts from every performance to the fund. This percentage may not be less than two dollars, and when a given society has contributed a total of ten dollars, it will be permitted to produce the play that wins first prize. A total of six dollars in percentages will entitle the society to produce the second prize play, four dollars, the third. Societies which make no initial contributions, however, will be given the privilege of producing prize plays only upon payment of thirty, eighteen, and twelve dollars, respectively. The plays will be copyrighted and will remain the property of the Foundation.</p>
   <p>"Aside from the above payments, the committee will accept gratefully all contributions that private individuals or societies may wish to make. These will be publicly recognized in the Foundation's semi-annual financial statements, to be published in at least two Polish newspapers in America. At present, the treasury contains four hundred dollars in cash.</p>
   <p>"Each competition will be designated by the name of a famous Pole, whenever possible, by the name of a famous Pole in exile. Since the 350th anniversary of the publication of Copernicus' epoch-making discoveries and of his death falls this year, the first competition will bear the name of Nicholas Copernicus.</p>
   <p>"In order that the next competition may be announced as soon as possible, the committee asks that all societies wishing to participate, respond immediately. All communications should be addressed to the secretary of the committee, Sigmund Slupski, 207 West Madison Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   
   <p>"The Nicholas Copernicus Literary Competition For American Poles</p>
   <p>(Conditions)</p>
   <p>"Inasmuch as the purpose of this competition is the development of local literary talent, only such entries will be accepted as are submitted by authors who have lived in the United States for the last two years. Those who have arrived here later than two years ago may compete only for honorable mention.</p>
   <p>"Only short novels, satires, and human interest stories between one and two thousand forty-letter lines [10,000-15,000 words] in length, based on Polish-American life, will be accepted. Entries will not be judged by their length, and must be within the prescribed limits.</p>
   <p>"There will be three money awards, namely: first prize, $100; second prize, $75; third prize, $30.</p>
   
   <p>"Every manuscript ought to carry a special mark or number besides its title. This same mark or number should appear on a sealed envelope, included with the manuscript, which will contain the author's name and address. These envelopes will be opened only in the event that a manuscript is awarded a prize. The names of all authors who do not receive prizes will remain secret. Manuscripts will be returned to their owners upon proper identification. To facilitate return of a manuscript, a mark of identification known only to the author and to the secretary of the committee should appear on the envelope. Every author should designate on this sealed envelope whether he desires the judges to be chosen from amongst American Poles or from amongst well-known literary men in Poland, that is, Cracow. Final decision on this question has been left to the authors themselves, who are, after all, most concerned. The will of the majority will prevail.</p>
   <p>"Illegible manuscripts will not be accepted. All manuscripts not receiving awards that are not called for within two months of the date on which results of the competition are announced, will either be destroyed together with the accompanying envelopes, or placed in the Museum.</p>
   <p>"Prizes will be awarded three months from the date on which results are announced. This is necessary in order that the judges have time to discover any possible plagiarism. If it should happen that an award is not called for within three months of this date, the money will be returned to the Foundation and the author will lose all rights to his work; the work will be the property of the committee. The rights to all other works that receive prizes will remain with the authors, and the committee will even endeavor to find a publisher for them.</p>
   <p>"Manuscripts must be submitted to the secretary of the committee and must be postmarked before September 1, 1893. The committee will not be responsible for any unregistered material.</p>
   <p>M. Drzemala, president.</p>
   <p>Sigmund Slupski, secretary.</p>
   <p>Address: 207 W. Madison Street. Chicago."</p>
   
   <p>Dziennik [Chicagoski] will return to a discussion of this competition in a later issue with a number of appropriate suggestions.</p>
