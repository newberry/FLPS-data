   <p>The newspaper known as Reforma has already appeared under a new editorship. The editor of this weekly paper, as is known, is Mr. Kazimierz Neuman, former editor of the Milwaukee Kuryer Polski, who also presents his program in his introductory article of today's Reforma.</p>
   <p>In another article he criticizes the Dziennik. He states that there exist associations which have their special aims, and have nothing to do either with patriotism or religion, and, hence, there can also exist an organization that would be purely Polish politically, in whose constitution there would be no word of religion. Consequently, according to the new Reforma, the Dziennik has made "much ado about nothing," when in its article it discussed the proposal of New Life. In this instance we do not agree with the Reforma and we note here that it is inconceivable to have Polish politics completely severed from the religious feeling of the Poles, upon which political stand Poland has based her principles for as long as she has existed. Look at the Constitution of the Third of May. We have already discussed this situation.</p>

   <p>A new weekly periodical, known as the Telegraf, whose editor is the former editor of Reforma, did not make its appearance. The "trial number" was to have been presented today but because of the tardiness of the various contributors, it will first appear on Tuesday.</p>
