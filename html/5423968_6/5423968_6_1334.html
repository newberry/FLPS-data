   <p>A meeting of the main committee, together with subcommittees from Saint Stanislaus Kostka and Saint John Cantius parishes, was held yesterday.</p>
   <p>As everybody knows, this grand Polish manifestation will be held on July Fourth at Schuetzen Park.</p>
   <p>Various important decisions were made at this meeting concerning the affair.</p>
   <p>It was decided not to tax the societies taking part in the festival. The societies are not to go to any extra expense for music. The arrangement committee has already hired one great orchestra, which will be sufficient for all.</p>
   <p>Further, it was decided to order 10,000 special badges at the expense of the committee, and so that the expenses be kept at a minimum, these badges are to be of paper.</p>
   
   <p>Every person with a badge will be admitted to the park free of charge.</p>
   <p>A committee of three was selected to order the badges.</p>
   <p>It was further decided to give full publicity in all Polish newspapers to the actions of the committee.</p>
   <p>The committee assigned to Saint Adalbert Parish reports that Reverend Radziejewski had promised to support the cause most energetically, and that he is calling a parish meeting on May 10.</p>
   <p>There followed the reading of correspondence from societies announcing their desire to take part in the manifestation.</p>
   <p>These are the Holy Cross Society, the Saint Joseph Society, the Saint John Cantius Society of Saint John Cantius Parish, the Harmony Society (Group 4 of the Polish National Alliance), and the Saint Anthony Society.</p>
   
   <p>We wish to mention that persons not belonging to any society may purchase tickets at twenty-five cents each from the following Poles in Saint Adalbert's community:</p>
   <p>J. Napieralski, 68 W. 17th Street; F. Wolowski, 775 South Ashland Avenue; M. Baranski, in Pulaski hall, and A. Blaszczynski, 648 West 17th Street.</p>
   <p>The committee will shortly announce where the societies are to meet in the various sections of the city and where they will be joined in order to enter the park. The committee will make arrangements with the surface lines in order to assure a sufficient number of streetcars for all who desire to participate in the manifestation.</p>
