   <p>We wish to draw the attention of our readers to the new section which we have introduced in Dziennik Zwiazkowy, having the title "Polemics." This section is open to anyone who wishes to express his opinions and viewpoint on any social, national, or Alliance questions. We will be glad to receive any contribution and to publish it in this section, provided, naturally, that the article does not contain personal sallies, names, attacks, lies, or insinuations. Polemics and criticisms are beneficial and necessary, but they must be based on truth, facts, and love for the cause which they defend, and not seasoned with spite, falsehood, and distortion of facts.</p>
   <p>We therefore invite our readers to co-operate, and to send in their valued remarks and observations; this will greatly raise the standard of our publication and will benefit all of us. Yesterday we published the first article, which dealt with parochial schools,in the section "Polemics," and we are awaiting further contributions. Who will be the next?</p>
