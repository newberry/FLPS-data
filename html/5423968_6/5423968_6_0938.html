   <p>Yesterday evening, the commercial school inaugurated by the polish Polative Corporation was officially opened. The large hall on the seventh floor of the Polative Building on Milwaukee Avenue was completely filled with students, stockholders and their friends at eight o'clock. So great was the crowd that there was not room in the hall for everyone. There were many old and experienced Polish businessmen, large numbers of young men who desire to enter the commercial field, and many women who are interested in the development of Polish business and industry.</p>
   <p>The exercises were opened by Mierzynski who, in a long address, showed the benefits that can be gained from a commercial course. He also called attention to the need for Polish businessmen here and in Poland.</p>
   <p>Dr. J. Jankowski, president of the school board, spoke about the teaching personnel of the school. He said that the lecturers will be seven volunteer teachers who have offered their services free.</p>
   <p>Walter Kulanko then explained, in a few words, the benefits he had derived from the last three-months course offered by the Polative school. He said that he would not give up the education he received in that short time for a hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>W. Perlowski then delivered a long and beautiful address. He presented business as something sacred, as the force that will raise our nation. He summarized his own efforts in the field of business, his struggle for existence among people of other nationalities, and he showed that a great future lies in business. "Work and think", he said, "and you will one day be as rich as I am. Fix your eyes upon that statue of Liberty that stands upon our building. It stands there to testify to the triumph of Polish business amongst Jews".</p>
   
   <p>The secretary of the school board, Urbanski, then read a paper on thinking in business, following which Ulanowski, secretary of the Polish Businessmen's Association and proprietor of the Progress Clothing Company, proved, in a short address, that Poles should overcome the competition of other nationalities, for only business can place us in such a position that others will have to reckon with us.</p>
   <p>Francis Wydra then spoke, urging perseverance in this work that has just begun.</p>
   <p>The subject of the return of Poles to their homeland was extensively discussed by S. Zalewski. In his opinion, a great wave of Poles will return to Poland after the war is over. They will need to take something with them from this side of the ocean, and it will be best if that something can be a professional education, which has a value not to be reckoned in dollars and cents.</p>
   
   <p>It would be difficult to describe the atmosphere that prevailed throughout the evening. Often the speeches were interrupted with bursts of applause and cries of "Bravo!"</p>
