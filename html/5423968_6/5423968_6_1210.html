   <p>In answer to Mr. Z.: You wonder, sir, why Dziennik Chicagoski does not publish news of the "famous" prize fights in New Orleans. We omit news of this kind purposely, since fist fighting for money ought to be regarded as one of the most deplorable and immoral pastimes in America. At any rate, prize fighting, fortunately, does not interest our people.</p>
