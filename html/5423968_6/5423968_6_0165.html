   <p>The brotherhood Youth of St. Joseph, from St. Stanislaus, donated the sum of one hundred dollars, also collected an additional four hundred, with which they will establish a Polish lending library. The books are being secured from Europe, and will be designated for the use of the Poles in the parish of St. Stanislaus.</p>
   <p>For the occasion of establishing this lending library, there was held yesterday a musical concert in the parochial hall.</p>
   <p>There was a great variety presented on this program. Father J. Ziemba and Mr. Casimir Neuman were the speakers. Mr. F. Gorski, J. Gorski and B. Szczuka, played their mandolins and guitars, the Nerings sang a wonderful duet. In the presence also was the parochial choir singing Mr. B. Debinski's composition, "To a Song," and "With a Toast," and later Mr. St. Godzich recited a humorous monologue, "My Nose." The orchestra conducted by Frank Kondziorski presented a group of many wonderful melodious tunes.</p>
