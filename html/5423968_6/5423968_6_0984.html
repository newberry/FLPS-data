   <p>The first Polish school of photography in America has just been opened by the well-known artist and photographer John W. Idzikowski at his place of business, 433 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this school, according to Mr. Idzikowski, is to give training to those interested in this field, so that they may have a future in photography and be in a position to succeed in America. There are over one million Poles in this country and only three Polish photographers, whereas a million Germans have 445; Italians, 305; French, 210; and Irish, 150.</p>
   <p>Aside from medical photography, as well as astronomical and judicial, which requires more intensified training, practical photography embraces four branches, namely: technique of picture taking, laboratory work, retouching, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and copying. All four branches are essential, and when a photographer is unfamiliar with them his pictures will be such that a brother would not recognize his brother nor a daughter her mother. Not even the most modern and richest decorations, accessories, ornaments, flowers--even a hair stylist--will help if one does not possess the required artistic training, for the public will soon recognize inferior work.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that the students receiving training under Mr. Idzikowski's supervision will receive the best instruction in artistic and practical photography, for he studied under such men as Nadar, Angerer, Bergamasco, Abdullo, Taber, and Moreno.</p>
   <p>The best of success is extended to Mr. Idzikowski, and we support his idea for the good of the Poles of America.</p>
