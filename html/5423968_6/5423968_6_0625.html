   <p>Every newspaper ought to make an effort above all to awaken the greatest number of intellectuals in society, to encourage them to avail themselves of their position, and stimulate them to activity, education and understanding of their position and duties in life.</p>
   <p>Every paper throughout the world, including the United States, ought to live a general life, not an individual one. The papers should not be primarily concerned with their own individual desires and private ventures. Each newspaper ought to feel and understand all the needs that may arise in society during the course of time.</p>
   <p>If the journalist will always and everywhere step out as a citizen, if in his articles he will consider beforehand the kind of words that will reach <span class="page-break">\2</span>the general reader, if he will take note of his true usefulness along with the purpose of his aims, and the steps by which these aims are to be achieved, if the demands and needs of society will be his goal and not the applause of a thoughtless crowd, only then will his purpose be carried out faithfully, only then will he be a useful doer for society.</p>
   <p>....Onward! Onward toward the sun!</p>
   <p>Darkness is our constant foe!</p>
   <p>There where the light is the brightest--</p>
   <p>That is where truth lies, that is the place of God!</p>
   <p>One of the first duties of a newspaper ought to be the awakening of the people toward education.</p>
   <p>The journal ought to spread far and wide the fact that education for all is essential to life, just as bread and water, as sleep and activity, as health and thought; but it ought to support only the true culture, supported by <span class="page-break">\3</span>eternal truth.</p>
   <p>He who desires culture for all certainly does not have his personal interest at heart, and so will profit sooner or later from it. Knowledge is power; it alone can give a lasting foundation upon which it is possible to build moral and material success.</p>
   <p>The second important obligation of the press, especially the Polish press, ought to be its interest in youth. It should work in the direction of helping youth by stimulating it to unity and activity and by awakening its hearts and thoughts toward the ideals of nationalism. The saddest and most often-repeated folly committed by our Polish youth is its utter disregard and disrespect for our past and our national life. This, however, is not true of all our youth. A good portion of the younger Polish people, according to reports, have a warm and sincere feeling toward nationalism. We also know how to draw the remainder into our fold and encourage them to become active.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>But this work must be intellectual and constructive. It is not wise to hold the truth from youth. Yet if it is to be imparted to them, one must not only be deeply convinced about its results but also be able to watch over it, as in administering medicine; for sometimes the organism may not respond to the curative measures, and may develop into a more serious problem.</p>
   <p>Love for youth, along with patient work with youth, is of primary importance. Let us do as the poet says:</p>
   <p>Let us on our garden plots</p>
   <p>A small plant start to grow,</p>
   <p>Thought the smallest blade may sprout,</p>
   <p>Or start a small spark aglow...</p>
   <p>And night will turn into day.</p>
   <p>This day.this glowing of hearts and minds, I sincerely wish to all of <span class="page-break">\5</span>our youth and all of us, for youth is our future!</p>
   <p>B. Klarkowski</p>
