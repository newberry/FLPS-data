   <p>The most outstanding Polish industry in America is that of journalism and typography. There are ten Polish dailies, and about forty Polish weeklies and monthlies, that have their own printshops, with about twenty-five miscellaneous printing establishments. The grand total of these Polish journalistic and typographical enterprises is about Seventy-five, and in round numbers, employees are as follows:</p>
   <p>Seventy-five editors and news reporters; 800 adult typesetters, pressmen, dispatchers, bookkeepers, local agents, clerks, stenographers, etc; 1,000 school boys, acting as messengers and errand boys, and an army of traveling news and book agents.</p>
   <p>A total of about nine million dollars in salaries is paid out yearly to those employed in the various branches of the newspaper and publishing <span class="page-break">2</span>industry. If we add to this sum the salaries of expressmen, craftsmen and mechanics, we may safely say that about one million dollars, is paid out annually from the printing and publishing industry into the hands of Polish employees and cooperators; and that the yearly expenditures of Polish newspapers and printshops in America reach the sum of about two million dollars.</p>
