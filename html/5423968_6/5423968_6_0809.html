   <p>We have before us a new Polish monthly entitled Ekonomia, official organ of the Polish Merchants and Manufacturers Association in Chicago, Illinois. In spite of that the title does not please us and we would rather have it named "Merchant" the monthly presents itself very good to the readers in regard to its contents and very "attractive" for the editors in regard to advertisements. The monthly is edited by Stan. Jakiel, a well known and conscientious worker in the publishing field. The address of the publication is Ekonomia Publishing Company, 1124 N. Robey St., Chicago.</p>
   <p>We wish the editor success.</p>
