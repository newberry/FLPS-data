   <p>The Polish Academists Society has held its first meeting Sunday, Feb. 3. The chairman for this session was Mr. F. Piotrowicz, a student of law attending the University of Chicago, and secretary Mr. Edward F. Czeskawski, a student of medicine at the State University.</p>
   <p>After discussing the cases concerning this organization, the chairman chose a committee to make a constitution for this society. The committee consists of the following members: R. Ostrowski, medical student, chairman of the committee; M. Goy, medical student; Ed. Kaczmarek, medical student; W. W. Nowacki, dental student; R. Orzechowski, medical student; Dr. Kobus, J. Paszkiewicz, technical student; T. Morowski, student of pharmacology; S. Staszak, also a student of pharmacology.</p>
   <p>At this meeting they enlisted eighteen new members. This increasing number of members denotes that the Polish youth, educating themselves, are familiar and recognize the worth and importance of education. Poland the distinct being a derelict from its reality, has sons at least who try and preserve in their Polish souls with their entire strength the hope of nationalizing all of the Poles.</p>
