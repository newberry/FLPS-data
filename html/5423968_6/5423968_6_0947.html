   <p>In the Polish Falcon, official organ of the Alliance of Polish Falcons, we read that on March 21 the Alliance will open a military school at Cambridge Springs, Pennsylvania. All the most influential people and representatives of our Polish organizations in America have been invited to attend the opening ceremony. Ignace Paderewski, master of tone, the most deserving Pole of today, will probably attend also.</p>
   <p>What is the purpose of this school? The Sokol Polski (Polish Falcon) answers this question as follows: "We all expect a great deal from the Military School, and cherish the firm belief that it will produce the hoped-for results not only for the Falcons but for all our immigrants and for our homeland as well. This will be the first military school since the time of the famous Cadet School at Warsaw during the time of King Stanislaus August Poniatowski, of which Thaddeus Kosciusko was a product, and which produced such patriots as Lukasinski, Wysocki, and other figures of the November Insurrection.</p>
   
   <p>"This will be the first Falcons' officers training school under the exclusive direction of Poles. It will be financed by the contributions of our immigrants and will constitute the most praiseworthy acquisition of our Falconry in the half-century of its existence. We look with pride upon this product of our peregrinations in a foreign land, and believe that the new school will constitute another milestone on our Falcon order's road to progress. "We cherish the firm belief that with the continued generosity of our immigrants this school will fully answer its purpose by sending forth at proper intervals new corps of soldier-citizens who will love their country above all else, who will be ready to sacrifice their lives for it, and who will be loyal and determined champions of the Falcon ideal--the ideal of the physical and spiritual rebirth of the nation[Poland].</p>
   <p>"But in order that this school may become a real officers training school, in order that it may fulfill our hopes and dreams, we must all get to work most energetically at collecting funds for its support. What we have so far contributed and collected is merely a drop in the bucket and it will suffice only for the opening of the school and for running it for two or three months. That is why we call on all Falcons to begin to take up collections with renewed energy for the continued support of the school. The school, in turn, will repay our immigrants by training new groups of soldier citizens, real Polish knights capable of organizing millions of fearless champions, men who will know how to establish and keep in their entirety the boundaries of the future united and independent Poland free from all foreign protectorates."</p>
   <p>There is nothing that we can add to this. We can only express the hope that this Officers Training School at Cambridge Springs, where the first Polish national school has been in existence for the past five years, may get the support of our entire immigrant group, so that it can fulfill the purposes for which it is being established. That it is needed is proved by the fact that more than a hundred young men have already applied for admission to the school. Therefore we wish it the best of luck and complete success.</p>
