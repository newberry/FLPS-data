   <p>Plans for a meeting of Polish newspaper editors are nearing completion. More and more journals are favoring the undertaking, and there is hope that such a meeting will soon take place.</p>
   <p>Many Polish journals have already expressed their opinions as to the proper subject of discussion at such a conference. Some of these opinions are amusing, like the one expressed by Przyjaciel Ludu (Friend of the People), which was corrected by Kuryer Polski of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Nowe Zycie (New Life) has also made comments upon the proposed meeting. In fact, only a proportionately small number of journals is indifferent to this undertaking or opposed to it. We too will take the liberty of making a few remarks.</p>
   <p>Such a conference cannot in reality be brought about by an editorial campaign in the newspapers. We know that some newspaper editors do not read any paper other than their own; they would be surprised to find that a plan for such a conference exists. We also know of others who probably would take part in such a conference, but who do not wish to be inconvenienced by taking any part in the arrangements for it.</p>
   <p>It will be necessary to send, as soon as possible, to the editorial staffs of all Polish newspapers, either invitations to this conference or questionnaires about it. But who should send these invitations? Who should sign them? We know very well that there exists among us a form of jealousy in respect to these matters.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we suggest that the editors of Kuryer Polski, originators and vigorous supporters of this plan, contact two other newspapers, to be chosen by themselves--though we suggest that they choose the oldest ones--and ask them for permission to use the signatures of their editors on letters which will be sent out by the editors of Kuryer Polski, whose own signatures will, of course, also appear.</p>
   <p>It would be advisable to explain in these letters the object of this conference and the necessity of holding it. These letters may also deal with other matters of interest pertaining to the conference.</p>
   
   <p>The purpose of the conference, if it is to be effective, must be twofold; that is: the conference must present both a general and a specific program.</p>
   <p>The general object of the proposed conference has been explained by the originators of the plan as follows: to promote a better understanding and a closer personal acquaintanceship among editors; to remove venomous controversy (without, of course, altering a newspaper's policies on political issues and on other matters where decent controversy is not only permissible but often beneficial and sometimes necessary); and to establish the principle that the editorial and administrative staffs are two different departments (although quite often they are conducted by the same persons), in that the object of the second staff is the bringing of material gain to the publishers of the newspaper, while the object of the first is the bringing of moral benefit to the readers and honor to the Polish element in America.</p>
   <p>Besides devoting itself to the achievement of its primary purpose, the conference should, in our opinion, take up other matters. We will name some of them. First, provision should be made for the mutual exchange of newspapers.</p>
   
   <p>Second, editors should agree that in reprinting newspaper articles they will list the source and the date of the article's first publication. In our opinion, an additional and very important issue is that of spelling and terminology. There are many expressions which the editors of our journals must invent on their own responsibility. Every language changes and improves according to growing needs. American conditions, being different from European ones, sometimes create difficulties for even the most able and experienced writer when he tries to decide what expression he should use for describing something or other; often the same and identical thing is referred to in several different ways by different persons.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, Polish grammarians and linguists have not been aware of these needs and have not been able to solve the problem; therefore, the Polish Press Alliance in America should, as a matter of duty, make itself an authority on this subject, in order to maintain and increase the value of the Polish language to the Polish people of America.</p>
   <p>There is also another issue which, in our opinion, is important enough for consideration at the conference of editors. The object of newspapers is to acquaint the public with matters concerning the community, and also to awaken national spirit. These issues concern not only us here in America but also our countrymen in Europe. Our journals publish in every issue news from our fatherland in Europe, but no such practice is followed by European papers. European papers rarely publish anything about the life of the Polish element in America; when they do, the information is not reliable, and is written in a manner which betrays either false or insufficient knowledge of our conditions. It is our duty to remedy this situation in some way, either by sending a large quantity of our newspapers to the publishers of European journals, or by corresponding with European editors whenever circumstances make it possible, or finally by any other practical means which may be suggested by the conference.</p>
