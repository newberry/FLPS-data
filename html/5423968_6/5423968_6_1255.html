   <p>We are kindly informing you that at today's meeting, after regulating all our affairs, and after receiving the secretary's report, we announced shortly after the unveiling of the monument, in our newspapers, that we have concluded the final activities of the committee on the building of the Kosciuszko monument, in Chicago, and have dissolved that committee.</p>
   <p>Throughout a number of years we have worked, mutually, to accomplish a deed, incontestably difficult, but admirable and great, which has turned the attention of the American world to all of us in general, and at the same time, fastened the ties with our brothers in the far off but always beloved fatherland, by forming a golden bridge joining all of us with that traditional worship of our great men - that worship given with the whole heart, the same in Poland as in America. The monument is proof that, although we have left our native land, we still have in our hearts, our fatherland and all that is connected with it that brings it to our thoughts, and we ardently desire, that our love of that <span class="page-break">\2</span>which is Polish will be conveyed likewise to the hearts of our progeny. It was this kind thought, besides other motives that was primary in our minds when we conceived the idea of building the Kosciuszko monument. The building of this monument cost us a lot of hardships, lots of work, and anxiety. More than once we thought our work would collapse, so that we practically had to start anew; in the end, however, we brought it to a successful finish and, today, this beautiful work of the Polish people in America, adorns their capital on the shores of Lake Michigan. It adorns, with merit, all of us who, with our own hard earned coins achieved it with glory to our art. We consecrated it to the memory of all of us as well as those of our countrymen, who will follow us, as a testimonial that we are Poles and ought to remain as such. These are our ideals, enlivened with which, we built a monument to Kosciuszko, the greatest son of Poland, who to us is the personification of bright patriotic virtues. In concluding, today, the deliberations and activities of our group, who were active directly concerning the monument, we wish to direct the attention of our Polish-American Society to just one more particular. We beseech you, ardently and heartily, that this beautiful and valuable work of ours encircle our people with piety, worship, and remembrance, truthfully worthy of that man to whom we consecrated it, that leader of ours, in <span class="page-break">\3</span>peasant garb, who became so dearly beloved by a valorous people. Let our Polish language be always heard at the foot of his monument. Let us remember about that Kosciuszko of ours, often visit him in great numbers, and in his honor let us institute among our Polish population a memorable holiday and observe it, annually and magnificently, on the 14th day of June, that is, on Flag Day. Let us on that day alongside the older people and the school children gather at the foot of the monument, and looking into the bright countenance of our great hero, take on its firmness and the ardent desire to work for the liberating of our fatherland from bondage. To achieve this project we heartily request help of our Polish organizations in Chicago, entertaining a strong hope, that in the near future they will take up this matter in earnest, we remain with deep respect.</p>
