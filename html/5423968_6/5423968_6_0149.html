   <p>On January 31st, The Library and Museum of the Polish National Alliance are arranging their annual ball in the beautiful Wicker Park Hall at North Ave. near Robey and Milwaukee Ave.; many societies are expected to attend. The proceeds are designated for the purchase of the most recent Polish literature, and to increase the Polish historical collections of our Museum. We anticipate that these beautiful and practical aims will bring fame and honor to our large Polish organization, and will encourage liberal-minded members to take action in swelling the funds of the Library and Museum, either through donations or active work. Societies attending in groups will be admitted free. The committee will spare no effort to satisfy every one, and will have a surprise for all; good dance music is assured.</p>
