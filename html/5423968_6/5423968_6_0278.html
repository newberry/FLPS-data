   <p>On Saturday, April 27th, a meeting was held in the Union Hotel, by the Polish Doctors Society. The Polish Doctors Society of Detroit was represented by Dr. E. Koneczny, and Dr. S. Lachajewski. Because of the absence of the president, Dr. Zurawski, the meeting was opened by the vice president, Dr. Pietrzykowski, who explained the object of the meeting in detail: namely, to devise some means by which to combat loose quacks and charlatans who exploit the simple minded public by posing as doctors.</p>
   <p>Let us take into consideration the most recent issue in Detroit; namely, the action by a group of doctors of this society who brought about the prosecution of the unmindful quacks who not only violate the ethics of the medical profession, but also expose their patients to physical as well as financial loss. Dr. Koneczny, in strong words denounced these fake doctors, who, like spiders surround the leading cities of the United States, luring their victims into their meshes with imaginary ailments; the patient worries about these imaginary ailments and consequently breaks down, with the result that the quack doctor pretending to effect a cure drains him to his last penny. Such methods are much worse than those of a highway robber because while he only takes the victims' money, the fake doctor not only relieves the victim of his last penny, but also deprives him of his health, under the guise of being a benefactor to the suffering public.</p>

   <p>Dr. Koneczny exposed the practice of these wicked and cunning vampires, and stated that the Doctors' Society of Detroit has begun action to exterminate this band of wasteful criminals. The efforts of the society have been fruitful, for today, many of these cheaters are standing before the bar of justice, as are also the publishers of their fraudulent advertisements. Dr. Lachajewski from Detroit also spoke on this subject and suggested various means by which this wicked band could be wiped out. We learned from Dr. Koneczny, and Dr. Lachajewski, that credit is due to Assistant State's Attorney P. L. Koscinski, and Attorney P. J. Gardulski, for making it possible to bring these charlatans before the bar of justice.</p>
   <p>Each year the gullible public is exploited to the extent of many thousand of dollars. It was voted upon by the Polish doctors of Chicago, that a list of the immoral and unethical practices of these crooks, who degrade the whole medical profession of Chicago should be published. A resume of the discussions by Dr. Statkiewicz, Dr. Pietrzykowski was given for the benefit of Dr. Zurawski, who just returned from Valparaiso where he addressed the Polish youths at the University, Dr. Balcerzak, Dr. Guraltowski, Dr. Szymanski, Dr. Bugaszewski, and Dr. Czaki. After a lenghty discourse, a motion was made by Dr. Statkiewicz to revive the alliance of the Polish Doctors Society in America, which in the past two years has lain dormant, but, which, with its renewed strength, would support the morale and educational practice of the Polish doctors in America, and would be <span class="page-break">3</span>a defense against these impostors and quack doctors who are the cause of untold harm to the suffering public. The motion was accepted unanimously.</p>
   <p>In reference to the reorganization of the society, the following doctors were called for advisement: Dr. Koneczny, Dr. Lachajewski, and Dr. Statkiewicz. The meeting was adjourned at midnight.</p>
