   <p>There has come out a new paper that shall greatly serve the people and will especially aid the Polish children.</p>
   <p>This new publication is called the Aniol (Angel); the title explains itself as a "Book for the school children," the first publication is dated September 20, 1906.</p>
   <p>The publisher and editor is Mr. Szczesny Zachajkiewicz, a known writer, poet and friend of all youth in America. We guarantee this publication will be good, as long as it is under the guidance of Mr. Zachajkiewicz.</p>
   <p>The first number consists of eight pages neatly and wonderfully printed verses: "Angel," "School at Home," by Severa Duchinska and "To Speak Polish," by Zachajkiewicz, also articles such as: "The bravery of Stephen Czarniecki," "Wonderful example;" "Michael Kopernik"; "Letters to the Angel."</p>
   <p>We heartily support and recommend this issue.</p>
