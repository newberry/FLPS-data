   <p>We examined the model of Kosciuszko's monument made by our Polish artist Mr. Broda.</p>
   <p>We informed the Polish public about this model three months ago, at which time it was under construction. Now it is finished and stands one sixth of the natural size. Besides the cost of making the monument, the cost of erecting this monument has been figured and the bill has been forwarded to the committee for approval.</p>
   <p>A beautiful miniature bronze plate was donated by the artist showing a Polish peasant woman giving Kosciuszko a Polish flag. This plate should be placed on the front of the monument; for the two sides of the monument two bronze plates are to be made, one of Kosciuszko taking the oath of fidelity in Crakow, the other showing Kosciuszko at the time of the battle at Reclawice.</p>
   <p>We are wishing this Polish artist success in his future undertakings.</p>
