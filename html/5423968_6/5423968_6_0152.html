   <p>Public libraries, in American cities inhabited by Poles, usually carry a selection of Polish books. It seems, however, that the Poles do not take equal advantage of this opportunity everywhere.</p>
   <p>In some cities, such as Buffalo and Detroit, the Poles borrow Polish books from public libraries, and if any desired book is not there they demand it repeatedly till the library orders it for them. The public libraries of Buffalo and Detroit import new Polish books annually, at a cost of hundreds of dollars. This is of great benefit to the Polish public.</p>
   <p>We are informed that the Poles in other cities are not making full use of public libraries; they do not demand Polish books, and for this reason the librarians do not order any.</p>

   <p>It is said that the Chicago Public Library has not purchased any new Polish books for a number of years. A committee representing the Educational Department of the Polish National Alliance has made several inquiries at the offices of the Chicago Public Library, but always receive the same curt answer: "There is no demand for Polish books." The same condition obtains in New York and other large cities.</p>
   <p>The larger the city the harder it is for the Pole to go from his neighborhood to the main library for his books. There is, however, a remedy for this situation, because the main library will establish a branch in any locality, and will maintain it as long as there is a good circulation at that branch.</p>
   <p>Our public library boards import a large number of Russian books annually, for which they spend thousand of dollars, although the number of Russians in this country is very small. The circulation of Russian books is kept up by the Russian Jews, who, besides English and Jewish books, read also Russian books.</p>

   <p>The Poles should insist that there be Polish books in public libraries, in return for the city funds to which they contribute.</p>
   <p>It is true that the Polish National Alliance maintains a large library, with neighborhood branches, in Chicago; it was established by the Educational Department of the Alliance, and supplies the Polish settlements with books. It is also true that the Polish National Alliance has established Polish libraries in other cities, for the convenience of its members but this should not prevent public libraries from handling Polish books. Of course the Polish National Alliance cannot supply Polish books to every Pole, and, for that matter the more good Polish books there are in circulation the better.</p>
   <p>The Americans do not know that the Poles have their own source from which they obtain books, and most probably for this reason they think that the Poles do not care for education, since they do not ask for books in public libraries.</p>

   <p>This very important matter should not be neglected. If you are downtown, visit the public library and ask for a catalogue of Polish books; select one book and, if it is not in the catalogue, demand that it be ordered. The service is free, and you are performing the duty of a citizen.</p>
   <p>Public libraries have regular funds for foreign books, but the supply is controlled by the demand. If a certain foreign book is demanded by the public it will be ordered. This is as it should be.</p>
   <p>Besides demanding books at the main library, we should demand branch libraries, and should support them after they have been established. They are also free. This is one of the easiest duties of a Pole in his adopted country.</p>
