   <p>The Kraj (Country), published in St. Petersburg, [Russia] has for some time been publishing correspondence from Chicago about American, and at times Polish, affairs in its columns; these letters are signed "H. L." On the whole these articles are rather shallow and reveal a poor knowledge of our conditions. Occasionally they display an astonishing certainty of tone, which reveals that the author considers himself a super being and regards everything about himself as better than the common Polish-American rabble.</p>
   <p>On October 16, H. L. 's correspondence, from its Olympian heights, graciously deigned to pass a few remarks on the Polish press of Chicago. We are silently overlooking the remark that H. L. has made in the main about the Polish-American press: "It does not as yet stand upon the heights of its task" [sic] (decency would at least suggest giving a reason why), and the further comment that the language in which some of the papers are written is "tainted with Kassubian <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>dialect" [Translator's note: a Kassub is a native of Pomerania]. The judgment of our critic from the Kraj about the Chicago Polish papers, however, is interesting. He writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"Among the daily papers there are the Dziennik Chicagoski and the Telegraf ("Telegraph") (the latter is no longer published--editor's note). Their principal fault is that they have not acquired a sufficiently broad point of view, and are filled with Posen and Galician provincialism."</p>
   <p>On the whole we admit that it is of little importance to defend ourselves against such opinions about us. At times, however, when we are faced with plain nonsense and ill will, we deem it our duty to turn public opinion upon it.</p>
   <p>Truly, it is impossible for us to understand what H. L. meant by "Posen and Galician provincialism." What is this? Where did he find this "something" in the Dziennik Chicagoski, or in Telegraf, during the time of its existence?</p>
   <p>If this has reference to our special interest in Polish affairs in Galicia and <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Posen and our disregard for a matters in Lithuania, Ukrainia and Podole [old Polish territory], then everyone who is able to read will admit that the Dziennik Chicagoski nor the Telegraf had nothing of interest to write about the latter. Both papers have given equal space to the three divided portions of Poland, immigration, the Poles in America, and local Polish news. Both have frequently published articles about the oppressions perpetrated by Hurko, governor general of Russian-occupied Poland, about the German affairs in Posen, and about what was going on in Galicia. Where then can one find this "provincialism"? If H. L. is concerned about our views then they cannot be "provincial", for in every province there exist people and newspapers of various convictions. Finally, if this "provincialism" found its way into print then in this respect the assertions of H. L. are completely amiss, for the makeup of our daily or weekly papers is such that they have very little in common with Polish European journals. He is merely prejudiced against the Polish-American press. It is also his contention that the language in which some of the articles are written is of Posen and Galician dialect. Yet the present editors of the Dziennik Chicagoski and the Telegraf come from the former Duchy of Warsaw, which is now <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>under Russian rule.</p>
   <p>About what then is H. L. concerned? Perhaps he desires only to show his superiority. At any rate, such opinions as find their way into the columns of the papers in Russia, which we are unable to get as yet because of censorship, are generally stupid, and those of H. L. are certainly no exception. Things of this nature only agitate the people. If the Kraj wishes to write about us it ought to find a competent correspondent, one who has sensible opinions and knows how to express them.</p>
