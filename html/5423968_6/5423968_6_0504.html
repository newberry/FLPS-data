   <p>As soon as the first issue of Dziennik Zwiazkowy appeared, it was immediately attacked. It began with common pop guns; later, rifles were used and when the firing ceased, light artillery was brought to the scene. Right now guns of the heaviest caliber do their share. War trumpets have sounded and cannons are roaring, but the aim is poor. The missiles did not spread panic, devastation and death in the ranks of the nationals; they did not make even one break in our lines, in fact, the situation was just reversed. Those who heard, ran out to investigate. Dziennik Zwiazkowy is under cross fire; but - those attacks will only help Dziennik Zwiazkowy.</p>
   <p>The commanders of the opposing forces believed that the smoke would hide them, but they were mistaken; they have been recognized.</p>
   <p>Not only the leaders, but also the slaves are known. One of the co-workers of the Resurrection Father's organ, Dziennik Chicagoski, went to South Chicago for the sole purpose of inciting Rev. Wojtalewics, the editor of Polonia.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Since he was not able in conducting this fight, which job was forced upon him by his superiors, he sought allies.</p>
   <p>In this week's issue of Polonia, which appears today or tomorrow, much sarcasm will be directed against Dziennik Zwiazkowy. The author of these remarks will request that our Board of Directors compel the editors of Dziennik Zwiazkowy to change its policy, because it is endangering the confidence of the public.</p>
   <p>The co-worker of the Ressurrection Father's organ is happy in the belief that his gibes will be reprinted Saturday, in Dziennik Chicagoski, together with annotations of his own.</p>
   <p>This will happen Saturday, but we already know all about it today.</p>
   <p>What does it mean? It means that we have friends everywhere, that we are a-ware of every move made by our enemies and that the public is on our side.</p>
   <p>Something unusual has happened. People, who have believed implicitly in the articles of the Resurrection Fathers and to whom it was the highest oracle, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>are now coming to our office. Their eyes have been opened. They ask for all issues of Dziennik Zwiazkowy including the first one.</p>
   <p>Some, making the statement that they are surfeited with the Resurrection Fathers, and that they will join another parish, one that is not under their control. They are beginning to understand the aims and ideals of the polish National Alliance and will join its ranks in the near future.</p>
   <p>For this reason the Resurreption Fathers are attacking us as well as the Dziennik Zwiazkowy.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance experienced many hardships before it was given the right to exist; unfriendly forces wanted to destroy it. They are now also trying to crush Dziennik Zwiazkowy, our daily paper, that "Light Bearer" of the Polish National Alliance which brings the truth into every Polish home, every day reducing the number of slaves by changing them into intelligent citizens.</p>
   <p>It was ever thus!</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>When the strategy of our adversaries fails, or when they quarrel among themselves, we have peace; but when some one proffers a scheme with which to abolish Dziennik Zwiazkowy, they immediately resume the fight. They force the weaker clergy into co-operation with their strong influence and bribery; they spend money liberally; they compel others to attack our stronghold, our Dziennik Zwiazkowy, and our establishment, but they themselves hide.</p>
   <p>Their malice rebounds; our high ideals and our love for the institution protects us.</p>
   <p>We are profoundly impressed with our peoples motives; they support every good cause, they are interested in the welfare of families and in the enlightenment of the ignorant.</p>
   <p>They are willing to help good priests, and to give money for a good purpose.</p>
   <p>Our Alliance has changed the people without aid from the pulpit.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>They formerly accused Zgoda (The official edition of the Polish National Alliance) of being opposed to religious faith; now they use the same insinuations against Dziennik Zwiazkowy.</p>
   <p>Every broadminded reader of Dziennik Zwiazkowy will readily admit that our publication is not opposed to religious principles, because its editors regard faith as something sacred. Every conscientious reader of this journal will testify that he has read nothing antagonistic to religious beliefs.</p>
   <p>Many publications are being circulated to propagate religion, but instead of doing this, they promote business for their editors.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Zwiazkowy serves national interests, yet, it has more respect for good priests than clerical papers. It has a sincere regard for them because it has no personal grievances. Ecclesiastical editors praise only those clergymen who share their views but condemn others who differ. This can be proved by the publication of the Resurrection Fathers which denounces honest priests.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Instead of imitating their humble Master and preaching the word of God, the Resurrection Fathers are trying to gain power and riches, and to persecute those who refuse to kiss their feet. Because of these exposures the Resurrection Fathers are fighting against us.</p>
   <p>Church authorities should correct them for the good of the church; then there would be peace and respect for clerical robes.</p>
   <p>There are many good and noble priests, but they are obliged to be silent for their own good; it will change in time.</p>
   <p>Facts cannot be eliminated by thunderous warfare. If you intend to continue your attacks, that is your privilege, but we shall always retaliate for the good of the people.</p>
