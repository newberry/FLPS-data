   <p>As regards the number of their publications, the Poles in America are not lagging behind other nationalities and have even surpassed some. We have fifty-eight publications--dailies, weeklies, biweeklies and monthlies--which is not such a small number, considering that other nationalities with larger populations do not have as many nor have developed their press into a power such as ours.</p>
   <p>On glancing over the holiday issues of our dailies and weeklies, we see a marked improvement in their appearance and choice of material, each publication trying to surpass the other. Comparing our press of today with that of twenty or even ten years ago, one notices a tremendous difference. Our present- day publications, as regards efforts to satisfy and interest their readers--size, technical development, choice of material-- occupy a <span class="page-break">2</span>relatively high level, and, with continued endeavor on the part of the publishers and better editorial staffs, will be able to compete with the best publications of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>With fifty-eight publications, we have in our hands a power which, if used skillfully, can bring a great deal of good not only to our immigrants, but to our homeland as well. Unfortunately, the majority of our publications do not measure up to the high level expected from them, and, save for their imposing size, some of them are very pale in substance due to a lack of editorial ability.</p>
   <p>One can find in the majority of our publications everything but original ideas. They reprint articles from both European and local publications, altering them a little or publishing them in their original form. This practice is due to a lack of competent editors, some of whom are unable to produce anything original. In fact, from an editorial point of view, our publications are deficient and we must admit it.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>This is not necessarily the fault of the publishers, some of whom would sincerely like to have trained and capable editors, but is due to the scarcity of trained men. There is a handful of them, but they are engaged by the larger publications, so that the smaller ones must of necessity be served either by people of lesser ability or, sometimes, by people who have hardly a faint idea of what editing a publication is all about.</p>
   <p>This condition gives rise to quarrels, nasty arguments, and personal attacks, with the result that one paper does all it can to hurt the other. If our editors and publishers would realize that by casting dissension aside their publications would be in a better position to prosper and sow the healthy seeds of enlightenment among the Polish masses, they would put a stop to quarrels and unethical polemics. If they must compete with one another, let it be in the quality of their work and the selection of their subject matter.</p>
   <p>From a technical point of view, we have developed our press very well.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Our publications are impressive in size and format, but the majority of them are lacking in that spirit of determination and willingness to work, which yields good fruit.</p>
   <p>Their nasty and furious battles, often conducted indecently, may be traced to the fact that these publications are headed by the wrong people, that is, by people who do not understand our general needs and the broader horizons these needs encompass. They are headed, in most cases, by ordinary hired men, men who for the dollar are ready to sling mud at anybody, even the most impeccable.</p>
   <p>In spite of all this, one must admit that our publications of several years ago presented a worse aspect. The attacks, accusations, and polemics of today are nothing in comparison with what one can read in our papers of years ago. This indicates that, after all, our publications have reached an ethical level higher than the one they occupied formerly, and that, in time, they will come to a state of absolute equilibrium, because the readers themselves demand this.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The best proof of this is that the publications that battle violently with one another and indulge in nasty polemics, are gradually losing their readers. After reading one, two, and sometimes ten issues, all filled with personal attacks, the disgusted reader throws the paper away to read other papers more serious and quiet, which provide good clean food for thought and avoid dirt and sensations.</p>
   <p>The taste of the readers of today is entirely different from that of several years ago, and their demands in regard to subject matter have also become greater. Therefore, a publication containing well-chosen educational and informative material has greater interest and is read more willingly than a bickering and sensationalistic publication of the streets.</p>
   <p>All our publishers and editors should keep this in mind if they earnestly desire the development of the publications which they publish and edit.</p>
   <p>It is not the quantity, but the quality of our publications which should <span class="page-break">6</span>be our concern. After all, it would be better to have only twenty serious, educational publications than a hundred of them full of ordinary and inconsequential editorial chaff.</p>
   <p>We have developed our publications in the matter of size; now let us develop them in the matter of substance. It is only after we have done this that Polish journalism in America will stand high and will become famous throughout the world.</p>
