   <p>The public schools have been closed for the summer vacation. This is the most suitable opportunity for children to thoroughly learn their native language.</p>
   <p>Instead of allowing them to loiter on the streets, parents ought to enroll their children for special courses in Polish. Beginning next Monday, classes will be held on Monday, Wednesday and Friday every week, from 9 A. M. till noon.</p>
   <p>New pupils may enroll at the parochial hall, at the corner of North Wood and Iowa Streets.</p>
