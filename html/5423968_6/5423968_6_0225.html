   <p>The administration of the Educational Department of the Polish League is happy to acknowledge the following contributions of books for the proposed libraries and reading rooms: J. F. Smulski, eight books; Mrs. Agnes Zmich, three books; and I. Machnikowski, two annuals. This brings the total books available to two hundred and thirty-four.</p>
   <p>We are certain that the support will continue. Books of all kinds are gladly accepted. The Polish youth will be grateful to us for this work, since it is a worthy endeavor.</p>
