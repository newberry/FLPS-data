   <p>As everybody knows, on July fourth--Independence Day--the Poles in Chicago will hold a grand festival at Schuetzen Park for the benefit of the Thaddeus Kosciusko Monument Fund.</p>
   <p>Since we consider it the sacred duty of every Pole to support this affair, the Polish Cyclists Club has decided to take part in this festival and march in the parade.</p>
   <p>We are inviting all Polish cyclists to come along with us.</p>
   <p>We hope everyone will be in the line of march with us.</p>
   <p>All those wishing to join in the parade may register at the following places: Lechert, corner Division and Cleaver Streets; D. Paszkowski, 90 W. Division Street; Alex Grabowski, 260 Jackson Boulevard.</p>
   <p>The final date to register is June 24.</p>
   <p>The Polish Cyclists Club will then invite all those registered to a meeting, where instructions will be given on how to decorate the bicycles, etc.</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
