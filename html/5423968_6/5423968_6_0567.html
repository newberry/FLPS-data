   <p>Even in our ultraprogressive press, we find articles claiming that the Catholic clergy and the Catholic press should never have any connection with politics.</p>
   <p>This viewpoint is absolutely false.</p>
   <p>One of the most influential English Catholic papers in denying the truth of the above assertion,says the following:</p>
   <p>"We separate politics from religion but not religion from politics.</p>
   <p>"If we have confidence in the Catholic press, then we should consider their judgment in religious and in political matters. Every citizen, whether he <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>holds an office or is a candidate for an office, must interest himself in daily political news. Politics oftentimes touch on Catholic church affairs and on matters concerning Catholics.</p>
   <p>"When there is anti-Catholic agitation, either in the national or state political sphere, haven't the Catholic papers the right to fight it? They not only possess the right, but it is their obvious duty. Silence on their part would be a crime. It would be neglecting their most sacred duty.</p>
   <p>"So we cannot be silent!</p>
   <p>"We need an alert, brave, and energetic Catholic press. It can never be too watchful!"</p>
   <p>We heartly agree with the above words, and in practice we have tried, and will continue to try, to follow them.</p>
