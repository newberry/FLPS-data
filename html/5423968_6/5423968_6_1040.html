   <p>The board of directors of the Polish Press Club has decided to arrange a series of lectures for members and their friends. This series will begin next Sunday, March 25, in the afternoon.</p>
   <p>The lectures, as a rule, will be given in the Polish language, but the board intends, from time to time, to invite prominent Americans to lecture. In this way the Press Club will try to be an outpost not only of social life but of enlightenment as well.</p>
   <p>Mr. Florian Znaniecki will deliver the first lecture of the series next Sunday. Mr. Znaniecki is a professor, in the Department of Sociology at the University of Chicago. Recently he was given the Chair of the Polish Language at the same University.</p>
   <p>The club expects a large crowd next Sunday because Professor Znaniecki's <span class="page-break">2</span>lecture will be both interesting and informative. Special announcements of the lectures will not be sent out, but one will always be able to find information about them in the press.</p>
