   <p>We have written a few times in this Polish newspaper about the valuable and interesting Polish books written by our Polish author Mr. Julian Baczynski, printed and issued by Carl Koslowski.</p>
   <p>This work was praised by critics as an impartial and true history of the Polish nation, permitting the people not only to know our past but to love and cherish the true Polish spirit.</p>
   <p>The history of Poles, written by Mr. Baczynski, should be in the home of every true Pole, but most of all, it should be placed in every Polish society, in Polish libraries, Polish literary circles, and in Polish parishes.</p>
   <p>At the present time Mr. Baczynski's book can be purchased in the office of the Polish Daily News.</p>
