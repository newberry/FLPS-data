   <p>Last Friday night hundreds of people came to Pulaski Park to witness the water carnival arranged by "Uncle" Geo. Rozczynalski, Director of the park, with the assistance of Mr. Wm. Paulick, the instructor of the men's gymnasium.</p>
   <p>The lovers of this sport showed unusual interest in the aquatic feats, which were original in every respect. The enthusiasm of the crowd was shown by loud cheers and applause.</p>
   <p>The entire program was arranged in such a way that it held the interest to the extent that time flew by without anyone noticing it.</p>
   <p>"Uncle" Rozczynalski and Mr. Paulick proved more than capable of arranging such a program. Many of the guests present expressed their opinions that under Mr. Rozozynalski's management a new era dawned for Pulaski Park.</p>
   <p>The new park director promised to have, in the future, many more similar attractions composed of all kinds of sports, which will give an opportunity to all local talent to show their ability by competing with the champions in other <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>parts of the city.</p>
   <p>The last water carnical proved to us that Pulaski Park in the near future, thanks to the management of the able Pole, will attract all the younger generation of the neighboring Polish parishes to take more interest in this sport.</p>
   <p>Among the prominent people who attended the meet were Dr. John Dill Robertson, President of the West Park Commission; J. Furlong of the Safety Division of West Parks; Dr. H. W. Gentles; Phil Garbarek, Vice-President of the Polish National Alliance; Edward J. Prebis, Vice-President of the North-Western Bank and President of the Chicago Society; Mrs. Wellinaer, Secretary of the American Red Cross; J. J. Budzban, Assistant Secretary of the North-Western Bank; and a host of "Uncle's" friends.</p>
   <p>Dick Howell, one of the best swimmers, was the attraction of the evening; and also Mr. Wm. Paulick who showed his ability as an expert swimmer; Miss Evelyn Bolke finished first in three of the girls' events.</p>
   <p>Following the races and the exhibitions, Mr. Louis Shabbot made his spectacular <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>fire dive.</p>
   <p>We wish you success, Mr. Rozczynalski and also Mr. Paulick! So keep up the good work.</p>
