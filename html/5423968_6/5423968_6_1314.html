   <p>The main committee in charge of arranging the great Kosciusko Festival on July Fourth at Schuetzen Park hereby appeals to all Polish businessmen, grocers, butchers, etc., in every part of the city, to kindly keep their places of business closed on the day of this affair, namely July 4th.</p>
   <p>We hope not one of them will fail to celebrate this day properly.</p>
   <p>Let the people of other nationalities understand that we know how to honor the memory of the hero of two hemispheres, and how to commemorate the Independence of the United States.</p>
   <p>We expect our appeal not to go unheeded and that the Polish businessmen will prove on this day that material profits are not as important to them as is the cause they celebrate.</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
