They have aroused interest in all of the Polish communities in America; the need for a monument to our great hero is recognized in Polish circles everywhere. It is with extreme pleasure that we publish the following announcement:</p>
   <p>"A lively general interest in contributing to the fund for a monument to the immortal hero of Raclawice, Thaddeus Kosciusko, one of the most capable defenders of American liberty, has aroused a number of ardent Polish patriots in South Chicago to greater activity in this truly Polish cause. To this end, a theatrical performance will be presented in South Chicago for the benefit of the Kosciusko Memorial Fund. We are sure that the Polish public of this part of the city, known as it is for its generosity, will attend in <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the largest possible numbers. We have chosen only our most capable amateurs for this performance, who, in their turn, have promised sincere co-operation in this noble work. We have no doubt that not only the whole of the Polish public, but a great many of the more intelligent Americans besides, will approve of our plan. The committee in charge of arrangements will, in due time, make known the date and place of this performance. All other Polish newspapers in Chicago please copy".</p>
