   <p>At the meeting held on Sunday, February 22, 1903, in the hall of Pulaski, the Society of Polish Industrial Tradesmen, of Group 3 of the Polish National Alliance, passed the following resolution:</p>
   <p>Whereas, the matter of Kosciuszko's statue has been moved speedily ahead and that shortly the building directors are to bring forth their report of the time for erection of the statue; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, it came to the knowledge of the public that the agreement had with the Park Commissioners, for the creation of said statue in Humboldt Park, has passed the time agreed on for the accomplishment; and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, a great majority of the Poles have opposed the idea of placing a statue of our hero Kosciuszko in Humboldt Park, because such park is controlled largely by Germans and Scandinavians who frequent the park in observance of various popular feasts and like activities; <span class="page-break">2</span>proving that this park is regarded as Teutonic,</p>
   <p>Therefore, the Society of Polish Tradesmen in Chicago, one of the oldest societies, totalling more than 100 members, people with trade in various industries as well as men of profession, are taking charge of this at the present time to satisfy the wishes of the public, that the monument of Kosciuszko, built under the care of Polish artists, will not bear criticism. It should be placed for greater glory and honor in Grant Park, but if this is not possible, then place the statue in Lincoln Park, but never in the Teutonic Humboldt Park.</p>
   <p>It was resolved, regarding this monument of Kosciuszko, that this re-solution be sent to the directors building and to advertise this in the newspapers so as to awaken all other societies and make them take an active part in this great undertaking.</p>
