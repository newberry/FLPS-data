   <p>Ten years!</p>
   <p>Although this is but a short space of time in eternity, yet it was brimful of events, hopes, joys, disappointments, and troubles of various kinds for nations, organizations, families, and, well--for Polish publishers, especially, here in America.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Zwiazkowy has existed for only ten years, but it has weathered many storms, it has had many joys and disappointments, it has waged many battles, not only for its own existence, but in defense of [Polish], national principles, patriotism, and purely Polish ideals.</p>
   <p>It has conquered everything like an undaunted champion, and today Dziennik Zwiazkowy can make a full report of its activity to the Polish people and to the Alliance members; its editors can hold their heads high and with their hands on their hearts say: "We did what we could. We defended a good cause.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>We were successful and we achieved our goal. It is for you, honored readers, to judge whether or not we accomplished our difficult task."</p>
   <p>Founding of Dziennik Zwiazkowy</p>
   <p>Dziennik Zwiazkowy was founded not for profit, not out of mere caprice, and not to serve individuals at the head of the Polish National Alliance, for these change from time to time; it was founded to satisfy the needs of our organization and to help in the work for our homeland.</p>
   <p>Such a great, wealthy, influential organization as the Polish National Alliance needs a daily newspaper for its own interests, to defend itself against unjust attacks, and to present the true facts of what is happening within the organization. Private newspapers, no matter how favorable they may be to the Alliance, cannot do this, for they do not know the true state of affairs within the organization. Private newspapers often made erroneous reports to Alliance members of organization affairs, and produced, perhaps unintentionally, disturbances <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>within our ranks; others, in their zeal to serve the Alliance members, fought unnecessarily with the officers of the organization, which did more harm than good.</p>
   <p>The administration of that time [1906], headed by M. B. Steczynski, understood this, and decided to create the daily paper so necessary to the organization's welfare. The weekly Zgoda, grown old in the battle for a good cause, could not satisfy the needs of the Alliance, nor could it repel the attacks made upon the Alliance by its enemies. After all, daily papers could make six attacks, while Zgoda could answer them only once a week.</p>
   <p>The meeting of the Central Board of that time, held on may 17, 1906, was a memorable one. It was at this meeting that the vice-president, Michael Rzeszotarski, arose to make the formal motion that the Polish National Alliance establish its own daily newspaper. He said that since the Alliance owned its own building and printing shop, the paper could be published without much additional cost, and that with so many thousands of members the paper should <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>have a sufficient number of subscribers. The motion was carried unanimously, and it was decided to submit the matter in a referendum to the Alliance groups. A. Schreiber, censor of the Polish National Alliance at that time, issued an appropriate announcement. The project was defeated in the referendum by a majority of three hundred votes. It should be taken into consideration, however, that many of the groups that voted against it were in favor of the principle of the project and merely referred the matter to the next convention.</p>
   <p>The memorable seventeenth convention, held in Baltimore, Maryland in 1907, finally opened. Unfortunately, the projected Dziennik Zwiazkowy was bitterly opposed by members who were publishers or part owners of other newspapers, and who saw in this new champion a powerful competition that might affect their own private interests.</p>
   <p>Despite the fact that forces from all sides were set to work against the project, it was carried by the level-headed delegates to the convention.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Delegate Paul Kurdziel of Cleveland, Ohio, made the formal motion that the Polish National Alliance publish its own daily paper, and in spite of the terrific opposition and the confusion it created, the motion was carried by a considerable majority. The convention had voted to establish Dziennik Zwiazkowy. Francis Jablonski was elected editor-in-chief of the weekly Zgoda and of the prospective Dziennik Zwiazkowy, defeating Thomas Siemiradzki by a considerable majority. The choice was a good one, for the Alliance of that time could have found no better man for the job. Thus, a capable man was placed at the head of the Alliance publications, a tried and zealous worker, a member of the Alliance body and soul, who had already been editor of Zgoda for two terms, and president of the Polish National Alliance for one term.</p>
   <p>Joseph Olbinski, an equally tried champion of the Alliance cause and an expert in printing matters, who had worked in the offices of the Alliance for many years, was unanimously elected secretary and administrator of the Alliance publications. The result of the elections was fortunate, for both these men chose <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>capable staffs and set to work immediately on publishing Dziennik Zwiazkowy.</p>
   <p>First Struggles of the New Paper</p>
   <p>With an eye to the material good of the prospective Dziennik Zwiazkowy, the newly-elected officers appointed Philip Ksycki, an active Alliance member and a thoroughly capable man, to the office of advertising manager. After consultation, the management decided to issue the first number of the paper on January 15, 1908. On that day, Dziennik Zwiazkowy went out into the world and reached the cottages of Polish immigrants; it went beyond the boundaries of the United States, reaching the farthest corners of the globe, wherever Polish hearts beat.</p>
   <p>Its beginning was very difficult, as is usual with new publications, especially daily papers. The first manager, under secretary Joseph Olbinski, was the originator of the project, Michael Rzeszotarski, who had a great many difficulties <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>to overcome. There were not as many subscribers as had been expected, and, consequently, the volume of advertising was low. As a result, considerable effort and sacrifices on the part of the management were necessary in order to keep the paper going.</p>
   <p>During the first few weeks of its existence, Dziennik Zwiazkowy lost its editor-in-chief, Francis Jablonski. The first issue of the paper appeared on January 15 and Jablonski died on February 23 of the same year, without having seen the triumph of this newspaper into which he had put his whole soul, energy, and ability. His place was taken by Thomas Siemiradzki, who had been his assistant. The eighteenth convention, held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, elected Siemiradzki editor-in-chief of Dziennik Zwiazkowy and Zgoda. The task was too great for Siemiradzki, however, for at the next convention, held in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1911, he resigned from the editorship of Dziennik [Zwiazkowy], but retained the editorship of the weekly Zgoda.</p>
   <p>Orpiszewski Becomes Editor</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>The first editorial staff after the death of Jablonski consisted of Siemiradzki, [N.] Zlotnicki, [S.] Orpiszewski, S. Osada, city editor, and Miss Walukiewicz, Women's Department editor. After Siemiradzki's resignation, the Central Board appointed Orpiszewski editor-in-chief of Dziennik Zwiazkowy. Orpiszewski had been assistant to the editor-in-chief since the first issue and had been working with the paper ever since. The last convention, held in Schenectady, New York, in 1915, unanimously elected him editor-in-chief of both papers.</p>
   <p>The present staff of the two papers, excluding the editor-in-chief, consists of the following talented journalists: I. M. Osostowicz, Henry Lokanski, Stephen Lewental, city editor, Vincent Grabowski, W. Skwarczynski, reporter, and Mrs. Helen Setmajer, women's editor of both Dziennik Zwiazkowy and the Zgoda. After the resignation of Rzeszotarski in 1908, Stanislaus Dangel was appointed general manager. It was a most unfortunate choice. Dangel began his management <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>by discharging many of the old employees from the printing shop. He conducted incessant quarrels with the workers, he reduced the circulation of both Dziennik Zwiazkowy and Zgoda, he carried over the same material from one paper to the other, he cut the editors' salaries, and finally, he defiled the paper by publishing slanderous articles attacking everybody and everything, ostensibly for the good of the paper but actually lowering it to the level of his present Narodowiec (Nationalist). Dziennik Zwiazkowy began to lose popularity and its development became retarded. Almost anyone could "save" Dziennik [Zwiazkowy] in this manner! Finally, the Central Board, disgusted with his methods, requested Dangel's resignation from the position he was so ill-fitted to occupy. He resigned on June 17, 1910.</p>
   <p>The New Manager</p>
   <p>The capable and energetic C. Wiechecki was appointed to replace Dangel as manager. Wiechecki was manager of the Alliance publications until July 1 of last year, at which time he resigned after enlisting in the Polish Army as a <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>volunteer. At present, he is stationed as recruiting officer for District Number Two in Chicago. He will probably leave for France.</p>
   <p>Together with Olbinski, who had been re-elected secretary time and again by the conventions, as a capable, honest, and thrifty official who understood the publishing business thoroughly, he was the spirit of the whole enterprise, working zealously to save the paper and to develop it properly.</p>
   <p>Philip Ksycki, advertising manager and former vice-president of the Polish National Alliance, rendered great services in the advertising department that filled the treasury of Dziennik Zwiazkowy. Thanks to his cleverness and energy, Dziennik Zwiazkowy's volume of advertising increased steadily, until the paper was finally placed on a sound financial foundation. Ruin no longer threatened it.</p>
   <p>At the twentieth convention, held in Detroit, Michigan [1915], he lost his position through intrigues carried on against him. After a two-year absence, <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>he again became advertising manager of the Alliance publications, occupying this position at the present time. Due to his efforts, the volume of advertising is constantly increasing and this alone is greatly enriching the newspaper's treasury. Adam Paluszek was advertising manager during Ksycki's absence.</p>
   <p>Joseph Mierzynski, circulation manager of Dziennik Zwiazkowy for many years, contributed much to increase the paper's circulation, and during ten years the circulation has risen to forty thousand subscribers.</p>
   <p>After Wiechecki's resignation, the young and energetic Stanislaus Gryzbowski, formerly assistant manager, was appointed general manager, and it is to be hoped that with his ability and intentions he will prove a worthy successor to Wiechecki.</p>
   <p>Financial State of Dziennik Zwiazkowy</p>
   <p>After ten years of struggle for existence, we can look with pride upon the <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>fruits of the efforts of those people who supported and helped to develop Dziennik Zwiazkowy to its present proportions. It is constantly gaining new friends, there is no lack of subscribers--its circulation increases almost daily. The state of the Alliance publications' treasury is more than satisfactory, for on January 1, 1918, the treasury report showed $34,751.18 in cash, accounts receivable not included. Of this sum, the newspapers' administration used nineteen thousand dollars for the purchase of Liberty Bonds, an example which thus far has not been followed by any of the other papers.</p>
   <p>It should be added that Casimir Zychlinski, iucumbent president of the Polish National Alliance, has proved a reliable advisor, whose good advice we always welcome; the entire Central Board of the Alliance is very favorably disposed toward our daily paper.</p>
   <p>Correspondents</p>
   <p>Dziennik Zwiazkowy has two permanent paid correspondents in Europe: Professor <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>W. Lutoslawski in Paris and John J. Kowalczyk in Copenhagen, so that it receives news of what is happening in Poland and in Europe in general at first hand. In addition to these, it has many other correspondents all over the United States and in other countries who deserve recognition for enriching the paper with their many news items and articles. Dziennik Zwiazkowy today is read by our countrymen in all corners of the world where Poles are to be found; it is quoted by European papers.</p>
   <p>Politics</p>
   <p>In politics, Dziennik Zwiazkowy has taken a purely Polish stand, holding that Poland must be united, independent, self-governing, with an outlet to the sea. The governments of the United States, England, France, and Italy agree on these points. Other papers held Prusso-Austrian points of view, but Dziennik Zwiazkowy, having successfully fought the Kaiser's sympathizers, triumphed, and greatly increased its own importance as a consequence.</p>
   <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>
   <p>Alliance members can well be proud of their daily paper, and should continue to favor it with their support.</p>
   <p>Dziennik Zwiazkowy did its part too in urging our brethren in America to contribute to the funds for war relief, the Polish Army, and other national causes.</p>
   <p>The Employees</p>
   <p>The employees in the administrative department and in the printing shop of the Alliance publications were carefully selected by Secretary Olbinski. There are several score employees in those departments, and there is plenty of work for all of them, for the paper is growing.</p>
   <p>The printing department is very well equipped, although the Alliance building is becoming somewhat crowded. Our shop produces the highest quality of work, for its employees are all experts at their trade. For the last few years, W. Gorecki has been foreman of the shop and has kept everything in the best of order.</p>
   <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>
   <p>The advertising, accounting, and other departments are also conducted properly, for these departments also employ people who understand their work.</p>
   <p>From itself, the editorial staff extends its best wishes to Dziennik Zwiazkowy for its continued growth. The staff urges the employees to persevere in their difficult and responsible work. It is our hope that within five years Dziennik Zwiazkowy's circulation will have increased threefold, and that the paper will have hundreds of thousands of dollars in its treasury.</p>
   <p>S. Orpiszewski.</p>
