   <p>This year, at the Christmas Eve supper, when Polish families, especially in Chicago, will be gathered at their tables for the traditional custom of breaking and partaking of the wafer, a new guest will be present. This young guest that loves all Poles sincerely, and brings best wishes into the homes, is Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>"Glory be to God in the Highest and Peace to All People of Good Will."</p>
   <p>This new guest, dear readers, desires to bring, peace, good will, harmony, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and mutual love into your homes. This new guest desires to be your meditator, welcomed everywhere and by everybody. It desires to remove disagreements and bring understanding among you, to give you an opportunity to know yourselves better. It desires to enlighten you on important matters, to reconcile you, and to establish brotherly love among you.</p>
   <p>We know positively that you will not refuse this guest, that you will welcome it on that day; we have proofs of it in spite of the short existence of our journal.</p>
   <p>Please accept our best wishes. May God bless all your endeavors, lighten your burdens, alleviate your sufferings, and prolong your happiness.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>We also hope that you live to be a hundred years old, own your homes and reap a harvest of gold.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow is Christmas Day, one of the most important holy days of the year. We will observe it. All will have a holiday tomorrow, the whole world has a holiday; therefore, no one will accuse us of wrong doing if we desire to observe solemnly such a holiday. In order to supply our subscribers with something to read, in case they have any time left for that purpose, we are mailing "Wiara I Ojczyzna" (Faith and Motherland) early enough so that they receive it on that day.</p>
   <p>We remarked in the editorial columns of our journal, a few days ago that other <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>newspapers ignored us but since that time favorable comments have appeared in several newspapers, therefore, we thank our colleagues very kindly and wish them a Merry Christmas.</p>
