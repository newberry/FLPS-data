   <p>It is with pleasure that we inform our readers that the new project of building a pedestal under the monument of Tadeusz Kosciuszko in Chicago has been accepted by the local artists commission. This project which has been worked out by the architect Mr. Spencer is more elegant and beautiful than the former one and, above all, it is not as costly as the other, about $1500 lower in cost. On the whole it creates a very good impression, is light and slender. At present there is a general accounting of all the offerings received toward the project, and just as soon as this is completed the task of completing the pedestal will get under way. It will be finished in about a month and a half so that the unveiling of the monument can take place at the end of May or early in June.</p>
