   <p>Ten years have passed since the Polish National Alliance called to life that champion of the Alliance and of the Polish national cause, Dziennik Zwiazkowy.</p>
   <p>Already a few years before its establishment, the lack was felt of a daily Alliance newspaper that could enter the homes of all Alliance members and help maintain the Polish spirit therein, spread our organization's ideals, and contribute to the growth of that organization.</p>
   <p>Our newspaper has filled the need adequately, and it will continue to do so. People may change, but the basic principles upon which the Alliance was founded can never change. Love of our motherland and of our organization will forever remain the criterion by which Dziennik Zwiazkowy will be conducted.</p>

   <p>Therefore, on this tenth anniversary of the founding of the champion of the Polish cause, I express my best wishes for its continued success and further growth; to its staff and all its employees, I offer sincere thanks for their conscientious work.</p>
   <p>J. S. Zawilinski,</p>
   <p>secretary of the Polish National Alliance</p>
