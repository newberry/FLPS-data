   <p>A Polish University in America.</p>
   <p>This watchword is trying almost violently to be popular, through the organ of the Resurrection Fathers and other clerical-national organs.</p>
   <p>The initiators are sending questionnaires to editors, writers, presidents of large Polish corporations, organizations, and other influential persons, asking opinions on such an important question.</p>
   <p>Indeed, the noise which has been started could not pass some ears which are sensitive to hypocrisy. It cannot fail to produce the saddest results.</p>
   <p>Who agitates for calling a Polish University to life?</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Who has a benevolent desire to become its organizer and protector?</p>
   <p>No one else but the well-known throughout America, fleecers and those who keep the people in ignorance, under the sign of Saint Stanislaus Kostka, the very reverend Resurrection Fathers and Gordons. In other words, a fraternity which has written the pages of the history of Polish immigration with the darkest letters, and which for over thirty years has kept in its clenched fists the child mind of the Chicago Polish settlement, and indirectly all Polish settlements in America.</p>
   <p>And such people have the intention of calling to life a new sanctuary of learning.</p>
   <p>Is it ridicule or derision?</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>A sanctuary of learning which cannot afford not to be free, or a sanctuary of medieval darkness, which has reigned long enough in that house of Polish exile.</p>
   <p>We judge that it is not only high time for establishing such a university, but the time has past for playing such pranks.</p>
   <p>Take off your masks Messrs. Resurrectionists!</p>
