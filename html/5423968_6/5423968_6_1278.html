   <p>On the 6th of April a bet took place between two Republicans, namely, Frank X. Kucharzewski and George Skszydlewski, in the matter of election of V. J. Jozwiakowski for alderman. Kucharzewski asserts that Jozwiakowski will be elected, while Skszydlewski affirms that he would not be elected, though both of them are Republicans and vote for Jozwiakowski.</p>
   <p>The one that will lose in this bet will stay on a street with a box and an inscription in his hands, asking for a free donation for the monument of Kosciuszko on Sunday, April 12, between the hours of 1 and 4 P.M., in front of the Kucharzewski's cigar store on 100 W. Division St.</p>
