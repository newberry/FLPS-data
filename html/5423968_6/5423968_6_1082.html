   <p>Another in a series of patriotic lectures was given Sunday, May 20, at University Hall, Town of Lake. As is well known, these meetings are held every two weeks, but last week's had to be postponed a week because of a parade of the Polish societies on the West Side.</p>
   <p>Dr. T. Kodis presented a talk on the present developments in this country: the centralization of capital and the meaning of this to labor. He pressed everyone to join the unions, for this is the only means of protecting the workers' interests.</p>
   <p>Members of the university entertained the gathering with instrumental music--it is much to our regret that we do not have any talented Poles in our vicinity. Mr. Chase and Miss Bauer played a duet on the violin and piano. Miss Hoffer sang a few English numbers and Miss Hess played the lovable "Minuet" by Padarewski.</p>
   <p>Miss Klimowicz declaimed the "Immigrants' Song" by Kondrotowicz [Polish poet] <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and recitations were given by the Misses Zolkowska and Kotowska.</p>
   <p>Another declamation was beautifully rendered by Mr. Chrzanowski, who, in conclusion, also sang a number by Maniuszko, a Polish composer. He received a great hand from the audience. The other numbers on the program were also well received.</p>
