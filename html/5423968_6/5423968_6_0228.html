   <p>According to I. Kowalski, secretary of the Educational Department of the Polish League, contributions of books, continue to pour in. Over thirty volumes were received recently.</p>
   <p>R. Raszczynski, of Chicago,contributed twenty-three books in Polish; Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek contributed the work Droga Do Nieba (The Road to Heaven); Mr. Neuman, of Milwaukee, offered ten copies of his paper Glos (Voice); and Miss Mary Jablonska, of Chicago, gave seven books in Polish mostly novels.</p>
   <p>Thanks are extended to all kind contributors by the administration of the Polish League. It is hoped that this support will continue, for without such support it will be impossible to open Polish libraries and reading rooms in Chicago and <span class="page-break">\2</span>throughout various parts of the United States. The work is slow, but in time much will be accomplished toward the fostering of Polish education and culture.</p>
