   <p>The Committee on Public Information has named Mr. Paul Berak as the organizer for the Hungarian American Loyalty League in the State of Illinois. Even though this paper and its organization does not fully agree with the ideas of this league, we are glad to hear that Mr. Paul Berak got this appointment. We know Mr. Berak to be a man of good character, and we feel sure that he will be the man to lift this organization to greater heights.</p>
