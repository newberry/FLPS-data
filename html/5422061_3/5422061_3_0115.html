   <p>p.1....Several American newspapers wrote that Al Capone is not an Italian, as heretofore everyone thought, but a Hungarian. They base this report on a news item that appeared in the Reggel (Budapest newspaper).</p>
   <p>The Reggel writes that the true name of Capone, is Coinelius Kapovicy, born in Arad, Hungary. His father Laszlo' Kapovicy says that "Al" studied carpentry, but on account of petty thievery left his birthplace to settle in Trieste in 1910, where he changed his name to Capone.</p>
   <p>He was not in Trieste long before he sailed for America. He wrote his father that he became a bandit and is very prosperous. The seventy year old Kopovicy- Capone claims to possess many letters from "Al." For a while Al Capone aided his father financially, but for a long time now the contributions have been stopped. The old man appealed to the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Press to help locate his son and to remind him of his filial duties.</p>
   <p>We hope this report will prove to be only a delusion of an old man.</p>
