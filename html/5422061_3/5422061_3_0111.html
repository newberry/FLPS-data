   <p>During the past week Mr. Louis Nagy, the Hungarian representative on the Committee of Foreign Born Citizens, became a very proud man. The United States government recognized him for the distinguished work he performed among the Hungarian people of Chicago. The government honored him with a blue star. This is a great honor, but we must admit that this man deserves the recognition because he has been a tireless worker in the interest of the Hungarian people.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian people can be proud of this man, and they can say that there is at least one man amongst them in Chicago who deserves recognitiion.</p>
