   <p>Erno Lengyel, 19, 1216 Marengo Ave., a Hungarian youth, has the tragic distinction of being the first one to commit suicide in the air. He shot himself Sunday afternoon way up above the airport, 63rd &amp; Cicero. Lengyel went up in a plane and asked pilot Daley to show him something nice. The pilot didn't notice that his passenger was dead until he landed. Lengyel had shot himself.</p>
   <p>His identity was established from a letter to his sister, in which the unfortunate young man writes, "I wanted to die happily, that is why I chose this method."</p>
   <p>Lengyel's most earnest desire was to become an aviator, but could not pass the tests.</p>
