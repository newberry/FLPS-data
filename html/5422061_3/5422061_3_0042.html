   <p>Let us start out under his (Lorthy's) leadership, whether he likes it or not, whether he is busy or not, he must lend an ear to our wish. We formerly called the attention of the American Magyars, to the "Huszar excursion," and we obtained the proper results, because we were not bothered by that "Great Lord" here, and at least they will know in the Old Country too that we cannot be tamed so easily by a handshake.</p>
   <p>Some "Counts" are mentioned as future ambassadors. Let them come. They will not be our ambassadors, they will only be the grave diggers of their own country. Those "ferocious" Counts will not bury us because we will ignore them; they cannot expect anything from us. There should be an end to the "sweet" newspaper articles.</p>
   <p>Until now, they with their empty heads, successfully squandered away the whole country. Now they want to try the same on us American Magyars, but they will not succeed so easily. They applied many forms of oppression <span class="page-break">\2</span>in the Old Country, including taxes, and the workers were always crushed. The poor workingmen gave everything, and they will continue to give, until they collapse under the heavy burden; they will not cry for mercy, only we will weep for them, but on the other hand, we are glad that we have escaped the claws of the "Great Lords."</p>
   <p>Here oppression is not necessary only the good will of the diligent Magyar workers and their readiness for sacrifices.</p>
   <p>We are the only ones who can bring that unfortunate country back to life and make her great and independent, and for that we don't need the "great ones." Our will alone is needed, and we refuse to do anything until they cease thinking that the old methods can be applied to us.</p>
   <p>Let the "Great Lords" get out of our way and we will finish the work honestly which our beloved native country can rightly expect. We will redress the wrongs committed by the "Great Lords" for centuries, if they will take our advice, and even the devil himself will not trouble <span class="page-break">\3</span>his head about them. This especially will be true when our thousand year old native country becomes independent.</p>
   <p>You, Mr. Lorthy, by your knowledge and your work here in America, you have attained your position without anybody's support, and you are assured of your future, but this is not enough, your duty is now to become our leader. We have had no opportunity to meet you at banquets or pilgrimages, because you are viewing the events from your seclusion. We are not satisfied with that. You must come out and help us prove that we are Magyars who did not grow fat on the skin of the emigrant Magyars, but that we are successful because we have worked hard. And let us prove that we are able to solve the present problems ourselves, without the oppression of the Old Country, without "Great Lords," and without their flattering, devilish newspaper articles, because they can only bring ruin.</p>
   <p>Let us show the world that we Magyars, living in this free America, can put our native country on her feet without the meddling of the "Great Lords." Now Mr. Lorthy you cannot give us excuses any longer because our native country is in danger, perhaps in greater danger than she was during the war. So we can only say come, let us get busy.</p>
