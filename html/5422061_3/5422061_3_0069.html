   <p>The Hungarian newspaper, The Magyar Nepszava ,in its last few issues has been taking all the credit for obtaining the Red Cross as an agency to handle mail for Hungarians between their homeland and the United States. But the fact is that not a single Hungarian letter that has been sent to the Red Cross, has been forwarded to Hungary. Now the Red Cross has announced that communication by letter between Hungary and the United States has been temporarily stopped.</p>
   <p>Probably some day the postal communication will be open between the United States and Hungary, but not just yet.</p>
