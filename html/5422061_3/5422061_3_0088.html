   <p>Our readers will recall that two months ago [Dr. Emil] Schreiner, retired Chicago Hungarian Consul, and his wife were killed as they were driving in an automobile in Banfalva, Sopron County, [Hungary].</p>
   <p>The murderer, a young bricklayer, admitted during the investigation, that he had shot at the passing automobile because his parents' chickens were gradually being killed by motor cars on the highway.</p>
   <p>We received word from Sopron that the court there imposed a sentence of one year imprisonment on the murderer.</p>
