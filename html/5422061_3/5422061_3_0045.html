   <p>The Hungarians in America have always maintained a connecting link with the homeland. This link has been a sentimental feeling more than anything else. The Hungarians in America have manifested with all their might the affection and the love which they feel for Hungary.</p>
   <p>Many individuals have tried, on numerous occasions, to provide a practical plan to bring about closer relations between the homeland and the Hungarians in America, and these efforts have had visible and striking success. In Cleveland we have erected a memorial to Kossuth; in Budapest we have set up a memorial to Washington. We brought the Hungarian national flag to this country with elaborate ceremonies. Other events of similar nature have been celebrated.</p>
   <p>Up to this day and hour everyone has done his share to show his kindly feelings; in fact, we have continually expressed our emotions. Now the shock of the World War has created a new situation in the homeland. The condition of the Hungarians in America is also changed.</p>
   <p>Our native land throughout many years past has hardly ever thought of the Hungarians in America or paid serious attention to them. We do not complain about this, for we in America have lost nothing thereby. Since the World War has so mercilessly wrought its effects on Hungary, the relations between the Hungarians here in America and the homeland have been completely altered.</p>
   <p>Now not only has Hungary become aware of our existence, but hardly a day passes but that the publishers of newspapers in our native country print matter which relates to the Hungarians in America. Our dollars and their poverty have created a new and odd situation. We have become their American uncles, of whom their poverty-stricken populace dreams,--from whom they hope to inherit, to their great felicity, our fortunes of millions of dollars.</p>
   
   <p>To boast or to condemn is not the part of prudence. We do not boast, nor do we condemn because when our native land was afflicted with poverty, we Hungarians in America bore the burden with gallantry and with open hands, forgetting that Hungary had opposed us and neglected us because of the beliefs acquired by us in America regarding race and creed.</p>
   <p>Our native land's distress has not been relieved, nor has our generosity ceased. We foresee that throughout the winter we shall hear more of both. This will be in order. We ourselves were the organizers of the Hungarian workers of America who relieved and helped the starving in Hungary, especially the innocent children. And what is more, we affirm without boasting that we have persuaded the Hungarians of Chicago to create an organization for the purpose of receiving funds and seeing to it that the funds are properly forwarded to Hungary. We also urged our people here to donate to the best of their ability. So now we feel that we have the right to assert ourselves.</p>
   
   <p>Those of you who have read the recent issues of newspapers received from Hungary must have felt the blood rush to your heads. We read that the situation in Budapest, relative to the security of the Hungarians, is much worse than at the time of Rosza Sandor's and Sobri Joska's ruffianism. It has been much safer to walk through the thickest woods of Bakony's than down the main street [of Budapest].</p>
   <p>The wide-awake, the builders of the new homeland, soon mobilized and showed their position, which was not anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism reveals weakness and produces weakness. Let there be no fight against Jews; that would be too one-sided and would be a cowardly fight.</p>
   <p>That dissolution of security and order which is advocated by anarchy would only bring insecurity to person and property,--chaos and confusion of the worst form and triumph for the anarchists. These self-styled moral uplifters are young hoodlums and ruffians who are fishing in troubled waters, while they continue to allow such men as Zakany Gyula, Daner Bela, and Ereky Karoly to dominate national affairs, such insecurity will prevail, and the result will be the overthrow of the government. They see that the Horthy government is passively carrying on. These Reds and profit-seeking hoodlums will soon find themselves before the bar of justice.</p>
   <p>From anarchy they derive their inspiration, their moral courage to take the law into their own hands, and their assumption of the right to requisition benzine, rooms, automobiles, and everything else which they may need for the use of the ruffians and the hoodlums. And their form of requisitioning is nothing more than thievery. In the old days of ruffianism in Hungary the method employed was highway robbery.</p>
   <p>This condition in Hungary must be stopped. It must be stopped as quickly as possible, before the country is completely wrecked. It is useless for any one in the homeland to speak out against this situation. It is useless for the press to protest. The government will be the same, in effect, if Teleky and his associates finally go, for then some other individuals with the same principles will take their places.</p>
   <p>Our opinion is that the Hungarians in America today have acquired rights in our homeland. In fact, it is to our interest here in America to prevent spreading over the cables the news of internal strife. Beginning with this, we must find a way to arouse public opinion in Hungary by sternly protesting from America. Our protest must insist on the establishment of law and order in Hungary.</p>
   <p>We do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of our native land, but today we have the right to force recognition of our voice, and for their own benefit they must accept our advice. The organized Hungarians of America and their newspapers must at last begin to speak out and to bring this mad situation back to normal conditions.</p>
   
   <p>Our homeland cannot expect material relief from us until it shows us that Hungarians can at least behave themselves like human beings in their relations to one another. They must also show us that law and order have been established by dealing sternly with those bands of rowdies, who themselves do not spare anyone, and by bringing them speedily to justice. Just as we have protested to Hungary against its form of government, so now we protest against Hungary's becoming the nest of shame of Central Europe and the Balkans, the rendezvous of the underworld.</p>
