   <p>Mayor Heath has issued an address to the people of Chicago, reminding them of the fact that in October, 1871, the contribution of HUNGARY,to the relief of the homeless and hungry sufferers of this city,amounted to $12,000. A good portion of this was doubtless furnished by the inhabitants of SZEGEDIN, the second commercial city of the KINGDOM. The terrible distress into which these people have been plunged in consequence of the recent floods calls for a reciprocation by Chicago of their abundant charity, it is therefore proper that the attention of our people should be directed to the matter in an offical manner. The DEAK VEREIN, a HUNGARIAN society in this city, has assumed the task of receiving and forwarding such contributions as may be offered Chicago should give a good account of itself in this HUNGARIAN relief movement. There is little danger that more will be given than is needed to provide for the 80,000 people reduced to destitution by the flood.</p>
