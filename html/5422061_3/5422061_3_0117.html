   <p>In accordance with the old ancient custom, there was a great "pork feast" in the home of Mr. Louis Tolmay, 628 E. 93rd. St. The host and his able assistant prepared two large porkers, in the usual old ancient custom, for his friends, and guests. A cheerful mood was heightened by the serving of good wine to top it off.</p>
