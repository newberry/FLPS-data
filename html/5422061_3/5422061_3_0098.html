   <p>After several weeks of planning, the Chicago Hungarian Reformed Church more than outstripped itself in its joy and happiness over the fact that its minister had been elected president of the western division of the Hungarian Reformed Churches. The selection of Reverend Eugene Boros is an honor to the entire Hungarian population of Chicago. On May 24, a gigantic banquet was given in his honor. The celebration started with church services in the morning. At these services, the Hungarian government was represented by Stephen Schefbeck, Hungarian Consul in Chicago, who extended congratulations to Reverend Boros from his mother country, and delivered a very heartfelt message to him from his mother, whom he has not seen for the past twenty years.</p>
   <p>The banquet began at 8:00 P. M., and during its course, the presidents of various organizations gave congratulatory addresses.</p>
   
   <p>Under the able leadership of Daniel Bodor, the Choral Societies of the Hungarian Reformed Church of Chicago, sang patriotic and folk songs to liven up the events of the evening, thus making it a typical Hungarian celebration.</p>
