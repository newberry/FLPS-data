   <p>Just as this edition of our paper was going to press, we were notified that Dr. Victor Gonda, eminent Hungarian psychiatrist, was offered a professorship at Loyola University. We are sure that every Hungarian feels proud of this recent acknowledgment of Dr. Gonda's ability. Dr. Gonda is the chief psychiatrist of the Mercy Hospital, and he will also lecture at the Cook County Hospital.....</p>
   <p>It was public knowledge in university circles that Dr. Gonda, who taught at the University of Chicago, was well liked by his patients and was worshipped by the students. His accurate diagnoses were acknowledged by other professors.....We have heard that Dr. Gonda is sorry to leave the University of Chicago where he has taught for five years. Many Hungarian patients, too, can testify that Dr. Gonda had tremendous success in curing one of humanity's greatest scourges--syphilis of the nervous system.</p>

   <p>Dr. Gonda's new post will keep him very busy, but we hope that he will find time to continue his efforts in behalf of the working class. We also take this opportunity to ask him to continue his articles on health and social problems in our paper, as he has done in the past under a nom de plume.....</p>
