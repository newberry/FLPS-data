   <p>The radio ball arranged by the tireless leaders of the Hungarian Radio Hour of Hammond, Indiana, Ivan Komarik and Irma Ferenczy-Komarik, to raise funds to broadcast a Hungarian program during the World's Fair from the radio station on the Fair grounds, met with great success, proving that the Hungarians of the South Side and the Calumet region are always ready to support those who give them enjoyment in Hungarian art and music, and demonstrating that the radio is the most effective way to spread our musical culture abroad.</p>
   <p>The radio ball held on Whitsunday, with its first-class program, was a great success, especially if viewed from a moral point of view. The program, from the first number to the final rolling down of the curtains, was greatly enjoyed by the audience, which gave expression to its pleasure with great applause. Even a Loop theater could not have produced a better program than the one we <span class="page-break">\2</span>saw Sunday at the Hungarian Home. In the careful arrangement of the program one could notice the experienced hand of Irma Ferenczy [Mrs. Komarik], and though the rooms of the Hungarian Home were quite well crowded, yet the beautiful program should have merited an even larger audience, if for no other reason than because the direction intended to cover from the proceeds of this ball the expenses of the Hungarian Radio Hour broadcast from the Fair grounds.</p>
   <p>The program opened with a speech by Ivan Komarik, which was followed by the music of the Stratinsky Brothers of West Pullman in which orchestra Martin Stratinsky played the accordion, Jimmy Stratinsky the piano, and George Stevens the violin. The music met with great success by its strange composition. The graceful Soltesz Sisters from Indiana Harbor made a hit with their dances and music selections. There is seldom found so much talent in a single family: the beautiful piano selection by Margit was accompanied by Irma at the saxophone and Pauline at the violin, while Wilhelmine performed her fiery gypsy dance.</p>

   <p>Bertha Koczan, an East Chicago piano teacher, played the more serious selections, rendering some classics and some Hungarian pieces with great virtuosity. Also successful was the Youth Choir of the Hungarian Reformed Churches in the Burnside district and the West Side, which sang masterfully some very beautiful Hungarian folk-songs. This choir, thanks to the untiring efforts of Reverend Eugene Boros, is now one of the best choirs of America, and we hear that it will be increased to about five hundred singers, with the addition of new members from other Hungarian Reformed Churches, for its participation in the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>John Petri, former ballet maestro of the Chicago Civic Opera, provided a never-to-be-forgotten entertainment, in which his dancing pupils excelled, both in groups and singly. The ballet was composed of Mary Karpa, Irene Mezei, Rose Szabo, Dorothy Dreisen, Betty Murtz, and Mary Kitry. Little Irene Mezey was much applauded for her acrobatic dances. Her teacher, Maestro John Petri, predicts a brilliant future for her. The music for the dances of the Petri, group was played on the piano by Miss Mary Warner.</p>

   <p>The violin solo by George Szabo, Jr., of East-Chicago, who played Brahms' "Hungarian Dance," encourages us to hope a successful and bright future for him. He was accompanied on the piano by Bertha Koczan. The young violin virtuoso received great applause.</p>
   <p>Radio listeners who already had heard young George Szopusek over the radio, met him again on this program. He sang the popular song "Old Gypsy," as well as two songs in English, and was rewarded with great applause. In the next Hungarian number, Irma Ferenczy-Komarik exhibited her brilliant talent. The dancing group of Maestro Petri assisted her in this excellently arranged play, which gave an opportunity to Maestro Petri to show himself in a marvelous Hungarian dance. For long minutes after the ending of this number thunderous applause could still be heard. The program was concluded by a little burlesque, "Night Quarrel," in which Mrs. Magda Hubert and Joseph Kaszas played very cleverly, keeping the audience constantly in good humor with their excellent acting.</p>

   <p>The performance was followed with a dance, the music for which was furnished by the orchestra of Miska Pal. The public left the Hungarian Home well late into the night, enriched with the memory of an evening well spent.</p>
