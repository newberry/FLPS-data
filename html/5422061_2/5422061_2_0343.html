   <p>The Hungarian Government has established a tourist information bureau at the Hungarian pavilion at the World's Fair. The Hungarian government's work cannot be sufficiently appreciated because our impoverished country is in great need of an influx of foreign visitors. This is beneficial in more ways than one, because not only will tourist trade boom conditions, but foreigners will have an opportunity to become acquainted with our people and also become friends of the Magyar cause.</p>
   <p>Dr. Joseph Vizsolyi is in charge of this information bureau, and is doing commendable work, despite difficulties. One of the effective inducements <span class="page-break">\2</span>is the distribution of attractive information booklets. Over a thousand booklets are given out daily. They are written in English and illustrated with pictures of points of interest in Hungary.</p>
   <p>We are positive that the tireless efforts of Dr. Vizsolyi will be rewarded during the coming season as is already in evidence.</p>
