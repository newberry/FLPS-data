   <p>The Chorus of the newly organized Senior Christian Endeavor Society of the Burnside Hungarian Evangelical Reformed Church made its debut last Sunday. The congregation was delighted to hear the thirty-six members of the mixed chorus sing with such exactness. It is gratifying to observe that a friendly contest has begun between the choruses of the Junior and Senior Christian Endeavor Societies.</p>
