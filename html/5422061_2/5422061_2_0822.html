   <p>Last fall I listened to a lecture by Thomas Vernon Smith, professor of philosophy at the University of Chicago. He spoke of the principles and influences that dominate our social life of today.</p>
   <p>There is food for thought in this abstract subject; but I wish, however, to discuss only that part of the lecture which applies to us, American Hungarians: "One of the foremost endeavors of the present social order," said the professor, "is to enact more and more laws, and through these laws to control the individual and his mode of life."</p>
   <p>Let us take, for instance, the life of our societies. For fifty years the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>State of Illinois paid no attention to sick and death benefit societies. The law was so liberal that a sick benefit organization could be a social, dramatic, burial, sick benefit and life insurance society. The charter permitted anything.....</p>
   <p>Eventually, [however,] diverse influences resulted in the restriction of the freedom of activity of our organizations. The present law states clearly under what conditions a sick or death benefit society may function. These requirements are so rigid that the weak and tottering societies are either doomed to extinction or they must consolidate with stronger organizations.</p>
   <p>The moment we hear of these new restrictions that will limit the freedom of activity in our societies, the first effect is a feeling of resentment. There is a conflict in our minds between familiar ideas and new ones. Sick benefit societies up until now have had a life like that of the Csikos [herd boy] of the great Hungarian Puszta [plains], who obeyed only the laws of heaven. Last year a new law was enacted and when we consider that it is not its purpose to annoy us, we will come to the sane conclusion that its purpose is <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the protection of our orphans and widows.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian societies were always magnanimous to their members, although in many cases it was apparent that some members took advantage of this and drew sick benefits for long drawn-out illnesses. Due to lack of professional insight, these vacationing pseudo-patients easily hoodwinked the well-meaning, but ignorant, visiting members whose duty it was to make reports. If, unfortunately, a society had many such members, it would have been sufficient to drive it into bankruptcy. The new laws puts more responsibility on the shoulders of the officers and physicians, but for the honest officers and members this will mean no hardship.</p>
   <p>Until we understand the new law better, let us not take a hostile attitude toward it. Let us not think that it means the end of our societies. Let us discipline ourselves; and let us not only reorganize according to the new law, but let us also school ourselves in the spirit of this law.</p>
   <p>Professor Smith advises that these constant changes in the social order should <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>not be greeted with animosity and antagonism by the minority, but with studied understanding and self-control which will make these changes more bearable. Our children understand the spirit of these changes and they do not harp on the good old times. They consider the present order of things natural and not--as we do--revolutionary and despotic.</p>
   <p>The path of the pioneer is full of thorns, because comfort-loving, slow thinking, shortsighted mankind frantically clings to the old order, regardless of the fact that the new one is better.</p>
   <p>In this present era everything is specialized. Since we find this true in trades and professions, why cannot our societies be specialized also? Whereas in the past a society had to take care of sick and death benefits, and at the same time was a social and dramatic club, now we can specialize. We can have social clubs, glee clubs and dramatic clubs.</p>
   <p>Members of these specialized clubs will be those who are kindred spirits, who <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>think alike,who have the same hobbies. This will eliminate much of the antagonism and make for more successful co-operation. This is the secret of long-lived native American organizations.</p>
