   <p>On Sunday afternoon, December 14, the Chicago Hungarian Theatrical Society made its first public appearance under the direction of Eugene Endrey. As an introduction, this performance will have great bearing on the activities of this society in the future. Mr. Endrey made mention of the fact that this organization was in its infancy, and is being nurtured by the Chicago Hungarians. It will be up to them to support this organization. We are satisfied the Chicago Hungarians will be faithful guardians of this great cultural organization.</p>
   <p>This performance was merely a test of strength of the organizers. In their first step in the theatrical world, the society sought to learn everything necessary to insure themselves of further development. We can rest assured now that the Chicago Hungarians will have a permanent theatrical organization which will devote all its time to entertain its friends who <span class="page-break">\2</span>reside in Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <p>Concerning the introductory performance, the beautiful operetta, "The Blue Mazurka," was presented. Its performance would have satisfied the most critical type of person. "The Blue Mazurka" is a beautiful piece of art, which contains romance and music which are pleasing to the ear. The acting was superb.</p>
   <p>We have very, very great hopes for the success of this society under the capable leadership of Eugene Endrey, because we are satisfied that each performance under his direction will be an exhibition of art.</p>
   <p>What this Society can produce we have witnessed. Now it is up to the Chicago Hungarians to show that they are good and faithful guardians of this newly organized society in order that both may reap the harvest they deserve.</p>
