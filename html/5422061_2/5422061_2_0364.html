   <p>After a long preparation full of excitement, at last the Hungarian Day took place in the Hall of Science at the World's Fair. In addition to the Hungarian visitors, there were many non-Hungarian ones, who occupied most of the seats without paying for them. This irritated those who had paid for their seats but who had to stand because their seats had been taken and their occupants could not be ordered to give them up, since admission to the place was free. And in a free place, first come, first served.</p>
   <p>Then again, we have to state that this time success was greater financially than artistically, though usually at such Hungarian occasions the opposite is always the case.</p>
   
   <p>Somehow or other here it was the opposite, since despite the fact that Hungarians had paid their hard-earned money, the Arranging Committee gave them nothing in return--not even seats.</p>
   <p>It seems that the Arranging Committee was only interested in making money and did not care a bit whether the audience was satisfied or not. But after all, why should the Committee worry--a Hungarian Day takes place only once.</p>
   <p>Though the Hungarians were present in great numbers, yet the Day looked like a ship without a pilot. This was evident right from the very beginning, proving that the Arranging Committee knew as little about the arrangement as a village blacksmith knows about chemistry.</p>
   <p>It was a shame which could not escape being noticed, that the march looked more like a funeral than like a festival.</p>
   <p>And who knows, maybe it was a funeral.</p>
   
   <p>Those who arranged this Hungarian Day should have kept in mind that their business was to show to other nationalities and to the American press, the cultural progress made by Hungary during the last century. Instead, the Arranging Committee presented a program fit for a picnic, a program which did not satisfy even the Hungarians, many of whom wandered away from there rather than face the humilation of seeing how their Hungarian culture was slapped in the face with that comedy.</p>
   <p>To make matters worse, the radio microphone was disconnected, which was a great humilation too.</p>
   <p>Those who know the history of our one-thousand-year-old country know well that Hungary is blessed with various periods of historical development. It would have been better to show these developments on Hungarian Day not only to the Hungarians but also to the people of other nationalities who were present there.</p>
   
   <p>It seems that the eyes of the members of the Arranging Committee were impeded by their own noses, as only so is it possible to account for the fact that they did not present Hungary as a cultured country.</p>
   <p>But again, maybe the race hatred so diligently cultivated by that little group which dictates from behind the curtains, played its role here too.</p>
   <p>Or do those gentlemen ignore that a peasant wedding or a harvest festival is not adapted to represent the culture of one-thousand-year-old Hungary, which culture we always cherish and proudly and with full right superimpose upon the culture of all other nations of Eastern Europe?</p>
   <p>A peasant wedding and a harvest festival are attractions good enough for a picnic or an outing, but they do not show the Hungarian cultural development to the people of the civilized world.</p>
   
   <p>It seems that the Arranging Committee had no intention of showing the culture of the Hungarians, but its own ignorance, and in this it succeeded.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian colony of Chicago, as well as that of the vicinity, has many brilliant artists and amateur talents who are capable of giving a good performance, and so there could be no difficulty in arranging a cultural program, which would have earned laurels for Hungary and her culture, so that the non-Hungarians present would express themselves in lauding terms rather than in disparaging ones.</p>
   <p>Would it not be much better if instead of the peasant wedding and harvest festival, Madach's "The Tragedy of Man" had been shown, supplemented with the events up to date, which could have been accomplished without any appreciable effort on our part?</p>
   
   <p>Would it hurt the Hungarian-Americans and the Hungarian nation any, if a program showing our culture, performed in a grand style, would be presented again under the sponsorship of some of the greater American newspapers?</p>
   <p>And in this program the results of the dismemberment of Hungary could have been easily shown, which would be better than any other propaganda in the interest of Revision.</p>
   <p>But unfortunately our "pure blooded" compatriots can boast only of their race cleanliness of doubtful value, for when the opportunity offers itself for them to do something in the interests of Hungary, then all their patriotism ceases.</p>
   <p>And we can thank these "patriots" for the fact that the moral success of the Hungarian Day was below all criticism, since the leaders considered financial success more important that artistic opinion.</p>
   
   <p>And thereby they have hurt Hungarian culture more than any enemy could hurt it.</p>
