   <p>The Hungarian Republicans of New York wish to announce to the Hungarians of America that their Party has passed the following resolutions urging all true Hungarians to live up to them, and to keep away from any activities that are sponsored by Geza D. Berko, the editor of the paper called the Hungarian American Peoples Voice, as this publication supports the principles of the Horthy regime and the further promotion of the Hapsburg dynasty in Hungary.</p>
   <p>Hungarian Americans!</p>
   <p>In September there will be an interparliamentary conference in Washington where every nation will be represented. The purpose of this conference is to insure world peace, democracy and liberty for the various nations [of the world].</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>The men who have been chosen as delegates to this conference by the different nations are the most outstanding men of their country.</p>
   <p>But who was sent by the Horthy regime?</p>
   <p>No comment is necessary since they are the trusted men of Horthy. We find that we must mention them, however, because they have called on the Hungarian press to promote celebrations in their honor, under the auspices of different Hungarian organizations.</p>
   <p>We will therefore discuss these illustrious gentlemen.</p>
   <p>The leader is naturally Gyula Pekar, who is the secretary of education, and a very eloquent man.</p>
   <p>Pekar is the one who helped save the Hungarian nation thus: he helped <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Friedrich and Roumania rob Hungary of all her natural resources, and he was the one who admitted openly in the Horthy parliament that Ivan Hejjas, the murderer, was the best citizen of Hungary and that he was sorry that Hungary had only one Hejjas. Pekar's name is also connected with the fact that the greatest of all Hungarian actors, Oscar Beregi, had to leave Hungary.</p>
   <p>Along side of Pekar stands Emil Nagy, the feudal and land baron, a royalist and a man who was always ready to deny the pleas of the common man in true Horthy style.</p>
   <p>Paul Petri, another secretary of education, about whom all we will say is that he was the one who was responsible for the dismissal of hundreds of liberal-thinking school teachers in Hungary. Perhaps we have said more now than we should in order to justify our feeling towards him.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Tibor Kallay, former secretary of finance under Horthy, is at the present time saving great sums of money for armaments and inciting neighboring nations to take arms against Hungary.</p>
   <p>Bela P. Poka, who was appointed by Horthy as a government advisor, is the sixth delegate from Hungary.</p>
   <p>Those we have mentioned thus far are pure Horthy representatives and leaders.</p>
   <p>There were other Hungarians appointed also. There was Joseph Stern, who during the World War was willing to sacrifice the last drop of Hungarian blood to keep the war going even when all was lost. This man at the present time is doing everything in his power to restore Hapsburg power in Hungary.</p>
   <p>This is the type of person who are representing our homeland at the interparliamentary conference.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The rights of man and the sacred rights of liberty have been insulted, and this has forced the Hungarian Republicans of New York to take action in this great land of liberty, and so they have drawn up the following resolutions:</p>
   <p>The Hungarian Republicans of New York protest, in the name of the Hungarian people, the representation of these men who have robbed the people of their most sacred rights and have exiled the finest and most beloved citizens of Hungary. The organization protests against their activities, because it is a crime that these people should be present at a meeting where sacred ideals are to be discussed.</p>
   <p>In connection with this protest, the organization wishes to call the attention of every Hungarian individual and organization, regardless of religious affiliations, to boycott any activities which will aid these representatives of terror-ridden Hungary, because they are betrayers of the high ideals of this conference.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>We urge and hope that all the Hungarians of the United States will stay away from these representatives.</p>
   <p>Dr. Samuel Buchle, President.</p>
