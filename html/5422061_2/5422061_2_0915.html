   <p>In Burnside, a new branch of the Protected Home Circle Benevolent Association, to be known as Hungarian Branch 202, has just been organized.</p>
   <p>This branch, although only a few weeks old, has a membership of fifty. From all indications this organization will soon have a membership of more than one hundred.</p>
   <p>The following are officers of the organization: Peter Auer, president; John Racz, vice president; Irma Barna, comptroller; John Doycsak, treasurer, and John Gabriel, inner guard. The organization holds its meetings the last Sunday of each month. Those people who are interested in this new organization are urged to communicate with Henry Barna, the organizer and founder of the Hungarian branch. He is located at 716 E. 92nd St.</p>
