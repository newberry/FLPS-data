   <p>The project to establish a Hungarian Catholic orphanage is confronted with the difficulties which beset all public movements. Opinions vary. Some say that a Hungarian orphanage would be superfluous because our orphans were born in America and there are enough American orphanages where we can place them. Others say that the Hungarian-Americans have enough troubles now without shouldering new burdens. There is no end to the objections against a Hungarian Catholic orphanage. The usual answer is that there is no money and that work is scarce.</p>
   <p>As in other cases, the question of money is not the decisive factor in a project such as a Hungarian Catholic orphanage. It is strength of conviction that brings about and keeps alive great institutions and finds a way to finance them. There is an old American saying, "Where there is a will, there is a way," that expresses what we mean.</p>
   
   <p>The realization of a Hungarian Catholic orphanage depends on whether there are enough Hungarians in America possessing the spirit of conviction required to inspire men to benevolence.</p>
   <p>It is true that there are enough orphanages in America where our orphans can be placed. However, why should we entrust the children of our late fellow Hungarians to the care of strangers? Why should we impoverish our race this way? Mutilated Hungary needs every one of her sons -- including the ones born or naturalized in other countries. As long as the Hungarian-American is brought up in a suitable Hungarian environment, he will become not only a useful American citizen but also a defender of the Hungarian cause -- a cause with which the world will sympathize some day. And who knows? Possibly one of these orphans has been selected by God to be a leader, a prophet who will be the champion of the Hungarian cause.....</p>
   <p>One of the most important aims of the proposed Hungarian Catholic orphanage would be to preserve every drop of Hungarian blood, which would otherwise be lost without leaving a trace. We believe that the true Hungarian spirit is not departed from the hearts and souls of the Hungarian-American Catholics, and that they understand the importance of this cause and will make sacrifices.</p>
   <p>Interest in the Hungarian Catholic Orphanage is growing every day. Those who observe the weekly reports of donations will notice more and more names of contributors each week. This is a sign of awakening. It is a regrettable fact that this awakening is not general.</p>
   <p>The fact is that the majority of the contributors are poor and have large families. Those who are familiar with American standards know that all Hungarian-Americans are not poor or have large families of eight or ten children. Large families, naturally, cannot afford to donate more than a dollar. In spite of this, the first contributions have come from poor families, proving that interest is not general, especially among those who have more of the worldly goods and from whom one would expect generosity.</p>
   <p>If every Hungarian-American Catholic would give according to his means, the orphanage would be built and would be a monument to our nobler instincts.....</p>
