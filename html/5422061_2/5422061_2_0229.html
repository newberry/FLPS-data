   <p>The pupils of John Petri, Hungarian dance master, were performing with remarkable success at the Goodman Theatre last Sunday, June 17.</p>
   <p>John Petri has been a resident of Chicago for twenty years. He was the soloist of the Chicago Opera ballet group. He has traveled all over the world with the San Carlo Opera Company.</p>
   <p>Petri has always been a master and now he has proven that he is a good teacher. The arrangement of the program numbers, the costumes and the artistry of his pupils, exceeded all expectations.</p>
   <p>The numbers deserving special mention among the dance section were: Brahm's Hungarian Csardas solo by Rose Szabo, and the Japanese dance <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>by Marietta Spitzer.</p>
   <p>Petri, himself, danced the "Sword" dance with many encores.</p>
   <p>We hope to see the pupils of John Petri perform again soon, and believe that many of them will gain fame in the dancing profession under the guidance and instruction received in Petri's school.</p>
