   <p>There are creations, of which in the moment of their first appearance few are able to sense, that they are road makers of the Future and that they are building quarters for the Future. Such a one is - we firmly believe, - The Hungarian American Radio News.</p>
   <p>The title: Radio News is not merely a name, but a conception and at the same time a program. The word "Radio" is the mirror of a new era, which came into being by the developing and quickly moving life, in order to teach us, to entertain us, to keep its hand on the pulse of the events and to retain everything which is worth to be retained out of the quickly flying waves of the ether.</p>
   <p>Others may judge our appearance just as they want to, but we feel, that we are fulfilling a calling like that, which prompted us to let our Hungarian Radio Hour fly on the wings of the ether.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We think and hope, that our brother Hungarians will receive the Radio News with the same love, as they received our Hungarian Radio Hours. These two are Twins, who are working with the same enthusiasm to satisfy the needs of artistical, cultural and technical knowledge of our brother Hungarians, which the tempo of the new radio era makes absolutely necessary.</p>
   <p>We can state the platform of the Radio shortly in the following:</p>
   <p>Cutting out all debates about parties, religions; no quarrels; to bring about a spiritual, artistic and cultural bond between the Hungarians, who live scattered all over, far from each other.</p>
   <p>To exercise a just and educating criticism over all kinds of cultural achievements: On the theatrical, amateur and artistic performances, over singing or musical concerts, dancing and other festivals. We intend to exercise these quite independently and uninfluenced.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>To give moral support to those young second generation Hungarians, who are coming up as having some talent in some field of the arts.</p>
   <p>To give account of all the Hungarian Radio Hours which are operating within the territory of the United States.</p>
   <p>Radio News gladly puts to disposition its columns to all those personalities of the Hungarian Cultural life, who are stepping to our sides in the sincere endeavor to help us in our road breaking tasks and who desire to work with us in building up the Hungarian Culture.</p>
   <p>The Radio aims to enlarge the knowledge and the views of its readers,to satisfy their thirst for art.</p>
   <p>We ask you to accept the Radio News with as much love as that which is moving us while we write its every letter. Close in your heart the aims and help us realize our endeavors.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Those who have Hungarian faith and Hungarian souls, will come with us. With these words we are knocking on the doors of the Hungarian hearts and greet the Hungarians of America.</p>
