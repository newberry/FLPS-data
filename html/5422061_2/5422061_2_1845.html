   <p>We have heard of two instances in which some of us here in Chicago discouraged European-bound tourists from entering our homeland. This sort of action does not alleviate the situation of our homeland; it only causes more hardships for our people. It takes the bread away from our starving brothers in Hungary! In both cases, the tourists were Americans, and the pessimists were Hungarians. The advice was given by people who were either misinformed or were lacking in loyalty to our homeland. We can dispense with the latter in short order, for they do not belong among us; but those who were misinformed we will willingly enlighten, for the dissolution of darkness is one of our great tasks.</p>
   <p>It is true that starvation and misery prevail in Hungary, and that many people are in rags. But why? Is it because, perhaps, there are no clothes, <span class="page-break">\2</span>shoes, or underwear available? Are they starving because there are no potatoes, meat, or wheat available? Of course not! Hungary has everything available. What the people do not have is the money to purchase these necessities of life, and the work by which to earn the necessary money.</p>
   <p>A decent and healthy balance does not exist between the earning power and the cost of the necessities of life. In order for a worker to live decently, he must earn a thousand korona a day. The average worker does not receive half of this amount for his work. The office workers do not receive one-fourth of this amount for his work. That is why so much misery and hunger prevail in our homeland. The aristocrats, high priests, jewelers, bankers, and politicians are not starving and are not in misery. If you have money, you can obtain everything in Hungary.</p>
   <p>The purchasing power of the korona is much higher to-day in Hungary than elsewhere, for the value of the korona is standardized there. Thus, when an American tourist arrives in Budapest or anywhere else in Hungary with a <span class="page-break">\3</span>well-filled pocketbook, he does not have to fear that he will starve or that he is eating food which should go to the starving people.</p>
   <p>Anyone who has read the recent issues of newspapers from the homeland has seen the articles pertaining to the beautiful and extensive displays at the various food markets; if there is very little activity there, it is because this food is beyond the reach of the average worker. How can a poor factory worker or office worker with a family purchase pork if a killo (21/4 lbs.) costs 140 to 150 korona? For an American tourist the price is very cheap; the price of two and one-fourth pounds of pork chops would be 28 cents in American money. The price of five korona for one egg is prohibitive to the residents of Budapest, but to the American it amounts to only one cent. Of course, if the visitor was to earn his livelihood in Hungary, then he too would be opposed to the prices of foodstuffs on the markets of Hungary. But by exchanging the money he earned in America for Hungarian korona, and making his purchases with the korona, the American will find that it is very much cheaper to live in Hungary than anywhere else.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Now then, it would be very fortunate for our homeland, if by some means there would come to Hungary more foreign tourists with foreign money to spend. If this should happen to our homeland, then the tremendous worry and burden would be eased from the heart of our finance minister, Heqedus. This would save the nearly worthless korona. It would soften the heavy problems of imports and exports. The greatest piece of luck that could strike our homeland at this time would be for five thousand foreign tourists to arrive in Hungary this summer, with each one spending an average of a thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>The circulation of five million dollars of foreign money in Hungary would promote agricultural growth, enable the government to stabilize the value of the korona at a higher rate and settle the problem of duties on exports and imports, and enable many thousands of unemployed to return to work immediately.</p>
   <p>The banks in Hungary are today building cold storage plants, in which to store surplus food products. It is very costly and troublesome to ship to foreign ports, and, because our foreign neighbors are striking against the <span class="page-break">\5</span>high cost of living, we find that the surplus food either becomes spoiled or finds its way into the cold storage plants.</p>
   <p>The American movement to save the Hungarian children from starvation is not made necessary by the lack of bread and rice in Hungary. Hungary is requesting aid from America for the starving children only, because these children have no one who can afford to purchase food for them--there is no work or money. Those who have a little money find that the money they do have has no purchasing power.</p>
   <p>We see advertised in the newspapers of Budapest the fact that the cost of a dinner or supper, consisting of four or five eggs as the entree, and including musical entertainment, is thirty cents of American money. This would be an ideal way for the American to enjoy his meals, with a real Gypsy orchestra, and a few drinks of that delicious Hungarian champagne--all for thirty cents.</p>
   <p>For a Hungarian worker the cost is prohibitive, especially if he is a family <span class="page-break">\6</span>man. If the Hungarian worker attempts to live on this scale for a time, where will he get the extra money to pay rent, light, hundreds of different taxes, carfare, etc.?</p>
   <p>Hungary does not suffer from a shortage of food! Only those who are mistaken or who desire to do harm to our homeland would say so. The trouble originated in the printing of worthless money by our homeland's government. In addition, irresponsible leaders and an unsound form of government have brought about the loss of the export trade. Hungary has no commerce, no coal, no railroads, no steamships. Without coal or transportation, commerce and industry cannot exist. Therefore, since commerce and industry do not exist, we have no work and no income, and when we have no income we have no bread. Thus we find, in our homeland, misery, sacrifice, despair, hatred, murder, robbery epidemics, and suicides.</p>
   <p>We feel very much disheartened that epidemics of disease and suicides are prevailing in our homeland. If we continue to chase away the foreign tourists <span class="page-break">\7</span>and visitors from our homeland, we are by these actions sanctioning the increase of terror, misery, starvation and suicides in Hungary.</p>
