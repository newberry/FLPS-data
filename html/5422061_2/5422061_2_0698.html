   <p>Fans of the tamest sport, ping-pong or table tennis, will be glad to hear that Victor Barna and Sandor Glancz, world champions, our compatriots, will be in Chicago to play against the American champion, Jimmy McClurer, and the ex-champion, Coleman Clark, on Jan. 6.</p>
   <p>Victor Barna won the world championship in 1932, 1933, and 1934. Glancz has taken the honors twice.</p>
   <p>The matches will take place at the Stevens Hotel. We have no doubt that the Hungarian boys will win again.</p>
