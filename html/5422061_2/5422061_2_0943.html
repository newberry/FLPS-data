   <p>The Hungarians of Chicago appreciate and support the movement to establish the Old Hungarian-American Home. Not only in words, but in deeds, do they express their sympathy toward this worthy institution. The Hungarian Literary and Social Club has contributed $1500, so that the Home may pay the installment due on its real estate. Louis Szappanos and the Sinko-Szantay Company each donated $500.</p>
