   <p>When in September the Hungarian Nation as a gesture of it's gratitude unveiled the monument erected to the memory of the American General, Harry Hill Bandholz, his widow, who lives in Michigan, could not be present at the ceremonies. The Chicago Magyar Club invited Mrs. Inez Bandholz to a reception party in honor of the memory of the late general. Mrs. Bandholz accepted the invitation in order, to make the acquaintance of the sons of that nation, which erected a lasting monument to her late husband's memory. The Reception Party will take place on November 14, Saturday at 9:00 o'clock in the evening in the localities of the Chicago Magyar Club (100 East Ohio Street).
