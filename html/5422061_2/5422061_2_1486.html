   <p>p.2....Inasmuch as it has an important bearing on the future of our church, our pastor will call on the families of the congregation to register their names. To be able to keep our children in the Hungarian Christian social circle, we have to know if we have enough contributing members to be able to keep up the Hungarian Greek Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>We ask the members and friends of our church to assist us in attaining our aim in building up our membership.</p>
