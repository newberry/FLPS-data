   <p>The Hungarians residing in the more central part of Chicago have done a lot of talking in regards to building a Hungarian Home for recreational purposes. The question is discussed and soon everyone involved forgets about it.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian community located on the South Side of Chicago, known as Burnside, has many organizations. One of these, The Virgin Mary Roman Catholic Sick Benefit Association at its last meeting started the ball rolling and opened a campaign that will make a Hungarian Home in the community of Burnside possible. This organization has voted four thousand dollars as a start in the campaign. The project is to be supported by practically all organizations on the South Side. It is the hope of all involved that this plan of a Hungarian Community Center will be realized in the near future.</p>
