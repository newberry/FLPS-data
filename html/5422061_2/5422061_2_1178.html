   <p>The majority of Hungarian immigrants want to be real Americans. His motive in comimg to America is probably as pure as that of the earlier English colonists. He left his home and came to America for economic opportunities in a new country, for freedom of oppression and extortion, for homes and schools and citizenship in a free republic. The Pilgrims of 1626 did not come to America for more nobler purposes than did these Hungarian immigrants.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian immigrants have worked hard to make America great. At <span class="page-break">2</span>first, filling the ranks of unskilled labor, but later, they have in many instances acquired special skill, and have risen to places of distinction. Their work has gone into the building of a nation. They have helped a great deal in bearing the burdens and responsibilities of America in the making. But we should now consider all foreign born, and give them an opportunity to bring themselves in harmony with the spirit of America. This cannot take place if we segregate ourselves, speak a foreign tongue and remain in ignorance of American ideals and institutions. These people must become Americans.</p>
   <p>Americanization is the bringing together of old and new America. It is the interpretation of America to the foreign born, and vice versa.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Americanization will begin when the native born American says to the immigrant: "We, honestly welcome you to all opportunities that a free land can offer. This democracy of ours is a partnership of all men who believe in equality of opportunity, in the abolition of class distinction, and in the sweeping aside of racial and religious prejudices. I want to learn from you the reasons why you came to America. I believe that many things which you brought to us are well worth having. Your music, literature, science, art, and many of your customs, should enrich the culture of this nation. I want to know and understand you better.</p>
   <p>I want to make you feel at home here with us. I shall give you the <span class="page-break">4</span>chance to learn our language, and I shall give you an opportunity to become an American citizen, I shall also assist you to get acquainted with a wider group of people than that of your own nationality.</p>
   <p>We want to make America a vast fellowship of free men. Let us understand each other, let us get together."</p>
   <p>Americanization is in progress when the foreign born says to the native born: "I want to know you better too. My children shall go to American schools to learn the English language. I have no desire to keep alive in your country a part of the nation from which I come, as I have chosen America for me and mine. I find it hard to learn a new <span class="page-break">5</span>language so late in life, but others have learned it, so why can't I? I shall keep some of my culture, my music, my art, and my great literature, for they are not for that country from which I came alone, but they are for the world. I shall learn to appreciate your culture also. I have given up my allegiance to the foreign ruler, and I shall become a citizen of your republic. I shall endeavor to go to school here to read your books and newspapers, thereby becoming a part of this great free nation."</p>
   <p>Americanization is not a one-sided process. It can only succeed when the American recognizes the worth of the newcomer, and seeks to bring out his full value. Americanization is not charity, or patronage. It <span class="page-break">6</span>is an attmept to unify all the people of this nation through mutual understanding and trust. When every native born American understands this, the task of assimilating the foreign born will be easily accomplished. For Americanization is the simple matter of getting together.</p>
