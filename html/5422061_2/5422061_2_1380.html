   <p>Since the World War, two distinct, strong, and steady dominating forces have been active among the Hungarians of America.</p>
   <p>Here and there certain individuals, constituting one of these forces, have tried to organize groups, promote movements, and persuade existing societies to give moral support to the Hungarian government.</p>
   <p>Opposing them are the Hungarian-speaking Communists, who are under the influence and direction of Russia. These Communists, in their own special way, resort to any means to weaken the American-Hungarian supporters of the Horthy-Bethlen regime. Often these Communists have been successful in obstructing liberal Hungarians as well.....</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, neither of these two forces has achieved any permanent results so far, except the erection of the Kossuth statue in New York, which was made of inferior material, a fact for which the leaders were accused of graft. But even so, the patriotic Hungarians did go through with their plans and built this permanent memorial.....</p>
   <p>Now comes the Buffalo National Conference in May. Our views on the matter have been clearly stated before and we do not wish to change them now. However, here and there we hear questions that demand further explanation.</p>
   <p>We have at hand a copy of the cable from Count Mihaly Karolyi and the League Against Horthyism. Karolyi says that he considers the Buffalo National Conference an instrument to spread Fascism, and that we must fight against it.</p>
   <p>We (the Magyar Tribune) were loyal to Karolyi [Translator's note: Count Mihaly (Michael) Karolyi was the president of the short-lived Republic of Hungary.] for ten years. We respected his unselfish, clean political career, his honest and democratic efforts, but we were not members of his party. His sacrifice and martyrdom impressed us. We consider him a noble person, who, in his struggle for the Hungarian working class and rights for the people, was abused left and right.....</p>
   <p>Our respect for Karolyi is not lessened when we say that, for the present at least, we do not share his opinion and will not follow his advice.</p>
   <p>We--who have known intimately and have studied closely the American-Hungarians, their important activities for a quarter of a century, and are well acquainted with this National Conference movement--can earnestly say that the aim of the Buffalo National Conference is not to spread Fascism or propaganda for the Hungarian government.</p>
   <p>If we would have the slightest suspicion that the American-Hungarians are being invited for these infamous reasons, then not only this newspaper but many others would not be among the sponsors of the conference.</p>
   <p>Without a doubt the Buffalo National Conference will be a conglomeration of people. Anyone can take part and everybody will. Only the Hungarian Communists are not invited. The faction better represented numerically will determine the future course of events. This is democracy.</p>
   <p>If the liberal-minded Hungarians stay away from the Conference for any reason, the conservatives will dominate the situation.</p>
   <p>Frightening away the well-meaning Hungarians in advance, means that the League against Horthy or Karolyi is trying to make a fiasco out of the Buffalo National Conference.</p>
   <p>We can predict that the Conference, set for May, will bring together representative Hungarians in large numbers from all parts of America.</p>
   <p>Nothing can stop this as nothing could stop the Hungarians from erecting the Kossuth statue in New York.....</p>
   <p>The ideals--the aim of the Buffalo National Conference--are honest and democratic, the ultimate purpose being the welfare of our people. We must not, therefore, disparage these efforts now.....</p>
   
   <p>It depends on the American-Hungarians what the outcome of the Conference will be.....</p>
   <p>The duty of the Hungarians is to send individuals to Buffalo known to them as loyal citizens of the United States, individuals who not only swear to abide by the Constitution, but who also believe in it, and who because of this conviction will vote against the corrupt Habsburgs, the reactionary Hungarian government, and the oppressors of the people. They will vote, imbued with the American spirit and their love for the mother country, for the good of the suffering Hungarian people, for the advancement, strengthening, and recognition of American-Hungarians.</p>
