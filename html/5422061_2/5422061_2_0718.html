   <p>The Cleveland Hungarian soccer football team, together with the Chicago boys who represented the Hungarian "All Stars" in a game against the Chicago League stars, were honored at a banquet.</p>
   <p>The entire time was spent in good fellowship. The banquet was started at 9 o'clock in the evening. After supper was served, Mr. Peter Peel, president of the Chicago soccer football league, delivered a speech in which he voiced great praise for the great work that the Hungarian colonies are carrying on in the world of sports.

   <p>Mr. Joseph Kenessy, president of the Hungarian Athletic Club, then thanked the Cleveland club for their cooperation which enabled the two teams to get together. Mr. Kenessy presented silver medals to the members of the Hungarian team.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. Kramer, secretary of the soccer league was asked to say a few words. Mr. Kramer said that he felt greatly honored to be present at this occasion, declaring the social life and good fellowship that existed in the Chicago Hungarian Athletic Club was hard to find elsewhere. He also stated <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>that he has seen many other nationalistic athletic organizations, but none that brought so much honor and glory, through good sportsmanship and clean play, to their organization. Mr. Victor Schon, secretary of the Cleveland club, thanked everyone connected with the athletic event. He also praised the friendly feeling that existed between these two Hungarian Athletic organizations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schon stressed the importance of the cultural benefits of athletics. Everyone should participate in its development, he stated.</p>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Mayer, then expressed his appreciation for being invited as a <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>guest of the Thalia Literary and Song Society. Judges Mc Kinzie and Crompton told the Hungarian Athletic organizations that they hadn't come in contact with a more sportsmanlike group of fellows in all their lives, and stated that they were greatly honored to be present.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alex Halmassy, captain of the Cleveland team, and Mr. Frank Foldi then told the audience that they had done their work and that they expected 100 percent cooperation from the people in conducting this movement.</p>
   <p>The remainder of the time was spent singing Hungarian folk songs and in dancing. The music was furnished by a genuine Hungarian Gypsy orchestra.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>The music was enjoyed by everyone.</p>
   <p>There was a good reason for this celebration because the Hungarian all stars achieved great honor when they defeated the all stars of Chicago, thereby, crowning the Hungarian name with glory.</p>
