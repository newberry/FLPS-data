   <p>The Italia Hall was packed to capacity when the Hungarian Operetta Theatre of Chicago presented the "Kissing Woman", a three-act operetta. Rozsi Kassay, Adrienne Tomory, Simi Varga, Joska Virag, and Manci Szabo played the leading roles.</p>
   <p>This was the first presentation of the newly formed Chicago Hungarian Operetta Company, and it was a great success. It is up to the members of the company to do their best in coming productions, because the audience will show its appreciation by attending in greater numbers, if they receive real artistic entertainment.</p>
