   <p>The Hungarian-American youth of Chicago's North Side and South Side are working hard to prove to the older folk that "blood is thicker than water."</p>
   <p>These young people have organized in order to keep the Hungarian and American spirit alive in the hearts of the coming generation. This newly formed organization will be known as the Na-Bu-Co. Its main purpose will be to foster the spirit of Hungarian entertainment among the young people. The organization will have members who will teach Hungarian folk dances and Hungarian music to all those interested, regardless of their nationality.</p>
