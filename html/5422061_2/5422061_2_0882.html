   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Rakoczy Sick-Aid Society on January 29, 1921, gave a mask-ball in the Schoenhofen Hall. The ball was a success both materially and morally.</p>
   <p>At the ball prizes were awarded to those who wore the best costume. There were many prize-winners.</p>
   <p>For the success of the ball credit must be given not only to the members of the amusement committee (whose president was Joseph Holnar) but to every member of the society who worked hard to assure the success of the ball.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Rakoczy Sick-Aid Society informs everybody that its annual picnic will be held on June <span class="gap">[gap]</span> in the beautiful gardens of Elm Grove. All other Chicago Hungarian societies are requested not to arrange any entertainments on that day.</p>
