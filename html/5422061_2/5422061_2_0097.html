   <p>Laci Racz's Gypsy Band from Budapest gave its second concert last Sunday at the Eight Street Theater. This concert attracted--we regret to say--a rather small audience, but those who attended it warmly praised the artistic play of the King of Gypsies and his band. Laci Racz XXXVI and his orchestra took hold of the audience with their beautiful playing, just like they had done at the first concert, and those present enjoyed the solos and ensembles.</p>
   <p>Particularly delightful was the solo number by Julishka Varady, who later played and received great applause together with Louis Horvath and Joseph R. Toth in the one-act play, "On the Hayloft".</p>
   <p>The public listened attentively to the whole program, for after all, where can we find a Hungarian who does not enjoy the music of Laci Racz and his excellent band? Yet, we must say that the people did not get the kind of performance that the price they had paid for the tickets called for. Naturally, we do not insinuate that Laci Racz failed to give us all we were expecting from him; on the contrary, he gave us more than we were entitled to expect--he and his band played better than we had anticipated.</p>
   <p>Laci Racz and his band offered us enjoyment that would have been worth five dollars had we been amusing ourselves at a coffee house--but as a theatrical performance it is not worth two dollars. If you go to one of the better movies, for thirty-five cents you get a varied program which offers you good amusement and the enjoyment of art at its best.</p>
   <p>The arrangement of the program was faulty. Had Laci Racz and his orchestra appeared on the stage only once or twice it would have been better than to let them stay on the stage throughout the performance. To satisfy the public, the program must have a variety of attractions.</p>
   <p>It looks as though Mr. Friedman, the director of the ensemble, does not care whether the public is satisfied or not. He probably is trying to reduce expenses as much as possible, figuring that the smaller the expenses, the larger the profits.</p>
   
   <p>We hope that this empty theatre has brought home the lesson to Friedman, that besides looking for his pocket an impresario has to satisfy the public. Only then will the Hungarian theater be filled again to capacity, which, in turn, will bring the desired profit.</p>
