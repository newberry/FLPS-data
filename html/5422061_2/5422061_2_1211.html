   <p>At its last meeting, the Foreign Language Information Service passed a resolution which sharply denounces the different laws about to be passed in Congress regarding aliens.</p>
   <p>The text of the resolution is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, Several bills are pending in the case of the registration of aliens, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, In the opinion of the Foreign Language Information Service, this registration would divide and separate that part of the population which this country is trying to absorb, and, instead of increasing their feeling of loyalty, the new laws would hinder their assimilation and their desire for naturalization, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, These laws would affect innocent foreigners and would introduce a spy <span class="page-break">\2</span>system which would lead to graft, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, In the opinion of the Foreign Language Information Service, the registration of aliens is wrong in principle and contrary to the American tradition of personal freedom, and would complicate matters, causing serious difficulties; be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That the Committee of the Foreign Language Information Service will oppose all movements for voluntary or obligatory registration of aliens and asks Congress to drop all such plans."</p>
   <p>As in the past, the Foreign Language Information Service is carefully watchful in defending the rights of the foreign-born in the United States. But in addition to this, every foreign-language group should take part in this struggle to avert the dangers of registration. We urge the Hungarian churches and other organizations to wire their protests to their senators and congressmen.</p>
