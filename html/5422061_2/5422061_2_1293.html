   <p>The people of the United States will celebrate the birthday anniversary of their first President, George Washington, on February 22.</p>
   <p>George Washington was born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, February 22, 1732. From early youth he took part in public affairs. He was a great statesman, a great general, loved his country, and was a real hero who always fought for his country. He astounded the world by leading his small army to victory in their fight for liberty. He freed his country from British oppression and thereby started the United States on the road to a glorious future. The population of three million has grown to today's 130 million. Without Washington's victorious fight for freedom, the people of this country would probably never have attained the present standard of cultural and economic progress.</p>

   <p>From past history we know that each era, each nation, had its own leader. What George Washington did in his time to save his people from disaster is being done today by our great President, Franklin D. Roosevelt. The days of the Revolution were difficult, but it is as difficult for President Roosevelt to rescue this nation of 130 million from the whirlpool of disaster.</p>
   <p>We will be thinking of the gigantic task that is set for President Roosevelt when we celebrate the birthday of George Washington.</p>
