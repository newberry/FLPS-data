   <p>If there is anything full of interest and bound to awaken the interest of the intelligent person, it is the process of the creation, animation, and development of the human being. Only an ignorant person, one who does not care for his own being, can look at this process indifferently, but certainly not a cultured man, who is anxious to know for his own well-being and that of society.</p>
   <p>A very interesting and instructive lecture was the one given last Sunday at the Open Forum of I.W.W. in the Wage Earners Home by Dr. Martin Zeitler, distinguished Hungarian physician. The topic was "Heredity and its Consequence on the Life of the Infant." In a few concise sentences the doctor explained the laws of heredity and emphasized the fact that a child does not inherit the characteristics of body and spirit acquired by the parents after birth, but only those characteristics which were present in the original cell. After conception, the human being is formed by the <span class="page-break">\2</span>environment in which it lives. For example, during the time between conception and entrance into the outer world, the child is formed according to the nourishment taken by its mother, the state of her health, the kind of work she is engaged in during pregnancy, etc. All this plays an important role in the development of the fetus before birth, just as in the life of the born child the environment, the school, the work, companions, food, health conditions, etc., are factors which influence the formation of the characteristics of the man.</p>
   <p>Further in his lecture, Dr. Zeitler described the laws of nature in heredity, the ways and means to restrict the birth of those who would be brought to the world deformed in their bodies or minds, adding to this that these means are for the time being at least hardly possible to be employed.</p>
   <p>After this valuable lecture, the speaker gave prompt answers to all questions put to him by the audience.</p>
