   <p>The Hungarian press has unexpectedly received an addition in the form of a monthly magazine, called Interest.</p>
   <p>We do not know why the publisher christened it Interest, because that is not a Hungarian word, but perhaps he wished to symbolize the Americanization of our Hungarians.</p>
   <p>Contributors to the first number were Franklin D. Roosevelt, Franz Herczig, Dr. Anton Feher, etc.</p>
   <p>We wish luck to this new publication.</p>
