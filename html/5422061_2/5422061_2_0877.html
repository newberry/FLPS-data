   <p>The West Pullman United Sick and Benefit Society held a masquerade ball February 6, at the Pythian Temple Hall, 9235 Cottage Grove Avenue. The majority of the South Side Magyars were present, and assured the material success of the ball. The beautiful costumes represented the high degree of the aesthetic taste of the Magyars.</p>
   <p>Everybody had a grand time. The officers of the Society, who arranged the ball, were rewarded in a large measure.</p>

   <p>The Woodmen Circles Women's Lodge, 120, sponsored a splendid entertainment in Kossuth Hall. On account of the uncertain weather conditions, the ball began rather late. The business manager of our newspaper suggested to the guests that an artistic Chardash dance performance be given. From the many volunteers who thought themselves qualified for the dance, only a few young people were selected. The most artistic Chardash dancers were the following: John Konrad and Anne Varga, Mr. and Mrs. Elias Danks, Mrs. Paul Szabo, Steven Kasa, and Mrs. Steven Sabo. It was thought advisable to revive the Magyar dances often so that the younger Magyar generation would know them too.</p>

   <p>For the material and social success of the ball, the officers of the society must be given due credit. The Rakoczy Brass Band also excelled that evening. If they continue this progress in the future, they soon will be able to compete with the best American Brass Bands.</p>
