   <p>The Federation of [Hungarian] Associations of Greater Chicago, on its meeting--held on April 18 in the home of the Chicago Hungarian Club--resolved to protest against the practice of some organizations to speak and make decisions and resolutions in the name of all Hungarian associations of Chicago.</p>
   <p>According to its by-laws, the Federation does not meddle in religious or political questions, its sole aim being to support through the society all movements serving the interests of the Hungarian-Americans, and to guard the good reputation of the Hungarian name in the eyes of all the people of the United States.</p>
