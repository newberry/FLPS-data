   <p>p.11......................There is an increasing interest in the new Hungarian school, which was begun at the North Side Roman Catholic Church and the number of the enlistments grows from week to week. The teaching of religion in Hungarian language is done by Rev. James Kasztovszky, the reading and writing in Hungarian is taught by Ing. Michael Bayer, a former teacher in Hungary. The school term will last till the opening of the summer school, and is held every Saturday beginning at 2:00 P.M. There is room for some more pupils and the leaders of it ask the parents to send their children to these Saturday schools.</p>
