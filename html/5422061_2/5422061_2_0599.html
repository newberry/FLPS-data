   <p>Strange as it seems, the Hungarians in America have never had the opportunity to see a complete Hungarian talking picture, that is, one with actors actually speaking Hungarian in the original film. Nine months ago attempts were made to show talking pictures, but these, almost without exception, lacked the speaking part which came additionally , so that the greater part of the film had to be shown in the old silent fashion. Such shows have naturally disappointed the lovers of Hungarian films, and only now will the public have occasion to enjoy a first-class picture, where the conversations, from beginning to end, are spoken to our hearts in the sweet language of our dear old country, in a manner which the Americans call "talkies".</p>
   <p>Praise for this is due our well-known compatriot, Steve Komarik, who has succeeded in coming to an accord with one of America's greatest studios, which has successfully produced several excellent movies in Budapest. The best of all these plays is the one entitled: "The Secret of the Doctor," which will be shown for the first time here in America in the Burnside [district], the most populous Hungarian center.</p>
   
   <p>After this premiere in Burnside, the picture will be shown in other parts of Chicago.</p>
