   <p>p.2.... We all know that there will be a World's Fair in Chicago in 1933. We also know that all nationalities in Chicago are making preparations for this event. We Hungarians have not as yet done anything. It is time that we make some preparations to represent Hungary at the World's Fair, thereby gaining respect.</p>
   <p>We can't remain idle. We must do something. Let us get together to talk over details and then act.</p>
   <p>Time of meeting Jan. 30, Wednesday evening at 8; place of meeting: Room 529 Burnham Bldg., 160 N. La Salle St.</p>
   <p>Requesting your participation, we are respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Dr. Arpad Barothy, Pres.</p>
   <p>Rev. Julius M. Hanko, Sec.</p>
