   <p>The Hofbrau which is the most liked meeting place for the Chicago Hungarians, will in the future enjoy an increasing popularity. As the place is very often too crowded, Louis Wagner, the owner, took over the adjoining store, and the Hofbrau will be twice as large, as it was. The new hall, which will be known as Alpine Room, will be decorated by the wall paintings of Nicholas Gaspar, the world known Hungarian painter. This Thursday and Friday will be the opening festival, and many members of the Hungarian societies will be present.</p>
