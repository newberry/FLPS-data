   <p>p.1...A statue of Louis Kossuth, the great patriot, is being erected in New York. There is only one Kossuth statue in the United States at present. It is in Cleveland.</p>
   <p>The money for the statue is being contributed by Hungarians in the United States. In every larger city with Hungarian population Committees are being formed for the purpose of collecting the needed sum. An old and trustworthy institution in Chicago took this work upon itself.</p>
   <p>There is no Kossuth statue in Budapest. This is sad, but true. Several statues were destroyed in the capital during the "red" (Communistic) regime. It may happen that the statue in New York will be finished before the one under work for Budapest.</p>
   <p>Louis Kossuth's statue can be viewed by the seven million New Yorkers, and it will symbolize the honesty and love of liberty of the Hungarians.</p>
