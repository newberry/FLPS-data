   <p>At last some activity has started among the Chicago Hungarians.</p>
   <p>During the past few months there has been little or no activity in the life of Chicago Hungarians.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian societies' Central Committee sponsored a Baltazar festival, and since then we haven't heard from them. Therefore many people thought that this organization had ceased to exist. The organization is still in existence, and hasn't the least idea of disbanding. All that they are doing is conducting their work very quietly.</p>
   <p>The reason for this is that they want to gather more strength to continue their work.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian Home question has arisen again.</p>
   
   <p>The Hungarian societies' Central Committee has started the Hungarian Home movement with renewed energy. This project concerns the entire Hungarian population of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We learned this in a roundabout manner since the Hungarian societies' Central Committee has not yet informed us of these activities.</p>
   <p>We believe that the plan is in the interest of all Chicago Hungarians, and it should provoke action from them since it concerns all the people, not just a few Committee members. If we all felt the same as the Central Committee about this matter, we would just sit back and listen to the idea.</p>
   <p>In our estimation it is our duty to inform the Hungarians of Chicago of any and all activities which are of common interest.</p>
   
   <p>The Hungarian societies' Central Committee made the mistake in the past of misinterpreting some of our articles pertaining to the Hungarian Home. They did not look for faults in their own plans but were continually finding fault with other people's ideas, and blaming them because their plans were not successful.</p>
   <p>We hope that all these things will be forgotten in the future, and that we will start writing the history of the Hungarian Home anew.</p>
   <p>We state truthfully that we always felt that Ferenc Kalman was a capable man, and that his leadership would mean a great deal to this organization. We knew that he would be able to find the ways and means by which this great Hungarian project might be sponsored.</p>
   <p>We depended on him because we knew that one or two obstacles would not stop him.</p>
   
   <p>The only question in our mind was when would he realize that we had showed him the path which would eliminate the misunderstandings.</p>
   <p>So it looks as though they have finally realized that we were working for the benefit of the people.</p>
   <p>We have heard that the Hungarian societies have called a big meeting for next Wednesday. At this meeting they expect to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of consolidating several of the sick benefit societies. At this meeting it will be permissible for the members of the different organizations to voice their opinions on the questions that come up, although certain organizations are only sending delegates.</p>
   <p>We believe that this is the proper method by which certain delicate questions can be easily ironed out.</p>
   
   <p>Everybody will admit that the Chicago Hungarians are in great need of a Hungarian Home.</p>
   <p>Everybody must also admit that the Central Committee, without the aid of the different organizations, can't bring this to a reality.</p>
   <p>A Hungarian Home cannot be built with fine speeches, campaigning, and faultfinding.</p>
   <p>In order that a Hungarian Home may be built it is necessary that a definite plan be adopted and that the necessary funds be available.</p>
   <p>Our advice is that the securing of the required funds should be handled by different organizations and societies.</p>
   <p>We have said for some time that the societies are the ones that should decide whether or not there should be a Hungarian Home.</p>
   
   <p>If a Home is necessary--and it certainly is--we want to have more than enthusiasm; we must bring in financial donations which will make it a reality.</p>
   <p>If under these conditions the Hungarian Home is not built, then we can't blame the Central Committee, but we can blame ourselves and our societies for the downfall of this project.</p>
   <p>We are carefully following the developments, and we will inform our readers from time to time, regardless of whether the plan is successful or not--and we hope that it will be successful.</p>
