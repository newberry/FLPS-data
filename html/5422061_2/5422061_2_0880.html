   <p>The Verhovay Mutual Benefit and Aid Lodge, No. 164, held its regular annual Masked Ball on Saturday February 5. In the early hours of the evening, the beautiful Prudential Hall was filled with the merry-makers. There were many masked dancers, every one thinking himself entitled to win the first prize. Among the many beautiful costumes was really an original idea, representing dismembered Hungary.</p>
   <p>A few members of the independent Hungarian Society Juvenile Orchestra were invited to entertain the guests with music.</p>
   <p>The children played very cleverly, and the audience showed its appreciation by frequent applause, and also gave them money.</p>
