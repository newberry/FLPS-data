   <p>p.1..... Chicago had an interesting guest last week in the person of Vilma Banky, Hungarian film actress, who is the second person after Victor Varconi, trying to win laurels in America. It is gratifying to know that Hungarian talent is being appreciated in this field too.</p>
   <p>Vilma Banky will make her screen debut in the "Dark Angel". The Goldwyn film company has many good roles for Miss Banky for the future and it is probable that in a short while she will become a very popular star and in this way will bring glory to the Hungarians</p>
