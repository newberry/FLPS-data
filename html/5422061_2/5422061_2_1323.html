   <p>On Saturday night, March 20, the Chicago and Vicinity Social and Sick Benefit Society celebrated the anniversary of Hungarian independence. This celebration was attended by a large number of Hungarians in Chicago and vicinity.</p>
   <p>The success of this affair is credited to the efforts of John Rakos, who was the managing director. He also wrote a very patriotic play for this particular occasion. When he wrote this play, he proved that playwrights are made, not born. Mr. Rakos is a plain working man, who found time for writing this beautiful playlet.</p>
   <p>Its performance was very successful, but we are not in a position to be critics at the present time, but we promise our readers that in our next week's issue we will give a broader account of the play and program of this celebration.</p>
