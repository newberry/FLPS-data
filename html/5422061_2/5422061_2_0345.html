   <p>Erno Kasas, painter and art instructor, exhibited his newest work at the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>Originally, the fresco was made for the East Chicago Library.</p>
   <p>The painting is 34 ft. long and it required six months to paint the work.</p>
   <p>At present, it is displayed in the pavilion of General Exhibit 4. The space was given by the Cuneo Press. The General Exhibit pavilion is next to the Science Building, where the Hungarian Day celebration was held last year.</p>
   <p>We are glad to hear that this achievement will reflect its glory on the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Hungarian Day celebration because the success of Erno Kasas is, without a doubt, a Hungarian success also.</p>
   <p>The characters on the fresco depict poetry, music, Columbia, and beauty, the combination of ancient and modern art.</p>
