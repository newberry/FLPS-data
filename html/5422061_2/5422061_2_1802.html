   <p>In the animal kingdom there is a very patient animal which bears a cross on its back. During Admiral Horthy's last campaign in the United States he hung a fiery cross on the chests of his faithful followers. The only difference between the cross-bearers mentioned above is that the animal wears its cross without knowing about it. These faithful cross-bearers of Horthy will soon be hurrying back to Budapest for hand-kissing ceremonies; they will thank Horthy for the high honors accorded them [for their work in suppressing] any activities on the part of the Hungarian-Americans [in behalf of Karolyi].</p>
   <p>The rights and freedom of the people are secondary; this is the curse of the Horthy regime. Every sober-minded person can see that these cross-bearers are people who sold themselves to Horthy, regardless of the fact that under his leadership, the crippled nation of Hungary will be led to ruin. All that <span class="page-break">2</span>these people are interested in is personal glory or important government positions. Some even dream of occupying a parliamentary seat.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian-Americans are acquainted with these marked gentlemen who propagandize against activities in behalf of Karolyi. These people received [awards of] distinction for their work, not because their activities were helping to ease the suffering of the Hungarian people. Horthy's American ambassador and consuls are just like the one we have in Chicago who is continually snooping around among the people, shaking hands and handing out compliments freely in order that he may take advantage of them and swing them away from the ideas of Karolyi.</p>
   <p>A large number of those who have received honors from Horthy are priests. This was done because the Hungarian-Americans are faithful church members. They believe that every word of the priest is sacred. [This is the first reason for Horthy's favoritism toward the priests.] Secondly the priests realize that if either Horthy or some one else should declare a republican <span class="page-break">3</span>state in Hungary, the vast properties of the Church would be confiscated, and the power of the priests over the people would be abolished. This is the reason for the priest's faithfulness to Horthy.</p>
   <p>The reformed ministers have come to a temporary agreement with Horthy. Naturally this agreement will be useful only if Horthy is successful. Everyone remembers that when Horthy took power in Hungary, Dr. Dezso Baltazar, bishop of the Reformed Church of Debreczen, Hungary, made some untimely speeches for which he almost paid with his life. His tour in this country at the present time is being made successful through the efforts of Horthy's henchmen. Even our Hungarian consul in Chicago has sponsored a luncheon in honor of the Bishop. This shows very clearly why the Hungarian reformed ministers of America are receiving the cross of distinction.</p>
   <p>We are anxiously waiting to see when the Jewish priests will receive their awards. It is true that a few of those who have received awards are Jewish, but this is <span class="page-break">4</span>only a camouflage. We believe that the Hungarian American Jews will disown all Jews who accept this type of distinction. Such an award will act as a tool to prevent the advancement of the Jewish people in Hungary and [to negate the worth of their achievement.] The Hungarian-American Jews won't forget that after the 1848 war for liberty in Hungary it was the Jews who helped put Hungary back on its feet. [After the World War they would have done it again in a few years.] But the Horthy machine of destruction used fire and steel to kill and drive the Jews out of Hungary in order that the properties of the wealthier Jews might be claimed by the government.</p>
   <p>We could name many Hungarians who have done noble things for the suffering people of Hungary, but we think that each Hungarian community should deal with its own citizens whether they be good or bad. We shall discuss only those who affect the lives of the Hungarian people in Chicago.</p>
   <p>First we must stop at the door of Father Stephen Soltesz, the priest at the <span class="page-break">5</span>Hungarian Roman Catholic Church on the South Side of Chicago. This gentleman is working hard to increase his own personal wealth, and cares little for any patriotic movements that might be going on around Chicago. This charge is proved by the fact that his church is ready to fall apart, although he has been making collections for a new one for a long time. The entire Hungarian population of Chicago is disgraced by the dilapidated condition of this Hungarian church. This priest feels fine when he can climb into the pulpit and warn his people against going to hear Karolyi, if Karolyi should come to Chicago. Therefore this man must be watched.</p>
   <p>The award given to Eugene Boros, minister of the South Side Reformed Church, is quite a surprise. This minister of the Hungarian Reformed Church of Chicago was present at a farewell banquet given in honor of Brentano at the Hungarian University Club. His speech was so radical that even the extreme radicals present protested. And last year at the flag dedication ceremonies of the Rakoczi Society where he was the honorary speaker, he declared Lenin and Trotzky, the founders of Red Russia, to be the two outstanding men of the day. So Horthy <span class="page-break">6</span>hung a medal of distinction on this man. But that is all right because Brother Boros will repay him when the time comes to talk about Karolyi, should Karolyi come to Chicago. Then the Chicago Hungarians should [mark the words] of this exponent of the "red" cause.</p>
   <p>That Louis Szappanos has received his award will not surprise anyone. Because this man has served two crosses for quite some time. Every Hungarian will remember that when John Hock was here, he asked the Hungarian Societies's Central Committee to request their membership to participate in a peoples meeting. Szappanos was the president of the organization at that time; he misrepresented the decision of the organization, and in an official letter insulted John Hock.</p>
   <p>Now we are waiting with great interest for the Chicago Hungarian Independent Song Society to sponsor a banquet in honor of the recognized gentleman, Louis Szappanos. But perhaps this organization has a large Jewish membership which will disown Szappanos and will draw the membership away from this Horthy cross-bearing soldier. His type of person only worms his way into Hungarian societies <span class="page-break">7</span>in order to gain an official position that he may obstruct any movement against the activities of Horthy. All those who received recognition or money from the Horthy government, should be repudiated by the Hungarian-Americans.</p>
   <p>Recently a noble example was set for us by a group of Hungarian businessmen from the South Side of Chicago who returned one of our daily papers that constantly insults Karolyi to the editors of the paper with a request that the subscription be suspended because they did not care to read such filthy material. Every Hungarian should do likewise, and from now on no one should contribute to any Horthy activities. There is at present an individual traveling around, visiting Hungarian communities and asking for contributions for a Horthy orphanage. However these contributions will be used to subsidize government affairs. Naturally this agent who is making these collections receives a large salary from the Hungarian Ambassador in Washington. The liberal Hungarians have donated thousands of dollars already. All Hungarians should think twice before they sign any sort of pledge or contribution, because there <span class="page-break">8</span>has been more than enough of these swindles. The Horthy cross-bearing warriors are multiplying like flies in the spring.</p>

   <p>Our notable reporter, Mr. Korbacs, wrote this very interesting article on which we wish to comment. In Chicago there are many Hungarian men and women who through the years have served generously and faithfully all Hungarian social and cultural activities, both here and abroad. But these people were not available for political activities. So naturally the ambassador and the consul forgot about them as far as Horthy activities were concerned, and they forgot about them because they wanted to.</p>
   <p>The Horthy-Bethlen government was unfair in its distribution of crosses of recognition; therefore they cannot expect to received aid from the respectable and honest Hungarian-Americans. We Hungarian-Americans will not stand [inactive <span class="page-break">9</span>in the face of the distress of the] unfortunate people of Hungary. [we must give active support to their struggle against] this reign of terror.</p>
   <p>The Magyar Tribune heartily congratulates those Hungarian men and women, of Chicago and vicinity, whose contributions are impartial and always in the interests of social and cultural development [without thought of personal honors or awards of distinction.] These are the people who are the soldiers of the Hungarian cause, and they represent those Hungarians who are true and loyal to the fundamental principles of their people.</p>
