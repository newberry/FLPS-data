   <p>This Sunday Burnside was the seat of a magnificent festival. The South Side Reformed Church celebrated the completion of a quarter century of existence. The whole congregation, children as well as grownups, had been making preparations of all kinds for this festival for several months, and their efforts were crowned with the tremendous success which they had earned. A festival of joy was this for the members of the Reformed Church of the South Side, but at the same time it was a joyous festival for all the Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity, who came together to admire the splended achievement of their brother Hungarians.</p>
   <p>The public gathered in vast numbers, regardless of creed, thereby confounding those who babble about the curse of Turan, since they demonstrated in fact that there is harmony among Hungarians so long as the Hungarians stand alone.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>This splendid harmony it was which helped the Reformed Hungarians of the South Side achieve their superb success, the achievement of their ambition cherished since the beginning of the year: to free the church from debt by the time of the jubilee.</p>
   <p>The grandiose festival, which will remain forever in the memory of the South Side, was begun by a festive divine service on Sunday at 10:30 A.M. The prelude on the organ was played by Mrs. Stephen E. Balogh, and the Reformed Church choir of East Chicago sang an anthem translated from English into Hungarian by Mrs. Joseph Kocskemethy. The choir of the church also sang very well under the able leadership of Miss Anna Melegh, deaconess. Miss Ethel Revesz played several organ solos. Among the Reformed Church clergymen present, from Chicago and vicinity were the Reverend Messrs. Alexander Mircse of Indiana Harbor, Gregor Garay of South Chicago, Joseph Kecskemethy of East Chicago, and Benjamin Jozsa of Joliet; and the minister of the neighboring St. Vincent M. E. Church, the Reverend J. C. Yemm, was also present.</p>

   <p>After the church service the gathering formed itself into an imposing procession, in which the delegations of all the different associations marches with flying colors to the strains of Szepessy's band to the banquet in the Hungarian House.</p>
   <p>The public was evidently surprised and pleased at the sight of the tastefully arranged table decorated with flowers, where everything sparkled with cleanliness and order. Their second surprise was the self-disciplined co-ordination and co-operation with which the young ladies of the Church received the guests, and without hesitation or inquiry everybody was led to his designated place.</p>
   <p>During the dinner the serving proceeded in the utmost silence and with the greatest care. We do not know who planned this banquet with such thoughtfulness, but whoever he or she may be, the organizer deserves the greatest credit, and the arrangement itself could serve as an example for everybody in the future.</p>

   <p>As soon as the public was seated in the banquet hall, the pastor of the church greeted those present through the microphone and asked the Reverend Arpad Bakay, of Gary, to serve as master of ceremonies and the Reverend Dr. Julius Melegh to pronounce the blessing. The traditional Csigaleves (soup with noodles made like snails), the excellent fried chicken, the stuffed cabbage, and the delicious cakes, made by the blessed hands of skilled Hungarian women, promptly won the favor of the public, which consumed them with delight. After the meat course the festival speeches began to flow, and they lasted until 5 P. M. During the meal Szepessy's band played some music, but the Hungarian folk songs sung by the church choir, composed entirely of second-generation Hungarians and led by Deaconess Arne Melegh, were most heartily received by the public. For these songs the piano accompaniment was furnished by Miss Ethel Revesz. William J. Boros, professor of mathematics and son of the Reverend Eugene Boros, late minister of this church, played the violin with the skill of a real virtuoso, which he is, and the playing of Bela Olah was also favorably received. The public also had the opportunity of enjoying the really <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>artistic compositions of Alexander Rudnyansky, rendered by the excellent Hungarian pianist and composer himself, and in his songs one could easily detect the real soul of the Hungarians.</p>
   <p>Among the speeches was one delivered by the Honorable Ladislas Medgyessy, royal Hungarian consul, containing the message of our native country and praised the achievement of the South Side Church in maintaining Hungarian sentiment in second-generation Hungarian-Americans. Among others present at the banquet were Representative John G. Ryan, James J. Sullivan, Democratic committeeman, and Michael P. Mulcahy, alderman of the Eighth Ward, who all spoke very highly of the Hungarians in general and of the members of the church in particular. Most favorably received was the speech of the Reverend George Thegze, the Greek Catholic priest of Hammond, with its humorous tone, in which he proposed that the members should create a lasting memorial to this festive year by Christening one baby from each family in the church in the course of the year following.</p>

   <p>The first presbyter of the church, Mr. Joseph Gasparik, its second presbyter, Samuel Beluscsak, and the third presbyter, Paul Szabo, Senior, related some interesting episodes out of the church's past.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ernest Loevinger, section chief of the Chicago Health Department, spoke about his connection with the South Side Church through his close friendship with the first pastor of the church, the late Reverend Aladar Jezernitzky. Frank Kovach, the director of the Hungarian Hour of Radio Station WIND, Cornelius Szakatits of the Hungarian Family Hour of WWAE, and Henry Gross of the Hungarian Hour of WHIP delivered their greetings to the jubilee. Emery Frank of the Hungarian Daily Szabadsag, Frank Kalman of Interest, Ignacio Izsak <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>of Iras, and Bert Kalnay of the Magyar Tribune presented their good wishes for the further progress of the church.</p>
   <p>There were many more speakers on the list, but since the hour was so far advanced, many of the would-be orators renounced their claims to allow time for the young people to indulge in dancing. The speeches were concluded with those of the Reverend Stephen E. Balogh and Stephen Szabo, presbyter, in which they heartily thanked the public for its participation in the festivities of their church.</p>
