   <p>December 13 was a red-letter day for the Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity. Dr. Imre Josika Herczeg, the president of the Overseas Hungarians' World League, was here among us to acquaint our people with the League's aims and to ask the Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity to join.</p>
   <p>About two or three hundred Hungarians, many of them from out of town, attended the meeting. After listening to the speakers, the assembled proceeded to establish a local branch, electing Dr. Arpad Barothy as its president.</p>
   <p>After the election of the other officers and some rather heated debates and the announcement of a union with the national organization, the meeting adjourned, our countrymen leaving with the feeling that they had spent the evening doing their duty toward the old country.</p>
