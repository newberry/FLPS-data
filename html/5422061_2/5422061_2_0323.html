   <p>Chicago's oldest and most distinguished German society, the Germania Club, held its spring festival not so long ago, and since its program included the most celebrated artists in Chicago, it is quite a piece of good news for our Hungarian hearts to hear that the greatest success of the evening was attained by a group of Hungarian girls dancing the Csardas and other Hungarian national dances.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to note that these girls were discovered by Mrs. Ludwig, herself of German origin, the dancing teacher of the North Shore Conservatory, and a former member of the New York Metropolitan Opera and later of the Chicago Civic Opera. The music director and manager of these Hungarian dancing girls is Dalbert Chute, well known in our circles for the feeling he puts into the Hungarian music he plays.</p>
   <p>The ensemble has already had much success in Hungarian plays (usually whenever Irma Ferenczy took part), and now they enrich the collection of their former laurels with new ones, this time before an audience of another nationality.</p>

   <p>The Csardas group is composed of Maria Blasko, Margaret Bonifert, Erica Buzy, Margaret Chako, Helen Gyorke, Julia Kantor, Victoria Kasser, Helen Makert, Anne, Betty, and Helen Rehor, and Marion Werbovszky.</p>
