   <p>At the brilliant performance of the operetta "End of the Song", given by the Hungarian Cultural and Singing Club, we found with a certain satisfaction that the often expressed statement that "the Hungarian language here belongs to the vanished past", is far from the truth. The audience which came in such large numbers to this performance and found so much pleasure in this show that the applause sounded like a hurricane, proves this beyond a doubt. Yes, the Hungarian language still lives here and will continue to live as long as there is a group of enthusiastic Hungarians capable of producing such magnificent performances.</p>
   <p>It is only necessary that the Hungarians who are anxious to preserve our Hungarian culture join the enthusiastic group composing the Hungarian Cultural and Singing Club, whose only aim is the cultivation of the Hungarian <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>language and culture. By joining the Club, the latter would be strengthened, and thus be able to realize its cherished old dream--to found a library with a reading hall for the Hungarians. Such a library would become a stronghold of Hungarian culture, and would do away with our anxiety about the destiny of the Hungarian language here.</p>
