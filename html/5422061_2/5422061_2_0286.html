   <p>The Hungarians of Chicago have the reputation of being staunch supporters of their national theatre, even more so than their countrymen in more populous Hungarian centers, such as Cleveland and New York. We have had two types of theatrical producers: those who deserved our support and those who regarded the theatre as a godsend to plunder the theatergoers--which may be one of the reasons why, aside from the present economic crisis, our theatrical life has been rather stagnant during the last two years. And, God be praised, this is not because we lack local talent. We are certain that our people would again crowd the theaters were they sure that the artists do not regard the enterprise as a mere business proposition to satisfy their hunger for profits.</p>
   <p>This situation has been recognized by a number of our local artists who <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>united recently for the purpose of awakening the still smouldering love of the Hungarians toward the theater. These artists will present performances worthy of our Hungarian drama, song, and music--performances which shall stand on a high artistic level. [Translator's Note:The article gives the names of the artists of the Theatrical Company.]</p>
   <p>The first performance of this company will be held on March 5 at the Turner Hall, when the Hungarian comedy "The Wheatears Are Ripening" will be brought to the stage for the first time in America......If the hopes of this new theater ensemble are brought to realization, the artists will present on the stage other excellent Hungarian plays. It depends on the Hungarian public whether the Hungarian theater will have a more or less permanent home in Chicago.</p>
