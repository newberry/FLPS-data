   <p>A great holiday was declared by the faithful followers of Horthy throughout the United States because Karolyi took leave of this country, and he had to leave without his muzzle being removed by the Government of the United States. These standard bearers of Horthy's are awaiting new rewards of distinction for their anti-Karolyi activities. The Horthy-glorifying Chicago Hungarian consul has asked all the faithful followers of Horthy to assemble for a meeting in order that they may talk over a few things because Karolyi and his wife plan on touring this country next summer sometime.</p>
   <p>Many of the larger newspapers have avoided criticism in regard to the activities of the Government and its stand against free speech. The Chicago Herald and Examiner in its Easter number started activities with reference to the muzzling of Karolyi. Charles Hughes, the recently returned minister, has been denounced for his activities in this affair.</p>

   <p>Your priests and ministers are the trumpet-bearers of Horthy, and the editors of some of our Hungarian newspapers of which the names are not worth the ink in which they are printed circulated a petition among our priests and ministers, who signed this in the name of us Hungarians without consulting us. The contents of this petition were a request to Congress for the deportation of Karolyi because he was detrimental to the common good of the people of this country.</p>
   <p>Hungarian-Americans, do you not blush with shame when you think of the fact that you did not want this man deported from this country, this man M. Haly Karoly, who sacrificed everything for his native land? He came to this country, to the largest republican democracy in the world, and he came here with the idea of defending himself in the eyes of the world and of his enemies, and when he got here, he was muzzled. You, through your priests and your ministers, asked for the deportation of this man.</p>
   <p>Why do you not question your priests and ministers about their reckless acts, which were performed in your name without your permission?</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Now all the larger newspapers of the United States will print accounts of the injustices rendered to Karolyi. Are you going to keep still and have American opinion turned against us? Do you want the Hungarian people to be considered the scum of the earth? Do you want them to say that such people do not deserve anything better than a ghost king such as Horthy?</p>
   <p>I am going to write ten commandments, to which all good Hungarian-Americans should adhere:</p>
   <p>1. Question your priests and your ministers in regard to that filthy document which they signed in your names.</p>
   <p>2. All those priests and ministers who praise Horthy and degrade Karolyi from their pulpits or elsewhere should be reprimanded and straightened out on this question.</p>
   <p>3. All those miserable Hungarians who are warriors of Horthy's and have <span class="page-break">4</span>been decorated with the cross of distinction should be dealt with accordingly.</p>
   <p>4. Enlighten all Hungarian businessmen who are for Horthy and against Karolyi.</p>
   <p>5. Do not read any of those newspapers which are for Horthy.</p>
   <p>6. Organize open mass meetings during the summer, in which you can receive thousands of signatures requesting that Karolyi be allowed to enter this country and speak as freely as he wishes.</p>
   <p>7. Do not attend any meetings called together by Horthy organizers. As a matter of fact, it is your duty to discourage other people from attending.</p>
   <p>8. Do not make any contributions to any funds which are started <span class="page-break">5</span>by Horthy sympathizers, since they are not for a worthy cause, nor will they be used in Hungary; they will be employed to pay propagandists located in this country.</p>
   <p>9. Do not invite any of the Horthy government representatives to any of your celebrations, since it is they who want to take advantage of the good nature of Hungarian-Americans.</p>
   <p>10. Do not create enemies through religious prejudices. Think of 1848, when the patriotic Jewish population of Hungary marched right alongside the Hungarian soldiers and fought with them in the bloodiest of battles, sacrificing their lives in order that liberty might be born in Hungary.</p>
   <p>Hungarian-Americans! If you comprehend the meaning of these ten commandments and will act accordingly, the American reaction will be surprising. Americans will tell us that we are noble descendants of Louis Kossuth, and the American public will demand that Karolyi be allowed to enter the United States.</p>
