   <p>The First Hungarian Women's Benevolent Society of Chicago and suburbs, and its associated society, held its February meeting recently. At this meeting, a discussion was held principally on the methods of handling the money in the Carol fund. The meeting was held on the second floor at 11405 Michigan Avenue. Mrs. Gabor Varga brought in four new members at this meeting.</p>
   <p>It would be a very good idea for every man and woman among the Hungarians in America to hold a contest between themselves which would result in increasing the memberships of the societies, instead of always criticizing each other, and providing alibis for themselves. If we could have our societies full of members like Mrs. Varga, then the Hungarian-American Societies would be the leading Societies in America.</p>
   <p>Without the full support of the members, the officers of the society are helpless. While the officers keep urging the members, results are shown. This is an important matter which none of us should forget.</p>

   <p>For this reason, the reporter for this publication attended this meeting to bring the attention of the women to this important matter. After all, our paper is being published for all our readers, whose opinions and interests we must serve, and not for a few individuals.</p>
   <p>We trust that our old members, as well as the officers, after having learned their lesson from the past, will energetically work together in the interest of the society. We know that in this way we will be successful, and encourage other societies to follow.</p>
