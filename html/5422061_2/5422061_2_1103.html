   <p>The Chicago police have arrested Dr. Bela Szentivanyi, who was charged by Priscilla Szabo, of 4114 Arthington St., with obtaining $1,100 from her on the promise of marriage. She claims that he deserted her after she gave him the money.</p>
   <p>Priscilla Szabo met Dr. Szentivanyi in Cleveland, who came to that city from South America. The meeting took place in the Red Cross pharmacy, where the doctor attracted attention by showing off an exotic animal.</p>

   <p>The animal was a cross between a monkey and a skunk. Later the lady's fancy was taken by the owner of the animal, and she fell in love with him. However, her love was not returned, because the doctor, after borrowing money from her, disappeared and came back to Chicago. Here, he donned priestly raiments and in a few years expected to go to China as a missionary.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Szabo's charges put a stop to his missionary activities, at least for the present.</p>
   <p>Judge Howard Hayes, of the Felony Court, tried the case. The doctor claims that he did not promise marriage to Mrs. Szabo, but only borrowed money from her. The judge believed him and decided that he has to pay back the money in $120 installments to the lady.</p>
   <p>The moral is that women should be more careful about getting too friendly with such gentlemen.</p>
