   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Workers' Chorus has been formed Apr. 13, 1932. Its aim is to aid worker movements and give moral support to victims of industrial strife.</p>
   <p>Those Hungarians who can't join because they can't sing, may become supporting members.</p>
   <p>The Workers' Chorus deserves the support of the Hungarian organizations, because it is at the service of everyone on any occasion.</p>
