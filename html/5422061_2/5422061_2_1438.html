   <p>The chorus of the Hungarian Baptist Church will give its second annual concert April 22, Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock. The program includes beautiful old and new church songs. Several of the numbers will be rendered in English because many American friends will attend.</p>
   <p>The chorus has been studying for months to make this concert an outstanding one. There are twenty-four young men and women members of the chorus who sing equally well in both the English and the Hungarian languages.</p>
