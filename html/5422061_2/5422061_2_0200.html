   <p>It gives us great pleasure to announce to the great Hungarian population that there has been formed a permanent Hungarian theatre association.</p>
   <p>There have been many Hungarians in Chicago who have insisted that the Hungarian people of Chicago could well afford to support such an institution, and now it has been formed.</p>
   <p>Jeno (Eugene) Endrey who up to the present time has been connected with the Dani Papanek Theatre Association will become the director of this newly formed organization, and it gives us great pleasure to announce that a permanent agreement has been made between this organization and Joseph Viz who is the director of the Hungarian Theatrical Association.</p>
   <p>This newly formed organization will work in the field of operettas, comedies <span class="page-break">\2</span>and dramas.</p>
   <p>Margaret Padly and Adrienne Tomori, who are two of the foremost Hungarian prima donnas, are included in the staff of capable artists of the stage.</p>
