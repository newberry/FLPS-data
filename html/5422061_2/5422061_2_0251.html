   <p>The one hundred and fifty Hungarians who were present at the banquet of the Endre Ady Circle on June 9, at the Cameo Room of the Morrison Hotel, spent an unforgettable evening. Never before in the life of the Chicago Hungarians was there such a gathering, where so many different types of Hungarians--conservatives, liberals, and radicals--were together in complete harmony. The spirit of the great Endre Ady was instrumental in making these people of opposing ideas tolerate each other's society for an evening.</p>
   <p>The program of the evening, after an opening address by Mrs. Michael Bokor, included songs by the Workers' Chorus; a piano solo by Alice Landgraf, a little thirteen-year-old Hungarian girl, who played one of Dohnanyi's compositions; the recitation of two of Ady's poems, by Mrs. Erno Klopstein; two poems of Ady's set to music by Bela Reinitz, sung by Miss Yolanda Simiz; classical selections by the Kovacs Trio, violin, <span class="page-break">2</span>cello, and piano; and two songs of John Kurucz, by Adrienne Tomory, accompanied at the piano by Mrs. Kovacs.</p>
