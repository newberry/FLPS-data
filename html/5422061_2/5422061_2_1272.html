   <p>The question, "Shall the societies unite?", originated when the Indiana Sick Benefit and Burial Association and the Hungarian Federation of Sick Benefit Societies of America held a joint meeting to decide whether or not they should consolidate.</p>
   <p>Today we have high hopes of seeing these two Hungarian organizations consolidated, because it would be for the benefit of both organizations.</p>
   <p>The diminished strength of these organizations does not spell success for either one if they remain alone; but if the consolidation takes place, it will mean a very successful future.</p>
   <p>It is true that there are great differences in the constitutions of both <span class="page-break">2</span>organizations. In one organization premiums are regulated according to age, and in the other, there is a fixed rate.</p>
   <p>Which of these methods is better? Past experience has taught us all about this situation.</p>
   <p>When there were quite a few deaths in the organization which had fixed rates, the members were taxed according to the number of deaths. Sometimes this burden became too great and the members could not stand it and had to drop out. This would naturally work a hardship on the organization as well as the family of the deceased. The organization would sometimes have to borrow money in order to pay some family that had depended on the payment of benefits from the organization.</p>
   <p>This same thing happened when sick benefits were to be paid.</p>
   <p>These conditions naturally worked hardships on the organization, when this situation could have been regulated in order to ease the burden on both parties concerned.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>As the larger societies realized their mistakes they gradually modified their constitutions so that they were charging rates according to the rates of the members.</p>
   <p>It is true that in a lot of cases those rates were set unfairly as far as the members were concerned; naturally this was a drawback, but as time went on this condition was adjusted, until today preactically all larger societies are using this system of rates; even those who were sworn enemies of this plan must admit that a rate set according to age, is the only way in which the life of the societies can be assured.</p>
   <p>As far as sick benefits are concerned, they should be regulated and looked after strictly, in order to avoid cheating, because this will happen, as shameful as it mey be.</p>
   <p>These are the conditions which make it absolutely essential that rates be set according to the age of the persons belonging to these organizations that are going to consolidate.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>In Chicago are the vicinity there are enough Bungarians to support such an organization.</p>
   <p>It is probably true that he cannot count on new members from the standpoint of immigration, not for the time being at may rate. Without paying any attention to this situation, we know that there remains a broad field in which to work, when we consider the development of Hungarian Societies.</p>
   <p>There are thousands of Hungarians in and around Chicago who do not belong to any society whatsoever.</p>
   <p>All these people, with nard work, could probably be brought together to join some sort of society or lodge, if we can prove to them the high standards of these organizations.</p>
   <p>Then there is another duty that must be taken care of: the organization of a youth branch.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The Hungarian youth must be made to understand that it is their duty to carry on the traditions of their fathers, and that they too must belong to the organizations to which their fathers, belong.</p>
   <p>They must aid those institutions which were organized by their fathers for the sole purpose of ensuring some means of support for the Hungarian child who is left an orphan, so that the child will not become a depencent upon public charity.</p>
   <p>These questions are those to which there is only one decent answer:</p>
   <p>Organization! And then after organization, draw up such constitutions as will meet the requirements of the modern world, and will also meet the requirements of the goal for which the organization has been established.</p>
   <p>We want all Hungarians in Chicago and the vicinity to co-operate in making this organization a reality.</p>
