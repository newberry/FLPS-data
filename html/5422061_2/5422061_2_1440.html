   <p>In the last year it has happened more than once that some of our deceased fellow Hungarians, be it because they did not belong to any benevolent or protective society, or be it that they had no close relatives, or none who were in better condition, than they themselves, were unable to secure burial places.</p>
   <p>So upon their good friends was laid the heavy task of providing for a modest burial ground by pitching in together the necessary amount.</p>
   <p>This thought and the fact that four years ago some really active Hungarians prevailed upon the management of the Elmwood Cemetery Company to reserve in its ideally located Elmwood Memorial Park a section of one thousand four-person lots for a Hungarian cemetery brought up again the question of the cemetery. Those persons were guided by the thought that if the Czechs, the Germans, and the Scandinavians have their own national cemeteries, why could the Hungarians <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>not have one of their own? They sold nearly 125 lots to the Hungarians. There are many who have already paid in full the price of the lots. A small percentage, on account of the depression, have not yet been able to liquidate their obligations, but the Company is willing to wait for the payments. The management, in order to learn whether the Hungarians really do care to have their deceased ones rest in a Hungarian cemetery and to have their graves perpetually cared for, called a meeting of some interested persons for March 8, so that in accordance with the information received from them it might decide what further steps should be taken. The representatives of the various creeds expressed their belief that the Hungarians would be proud to have an independent cemetery. They think that it would be a good proposition to send to persons interested some literature concerning the necessity for the reorganization of the cemetery and concerning its aims and possible advantages before calling a general meeting.</p>
   <p>Those present received the idea of the organization with enthusiasm. If the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>cemetery succeeds, it will be possible for forgotten Hungarians to be buried without public donations; according to the proposals of the reorganized Hungarian Cemetery Association they would be accorded a free burial place by the Elmwood Cemetery Company, where their long suffering bodies could find eternal rest.</p>
