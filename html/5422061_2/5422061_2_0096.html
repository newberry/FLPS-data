   <p>John Kurucz, Chicago Hungarian composer and pianist, gave a concert at Kimball Hall last Sunday.</p>
   <p>It is interesting to know that many of Kurucz's compositions have been translated into English by Glenn Frank, dean of the University of Wisconsin; Miss. Amy Folk, Douglas Malloch, Gordon St. Clair, and Miss. Eunice Titjens.</p>
   <p>Two distinguished sopranos interpreted Kurucy's songs: Mrs. Mary Duffield, dramatic soprano, and Rose Napau, lyric soprano. Also contributing to the program were Frederic Jencks, baritone, and Carlos Hatvary, tenor.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Tribune's critic wrote: "The compositions of Mr. Kurnez are melodic. The folk-songs of his native country had a pleasing effect on the audience."</p>
