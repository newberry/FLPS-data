   <p>The Hungarian Day preparation committee held its account meeting last week, and its treasurer, John Bonifert, gave out a statement, that the total income of the Hungarian Day was $677.80, derived from the ads and the selling of the button-signs, against which there was a total of $517.80 expense. The difference was distributed among the arranging associations, so the Southside Federation of Hungarian Churches and Societies received $50, and the Societies of the Northside got the remaining sum. All the expenses were of the usual, routine type,but one item cries out loudly, that of $50 to Grant Park. When Mayor Kelly invited the Hungarians to celebrate the Chicago Charter Jubilee, by arranging a Hungarian Day, he offered the use of Grant Park free of charge, but when everything was arranged, the Park demanded an insurance fee of $31.25 for the chairs, and $50 for the permit, to distribute the program books free.</p>
