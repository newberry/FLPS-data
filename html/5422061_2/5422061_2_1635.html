   <p>With the cooperation of the Emigration Commission, the Foreign Language Governmental Information Service, Hungarian Branch, has recently made a report on emigration. It states that at least 1,300,000 foreign residents of this country are planning to emigrate. The peace pact which was signed by Germany a few days ago apparently has increased the desire for emigration. It appears to us that many people will emigrate immediately. We also assume that out of the 1,300,000 foreigners, many will realize that back in their homeland there exist many disturbing and uncertain conditions, while the situation in the United States is certain and peaceful and one is assured of some comforts. They will realize that to leave this country now would be foolish and unprofitable.</p>
   
   <p>The skies of Europe are still filled with dark and hazardous clouds. Those who return to their homeland will be terribly disappointed. The foreign population of this country is beginning to realize this fact.</p>
   <p>In the last few days, thousands of these immigrants have decided to remain in this country, even those who not long ago expressed a desire to go back to their homeland.</p>
   <p>At the same time the Emigration Commission's reports show that the 1,300,000 people who plan to leave this country would take with them 4,000,000,000 dollars.</p>
   <p>That means that approximately 3000 dollars a person would be taken to foreign countries. This wealth is sufficient proof that the Hungarian workingman has made a very good living in this country, especially in the last few years. During the war, wages were high, but they have remained the same to this day. In many localities, movements are being started to establish laws governing minimum wages for workers.</p>
   <p>The industries which were engaged in the manufacture of war equipment have been reorganized and the success of these industries is already having a favorable effect on this country. The United States receives the largest share of the benefit of this industrial reorganization, because this country is so far ahead of Europe in industrial development. Furthermore our wealth of natural resources will compete with any nation. The ruined European nations will be forced to buy their building materials and industrial equipment from this country. This will bring about increased employment opportunities in this country. Therefore, with these facts generally known the people of this country will be happier, their work will be easier, and opportunities for earning a good living will be assured. The unemployment situation in this country is already decreasing, due to the above-mentioned facts, as reported by the State Employment Agency.</p>
   <p>It is natural, therefore, that those people who only yesterday voiced their desire to emigrate to their homeland have changed their minds. They debate whether it is a wise thing to leave a land of certainty and go to a land of uncertainty where their small fortunes consisting only of money, would soon be spent and thereby increase their misery. At the present time emigration should be discouraged.</p>
