   <p>We had no idea that our assertion relative to the size, circulation, and influence of the Magyar Tribune would once become a topic of debate in newspapers. [Translator's note: The above-mentioned assertion, which appears in each issue, is (in English) as follows: "We assert that the Magyar Tribune is the greatest Hungarian Newspaper published in the City of Chicago and has the greatest number of paid subscribers. We challenge anybody to prove otherwise."]</p>
   <p>We believed that if the Chicago Tribune has a right to assert that it is the world's greatest newspaper and that it is the best advertising medium in the Middle West, we too can say that we have a greater number of subscribers in Chicago than any other Hungarian newspaper, and that it pays to advertise in our paper, because for nearly sixteen years we have served our advertisers satisfactorily.....</p>
   
   <p>This is modern advertising! The self-advertising of modern enterprises is an American specialty, but it is approved all over the world if the aim of the advertising is not cheating.</p>
   <p>We tried to draw the attention of the public to these facts on the advice of advertising specialists. We did not mean to antagonize or provoke our new neighbor, our contemporary, Az Iras (The Writing), or its editor in chief, Victor Drozdy.</p>
   <p>Naturally, we were not aware that the assertion of our strength, influence, advertising and subscription superiority would touch a weak spot in the otherwise hardy editor.</p>
   <p>We did not advertise our superiority because we wished to offend someone, but to strengthen ourselves.</p>
   <p>Our paid subscriptions have increased by a greater number this past year than at any other time in the last decade. We had hopes that the number of our advertisers would increase at the same rate. Therefore, we started an advertising campaign.</p>
   <p>Our sensitive neighbor, Az Iras, took this as a personal affront and labeled it as unfair competition.</p>
   <p>They began to talk in pounds--their pounds. They declared the number of pounds they distribute each week.</p>
   <p>But where did they get the precise information about how many pounds we send out?</p>
   <p>We are talking about paying subscribers, not pounds. Pounds of paper are easy to print and ship, because only paper and postage are necessary, but getting paid subscriptions is the painstaking work of years for a Hungarian newspaper. That is the reason we are so proud of our army of readers.</p>
   
   <p>We wished to be considerate and tried to avert further controversy between colleagues by a witty announcement. However, our short-tempered, sensitive colleague is not satisfied.....</p>
   <p>All right! We will leave it to our readers to judge whether the contention of the Az Iras about the number of pounds or the statement of the Postmaster of Chicago is correct.</p>
   <p>We asked the Postmaster and his answer follows:</p>
   <p>"Publisher,Magyar Tribune,</p>
   <p>2207 Clybourn Avenue.</p>
   <p>"My Dear Sir: Receipt is acknowledged of your letter of October 14th, inferring that the statement appearing recently in Az Iras to the effect that an issue of your publication does not exceed 200 pounds in weight may have been made through information given by this office, and in reply you are advised that this is contrary to the fact, as careful inquiry was made of the personnel of this office, who all disclaimed any knowledge of the matter.</p>
   <p>"Information contained in the records of this office pertaining to any publication is regarded as inviolate and may not be divulged to any person.</p>
   <p>Arthur Lueder, Postmaster."</p>
   <p>We believe that we have finished with the pounds.....</p>
   <p>Drozdy said that Az Iras is the most popular Hungarian newspaper.....If it makes him feel better, we are willing to acknowledge this.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we, the Magyar Tribune, have the greatest circulation, not in weight, but in actual readers. It is the sixteenth year that we are the best Hungarian advertising medium in Chicago.....</p>
   <p>The Magyar Tribune Publishing Company.</p>
