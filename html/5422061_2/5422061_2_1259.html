   <p>p.2....The women's division of the Revision League at its meeting of officers on Aug. 26, decided to call a women's meeting for Sept. 5th.</p>
   <p>We ask Chicago's Hungarian women to come to this meeting, because important things have to be done. Let us show the men how to work in the interests of our poor motherland.</p>
   <p>All Hungarian women will be there. If there is a spark of patriotism, a drop of Hungarian blood in you, you will be there. Remember the Hungarian women of history, who died for their country! We just have to give a little of our time to attend this meeting, and we can do something for our country.</p>
   <p>Do not forget the time: Sept. 5, the place: Room 1108, 29 E. Madison Street.</p>
   <p>Mrs. William Fuzy, President.</p>
