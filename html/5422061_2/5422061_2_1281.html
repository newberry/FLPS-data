   <p>Last Sunday afternoon, February 2, the Thalia Literary and Song Society held its regular quarterly meeting. Practically all members were present. After the officers and different committees made their reports, many important topics were discussed. As a result of the discussions, the standard of the society was raised because the society decided to develop the literary talent of the organization. In this connection classes in literature and arts will be of great benefit to the society. It was also announced that the small group attending these classes is making progress due to their whole-hearted cooperation.</p>
   <p>A resolution was made that all the Hungarian Sick Benefit associations be asked to send members to this association in order that a large male choir might be formed. The opinion was also expressed that by maintaining this choir the various organizations may keep in touch with each other to avoid interference in any programs which may be given by the several societies.</p>
