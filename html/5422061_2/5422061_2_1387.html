   <p>In our last week's issue of the Magyar Tribune we published a proclamation--as did thirty other Hungarian newspapers--calling all Hungarians to a National Conference to be held on March 15, 16, and 17 in Buffalo, N. Y.</p>
   <p>It must have been a surprise that we--who had always advocated liberalism--signed our names, together with conservative newspapers, to a proclamation in which Hungarian societies, churches, leaders, and workers are asked to get together for a conference.</p>
   <p>Please do not condemn us for this, as this does not mean that we have altered our policy. We merely undertook, as others did, to do our duty.</p>
   <p>We believe that the Buffalo Conference is so important to our work program that all the Hungarian-spirited newspapers should take part in it, regardless <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of differences, social or political.</p>
   <p>....Let us get together, all of us transplanted sons of Hungary, that we may begin again where we left off.</p>
   <p>Let us do something for our own Hungarian-American people, for America, and for our suffering brethren in Hungary.</p>
   <p>Perfect organization--from New York to San Francisco--would be just a dream nearly as hard of realization as Utopia itself.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us content ourselves with cold reality.</p>
   <p>In life's struggles it is often that we have to make concessions. Let us, then, make these concessions and, without giving up our ideals and beliefs, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>get together in the interests of a noble cause.</p>
   <p>What the significance of this National Conference will be, has to be explained to our people by church and society leaders at their meetings. Members of our editorial staff are willing to do this if called upon.</p>
   <p>We believe that our position is clearly indicated in the proclamation.</p>
   <p>In our church and society circles there are enough idealistic-minded wealthy men willing to attend the Conference at their own expense, thus increasing the number of Chicago delegates to ten or fifteen.</p>
   <p>Besides, if necessary, the societies should pay the expenses of delegates out of their treasuries.</p>
   <p>The important consideration is that the men and women chosen to represent <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Chicago and vicinity be intelligent enough to take an active part in the work of the National Conference.</p>
   <p>We are requesting all clear-thinking and intelligent Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity to give the best of their thoughts to this invitation, assisting us, at their meetings and gatherings, to make this National Conference--on March 15, 16, and 17--a historical event of the American-Hungarians. Let this National Conference bring about unity and co-operation, at least in vital matters of public interest.</p>
   <p>If all of us pull together, the results will be beneficial to all Hungarians and their descendants.</p>
