   <p>p.5...The National Museum, Budapest, sent the works of sixty-seven Hungarian painters to America to be exhibited in the larger cities of the United States. They arrived in Chicago last week. They will be exhibited in a big room of the Webster Hotel, 2150 Lincoln Park West, and the public may see them, free of charge, every day until Dec. 1st.</p>
   <p>Ladislas Medgyessy, Royal Consul opened the exhibition in the presence of representatives of all Chicago newspapers; the Hungarian journalists, the art knowers of the American public - among them Mrs. F. G. Logan, the well-known art maecenas, who did not keep secret, the fact, that she considers this exhibition more interesting, artful, and honest, than the one the American artists, just opened in the Art Institute.</p>
   <p>Among the exhibited pictures one can see the works of John Aldor, Laszlo', Eugen Czaps', Bela Ivanyi- Grunwald, Joseph Beregi, Desider Szlavik, <span class="page-break">\2</span>Francis Gaal, Mozart Rottman, Rudolph Negeli, Anthony Pecely, Louis Gimes, Aladar Padly, etc. The Chicago Tribune reproduced in one of this week's issue the picture by John L. Aldor, the "Girl with Guitar," but there are many, who think the best picture is "Bridge of Lights" by Rudolph Negeli. The miniature pictures by Steve Giszinger are worthy of the attention they receive. They were painted by the artist while looking through a magnifying glass.</p>
   <p>It is a real pleasure to look at these pictures, the creation of the best painters of Hungary. We might add, that those, who are able, should purchase some of them, as the manager of the exhibition is authorized by the artists to sell any at a moderate price.</p>
