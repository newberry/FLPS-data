   <p>We are sincerely glad that Franz Lehar's operetta, the "Gypsy Love," which was presented in the Chicago Bush Temple, (German theatre) was a success. The prima donna, Lucie Westen, has selected the same play for her premiere Saturday evening. We hope the house will be filled with Magyars, at the premiere of the talented actress, who has gained fame by participating in the best Hungarian plays.</p>
   <p>The various roles will be distributed as follows: Zorica, Lucie Westen; Joesy, gypsy orchestra leader, Angelo Lipich; Michael, Restaurant keeper, John Joby; Ilona, landlord's young daughter, Anna Berneck; Jonnel, young Rumanian nobleman, Willy Schubert; and Dragotin, Rumanian nobleman, Curt Beniceth.</p>
   <p>The director is John Joby, former member of Opera Company of Budapest, Hungary. His capable direction assures an excellent performance.</p>
