   <p>p.2. Traveling on the wings of time, each year takes its toll of our lives. The road we have marked out for our life's journey is inevitably changing. This happened to us, who left our homeland for a new country. Most of us came with the intention of going "home" after a few years in America. But the years have changed our plans and today, when we sing our national anthem "you must live and die here," - no matter how much we love our mother country "here" means America.</p>
   <p>We, wandering Hungarians, became Americans. Lest we perish in the onrush of time, we must unite so that we may be strong in our new environment. Today we rarely find one who refuses to join a church or organization, because he expects to go back to Hungary.</p>
   <p>We appeal to the Hungarian-Americans to join and support the Hungarian institutions of their faith.</p>
   
   <p>The Hungarian Zion Classis has churches in Chicago and vicinity. We invite all Reformed and Evangelical Hungarians to join the church, most conveniently located and accessible to them.</p>
   <p>Rev. Eugene Boros, president of Classis.</p>
