   <p>The savings department of the American Bankers' Association, has sent out the following letter:</p>
   <p>"The terrible pictures which certain Bolshevik agitators are painting for the foreign population of the United States are starting to have some effect. It is believed that 1,300,000 foreigners will soon seek residence in nations where Communism is flourishing."</p>
   <p>"The people who will emigrate will take their savings with them."</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The bankers have estimated that the average emigrant will take from fifteen to twenty thousand dollars with him.</p>
   <p>It is estimated that four billion dollars will go out of the United States.</p>
   <p>There are two important connecting facts: the people who emigrate from this country at the present time are not socially or politically fitted for citizenship in the United States; their voluntary departure will be a very good thing for this country. Those foreigners who are more bold in their Communistic activities will be deported by this country, and other individuals will be put in jail.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The money which they withdraw from banks, to take out of the country cannot be confiscated, without causing more serious trouble. The bankers want to stop this emigration, but this is to be deplored; just because they want to keep the money in this country, they must also seek to keep these "undesirable foreigners" here.</p>
   <p>This movement of emigration is angering people in the financial circles of this country. We can see that certain individuals would be glad to get rid of these immigrants, if they did not take their money with them. These people saved this money the hard way, and they are entitled to every penny they have <span class="page-break">4</span>saved. The four billion dollars which they will take out of this country is very negligible, compared to their contribution to the wealth of this country. And yet the financiers want them to leave their last drop of blood here.</p>
   <p>We do not think that the emigration will be as great as we are lead to believe. The immigrants know much more than the bankers think. These immigrants will not take a chance with their life savings. Especially those immigrants whose homelands are under the Communistic form of government.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Regardless of how the situation turns out, it remains a fact that the emigrants will not oblige the bankers by leaving their lifes' savings in this country.</p>
