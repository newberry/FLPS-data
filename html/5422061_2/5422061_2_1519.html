   <p>There is much happiness in the Chicago Hungarian Reformed church. It has every reason to be happy at this time, for the work which it started some time ago has been completed after a long struggle. Now it can look back and rejoice over the fact that every unsurmountable obstacle has been removed. The Chicago West Side Hungarian Reformed church is free of debt. The church and parsonage have had a mortgage of $3,700. This debt has been wiped out completely, and the church has high hopes of becoming one of the most progressive Hungarian Reformed congregations in America.</p>
   <p>Much credit is given to its beloved pastor Rev. Rudolph H. Pompl, who, besides serving this congregation, also serves the congregation in South Chicago. A large part of this success is due to the tireless work of Charles Szabo, president of the Donation Subscribers committee. He worked continuously in order to accomplish his aim. The entire staff of officers worked hard and deserve much credit also. The list of contributors will appear in this paper <span class="page-break">\2</span>soon.</p>
   <p>May God bless those who worked for and donated to this worthy cause.</p>
