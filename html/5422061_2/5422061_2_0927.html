   <p>With the Christmas season here, which is the holiday of love, we ask all our American-Hungarian brethren to think kindly of our orphanage at Ligonier. We are caring for forty Hungarian orphans and fifteen helpless old people.</p>
   <p>This year has been a very hard one. Unemployment and the depression have made our monthly income $1,480 less per month than in previous years.</p>
   
   <p>In admitting orphans and the aged to our Home, their religion has never been questioned. Therefore, we feel that we may ask the aid of all our Hungarian fellow men and organizations in behalf of the Hungarian orphans and the aged. Every little bit helps and our institution needs that help.</p>
   <p>We ask God's blessings upon our patrons, to whom we wish a Merry Christmas.</p>
   <p>Rev. Dr. Louis Narassy,</p>
   <p>Sup't. of the Hungarian Orphanage.</p>
