   <p>p.1. Father Poratunszky, pastor of the Burnside Greek Catholic Church was the victim of a brutal attack on the night of December 27.</p>
   <p>The temporary pastorage at 70 E. 92nd Street has already been robbed three times. The third time, the robbers were caught and their trial was set for December 28.</p>
   <p>We are ashamed to write that the robbers were two Hungarian boys and one Polish boy. In their three burglaries, they took over $300.</p>
   <p>Father Poratunszky was willing to drop prosecution against the burglars, giving the Hungarian boys an opportunity to go straight in the event that they return what they took. He was not able to do this, because of the murderous assault on his person.</p>
   <p>Sunday, December 27, after a hard day, the astor went to his home to retire.</p>

   <p>He soon fell asleep, but was awakened by a blow on his head. The bedroom, as well as the whole house was in darkness, and at first the pastor did not know what was taking place. Soon he realized his danger and began to struggle when he noticed that there were three against him. The cowardly attackers did not count on the pastor defending himself, and in the fight stabbed him. They inflicted nine slashes on the pastor, who was fighting for his life. The victim managed to reach the basement door and ran out into the street. The robbers shot at him, but missed and the bullet was embedded in the wall.</p>
   <p>The pastor was running on the street in his pajamas when Rosenberg, an Hungarian young man, saw him and took him into his home to notify the police by phone. Father Poratunszky collapsed from excessive bleeding and was taken to the Burnside Hospital.</p>
   <p>The police questioned the the burglars in custody and through them located the attackers. They are John Toth, twenty 10,538 Torrence Avenue, Michael <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Kolazsnyaa, twenty-one, 10,667 Mackinaw Avenue and Angelo Fattore, 10,547 Hoxie Avenue. Fattore tried to escape and the police shot him through the shoulder.</p>
   <p>At the hearing, the culprits said that friends tipped them off to the fact that Father Poratunszky always has large sums of money at his home and they wanted to get it.</p>
   <p>The doctors thought at first that the pastor's skull was fractured, but such is not the case and we will see him soon.</p>
