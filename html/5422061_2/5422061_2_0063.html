   <p>In spite of the immigration quota, the Hungarian colony of Chicago, thank God, is growing.</p>
   <p>Our colony has become richer by the addition of Elizabeth R. Mathe, graduate pharmacist, who, having settled in Chicago, bought the North Park Pharmacy.</p>
   <p>The newly stocked pharmacy; its new owner, who has had wide experience as a pharmacist; its shelves of imported and domestic medicines, perfumes, and cosmetics, will please all who visit the store.</p>
