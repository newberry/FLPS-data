   <p>Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity have been eagerly looking forward to the concert by Itza Kiszely ever since she came back from a two years study in Rome.</p>
   <p>Hundreds of people came to the De Paul Auditorium last Saturday night to hear her. When she appeared, the audience greeted her with a great ovation. Her personality and charm held the audience spell-bound. She sang compositions of Verdi, Mascagni, and Richard Strauss. Laszlo Gamouf, the pianist, accompanied her. Gamouf also played the following numbers with great success: Mozart's Phantasy, and Dohnanyi's Rhapsody.</p>
