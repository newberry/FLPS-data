   <p>p.16...........At the Hungarian Roman Catholic Parish on Washtenaw Avenue, the troubles of the last weeks are smoothed out at last. The bishop transfered to this parish, the Rev. Jim Kasztovzsky, who was the priest at Woodbridge, N. J. With this nomination it is hoped, the Hungarians of Chicago-Northside will have a nice Catholic parish.</p>
   <p>The new parson studied in Kalocsa and Insbruck and have lived almost ten years among the Hungarian-Americans. In order to improve his health, he went in 1933 back to Hungary and now he will begin his work with new zest and circumspection at his new parish.</p>
