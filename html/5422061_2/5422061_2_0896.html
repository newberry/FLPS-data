   <p>The 164th branch of the Verhovay Benefit Society will celebrate its tenth anniversary on October 3. The entertainment committee announces that this tenth anniversary celebration is not going to be just an ordinary celebration, but that they have planned to surprise the Chicago-Hungarians with many novel forms of entertainment. They have decided, and are now working strenuously to produce a three act play, the name of which is "Thury Borcsa." The cast of this play will include many well-known artists of the Hungarian stage. It is only natural that after the play Hungarian dancing will take place. The music will be furnished by one of the best Hungarian orchestras in Chicago. Arrangements have been made to have the best Hungarian food served.</p>
   <p>The committee takes this opportunity to invite all Hungarians in Chicago and vicinity to come and celebrate this great day in the life of this organization.</p>
