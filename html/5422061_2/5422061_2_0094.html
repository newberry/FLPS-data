   <p>We are always glad to record the successes of our Hungarian brethren, and especially well pleased when we can give news of a Hungarian accomplishment bringing fame to our race in the fields of science and art.</p>
   <p>We are now again able to give news of one exceptionally important event. Carlo Hatvary, well-known and well-loved opera singer in American and Hungarian circles, who has already won fame and esteem for the Hungarians through his art, has now received a contract from the Chicago Cosmopolitan Opera Company, where he will show his magnificent ability and art in singing leading roles.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Cosmopolitan Opera Company will give its first performance on March 5 at the Ashland Auditorium, at which occasion Hatvary will sing in two plays, "Bajazon", and "Cavalleria Rusticana."</p>
