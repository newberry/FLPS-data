   <p>Laszlo Medgyjesy, Hungarian consul, made the keynote speech. He said that women have an important role to perform in public life, and in order to effect the revision of this disgraceful treaty, the cooperation of all Hungarian women is needed. The question of the revision cannot be pushed aside especially since Lord Rothermere is our exponent.</p>
   <p>The consul concluded his talk with the famous saying of Madoch: "Struggle man, and hope."</p>
