   <p>Some day when that unknown historian writes the history of Hungarian-Americans, and comes to his chapters relating to the cultural activities of these people, we are sure that Paul Berak will be the one who will be in first place for his part in cultural activities.</p>
   <p>Twenty-three years ago, before Paul Berak came to Chicago, the Hungarian life here traveled a very narrow path. The defunct Hungarian Federation and the Hungarian Sick Benefit and Social Society were the only ones who kept Hungarian cultural activities alive in Chicago.</p>
   <p>After the arrival of Paul Berak, and the renaissance of the Independent Society, a new cultural life began which put Hungarian cultural activities on a new front.</p>
   <p>The evenings of entertainment and education lured many of the young Hungarians, and these people promptly came under the influence of Paul Berak.</p>

   <p>Berak is a leader in the field of Hungarian literature and is a prominent Hungarian playwright. Twenty years ago when he took those young people in hand he wrote a play called "The Judge's Daughter." This play was presented by young amateur Hungarian actors with such great success that even the American papers gave it favorable criticism.</p>
   <p>Those people who saw this performance will never forget how masterfully it was handled.</p>
   <p>He wrote and directed play after play with great success, for which he should be very proud. But the Chicago Hungarians should be proud also, because it isn't every national group which possesses so great a playwright as this man.</p>
   <p>Many of his plays were translated into English and the critics of the theater praised them highly.</p>

   <p>Paul Berak for many years was a pillar in the Chicago Hungarian Independent Song Society.</p>
   <p>He has opened a business of his own, and at the present time his business activities take up all of his time. He still writes editorials for Hungarian newpapers once in a while, which are gratefully received by the culture-loving Hungarians.</p>
   <p>He is a believer in democracy and is still hoping that some day Hungary will become a little America.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Paul Berak is still living. He has in his possession many interesting facts concerning the history of the early Hungarian immigrants. He also has in his possession a Chicago Hungarian news publication (complete file) which has been defunct for many years.]</p>
