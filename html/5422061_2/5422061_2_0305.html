   <p>The Count Michael Karolyi, Lodge #343, of the Woodmen of the World, held a dance and stage performance, in the Pythian Temple Hall, Sunday, January 30.</p>
   <p>The affair began at 3 P. M. with dancing, and was followed with the well-known play "Bad Boy of the Village," by Edward Toth, with amateur players under the direction of the stage-director, whose ability, and skill, instructed the players, and arranged the play.</p>
   <p>The committee and lodge officers merit thanks, for the success of the evening too. Mr. Louis Hornyak, the dance-manager, and Mr. Andre Farkas, Jr., and his twelve-piece orchestra, whose excellent music gave perhaps the greatest pleas are of the evening to the guests.</p>
   <p>During a brief intermission, the president, dance-manager, and the manager of the Magyar Tribune, made short address to the audience, (in Magyar and English), appealing to them not to forget the suffering and sick children in the old country. It was a very touching appeal, and contribution amounted altogether $11.30.</p>
   <p>On January 31, the amount of money was forwarded to the European Childrens Aid Society. Anyone who wished to, may see the receipt in the office of the newspaper.</p>
   <p>We extend our heartfelt thanks to all contributors, in behalf of the children whose suffering you have lessened by this noble humanitarian deed.</p>
   <p>Draiss.</p>
