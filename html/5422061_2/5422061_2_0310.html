   <p>The Chicago-Hungarian Socialist Labor party presented a very beautiful stage play to the Chicago-Hungarians on April 13,</p>
   <p>The name of this play was "The Old Shoemaker and His Son, The Hussar." The play was directed by Joseph B. Mayer, and is worthy of great praise as the direction of this play was superb. The director is not the only one that deserves great praise, the players were absolutely marvelous. They were all amateurs, but acted like veterans.</p>
   <p>At this time, we cannot mention the names of the players due to the fact that our informant could not get this information for us.</p>
   <p>The success of this affair is unquestionable, both financially and culturally.</p>
