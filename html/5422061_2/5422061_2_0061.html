   <p>We are always happy to bring news of successes achieved by our countrymen in America. We are glad to announce that Samuel Goodman has just patented a new window frame. A prominent architect stated that this is the most successful improvement in thirty years in this field. The new frame not only can be raised and lowered, but it also opens in and out. It is a boon to window washers.</p>
