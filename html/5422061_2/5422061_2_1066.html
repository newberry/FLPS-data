   <p>The Chicago Independent Song Society is working hard in order to promote a masquerade ball. This ball will take place on February 28, at the Schoenhofen Hall, Milwaukee and Ashland Avenues. The entertainment committee is sparing no efforts in making this affair a success. In this particular instance, it is very important that this event be a success, due to the fact that fifty per cent of the proceeds are to be turned over for food and clothing for starving Hungarian children. With this idea in mind, each member is desirous of giving his unselfish support to the affair.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that every loyal Hungarian be present at this ball. Besides having a good time at this affair, it is a worthy contribution. There will be prizes awarded to those wearing the most representative costumes, and dance contests will be conducted also.</p>
