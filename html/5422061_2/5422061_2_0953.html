   <p>p.2...The Virgin Mary Society at its meeting of March 3, found it advisable to change the name of its community home to Chesterfield Liberty Hall. To the Hungarians it will always be the Magyar Home and there has been no change made in the recording office. The new official name has been adopted so that American Clubs may be induced to hold their social affairs there.</p>
