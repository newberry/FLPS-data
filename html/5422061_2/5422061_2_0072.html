   <p>We present: John Kurucz, who is the author of over four hundred Hungarian songs. Can anybody write anything better, more effective or more lasting praise about anyone, than just that?</p>
   <p>For, it was he who wrote the most effective, the most lasting things about himself, when he created those four hundred Hungarian songs.</p>
   <p>Four hundred Hungarian songs! All of which are enclosed in the hearts and souls of hundreds of thousands Hungarians. Can a stone or metal statue compete with that?</p>
   <p>John Kurucz is a favorite of the Muse, from whose hearts the laughing and crying Hungarian songs simply blossom out. His songs will be sung by the future generations as fresh as newborn, as the Hungarian generation sings them today.</p>
   <p>We greet John Kurucz with our love on the pages of the Hungarian Radio News.</p>
