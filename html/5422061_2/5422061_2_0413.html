   <p>A few weeks ago there was a great celebration in Grant Park, where more than sixty thousand Germans had gathered to celebrate German Day. In a short while, Grant Park will witness another national-group celebration, and this time it will be the Czechs, who will celebrate their Czechoslovak Day. Other national groups, too, are planning their celebrations, but the Hungarians--we sorrowfully admit--do nothing along this line.....</p>
   <p>In the first place, the local American newspapers devote much space to these affairs, publishing pictures of groups in national costumes or engaged in sports, thereby directing the attention and sympathy of the American people toward other nations.</p>
   
   <p>Secondly, it would be advantageous, from a nationalist point of view, to see our country-men gathered in large numbers and in a position to discuss their problems with one another. Such activities would give rise to new hopes in our mother country, bleeding from countless wounds, which would see her sons together in one great camp and with one aim--to save the Magyars, here and over there.</p>
   <p>No other national group has a greater need for a day of demonstration than we Hungarians! No other innocent nation was smitten so severely by the World War as Hungary. Her best territories were severed, a large part of her population was thrown under foreign yoke, and the part that remained Hungarian has unfortunately a government that oppresses the peasant and working classes and denies them the privileges that other civilized nations grant to their citizens, such as the secret ballot and the opportunity for the children of a religious group (the Jews) to obtain higher education.</p>
   <p>Therefore, if we could get together and have a Magyar Day, we could do much for our mother country. We could raise our voices against the injustice of the foreign powers and at the same time demand a change in the present Hungarian government.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, if we could get the Hungarians together, we could establish a Magyar Home, where we could spend our spare time, have a library, hold our meetings, etc.....</p>
   <p>We have to admit with shame that we Hungarians do not have a public institution like other national groups, although some of them number less than we.....</p>
   <p>Who is to blame for all this? We must admit one thing, that the curse is upon us, the curse that prevents us from sticking firmly together. We have a good number of churches and societies, but they do not co-operate with one another.....</p>
   
   <p>The Chicago Hungarians resemble the dying father who gave his sons a bundle of sticks to break. The sons tried to break them, but found it impossible. The old man then untied the bundle and broke each single piece with his feeble hands. He meant to illustrate that in union there is strength.</p>
   <p>Magyars! Brethren! Societies! Churches! How long will you wait? The twelfth hour has come for the Chicago Hungarians. The bells of distress are tolling! Get together and do something for the common cause.....Plan a Magyar Day celebration where all the Hungarians, old and young, may get together.....</p>
   <p>Let the mistakes of the past teach us a lesson, and let us look bravely to the future, and our hopes will be rewarded and the truth of the old saying, "Hungary was not, but will be," will become a reality.</p>
