   <p>We are continuing what we started to write about the revisionist movement last week.....</p>
   <p>It is only natural that there is much controversy around such a public American-Hungarian problem.....</p>
   <p>....We will understand why the movement for the revision of the treaty of Trianon is so beset with difficulties. All abstract, idealistic endeavors of the American-Hungarians are so.</p>
   <p>We have already said that the leaders of the American-Hungarian revisionist movement are tackling a huge problem by trying to bring about, with their own special methods, the revision of the treaty of Trianon.....</p>
   <p>There are some people who would turn somersaults for a medal, especially the great patriots of the Amerikai Magyar Nepszava, who once tried to bolster this paper's declining business with a movement to erect a statue to Kossuth and now with activities in this revisionist movement.....</p>
   <p>The following expose appeared in the Ember (The Man), a political weekly:</p>
   <p>"The Amerikai Magyar Nepszava (The American Hungarian People's Voice) made an agreement with the Budapest Revisionist League in June, 1928, that in return for revisionist propaganda, the newspaper will receive seven hundred and fifty dollars per month from the treasury of the League. This amount--nine thousand dollars annually--has been paid promptly since July 1, 1928. The agreement which stipulates that the Amerikai Magyar Nepszava must exert every effort in behalf of the revision of the peace treaty of Trianon, is for a term of ten years. It is a well-known fact that the Hungarian government is behind the League, so the money that the Amerikai Magyar Nepszava pockets each month for the revisionist propaganda really is the money of the taxpaying citizens of Hungary.....</p>
   <p>"We not only contend that the foregoing statement is true, but we can prove it. We call upon the Amerikai Magyar Nepszava to give us an opportunity to prove it. Let the Nepszava sue us for libel, so that we can prove what we say under oath, with witnesses and other conclusive evidence."</p>
   <p>Our opinion is:</p>
   <p>It is not a crime to accept money from the Hungarian government for certain services, especially if the postal authorities know about it.</p>
   <p>Business is business! If the Hungarian government or any political faction needs this propaganda, let them pay just as other advertisers do. That is their business.</p>
   <p>However, we do protest, together with other unselfish newspapers, churches, and societies, against the impudence of a paid newspaper, which preaches to us of ethics, virtue, and patriotic duty, and is the self-appointed public leader and dictator.</p>
   <p>The newspaper that sold itself should accept its proper place and name, because there is a name and place for such in this mixed social world!</p>
   <p>Anyone who uses the erection of a monument to Kossuth or the revisionist movement for personal profit, commercializes the ideals and earnest desires of the American-Hungarians, and has to be dealt with as such and exposed as such to the public.</p>
   <p>We detest such racketeers and toll collectors!</p>
