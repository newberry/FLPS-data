   <p>p.2.............Rose Gyorke has been roller skating continuously for fifty-two days with fifteen minute rest periods hourly, in an effort to win the $25.00 - prize and the glory that goes with it.</p>
   <p>"I have to win the race" said Rose Gyorke to our reporter, "because I am determined to get the necessary sum for a college education. I don't wish for glory or to be a movie star, but I want to study to be a doctor. If I can reach this goal, I will be the happiest girl in the world."</p>
   <p>Our reporter sits at the 131st Infantry Armory on Michigan Blvd. to cheer Rose and we hope many of our readers will go to the Armory to do the same thing.</p>
