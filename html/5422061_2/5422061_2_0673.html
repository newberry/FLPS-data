   <p>Sunday, January 13, the Hungarian congregation of the Olivet Institute held an interesting cultural debate. The topic of the evening was the current one that is being discussed in the Senate--the Kellogg Peace Pact. Two members of the Olivet Young People's Circle took sides in the debate. Istvan Mate urged that the many sided Kellogg Peace Pact be ratified by the United States. The Kellogg Peace Pact denounces war as unlawful in settling international disputes. As a result the proposal of Coolidge to build fifteen cruisers would be unnecessary. Mate's opponent, Istvan Sarossy, was against the ratification of the Kellogg Peace Pact. Instead, he argued in favor of the building of fifteen new cruisers.</p>
   <p>The winner of the heated debate, in which the public also took sides, was Sarossy, upon the judgment of a committee of three. The winner received a book as reward.</p>
   <p>The highlight of the evening was a talk by the Reverend Geza Lorinczy, Unitarian pastor, who pointed out the weak spots of the Kellogg Peace Pact.....</p>
