   <p>The last strophe of the Ode is as follows:</p>
   <p>There he is standing now beyond the sea,</p>
   <p>And the great one will never turn to dust:</p>
   <p>Of metal and marble his statue will be.</p>
   <p>His voice, even today, like that of Memnon,</p>
   <p>Is sounding through worlds, peoples, and ages,</p>
   <p>"My country being poor, I came to seek treasure</p>
   <p>In this blessed land, and my spirit found it.</p>
   <p>When you have found it as I did, my people,</p>
   <p>Return with the treasure--liberty--to your own country."</p>

   <p>Col. Philip Fizyelmessy, who on account of his debility, could not come to the dedication, sent a very interesting letter, in which he tells that he conveyed the request of Seward, Secretary of the Foreign Affairs, to Kossuth, at the outbreak of the Civil War, asking Kossuth to intervene in preventing the interference of England by winning the English Liberals, which request, in less than three weeks, was carried through by Louis Kossuth.</p>
   <p>After the applause, which followed the reading of the letter, H. A. Garfield, son of the martyred President, was asked to speak. He spoke with such fervor, sentiment, and enthusiasm that the eyes of the Magyars filled up with tears.</p>
   <p>Colonel Charles Semsey, the most agile among the exiles, came from New York to the festival and spoke with warmth, in a voice, which filled the whole hall, saying: "Blessed be the Hungarian Fatherland and blessed be those who came here to pay their respect to this great man, who was my leader. The erection of the Kossuth statue reflects honor on America and on Hungary. I hope that it will make a closer friendship between the two nations."</p>

   <p>The solemn session was closed after an effective speech by Rev. Nicholas L. Kovachy.</p>
   <p>In the evening, a banquet was given in the Hungarian Hall. The toastmaster was William H. Schwartz, attorney. The first speaker, Rev. Alexander Kalassay, at whose suggestion a cablegram was sent to Francis Kossuth, read as follows:</p>
   <p>"The American citizens of Hungarian descent, who gathered here from every part of the country to celebrate the unveiling of the Kossuth statue, are sending their greetings to the son of Kossuth, and hope that the ideas of his father will be realized shortly."</p>
   <p>Everybody present at the banquet was in an ardent, enthusiastic mood. The faces of the Hungarians were flushed with happiness and pride, because this was the first instance when the American-Magyars proved that they could create a great permanent memorial if they would cooperate.</p>

   <p>Dedication of the Kossuth Statue at Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
   <p>From every tongue tingled the joy of the next day's solemn holiday.</p>
   <p>The speakers were: Marc Braun, president of the New York Hungarian Republican Club; Joseph Szebenyey, newspaperman from Budapest; Joseph Zseni (Dsance), Judge Solders, Dr. Penry Barach, Colonel Semsey, Adolph D. Weiner, attorney from Chicago, Theodore Kundtz, Louis Black and Coloman Kenost from Toledo, Ohio. Julius Uhrik representing the Hungarian Self-educational Circle, gave a floral bouquet to Joseph Joseph Jsene. The Committee presented a silver beaker to Louis Percel, who deserved the greatest credit for his work done toward the erection of the Kossuth Statue.</p>
   <p>Fery Miklosh's gypsy orchestra played the "Kossuth Song" and to the strains of this song, the dinner guests departed to be present tomorrow at the unveiling, as the "Kossuth Song" says: "we have to go all."</p>

   <p>The Statue Stands</p>
   <p>September 2, 1902, this day will be never forgotten by the American-Magyars.</p>
   <p>This day became a historical date, not only was a permanent memorial erected of American-Magyar historical interest, but the history of United States and Hungary was enriched by a new radiant chapter. The history of Hungary was enriched because a statue was erected in the United States to the greatest Magyar, Louis Kossuth:</p>
   <p>The history of the United States was enriched because a monument was erected on the American soil to this same Louis Kossuth, whom the United States had honored with a reception, such a reception as was never accorded a foreigner whose fiery speeches about the equal rights of humanity, paved the way for the emancipation of the Negroes and produced a great effect upon strengthening of the spirit of the American Constitution.</p>
