   <p>p.1..............The Secretary of Justice through the Federal Bureau of Investigation published the comparative statistics of the arrested individuals. The publications show, in what proportion the native Americans are represented and relatively for many of the foreign-born American residents committeed crimes in the first six months of the year. As in the previous years, so also this report shows that the foreign born populace committed relatively fewer crimes, than the native white citizens.</p>
   <p>During the first half of 1936 the Federal Bureau of Investigation studied the police records of close to 220,000 arrested persons. These records were sent to the above bureau from the police authorities of all parts of the country. These records were compared with the other datas and fingerprints, which are kept at the central bureau, after which they are classified and divided into statistical groups. These again were tabulated, to find out, in what proportion the different groups participated in crime. Taking 100,000 residents as a base, the crime list shows the following proportions in committing crime: burglary: foreign born (percentuel) 3.6, native <span class="page-break">2</span>whites 16; larceny: foreign born 1.5, native whites 3.8; fraud: foreign born 3.6, native whites 7.6; sexual crimes: foreign born 2.6, native whites 2.9; against the narcotic laws: foreign born 4, native whites 1.6; disturbance of peace: foreign born 4.6, native whites 8.1; vagrancy: foreign born 6.3, native whites 17.4; but on the other hand against the laws of beverages the foreign born sinned 4.7, the native whites only 3.7.</p>
   <p>The same way the proportion is somewhat higher in the cases of the receivers of stolen goods, where the foreign born were represented by 2% against the native whites 1.5%. Assault and battery 10.1 of the foreign born, while the native whites had 8.5. All in all,the proportion is this (taking always 100,000 as base): the rate of the foreign born is 99.3, while that of the native born is more than twice that, that is 211.9</p>
