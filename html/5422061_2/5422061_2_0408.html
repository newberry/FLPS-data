   <p>p.2.. The social event of the Chicago Hungarians this year will be an elaborate concert and dance, at the Sherman Hotel, Feb. 11. The high light of the evening will be Vilma Banky's entrance with her husband, Rod La Rocque, and twelve men in formal attire. She will sit on a throne on a raised platform so that everyone will have an opportunity to see the most beautiful woman in the world.</p>
   <p>Vilma Banky, who still speaks Hungarian more fluently than English, is appearing on the stage of the Erlanger Theatre in "Cherries Are Ripe."</p>
   <p>The huge concert program is built around John Kurucz, the brilliant Hungarian pianist of Chicago. We will also hear Carlos Hatvary, Irma Ferenczy, Jolanda Corna, Itza Csorba, Aladar Harmathy and Mrs. Eugene Kuhn.</p>
   
   <p>The Beauty Contest will be a big attraction also. The winners portrait will be painted by Miklos Gaspar.</p>
   <p>Music for the evening will be furnished by a gypsy band.</p>
