   <p>The past week was really a Hungarian week in Chicago. Without speaking of the few American theaters in Chicago where real Hungarian plays are being shown, we will only talk about those typically Hungarian activities which took place during the past week.</p>
   <p>The first activity we must mention is the performance of the Beregi Theatrical Society. A better and more beautiful performance of theatrical art has never been [given] before the Chicago Hungarian public. But we can't overlook one individual, the choirmaster of this company, Janos Kurucz. This man is today the outstanding composer of Hungarian music. He is the pet of Hungary and will only be in the United States for a short time. Janos Kurucz actually awakened out emotions and our love for our native land of Hungary, so great was his musical performance. The audience was entertained during the intermission by three child artists who sang and played instrumental music. That these children were taught by Hungarian music teachers and that their parents were good Hungarians could be easily recognized by their performance.</p>

   <p>The second interesting Hungarian incident took place in the studios of radio station W.O.R.D., located in the Webster Hotel. Here our own Chicago Hungarians were the important factors, and this event took place last Saturday evening. The program was given by members of the Chicago Hungarian Theatrical Society. The outstanding performer of the evening was Addrienne Tomory, who thrilled the Hungarian and American audience with her splendid voice. As a result of this performance, the American critics praised her voice highly and her extraordinary feminine personality.</p>
   <p>Another great performer of the evening was Margaret Padly, who held her audience spellbound with her thrilling voice, and exacting American critics referred to her as the Hungarian nightingale in their articles in the daily newspapers.</p>
   <p>Another of the outstanding performers of the evening was Guly-Gara who has played his violin in practically every large city in the world, thereby bringing great glory to the Hungarian name. During his performance he played the Rakoczy March. He played this so well that the radio audience responded with fifty letters of <span class="page-break">\3</span>congratulation written in Hungarian and more than fifteen hundred written in English.</p>
   <p>This extraordinarily successful radio concert was arranged and conducted by Bela Csilag, who is an orchestra leader in there large hotels in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The third great event of the week was the truly picturesque Hungarian grape festival. There were two such festivals this week in Chicago.</p>
   <p>One of these festivals was sponsored by the Hungarian Social and sick Benefit Society at the North Side Turner Hall, there thirty-six couples danced the real Hungarian folk dances, provoking in the audience the true Hungarian spirit. This same audience was thrilled by the beautiful Hungarian costumes worn by the dancers.</p>
   <p>The other grape festival was held at Prudential Hall and was sponsored by the Workers Sick Benefit Society. Here the ladies and girls gave a performance of Hungarian folk dancing.</p>
   <p>It seems like a crowded week for the Hungarian people, but all these events were <span class="page-break">\4</span>well attended and they were financially successful.</p>
   <p>As we were going to press we were informed that next week, on Saturday, station W.O.R.D. will present two outstanding Hungarian stage artists on their program, Joseph Viz, and Irma Ferency, two splendid Hungarian singers.</p>
