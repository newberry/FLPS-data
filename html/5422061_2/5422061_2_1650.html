   <p>The United States is considered by the world as the melting pot of nations; but since the country declared war, immigration has practically stopped, making raw material rather limited for this gigantic melting pot. For instance, during the last twelve months only 400,000 immigrants have arrived which is only one third the number this country received during the fiscal year ended in June 1914. We must also consider the fact that the year previous to the war the immigration was at its height,with the exception of 1907, when one million and two hundred eighty five thousand immigrants entered this country. The war naturally caused the immigration to drop sharply and immigration authorities tell us that there will be a further drop.</p>
   <p>The population of the United States is decreasing not only because immigration is dropping, but also because emigration is increasing. The larger part of the emigrants is made up of those men who are going back to fight for the country from which they came. The number of emigrants practically matches <span class="page-break">2</span>that of the immigrants. This is about the only year in the history of the country that the population of the United States has not increased due to immigration.</p>
   <p>The melting pot is practically empty, and is not working as it would under ordinary conditions; but the work that it has done so far is good and of great importance. Today the United States means more to every foreign born resident than it has at any previous time; this includes the immigrants from the central powers of Europe. The war has brought the foreign born resident closer to the United States; the fusion in the melting pot has become more complete than ever before. The United States is not only a place where the immigrants are able to make a comfortable living; it is not merely a temporary abode, but a real home to them. The people living in the United States are United regardless of creed or nationality, and this condition is created by the war.</p>
