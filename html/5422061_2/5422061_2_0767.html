   <p>Inasmuch as it has come to the attention of the officers of the Association of Old Hungarian-Americans that certain persons are collecting donations in the name of the Association of Old Hungarian-Americans, we wish to inform the public that no collections are authorized by us at the present time. If any one still has a letter of introduction obtained in the past and tries to collect on the strength of it, he is to be turned over to the police.</p>
   <p>When the reorganization of the Association of Old Hungarian-Americans is completed, we will notify the Hungarians through the usual publications those properly authorized to make collections of donations.</p>
   <p>Joseph Lautner, Pres.</p>
   <p>Gregory Goray, Sec'y-treas.</p>
