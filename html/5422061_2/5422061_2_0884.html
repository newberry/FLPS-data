   <p>On Wednesday evening, Nov. 24, the Hungarian Rakoczi Benevolent Society of Chicago held an Autumnal Dance, to which a large crowd attended. The dance was held in the huge Schoenhofen Hall, which was filled at a very early hour. Peter Kardos' first-class orchestra played, and his music was so lively that in no time every one in the hall was dancing.</p>
   <p>To doubt that the dance was a success would be foolish. It is known that any entertainment arranged by the Rakoczi Society is always a success. Of course, the success of their attractions is due to the cordial reception they always get.</p>
   <p>A detailed report of the dance, with a list of the members who arranged it, will be published as soon as we get the information from the entertainment committee of Rakoczi, which, we, hope, will be soon. Until then we will limit ourselves to informing our readers that the dance was a success.</p>
