   <p>p.2.....Foreigners who are obliged to have free medical aid, dare not go into a hospital, because they are afraid that by this act they will become public charges and will be deported. The foreigners know that those immigrants, who have tuberculosis or are mentally deficient, can be deported anytime within five years of their arrival in the United States. Those foreigners who have to be taken care of by relief institutions and who are not capable of self-support can also be deported within five years.</p>
   <p>All the relief agencies, hospitals,and insane asylumns in the United States have been notified to report all charity cases to the Labor Department. Many foreigners reported in this way are ordered to be deported. Those persons who entered this country illegally, but were allowed to stay because of insufficient proof, can also be deported. To the class of foreigners, who are not allowed to enter the United States, belong the following: idiots, mental defectives, epileptics, tuberculars, contagious diseased, beggars, prostitutes, anarchists, contract workers.</p>

   <p>During the season of 1924-1925 a total of 6,409 persons were deported for the above mentioned reasons.</p>
   <p>Not in every instance, when an alien avails himself of free hospital treatment, does it mean that he will be deported. If the person received injuries during his residence in the United States and can't pay for treatment, he cannot be deported, because it can be proved that he wasn't afflicted upon his arrival.</p>
   <p>If someone is taken ill with tuberculosis, heart ailment, or mental trouble, and he can prove that he was well when he arrived, he can't be deported, but it is so hard to prove that it is advisable not to take advantage of free medical aid, until the first five years are up.</p>
