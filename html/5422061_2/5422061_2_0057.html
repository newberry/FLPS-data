   <p>The stockholders of the Chicago Hungarian Theater had a meeting on March 12. At this meeting, the director of the theater, Eugene Endrey, reported on the financial standing of the corporation. He told the meeting that the shareholders would receive checks by mail for seven per cent interest due and a dividend of ten per cent.</p>
   <p>It is now the end of April, and the stockholders have not received either the interest or the dividend.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, we read in the Perth Amboy Hirado that subscribers to stock in New Jersey have not received either shares or receipts for the money which they paid to Endrey. The Fuggetlenseg writes:</p>
   <p>"We do not know how Endrey's stock-selling is conducted elsewhere, but if it is like his share-vending here, we warn Hungarians to beware. We have had to swallow many bitter pills already. What will Endrey, director of the Chicago Hungarian Theater, make us swallow next?"</p>
   <p>We hereby ask Louis Terebesi, the president of the corporation, to use his influence to get a clear picture of the situation and to submit it for publication, so that our readers may be enlightened.</p>
