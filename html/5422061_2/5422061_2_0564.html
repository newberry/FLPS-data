   <p>p.1...................When a new sprig of the printed Hungarian word starts on its way, it involuntarily discloses, that there is Hungarian life in America. If this life is not very active outwardly, it is nevertheless to be appreciated, worthy of notice.</p>
   <p>Our aim is to follow with interest this inner life to serve our readers with objective descriptions of the American, foreign and our native country's events. We do not make loud promises, do not write impressive slogans on our flag, we have nothing in our pockets, but the honest endeavour and the desire to serve the Hungarians.</p>
