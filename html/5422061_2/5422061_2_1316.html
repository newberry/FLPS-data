   <p>There is no Hungarian who does not revere the memory of Petofi and his part in the fight for the liberation of the Hungarian people. March 15th is a significant Hungarian national holiday because the dawn of liberation was seen on March 15, 1848. March the 15th and Sandor Petofi go together because this great poet inspired the people to fight for their liberty.</p>
   <p>On March 15, 1925, the Chicago Hungarians were given the chance to witness the portrayal of the life of this great Hungarian. The play "Petofi", illustrating the life and deeds of this great Hungarian patriot, was directed by Joseph Viz, and sponsored by the Chicago Hungarian Theatrical Society. The play, "Petofi", was a huge success, and was well attended.</p>
