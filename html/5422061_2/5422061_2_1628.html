   <p>The Hungarians are leaving the United States daily in large numbers. They are not paying attention to the propaganda that is being spread by foreign consuls, nor are they minding the high cost of traveling. The people who are leaving this country do not seem especially pleased that they are able to emigrate. There is a rather disgusted, yet determined look on their faces. To us these people remind us of a part of a Hungarian patriotic song by Vorosmarty, which is in part: "In the great world outside, there is no place for you. You may be blessed or you may be cursed by the hand of fate, but you will have to live and die here." Who would have believed that there was so much truth in Vorosmarty's words. This truth is clearly demonstrated by the fact that so many Hungarians are now leaving this country.</p>
   <p>During the time of peace, efforts were made to win these people to the farmlands <span class="page-break">2</span>of this country, but it was without success. The Hungarian worker accepted employment under the most hazardous conditions. He was not afraid of work or even of death, but he did not want to bind himself exclusively to farming here. There were a few Hungarians who purchased farms in Canada and in the United States, but now that they have a chance to return to the homeland, the majority of them are selling their farms and going back to Hungary. These loyal Hungarians are doing this with the best motives in mind to protect their country for which their forefathers shed precious blood.</p>
   <p>There were some political factions who wished to divide Hungary, but what right have they to say what shall be done. It is the working people whom the Hungarians have protected, provided with a better living and more comfortable homes. We Hungarian-Americans are good examples.</p>
   <p>We have been immigrating to this country for the past twenty-five years and <span class="page-break">3</span>have helped to build it. What is our reward? This, my dear friends, has been our reward: We Hungarians have never asked for Hungarian schools to be built, nor have we asked for any favors, but we are still being considered as belonging to the lower class of people. Whose idea it is or where did it originate that we should be like the hunted animals of the wilds. For the past six years our people have experienced nothing but hard struggles in order that their work would be recognized, but instead of being recognized and respected they are literally being kicked around. This is the reason the Hungarians are leaving America. They are leaving by the thousands now, but soon they will leave by the hundred thousands.</p>
   <p>If we were told that happiness exists only in fairy tales in the land to which we are going, we would not believe it. What are they going back there for now? They want to see what has happened to their native country since the Powers have been so ambitious to gain supremacy. It is a well-known fact that Hungary was the last nation who agreed to enter the War in Europe. Yet the <span class="page-break">4</span>Hungarians must suffer most. Everybody wants to kick and cut this nation to pieces. In spite of all this the Hungarians are emigrating from this country because they are still true to their homeland and cannot believe that it has been taken away from them. Those who are going back have no definite plans. They do not know whether they are returning to their homeland to live or to die. Their only reason for leaving is that they know something unfair has happened to Hungary and there is trouble there.</p>
   <p>In order to become familiar with the thoughts and motives responsible for this emigration, we have talked with some of the emigrants. We advised them not to make the trip because of the great suffering endured there. We received a very simple answer. They said that if those who are there are suffering, they would go and help them suffer. They said they were needed there. Some had left their parents, wives, husbands, and children. It was inspiring to hear some men among them who talked more openly and bravely. They say they are going over there to fight in order to win back their homeland. We will <span class="page-break">5</span>have to leave these Hungarians to do as they wish because we cannot hold them back. We agree with these emigrants whose determination for justice is shown when they say they will not be persecuted any longer nor robbed of their savings in the bold manner in which it is done in this country through misinterpretation of the laws.</p>
   <p>It is not our fault that Hungarians in this country are so degraded. Our efforts to Americanize them are completely wasted. A new paper can appear every day with articles advising these people to learn the English language, or other articles may appear concerning Americanization. They are sure to ignore them. They are determined to return to Hungary because they feel that their homeland is in danger and needs their help. It is true that such mass emigration will be of a disadvantage to America. Certain states having large Hungarian colonies have already felt the effects of the emigration. There are many thousands of Hungarian coal miners and steel workers in this <span class="page-break">6</span>country. They constitute the industrial life of America. Soon its industrial centers will be closed. Foreign born people are emigrating in great numbers, thereby imperiling the industrial life of the nation. To those Hungarians who have turned their backs on America, business means very little to them. While they were residents here they were degraded and discriminated against, which accounts largely for their desire to leave. Life or death, they do not care. They are going back because they feel they are needed most in Hungary. While in America, they were not given much protection nor liked very well. If there had been some capable leaders among the Hungarians, emigration among them would not have been so great. Efforts to educate the Hungarians would have made them understand that this country affords a good living for them and their families. The natural resources of this country are unlimited, and if the Hungarians had some efficient and influential representatives in their group their influence would be felt and the United States would help them in their efforts to stop the destruction of Hungary. Then it would not be necessary for the Hungarians <span class="page-break">7</span>of America to believe that the only way to regain the old Hungary is through bloodshed.</p>
   <p>The American-Hungarian leaders have used every available method to teach their people, but there is nothing left to do but to let these degraded Hungarians return to the country from whence they came. We will permit them to regain their beloved country for which they have worked and labored so long and hard.</p>
