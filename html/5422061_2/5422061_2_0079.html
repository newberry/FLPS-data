   <p>p.6....The young violin-artist, Bela Martay is deservedly the pride of the Hungarians of Chicago. He gave his first successful concert at the beginning of December in the Kimball Hall, of which not only the presumably prejudiced Hungarians, but the professional critics, spoke very highly. It is on a very general request, that the hopeful young artist has arranged to give another violin-concert at the Kimball Hall on the 29th of January. We are glad to call the attention of our readers to this really beautiful concert-program.</p>
