   <p>Our church does not wish to abandon our youth, so that they will grow up like weeds in the mad whirl of American life. Every parent knows that if proper attention is not paid to children in their formative years, they will become degenerate. To aid the parents in their efforts to save their children from the dangers that beset them in this life, the pastor and his wife offer their co-operation. The Christian Endeavor Society was formed for this purpose. The Society will meet every Sunday afternoon at five o'clock. The Society's officers are Elizabeth Toth, president; Charles Antal, vice-president; John Nemeth, recording secretary; Jolan Peters, secretary; Andrew Udvari, treasurer; Gertrude Gorombei and Elizabeth Mate, music committee; Helen Balogh, Barbara Peters, and Anna Popernyik, program committee; Margaret Imre and Elizabeth Bozsvai, bulletin committee; Maria Parajos, Elizabeth Rezes, Michael Horavecz, Bela Demeter, entertainment committee; Eugene Boros, Jr., organist and choirmaster.</p>
