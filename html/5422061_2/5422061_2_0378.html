   <p>We have just received from the Federation of Hungarian Associations of Greater Chicago a circular which appeared in the out-of-town [Hungarian] dailies last week. This circular has come a bit too late to be published in full in our weekly. It is our opinion that in local matters the local weeklies are at least as important as the out-of-town dailies, and that news of local events should reach them at the same time they reach the latter.</p>
   <p>If the leaders [of the Federation] cannot see the importance of this, let them bear the consequences. They have no one but themselves to blame. For the information of our readers, we wish to mention that the World's Fair Hungarian Day will be held on Saturday, August 26, at the court of the Hall of Science.</p>
