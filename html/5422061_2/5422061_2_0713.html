   <p>On March 14, the Y. M. C. A., Chicago Central branch, held a swimming contest, which was very interesting. The contest was won by Mr. Bela Szoke, president of the Immigrant State Bank, and younger brother to Imre Szoke. He is also a champion swimmer, who has recently arrived in the United States from our homeland. Bela Szoke has won countless contests in Europe. These were international contests.</p>
   <p>How the result of the contest is being taken by the American swimmers is shown by the following quotation taken from a Chicago newspaper:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>"The race produced a new "Star," in the person of Bela Szoke, whose exceptional ability as a fast swimmer was established by the fact that he broke all prevailing records in the city, suburbs, and State. He swam forty yards in twenty seconds."</p>
   <p>This is only the start of Bela Szoke's swimming career in America. We can be sure, that we will hear more of him and his feats as he brings glory to the Hungarians in Chicago and America.</p>
