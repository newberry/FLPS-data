   <p>Greater disappointment cannot happen to the parlor scientist than when upon leaving the four walls of his room he enters the ordinary everyday life and views the practicality of scientific theories.</p>
   <p>Greater disappointment cannot happen to the author of editorials of Hungarian newspapers than when he mingles with the general Hungarian public and listens to the critical opinions, the judgment of the ordinary Hungarian reader.</p>
   <p>The ordinary reader is not familiar with elementary things, yet the author of the editorials credits him with the intelligence of a university graduate. This is the beginning of misunderstandings.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>We have here, for instance, a practical example.</p>
   <p>For more than a decade we have emphasized in our articles that this newspaper has positive convictions. We call it liberalism.</p>
   <p>At times we call it the radical mouthpiece of sane, progressive workers.</p>
   <p>With these assertions we believe that we have sincerely designated the political and social course that we follow and advocate.</p>
   <p>And what do we see? Most people, even intelligent readers, believe that the word liberalism is a beautiful phrase or even less. Much trouble and misunderstanding are created by this attitude.</p>
   <p>A favorite saying of good automobile drivers is that they are not afraid of anything more than a bad driver in another car. That is the cause of danger always.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Our position is identical. Most critics who have not a clear conception of basic principles, who have only a limited education, criticize theories and trends.</p>
   <p>With those who know what liberalism means in practical politics, we have no quarrel because they know how elastic it is and how far one can lean without changing the basic principle.</p>
   <p>But there are marked lines of demarcation in liberal, social, and political courses, too.</p>
   <p>Those who only imagine that they know on what tree liberalism grows, are as dangerous to us as the inexperienced driver is to pedestrians or to the other driver. Sooner or later a senseless crash is inevitable.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>We wish to reiterate for the benefit of the uninitiated one or two general truths about what the creed of the liberal newspaper is and what liberalism means.....[It means] merciless war against feudalism, land ownership limited by birthright, reaction, and unprogressiveness. Because of this we are such stubborn and unshakable opponents of the Bethlen-Horthy methods of government.</p>
   <p>The conservative individual progresses only when he must, only under coercion. The liberal individual progresses whenever he can or is able to progress. This is why we are progressive and support every new viewpoint and objective that is for the benefit of the majority.</p>
   <p>Liberalism intends to free the will, the thoughts of the individual. There-fore, it advocates free speech, free press, and the right of free assembly.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>This is the reason we demanded that Count Karolyi be granted permission to enter the United States, even though we do not always agree with his political creed. On the other hand, we would demand the same right of free speech for Bethlen, were he to come to America. This is liberalism!</p>
   <p>Clean liberalism supports all honest efforts until it clashes with another honest effort. Leveling these clashes with fair methods and concessions will forestall revolutionary conflicts. Therefore, liberalism is against force, against militarism. It insures the progress of individual and social forces and free competition. In other words, it does not artificially hinder anyone from attaining the highest level, economically or politically.</p>
   <p>This is why we are fighting against the numerous clausus, which prohibits artificially the pursuit of study and scientific development in Hungary....</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Summarizing the foregoing, the newspaper which chooses the liberal course as its creed insures freedom for its readers, because it strives to obtain freedom for all individuals.</p>
   <p>Those who know all this about liberalism will understand that we have not deviated from our course when we gave space on one page of our newspaper to the announcement of the Amosz (Amerikai Magyar Szovetseg--American Hungarian National League), while on the other page we are trying to assist in the preparation of Count Michael Karolyi's lecture and meeting in Chicago.....</p>
   <p>There is one thing only which shows the true course of a newspaper--the editorials. That is where the principles of a newspaper are expounded. The intelligent and thinking reader can draw his conclusions from the editorials.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>We have written the foregoing because recently we have listened attentively to the comments of our critics on the policy of our newspaper and were greatly surprised that our belief that the general reader is familiar with the meaning of liberalism and democracy was incorrect.</p>
   <p>Our simple words are not simple enough for everyone to understand us. There is room here for education. We say again that the best and wisest thing that can be done by those interested in the affairs of Hungarians would be to establish reading and lecture courses for the education of our adults. For example, the following topics could be used in an educational campaign: how to conduct a meeting; the rudiments of social science; methods of debate; health problems, and historical facts.</p>
   <p>Most of the nobler projects of the American Hungarians fall into a rut and stay there because our well-meaning, simple Hungarians do not understand the intellectual leaders. On the other hand, there are always a few unscrupulous <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>leaders who find pleasure and think they are doing their duty when they see to it that these projects are never rescued from the rut, but are buried forever.</p>
