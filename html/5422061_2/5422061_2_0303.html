   <p>p.3...Chicago's theater-going Hungarians looked forward hopefully to last Sunday's and Monday's performances of the "Tragedy of Man". Frank Pap's daring venture yielded a moral success for him and the amateur performers, but we were sorry to see that our Hungarian public doesn't show enough enthusiasm toward the efforts of our artists. We are sorry that Frank Pap was disappointed, but we hope that he will have better success in other cities.</p>
