   <p>Chicago will have an extraordinarily rare theatrical event on March 4th, when the Germania Broadcast, under the direction of William Klein, will present Franz Lehar's operetta "Gypsy Love."</p>
   <p>It is natural that in this Hungarian operetta, our prima donna, Irma Ferenczi, should get the leading role.</p>
   <p>To make the atmosphere of this occasion still more Hungarian, the directors have made arrangements to have the best gypsy orchestra in Chicago play.</p>
