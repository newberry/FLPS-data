As an idea, this was good and the discussions in that direction started all right, but then stopped abruptly. It would be nice, if the long sought for Hungarian unity and understanding would be reached even if just by the sportsmen. Hungarian Sportsmen! throw out these noxious politics when we are dealing with the sports, and let us show the other nationalities what we can do. It is more than certain that with a hearty co-operation between us Hungarians, we could do at least as much as any of the other nations.</p>
