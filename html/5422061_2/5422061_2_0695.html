   <p>p.3.............We respectfully beg those Hungarian parents, whose children over twelve years of age do not belong to some sports club, that they shall send them every Saturday to the Wicker Park Gymnasium. Beginning at 3:00 P.M. they will be taught basketball and soccer football by competent and attentive instructors. Our aim is to bring together the Hungarian youth. During the summer there will be swimming, water-polo, tennis, baseball and excursions.</p>
   <p>The indoor instruction will be given in the Wicker's Park Gym every Saturday from 3:00 to 6:00 P.M. until March 14.</p>
