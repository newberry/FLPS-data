   <p>Sunday, April 13, will be an eventful day for Chicago Hungarians, for Sandor Magyar will be here, the pilot of the airship "Justice for Hungary," which recently made a trans-Atlantic flight for the sole purpose of calling the attention of the world to the injustice done to Hungary by the treaty of Trianon. Sandor Magyar will be escorted by Mgr. Elmer Eordogh, papal prelate, and they will arrive at the Lansing airport of the Ford Motor Company. Plans for the reception are as follows: Those who have cars will drive directly to the airport. Those who have no cars will congregate at the Magyar Home, 817 East 92nd Street, to welcome the arriving guests. Those who have not as yet received their "Justice for Hungary" buttons and automobile placards can get them at the airport. The placards are to be pasted in the back windows of automobiles.</p>
   <p>The route of the procession from the airport to the Magyar Home will be <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Torrence Avenue to 95th Street, right on Highway 20 to 65th Street, west to Cottage Grove Avenue, south to the Magyar Home.</p>
