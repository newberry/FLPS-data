   <p>p.2...........................Dear Editor: - Last Friday, May 8, we had the pleasure of hearing an excellent violin concert given by our young, rising violinist, Bela Martay at Kimball Hall. Mr. Martays' program was very artistically selected and produced with much brilliancy and skill. He has been acclaimed by American critics and we hope that in the future the Hungarians will appreciate his talents and patronize him in much greater numbers.</p>
