   <p>p.2....Margaret Slachta and Gertrude Horvath, heads of the Social Worker Sisters of Hungary, arrived in Chicago this week to do social work among our countrymen. They have been assisted by Mrs. Anna Kornacker, who has given aid to many needy families in the past. The sisters will do the work of the Good Samaritan. They are the workers in our Hungarian Christian life, who manage shelters for the poor, visit the sick and help the needy. Margaret Slachta fought for the rights of the poor in the House of Representatives in Hungary. She has written a number of books about her experiences in Hungary and in America.</p>
