   <p>Self-educational clubs are a definitely important factor, from a cultural or nationalistic point of view, in the life of the American-Magyars. They have filled a definite need in the past and can do the same for the future, if they keep to the aims for which the organization was founded. They should give the same care to the development of social life and entertainments that is given to the awakening of the Magyar spirit, and the diffusing of Magyar culture in the field of literature and art. The Magyar in America has developed his own literature and art. It should be cherished and protected, lest it be trampled upon while still in the bud, in the bustle and ado of life in America. This is the responsibility of the American-Magyar self-educational clubs.</p>
