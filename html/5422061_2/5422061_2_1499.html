   <p>p.2...The Hungarian Protestants, who live on the west side are glad to announce that they have formed an independent church. They have elected as their pastor, Reverend Julius M. Hanko, who has already arrived from Columbus, Ohio, to take his new post in our church at 4327 West Carroll Avenue.</p>
   <p>Those protestants who find our church nearer than Burnside and South Chicago, are invited to attend services Sunday, Oct. 17, at 10 A.M., and every Sunday thereafter at the same time.</p>
