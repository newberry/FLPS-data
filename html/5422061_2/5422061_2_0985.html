   <p>The Hungarian-Americans can not go to any one at present to seek advice in regard to legal matters regarding their foreign interests due to the fact that the Austrian Hungarian Consul has been withdrawn.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the American Hungarian Association has taken upon itself the responsibility of offering advice to the Hungarians in America. All advice is free and you are not obligated in any way. Chicago Hungarians will write to the American Hungarian Association located at 317 Superior Blvd., Cleveland, Ohio, for any information or advice that requires immediate attention.</p>
