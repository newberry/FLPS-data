   <p>Two great guests will arrive in the midst of the Hungarian-Americans, in the near future. Dezso Baltazar, bishop of the Hungarian Reformed Church, who is coming from Debreczen, Hungary, will arrive in New York, on October 26. Countess Karolyi, who will come from her home in London, will arrive in New York October 17.</p>
   <p>Bishop Baltazar is coming for the purpose of raising funds for the benefit of the Seminary of Debreczen, just as he did two years ago. The Seminary is righting terrible financial conditions, and can't continue its regular work in the cultural field, due to great poverty.</p>
   <p>Countess Karolyi, as we are informed, is coming to this country for a three-month lecture tour, and will conduct lectures in English before different groups of American organizations.</p>
   
   <p>Bishop Baltazar's presence, and the purpose for which he is here, command a lot of attention. The Hungarian-American people are rather tired of donating funds for different purposes in Hungary. The reasons for this is, that most of the Hungarian-American people are continually pestered by friends and relatives asking for help in one form or another; another, is that the economic conditions have gotten so bad that many have asked for aid from their fellow Hungarians, here in Chicago, and other are just making both ends meet; so from these people, one cannot expect any help.</p>
   <p>Just as we stated above Bishop Baltazar, is sincere in his brave liberalism, and should be respected for his work in connection with his tireless efforts to see that the cultural work of the Seminary of Debreczen be continued, and therefore, is deserving of the support of the Hungarians both financially and spiritually.</p>
   <p>Countess Karolyi is the wife of the exiled president of the Hungarian peoples Republican party, and as such deserves the undivided attention and help of the Hungarian-Americans.</p>
   <p>Countess Karolyi as a Hungarian lady, who during her days of trial while being driven to exile because of her high ideals, fought for the rights of the Hungarian people, is now coming to this country, and really deserves your loyal support on her tours through the United States.</p>
   <p>We know that there are many supporters of her cause in the different Hungarian districts throughout the United States; this is only natural, and in these localities she will be received in great glory, and they will do every thing in their power to make her travels here successful, enjoyable, and remembered by every one concerned.</p>
   <p>Countess Karolyi should not be welcomed by those alone, who believe in her ideas and principles, but also by all those people who stop to realize that she is a wife, a mother, and a woman who has fought and struggled for her nation, and has set an example for many other Hungarian women to follow.</p>
   <p>This type of Hungarian lady should be respected by every person, and we Hungarians must grasp this opportunity to point with pride before the world, that we are hosts to such a grand woman.</p>
   <p>Countess Karolyi stood by her husband through glory and defeat. When Count Karolyi was exiled to the island Lacron, his wife and children gave up all the luxuries that might have been theirs for the asking through her father Baron Andrassy. She gave this up in order to be true to her husband, and even in exile, still remained true to her country.</p>
   <p>This is the kind of Hungarian woman that will be in our midst within the near future.</p>
   
   <p>Chicago will be one of the cities that will be included in the tour of both Bishop Baltazar, and Countess Karolyi. Chicago is the principal city of the Middle West, and is one of the largest metropolitan centers in the world.</p>
   <p>Every one that does any traveling at all, visits Chicago, therefore it is logical, that sooner or later these two distinguished visitors will arrive here.</p>
   <p>Therefore we are speaking to Hungarian leaders, and those who are interested, to start working and preparing, so that we will not have to wait until the last minute. The Hungarian people are well acquainted in the formation of welcoming committees.</p>
   <p>We do not want this to be a click affair, but a real holiday declared by Hungarians.</p>
   
   <p>If the Chicago Hungarians are not capable of building something large and permanent, they can at least display the type of energy that they possess on occasions such as this will be. They can show the loyalty that exists among Hungarians living in Chicago.</p>
