   <p>The Chicago Hungarian People's Theater opened its fourth season with "Nebantsvirag" [Touch-Me-Not-Flower], an operetta, at the North Side Turner Hall. The hall was packed to capacity.</p>
   <p>The play was not the best choice for the opening of the season because it didn't hold the attention of the audience. The roles were so inferior that the performers had to exert every effort to make them acceptable to the public.</p>
   <p>Carlo Hatvary, the well-known Hungarian tenor, played the leading male role and Margit Padly played the title role.</p>
   
   <p>The sensation of the evening was a dance duet by Yola and Paul, Hungarian dancing team.</p>
   <p>The orchestra, directed by Madame Renee Engel Lidge, performed with artistic precision.</p>
