   <p>Last Sunday the Olivet Institute was crowded with Hungarians. Ladislas Medgyessy, Royal Hungarian Consul in Chicago, delivered a lecture on the present political and economic situation of Hungary. In his lecture, the Consul described the position of the [Hungarian] government and admitted that, under the present circumstances, it cannot possibly stay much longer at the rudder. At this exceptional occasion, it was not financial aid--which at the present time it is useless to hope for, anyway--but only sympathy for which the Consul asked.</p>
   <p>The owners of Hungary--the counts and the bankers--even today can find no other healing balsam for their hearts, which are bleeding in their patriotism, than that of restoration of the old borders. According to the Treaty of Trianon, those territories which were robbed from Hungary cannot be stolen back by force, so the "poor" victims have no choice but to appeal to the righteousness of the people of the world.</p>
   <p>We have heard this kind of talk too often and would not write about it, were it <span class="page-break">\2</span>not for the other more interesting side of this meeting. At the end of the lecture, the chairman of the meeting: (who is also the head of the Olivet Institute and the owner of a Horthy Iron Cross)--asked the audience to submit any questions and take part in the discussion. There were many questions, mostly political and economical in character, but the Consul preferred not to answer them.</p>
   <p>During the discussions there were many who bravely pointed out the gallows system of Hungary's owners, who skin the peasants, oppress the workers, and violate the rights of the people.</p>
   <p>The public was glad to hear the discussions and heartily applauded them. At the end of the meeting, the chairman stated that he had learned many things about Hungary at this lecture, and also about the attitude of the Hungarians toward their government.</p>
   <p>It was evident that the Consul was somewhat upset when he left, as we live now in revolutionary times. We are now curious. What will happen to the Iron Cross?</p>
