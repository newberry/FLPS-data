   <p>The Chicago branch of the Hungarian Workers Sick Benefit Association sponsored an evening of entertainment on May 30. In connection with the above mentioned entertainment, a picnic was also held in the morning. Although the weather was very nice, only a small crowd attended the picnic. The affair was, financially, a success.</p>
   <p>As far as we know, everyone present had a very enjoyable time. There was good Hungarian music, to which the younger people danced many good Hungarian Csardas. (Csardas is the name of a Hungarian folk dance).</p>
