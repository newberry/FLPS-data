   <p>Last Wednesday, June 9, a new Hungarian organization was born. The name of this organization is the "Evolution Round Table Society." The members of this new Society are so loyal to the theories of evolution, that they have absolutely denounced the evolution laws of the State of Tennessee, and are recognizing the theories of Darwin and ignoring the theories and ideas of Bryan.</p>
   <p>This extraordinary and different Hungarian Society has decided to have its headquarters in the old Kozma Cafeteria. These headquarters are only temporary.</p>
   <p>At the present time the membership numbers more than a thousand.</p>
   <p>Doctor Balla was elected secretary. The secretary of this organization has the power to accept or reject members. The requirements of the organization are very rigid, so that it seems as though it is a very exclusive society.</p>
