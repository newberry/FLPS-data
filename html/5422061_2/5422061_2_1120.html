   <p>The efforts of police officials in Chicago have been useless in eradicating crime. The underworld is working without hindrance, reaping great harvests in the field of crime.</p>
   <p>That these underworld characters have protection is unquestionable because they murder and work in broad daylight.</p>
   <p>Rackets are abounding in Chicago. It seems that whatever business one wants to go into, there is some strong-armed racketeer connected with gangland ready to step in and demand a certain percentage of the profits.</p>
   <p>This racketeering and other underworld activities cannot be stopped by mere <span class="page-break">2</span>orders, but it can be stopped if we, the people, see to it that their political protection is taken away from them. So you see, my dear readers, it is really up to us.</p>
