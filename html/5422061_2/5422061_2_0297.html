   <p>Chicago was the third city, (New York being the first, and Cleveland second), where the Magyars showed an interest in amateur stage plays.</p>
   <p>On April 6, 1889, the first Magyar Social and Amateur Society invited the Hungarian public to see the play "Szokott Katona" (Deserter), which was being produced in Turner Hall, at North Clark Street near Chicago Avenue.</p>
   <p>The same play was produced in New York twenty years ago.</p>
   <p>What did this mean in those times to produce amateur play performances during the early years of the American-Magyars?</p>
   <p>It meant chiefly that the amateur play production brought together the <span class="page-break">2</span>Magyars of New York, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Bridgeport, and other nearby cities.</p>
   <p>In the theatre, the Magyars became acquainted with each other, and the acquaintance gave a start toward the Hungarian social life, the foundation and organization of the societies, congregations and parishes of the Hungarians in United States.</p>
