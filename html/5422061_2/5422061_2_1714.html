   <p>The patented "apostle" of people's rights and democracy, Count Michael Karolyi, is in Chicago at this time. We cannot call his visit fortunate, but not wishing to be malicious, we believe that the presence of Michael Karolyi, onetime president of the short-lived Republic of Hungary, in America is not very important.</p>
   <p>The Immigration Bureau did wisely to allow Karolyi to tour the United States. The Hungarians who pictured him as an idol and a great hero have been given an opportunity to meet him face to face and to hear him, and we believe that they will be disillusioned.</p>
   <p>This otherwise obscure person is a victim of his boundless vanity. As the heir to the enormous Karolyi fortune, he had a huge income, and instead of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>conserving it, he squandered it on horse racing and cards.</p>
   <p>Before the World War, he had a political career as a member of the House of Representatives. He was quite popular because, as a liberal, he fought for Hungarian rights in Vienna. The liberal newspapers called him the true follower of Kossuth, the father of our country. This led Karolyi to believe himself to be a great man. There followed his visit to the United States in 1914. Although ninety per cent of the Hungarians here were not Hapsburg loyalists and he, as a liberal, should have made a good impression, his success was moderate.</p>
   <p>Then came 1918 and the days of revolution. Karolyi and the great pacifist Oscar Jaszi didn't approve of the disarmament agreement between Austria-Hungary and the Entente's General Diaz, so they went to Belgrade and talked with General Franchet d 'Espray to make a new arrangement. The result was that, while the agreement with Diaz permitted the borders of Hungary to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>stand as before, the new agreement voided this and the victors' will was carried out.</p>
   <p>Karolyites disbanded their army because their pacifist hearts didn't want to see any soldiers.</p>
   <p>Hungary's history has no blacker page than the events of the autumn, 1918, when Karolyi allowed the country to be mutilated. He sealed his own doom when he gave over his power voluntarily to Bela Kun (Communist leader).</p>
   <p>A true Hungarian cannot forgive Karolyi, but we see his nemesis now when he has to make a circuit tour, charging admission for his "performances".</p>
