   <p>Dr. Richard Kovacs world famous doctor, medical authority and publisher of the only Hungarian medical paper is to be in Chicago on June 9, 1918 to attend the convention of the American Medical Association. Dr. Kovacs enroute to Chicago will stop at various Hungarian communities and give lectures on health and medical attention. Dr. Kovacs gives these lectures and shows pictures relative to his lectures. These lectures are educational and very practical.</p>
   <p>We think that, if some Hungarian organization would ask Dr. Kovacs to give a lecture and show his pictures, Dr. Kovacs would be willing to do so. We think it necessary that the Hungarian people become acquainted with many medical facts.</p>
