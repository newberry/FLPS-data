   <p>A Chicago Hungarian woman, Mrs. Frank Lozer, who has to leave this country on Jan. 15, with her husband and two small sons, wrote again to Miss Perkins, Secretary of Labor, to petition her to reverse the deportation order so that she may stay in America, to raise her two Chicago-born sons here. One boy is seven and the other is five years old. The Lozer family live in their own home which, together with the house-furnishing is their property. Deportation would mean the loss of all this.</p>
   <p>The family came from Magykomlos, Hungary, now Roumania. The husband was a medical student when the war broke out and he was drafted. Later as the Roumanians came into power, he did not wish to go back there, but, with his wife, came to America. They came to Chicago, from Canada without permit, and that is why deportation awaits them.</p>
