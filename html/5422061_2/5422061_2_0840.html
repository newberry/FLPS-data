   <p>Last Sunday, March 7, the Virgin Mary Society held its regular monthly meeting. This meeting can be called a history-making meeting, in as much as it was decided at this meeting that a home for the Society shall be built. Before the final decision was reached, many brave and noteworthy speeches were made in favor of building a home. When the vote was taken, the plan was accepted unanimously by the members. Immediately afterwards, the Society decided to appoint a committee of sixteen whose duty it will be to see that the home is built.</p>
   <p>The following people are on the committee; Mike Polyan, George Mihok, Joseph Weber, Stephen Pfundstein, Mike Hornok, John Keri, George Klajnik, Frank Marton, Matias Fejes, Frank Piriczky, George Racz, John Szakacs, Joseph Kocsis, Alex Kirner, Geza Szeles, and Charles Hudak.</p>
   <p>The meeting was rather lengthy, but the results were very good because <span class="page-break">\2</span>this building will be of great benefit not only to the Virgin Mary Society, but to the entire Hungarian population of Chicago's great South Side as well, for it is planned that this building will be used as a social and cultural center also.</p>
