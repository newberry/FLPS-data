   <p>A large crowd attended the Independence Day March 15, 1848, celebration of the South Side Federation at the Magyar Home on March 17. Though the program consisted of thirty-five numbers, the audience listened patiently, to the speakers and performers.</p>
   <p>Dr. Laszlo Medgyessy, Hungarian Consul, was present to represent Hungary. The city of Chicago was represented by Hon. Edward J. Kelly, Mayor, James J. Sullivan, ward committeeman, and Michael T. Mulcahy, alderman of the 8th ward.</p>
   <p>Rev. Theodore "Fedas," of the Greek-Catholic church, Rev. Ernest "Horvath" of the Roman-Catholic church, and Rev. S. E. Bologh of the Evangelical Reformed church, spoke in behalf of their respective churches.</p>

   <p>Principal speakers were the Mayor and the Hungarian Consul.</p>
   <p>After are program, the following motion was read: "The people who are present at this March 15 celebration unanimously agree that propaganda should be started through the Hungarian Press and through other official organs to make known their firm desire to Chicago and, particularly to the American-Hungarians, that a plebiscite be conducted in those territories in Hungary under foreign rule, and that such territories should be given back to Hungary. This plebiscite should be conducted by the proper authorities."</p>
   <p>In this way, a seed was sown and may it grow to great proportions, thereby our cry of "Justice for Hungary" will not be futile.</p>
