   <p>The enormous work of taking the 1930 Census will begin April 30. It is a fact that nowhere in the world do the people travel as freely from one part of the country to another as in the United States.</p>
   <p>There are several practical reasons for taking the census. The Government would like to obtain a clear, statistical picture of the population, but, since there may be some people who will give false information or disappear before being registered, the President decided to issue a proclamation to the effect that anyone caught falsifying reports will be prosecuted.</p>
   <p>The census will not affect individuals personally. It does not serve the purpose of checking up on taxpayers, eligibility for jury service, or schooling. The factor that most concerns the foreign-born is that when questioned they will not be asked whether they are citizens or whether their entry to this country was legal.</p>
