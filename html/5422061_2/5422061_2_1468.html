   <p>Fellow-Members and Countrymen! I take this opportunity to inform the Chicago Hungarians that I have had no part in the founding of the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association. I state this fact because I have been informed by some of my Hungarian brethren that they believed that I am one of the directors.</p>
   <p>It is not my theory to bring the Hungarians together in a cemetery, but to get the Chicago Hungarians into one camp while they are alive.</p>
