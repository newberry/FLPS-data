   <p>Last Sunday, May 23, the Chicago-Hungarians has the pleasure of witnessing a grand musical comedy. This musical comedy was presented by that well-known Chicago Hungarian cultural society, The Chicago-Hungarian Independent Song Society. This musical comedy was presented for the benefit of the starving children in Hungary. The name of the play was "The Hero from Brezovacz." It is one of the most modern Hungarian musical comedies.</p>
   <p>The sad feature of the affair was that the children of Hungary will not receive as much as a crust of bread from the benefits of this performance, not because the organization which sponsored this affair did not want to give the profits to these children, but because there were no profits. The Chicago-Hungarians turned their backs to this charitable affair.</p>
   <p>It is a shame that the Hungarians do not take more interest in ideas of <span class="page-break">2</span>modern times. The Chicago-Hungarian Independent Song Society is primarily organized, not as a profit-seeking organization, but as a cultural and educational organization.</p>
