   <p>The Chicago Branch of The Rokoczi Society has sponsored many social affairs for the benefit of Chicago-Hungarians, but the picnic which was held on June 22 surpassed all their previous activities.</p>
   <p>The Chicago-Hungarians really enjoyed themselves. A Hungarian orchestra furnished the music, and the performance of several Hungarian folk dances and songs claimed the attention of all present.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian Athletic Club was the guest of the Society, and they conducted a very interesting athletic tournament. This particular feature of the picnic will long be remembered by those who attended this picnic. There was a race of 100 yards, a hammer throwing contest, high jumping contest, football kicking contest, and a bowling tournament. All these events had very thrilling finishes.</p>
