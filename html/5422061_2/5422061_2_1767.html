   <p>The Creed of the League against Horthyism</p>
   <p>Accepted at the congress of the League against Horthyism on January 15, 1928.</p>
   <p>1. Before we begin the nation-wide organization of our League, we state that we will fight unselfishly and sacrificingly for the liberation of our oppressed Hungarian brethren until they are set free.</p>
   <p>2. That we have no other aim except to gather the Hungarian masses in America into one great unit. To use this unit as a weapon that will reach across the ocean where our brethren are suffering from lack of bread, from pogroms, and from persecutions. To lend a helping hand and aid the Hungarian minority population of Czechoslovakia, Rumania, and Yugoslavia....To cleanse the United States of the harmful influence of Horthyism, which openly or secretly tries to inveigle the American-Hungarians into aiding the oppressors of our own brethren.</p>
   <p>3. That to attain our goal we must consolidate in our ranks and as a <span class="page-break">\4</span>perfect unit face our common enemy, Northyism.</p>
   <p>To the Officers and Members of Chicago's Hungarian Societies:</p>
   <p>Fellow Workers, Brethren!</p>
   <p>The Chicago branch of the League against Northyism was organized on January 30, 1928. The foregoing informative basic creed explains that the local organization will form its Executive Committee from the delegates of the allied societies.</p>
   <p>Fellow Workers! This new organization has a great task to perform! The League against Horthyism is aiming to overthrow the reactionary rule that has been in power for ten years in Hungary.</p>
   <p>Our blood relatives, the proletariat, the common people, and the poor Jewry are enslaved under the yoke of the ex-emperor's and king's maffia. It is <span class="page-break">\5</span>up to us Hungarian-Americans to acquaint Western civilization with the fact that in this third decade of the twentieth century a country still exists where conditions are more shameful than in darkest Asia.</p>
   <p>Therefore, forward to action brethren! Let each society choose their delegates!.....</p>
