   <p>Above on this picture we present a priest in the circle of his family, - one, who keeps step with the progress of our age, and whom on account of his many good characters the Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity know advantageously, love and esteem. He is the first Hungarian priest, who gave a real meaning to the proverb: "If the mountain does not come to Mohammed, Mohammed goes to the mountain," when he began to spread the Holy Gospel through the radio. There are many of those, who for one reason or other can not attend the church service, however much he or she may feel the need of it. To satisfy this need, Rev. Stephen E. Balogh made a truly record breaking step, when he created the so-called "Invisible Church" service with the use of the radio. He highly recognized the tremendous advantage derived from the fact that he can reach through the radio to everyone, from the richest palaces to the poorest shacks, who are thirsting after the words of the Gospel, and to announce the greatness of Our Lord.</p>
