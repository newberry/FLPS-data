   <p>Immediately after the War, it seemed that the American-Hungarians would join the Hungarian National Unity movement, and would work in behalf of the restoration of Hungary. It is regrettable that the first flare of enthusiasm has died down for various reasons. This waning enthusiasm is to be regretted because it is difficult for the Hungarians to get together and act as a unit.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, in the occupied territories of Hungary, our people are being persecuted. The new lords of these severed territories have decided upon extermination of the Magyars, that is, suppressing the national feeling and tongue. The exclusion of the Magyar language from public life is a death blow to nationalism. The Czechs, Serbs, and Roumanians, make no secret that no Hungarian shall be spoken in upper Hungary (now Czecho-Slovakia), Transylvania, (now Roumania), and Banat (now Jugo-Slavia), after the next ten years.</p>

   <p>The aim of the American-Hungarians should be to set an example for our countrymen under foreign rule. They should not allow themselves to become chattels, but should adhere to their beliefs and traditions.</p>
   <p>When I send my Christmas message to my Hungarian brethren, I shall ask them to believe that the love of Christ will tear the murderer's weapon from the hands of our enemies, and then His name will be praised in all Magyar homes from the Carpathians to the Adriatic, and from Deveny to Brasso.</p>
   <p>It is Christmas Eve. By the light of the small candles I see the rising sun that will dry the tears of the Magyars.</p>
