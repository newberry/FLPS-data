   <p>The Hungarian Congregation of the Olivet Institute is not a church or a sect. The Hungarian Congregation of the Olivet Institute is a cultural body of Chicago Hungarians. Its aim is the development of humans to a goal of perfection through the means of self-education, the development of social instincts, deciding our position in relation to God irrespective of denominations.</p>
   <p>The pastor of the Hungarian Congregation of the Olivet Institute is Dr. Stephen Csaktornyai.</p>
