   <p>Those people who have followed the development of the Hungarians in Chicago fully realize that they have been more active than Hungarians located in any other city in the United States. We have hardly recovered from the realization that we have a permanent Hungarian theatre here in Chicago, which is supported most impressively by our people, and now we are surprised by another development. A permanent Hungarian ballet school has been opened in Chicago. This school is under the management of Rose Kassay who is the prima donna of the Chicago Hungarian Peoples Theatre.</p>
   <p>She has equipped a beautiful studio at 333 North Avenue. She will teach Hungarian ballet and folk dances exclusively.</p>
   <p>We feel that the Chicago Hungarians are fortunate in having in their midst such a capable woman to teach their children the Hungarian dances.</p>
