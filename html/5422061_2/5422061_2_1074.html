   <p>Last Friday night, in the Italian Room at the Sherman Hotel, a meeting was held by the American Relief Committee for the Hungarian sufferers. Many of the members pledged special donations. The following are people who not only pledged to donate, but who also made their contributions:</p>

   <p>With the above information we also received a letter from the president of the committee which reads as follows:</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Nov. 15, 1919.</p>
   <p>Mr. Martin Benedek;</p>
   <p>2207 Clybourn Ave.,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>My dear Sir:</p>
   <p>I note with pleasure in the Magyar Tribune, of November 14, that you take a deep interest in the movement of which I have become the head. I am confident your action will be of great benefit to the movement which you admit to be a worthy one. I hope you will continue to lend us your support.</p>
   <p>Every donation will be recorded even those as small as twenty-five cents.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The money, as you know, will be sent from here to the American committee in New York, headed by Mr. Herbert Hoover, 115 Broadway.</p>
   <p>Should any of your subscribers desire to send funds direct to this committee we will be very happy to receive them.</p>
   <p>We have only one object in view, and that is to help the children in the country of our birth.</p>
   <p>Thanking you for your courtesy, I remain,</p>
   <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Joseph Byfield.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>We are very glad to publish this letter, and we will be very glad to publish the names of those who may make their contributions to this worthy cause later. Regardless of our dispositions towards the leaders of this movement, we shall not oppose their actions because we consider the object of easing conditions among these starving children to be a worthy cause, and we are happy to support it. We hope that millions of dollars may be collected in Chicago for this cause.</p>
