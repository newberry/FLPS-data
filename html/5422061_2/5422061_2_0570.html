   <p>Simon Szerenyi, co-editor of the New York daily Magyar Ujsag, is now in Chicago, where he was sent by his newspaper to write about the World's Fair. An American firm in Chicago has given Szerenyi an order to write a book. This book, which will be interesting, technical, and of literary value, will contain all information valuable to the visitors of the Exposition, especially Hungarians. This is the first book in Hungarian dealing with the Fair; it will be not only a useful guide to all Hungarian-Americans visiting the Fair, but also an album and souvenir book of artistic value to all those who come here to see the Exposition and to those who, for some reason, cannot come to Chicago. This interesting and valuable book will show in detail by means of pictures the progress of the century. It will contain about two hundred pages and will dwell with emphasis upon those things which in some way have some relation to the Hungarians. Its price will be fifty cents, and it will be sold at every Hungarian place.</p>

   <p>A separate chapter will deal with the life of the Hungarian-Americans, especially those living in Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit and New York.</p>
   <p>Those interested in this World's Fair Hungarian souvenir book, already under press, should order a copy now.</p>
