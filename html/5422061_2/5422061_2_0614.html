   <p>It affords us great pleasure to caption this article, because we seldom have the oportunity to write about Hungarian successes. There are a few of our countrymen, who achieve success among ourselves, but real success is attained when the American public, through the American press, becomes aware of one of us. We had the pleasure to read two Hungarian names in the March 10 issue of the South End Reporter.</p>
   <p>The State Theater on Michigan Avenue and 111th Street, advertised that they would have moving pictures made on their stage by the Berkova Film Company. Any talented person could take part. The scenario,--"The Artist Lover" was written by George Thorsen. There were hundreds of amateur candidates. We are gratified to hear that the jury selected two Hungarians to take the leading roles. Esther Bodnar, the eight-year-old girl, was named "the million dollar movie face" and a movie career was predicted for her. The other winner was Michael Mezey, who looks like Dustin Farnum.</p>
