   <p>Members of the Chicago Hungarian Athletic Club have just come back from Cleveland where they attended a Hungarian track and field meet. They came back to Chicago unbeaten ,and neither did they accomplish victory, due to the interpretation of the rules,the Cleveland officials called the outcome of the match a tie.</p>
   <p>The boys who were in Cleveland came back to Chicago heartbroken. The reason for their sadness was that the Hungarian athletics in Cleveland have an athletic home, while the Chicago Hungarian athletics have nothing and have not even started anything in the way of building a home for athletics. We believe that the Chicago Hungarian athletics deserve a beautiful and pompous home. We must tell the Chicago Hungarian Athletic club that they should not worry because Chicago will have a beautiful athletic home for them.</p>

   <p>We Hungarians must start working and it won't be any time before the idea will be a reality.</p>
   <p>The idea is there and now all we need is the money. We don't know of any good Hungarian who would not be willing to contribute for the welfare of the Chicago Hungarian Athletic Club.</p>
