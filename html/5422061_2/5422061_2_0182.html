   <p>Sunday evening, at the North Side Turner Hall, a large audience enjoyed the four-hour presentation of "Alexandra," an operetta by Albert Szirmay, presented by the Chicago People's Theater Company.</p>
   <p>The title role was played by Margit Padly.</p>
   <p>We are glad to note that the directors of the Chicago People's Theater are trying to please the Hungarian theater-going public by choosing plays and operettas destined to meet their approval.</p>
