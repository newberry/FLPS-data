   <p>Father Stanley A. Linkus, pastor of the St. Mary's Church, 3501 So. Union Avenue, has recently opened a free bread distributing center at 924 E. 93rd St., Burnside, where 300 families receive free bread daily.</p>
   <p>So many families are in need that hundreds have to be turned away.</p>
   <p>This new charitable movement is a branch of the St. John's Mission. Everyone is equally treated, regardless of nationality or religion.</p>
