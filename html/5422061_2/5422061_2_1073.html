   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Independent Charitable Society sponsored an evening of entertainment on January 10, for the benefit of the starving Hungarian children in Europe. Crystal Hall, where the affair took place, was filled to capacity. The most important part of the event was that it proved to be a success. The starving children of Hungary will receive $150, the proceeds derived from this entertainment.</p>
   <p>We take the opportunity to extend our thanks to all who aided in this work. The members of this organization are being congratulated for the fine work they are doing to promote such a worthy cause, the fruits of which proved so successful.</p>
