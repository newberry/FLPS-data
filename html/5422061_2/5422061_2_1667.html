   <p>Last Sunday, at the suggestion of our member, Mr. Emery Radi, our Congregation [the Hungarian Roman Catholic Church of the North Side] sent a telegram to British Premier MacDonald, now on a visit in Washington. The British Premier seemed to favor Revision when he met Mussolini in Rome. In its telegram, the Congregation asked the illustrious guest of America to remain loyal to the idea of Revision [of the Treaty of Trianon], as the slaughtering done at Trianon does everything to the world but bring peace.</p>
