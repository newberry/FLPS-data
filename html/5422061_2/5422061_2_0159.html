   <p>The economic and social turmoil caused by the War has cut short many promising careers of budding artists. Many of them had to leave their countries to better their conditions abroad.</p>
   <p>One of these artists has settled in Chicago. He is Nicholas Gaspar, who has a studio in the Studio Building, 3 East Ontario Street. Our reporter found him there, and had a very interesting interview. He does historical and church frescoes. He was the pupil of Aladar Krisch. During the War, he made valuable art contributions of the Roumanian and Russian fronts to the Budapest and Vienna art institutes.</p>
   <p>When Gaspar came to Chicago, he heard of the fresco painting contest of the Chicago Tribune and decided to enter it. We understand that there were eighty contestants, and Gaspar received second prize. We believe that if Gaspar had been an American, with some knowledge of the language, he would have won first place with the $5,000 award.</p>
   <p>The local Art Institute has placed three of Gaspar's works on display, proof that they consider them worthy of note.</p>
