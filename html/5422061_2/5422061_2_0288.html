For a moment we were dumfounded, but then we began to search for some psychological explanation. It seems that something was missing somewhere. The public was seeking for something which it did not get. Everything was good. The gypsy music was excellent. The actors were old, proved and knew their business. And yet, something was missing.</p>
   <p>It is possible that a certain finishing touch was missing, a touch which would have put the whole production in the right frame. A diamond is more valuable when in the proper setting. Even the best art has to be dished out skillfully.</p>

   <p>The missing master touch was noticed by the public who crowded the theater for the first performance.</p>
   <p>Yes, the show business is not so simple as it looks.</p>
