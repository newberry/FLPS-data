   <p>New Year Day will for long remain a fond memory in the minds of the Hungarians living in the Calumet region, because on that day a record crowd attended the Hungarian Home to see the first Hungarian Radio Festival. The evening was an outstanding success, which proves the popularity of the Hungarian Radio Hour and speaks well of its skillful arrangement. This Radio Festival was arranged by Frank J. Kovach, director of the Hungarian Radio Hour over Station WIND in Gary, Indiana, who was aided in his work by the businessmen of Burnside and by the House Committee of the Hungarian Home. The festival was scheduled to start at six o'clock in the afternoon, and by that time the halls of the building were crowded to capacity. To facilitate listening to the program, the halls, on the two floors were provided with loudspeakers. The loudspeakers were of great service when the time to dance came, as the same music was heard in both halls, thus preventing any crowding, to the great satisfaction of the public. The program consisted of numbers by amateurs and the well-known cabaret Troupe headed by Louis Horvath, Jr., a gifted actor. The program was <span class="page-break">2</span>varied and rather long, and the public evidently enjoyed it very much.</p>
   <p>Frank J. Kovach, who acted as master of ceremonies, greeted the audience with a short speech, which he commenced with the same phrase he uses when he opens his Hungarian Hour: "Good evening to all!" The public rewarded him with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>[Translator's Note: The article describes each number on the program, naming and praising each of the 76 performers, musicians, etc., and giving an account of how each of them played.]</p>
   <p>The festival lasted until the morning hours. The income of the evening will be used to make the Hungarian Radio Hour a permanent feature.</p>
