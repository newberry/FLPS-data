   <p>The Chicago Workers' Club, whose aim is the education of the workers, has decided to have a winter class for children. They have engaged a teacher who studied and received her diploma in Hungary. The school is free and all Hungarian children between the ages of eight and fourteen may enroll.</p>
   <p>The school's curriculum includes all subjects not taught in American schools, i. e. the reading and writing of Hungarian, grammar, elocution, and singing.</p>
   <p>We are aware of the fact that many children of Hungarian families do not read and write or even speak Hungarian, although the majority of the parents are still unfamiliar with the English language. Children will naturally learn English, and knowing how to read and write in the mother tongue of their parents can be only an added advantage.</p>
   
   <p>We call the attention of the parents, who wish their children to receive instruction, to this school. You can register every evening after 8:P.M. at the home of the Workers' Club, 453 West North Avenue....</p>
