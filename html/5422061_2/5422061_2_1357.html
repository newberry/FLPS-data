   <p>A truly historical event took place last Friday, Saturday, and Sunday at the Hungarian Home in the Burnside district, where Hungarian delegates and leaders, anxious to better the situation of our people, gathered together from all parts of America to find a remedy for the ills which have been aflicting our conationals for quite some time.</p>
   <p>These enthusiastic, unselfish, and prominent public leaders have demonstrated that they can accomplish good work, if they decide to lay aside,even if temporarily only, their religious and political differences. These differences are the snags on which our unity has been wrecked time and again in the past.</p>
   <p>We have to bow before our delegates for the good understanding that prevailed during the three days of the convention.</p>
   <p>The convention of the Hungarian-American Associations, opened on Friday, at <span class="page-break">2</span>4 P.M., at the Hungarian Home in the Burnside district, and called together to rescue our associations and their members from financial ruin, is of historical significance in the life of our institutions.</p>
   <p>In spite of attacks and objections from all sides, over one hundred and forty delegates from all parts of America--between Los Angeles and New York--as well as a great number of members, gathered here for the three-day convention.</p>
   <p>Louis Nagy, delegate from Branch 317 of the Woodsmen of the World and chairman of the Preparations Committee, opened the convention Friday afternoon and proceeded to name several committees. [Translator's Note: More than fifteen names listed, mostly from out of Chicago.] There were named a Credentials Committee of five, a Program Committee of twenty-five, a Finance Committee of seven, and Organizational Committee of twenty-five, a Motions Committee, and a Press Committee.</p>
   <p>Friday evening, before a crowd of about seven hundred, the program of the <span class="page-break">3</span>[Preparations] Committee was read and enthusiastically, approved after some debate by a number of local and out-of-town delegates.</p>
   <p>The serious and creative work of the convention began Saturday, after the opening speech of Dr. Zoltan Galambos, chairman of the convention, who exclaimed: "The ship is sinking, all hands on deck!"</p>
   <p>The Program Committee described the present grave situation and the necessity of helping the associations.</p>
   <p>Following this, the different committees went to work and, after lengthy and minute discussions, the Program Committee introduced its program, which, after being subjected again to a thorough debate, was finally adopted as follows:</p>
   <p>1. Governmental support for the associations.</p>
   <p>2. Immediate loans by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to Associations now on the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>3. Assets belonging to the branches of associations and now frozen in defaulted banks to be released immediately.</p>
   <p>4. The time for striking off our unemployed and aged members to be extended for at least a year.</p>
   <p>5. Creation of a reserve fund for helping our unemployed members.</p>
   <p>6. Insurance for our invalid and aged members. Social security.</p>
   <p>7. Founding of homes for the aged, sanitariums, and of orphanages through our joined forces.</p>
   <p>8. Hospitalization and medical care at modified prices.</p>
   <p>The convention declared that although it could not handle individual cases of members as the associations, yet it would lend moral support to efforts to save the members' bank deposits and homes. The convention will help them also in its capacity as defender of the interests of all the associations.</p>
   <p>Just before closing the convention on Saturday, the floor gave a hearty ovation to Paul Kisko, secretary of the Preparations Committee, who had been subjected to many unfounded and repulsive attacks by the enemies of the <span class="page-break">5</span>convention.</p>
   <p>Emery Frank, Chicago representative of Szabadsag, announced at the Saturday session that, after sending his newspaper a telegram reporting the magnitude and success of the Friday session, he had received instructions from his employers to attend the convention and report its progress to them.</p>
   <p>After this, the convention adjourned until Sunday, when the Organizational, Motions, Finance, and Press committees submitted their reports. At this session those points in the program which required immediate action were discussed.</p>
   <p>Chicago was selected by a great majority of votes as the national center for this action. The election of a president and a secretary was left to the discretion of a board of directors to be elected later on.</p>
   <p>The National Board of Directors shall consist of eleven members, plus three <span class="page-break">6</span>delegates from every district. This board will do its work through four secretaries, who will be supported by district board of directors to be founded at several places.</p>
   <p>The country was divided into six districts: Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Los Angeles.</p>
   <p>This settled, the members for the National Board of Directors were elected. [Translator's Note: The article gives a list of names--eleven directors, four secretaries, and several district board directors and district delegates to the National Board of Directors.]</p>
   <p>The name of the new body will be National Protective Federation of Hungarian-American Associations.</p>
   <p>The convention ended Sunday afternoon at four o'clock in the best possible spirit.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>The delegates went home to report to their associations and branches thereof, so that they might start without delay the execution of this historically important program adopted at the convention, and will urge all associations and their branches to join this action, the aim of which is to save Hungarian institutions and their members from disaster.</p>
   <p>Lacking space in this issue, we are postponing publication of the resolutions adopted at this convention until our next one.</p>
