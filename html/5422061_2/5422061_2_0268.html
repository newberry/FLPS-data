   <p>The plot of the story the "Silver Bird" is a true likeness of the Hungarian nation, which is under sentence of death. John Barothy, Hungarian landowner, is condemned to die because he loves his country. A patriotic Slav youth rescues him from his fate. The Czechs have misled the Slavs, who have been patriotic and loyal to Hungary for a thousand years, but they, too, are disillusioned and are helping us to fight for our rights. The fate of the Hungarians is akin to that of the Silver Bird. This proud bird followed the Magyars from the plains of Asia and made its home in the swamps of Ecsed. The swamps were drained and the Silver Birds flew back to Asia. Their place is taken by sparrows, crows and ravens. The Czechs, Rumanians, and Serbs have robbed the Magyars of their homes.</p>
   <p>This prize-winning play will be produced on Oct. 13 at the Douglas Park Auditorium, Ogden and Kedzie Avenues. All patriotic Hungarians should see it.</p>

   <p>Paul Berak is directing the play and takes this opportunity to ask American Hungarian dramatic and culture clubs to produce it also in all Hungarian localities so that the Hungarians will understand why we are demanding revision of the "Treaty of Trianon."</p>
