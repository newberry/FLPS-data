   <p>The Hungarian Baptist Church in West Pullman is remarkable for more reasons than one. In the first place, it is the mother-church of three very active churches: The Hungarian Baptist Churches in East Chicago and in Gary, Indiana, and of the Roumanian Baptist Church in Gary, Indiana. The founder-member of the church in West Pullman, the late Sam Ulbrich was also the founder and editor of the official organ of the Hungarian Baptists, the Evangelium Hirnoke (Herald of the Evangelium) which even today flourishes. On his insistence in 1908 there was called together the founders meeting for the American Hungarian Baptist Federation, which Federation celebrated its 25th anniversary in 1933 in the circle of the Hungarian Baptist Church in West Pullman. Many members of the church lives in various parts of the World, also in Hungary.</p>
