   <p>p.19.....................A new club was formed in Burside, which aims to bring together the youth for the practice of sport and self education. The club got its charter under the name of: Hungarian-American Social and Athletic Club and it has no connection with any other associations, or politics, neither does it include any sick benefit insurance or the like; it simply wants to serve the Hungarian culture. There is no initiation fee and the dues are only 10c a month. The officers of this new club are: Jack Rosenfeld, president, Joseph Szabo, vice-president, Louis Klajnik, recorder and Andrew Basco, treasurer. They expect new members from all over Chicago. Their regular meeting is every Tuesday evening at 9032 Cottage Grove. Their first ball was held on Sunday, September 30 in the Hungarian House, where the club presented itself advantageously to the public. The music was given by a band recruited entirely from the members of the club and was led by Valent Szepesi.</p>
