   <p>Brig. Gen. Harry Hill Bandholz, who as the head of the International Military Mission of 1919 in Budapest prevented the Roumanian army from looting the National Muzeum of Hungary, the grateful Hungarians erected a monument in Budapest. The armed bandits under the command of a Roumanian army lieutenant were just carrying out from the Museum many of the treasures when General Bandholz arrived, with only his riding-crop in his hand. He chased away the Roumanians singlehanded, together with their officer, ordered the art objects to be taken back to the Museum, closed and sealed the doors himself. This his deed the Hungarians never forgot. Although Gen. Bandholz died in 1925, his memory will live forever in Hungarian History. His monument, which was unveiled on Aug. 23rd, will long show the gratitude of the Hungarian nation.</p>
