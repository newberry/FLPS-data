   <p>Next Saturday and Sunday have been set aside as Hungarian evenings at Navy Pier.</p>
   <p>It is well known that the Navy Pier is built into Lake Michigan, a mile from the shore, which makes it one of the coolest spots in Chicago.</p>
   <p>On these evenings, dancing is free on the beautiful pavilion for all those who cut out this notice and present it at the entrance. There will be a dance contest and many valuable prizes.</p>

   <p>The City of Chicago has spent ten million dollars to build the Navy Pier and it is up to the citizens to make use of its amusement facilities.</p>
