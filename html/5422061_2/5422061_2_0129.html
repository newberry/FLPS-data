   <p>p.4.... This is the first time that the Chicago Opera contracted a Hungarian woman singer. She is Olga Forrai, soprano. For years, we've known of William Beck as a male Hungarian member of the Chicago Opera.</p>
   <p>We are very glad that Olga Forrai is here, because we know that with her art she will make us Hungarians proud of her.</p>
   <p>Among the members of the Opera there are many nationalities and every nation is not only proud of members of their own group ,but does everything within their power to help them. Behind every artist there is a colony, who claim the artist as their own. If an Italian, Jewish or French artist is here, the Italian, Jewish or French colony celebrates. We Hungarians can't stay in the background either, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in this case. We welcome Olga in Chicago and promise to stand by her. All the Hungarians in and around Chicago should hear her.</p>
