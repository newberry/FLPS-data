   <p>Several years ago, when the Committee of the Hungarian Group of A Century of Progress World Exposition was founded, its leaders not only sold shares to the Hungarians, but also kept in continual touch with Fair officials. It is to be regretted that this Committee did not inform either the Hungarian press or the Hungarians of Chicago and vicinity how far its work had progressed.</p>
   <p>The bad economic situation that prevailed in Europe threatened the success of the Exposition. It is a well-known fact that two years ago Hungary was forced to withdraw her intention to be officially represented at the Fair. Since that time, the meetings of the Committee for the Hungarian Group became more sporadic, giving rise to the impression that the Hungarian-Americans had withdrawn entirely from participation in the Exposition.</p>
   <p>The Federation of Hungarian Associations of Greater Chicago took this case into their own hands and called a meeting on May 1, 1933, at the Chicago Hungarian Club. Present at this meeting were Ladislas Medgyessy, Hungarian consul, Dr. Arpad Barothy, Joseph Kaszab, Ernest Horvath, priest in Burnside, Dr. Steve Csaktornyay, R.C. Hurd, the official representative of the Century of Progress, the executive members of the Federation, and the representatives of the newspapers Magyar Tribune, Aziras, and Szabadsag.</p>
   <p>The meeting, under the chairmanship of Ernest Holvay, after a lengthy discussion resolved to form a new committee and restart immediately the already abandoned work this time with united forces, so that there is every right to hope that the Hungarians will be well represented at the Exposition.</p>
   <p>The new committee is composed of Dr. Arpad Barothy, president; Ernest Holvay, executive president; Joseph Kaszab, vice-president; Joseph Csanady, secretary; Joseph Iroczky, treasurer; and Ernest Kunstadt, recorder. The board of directors is composed of Louis Szappanos, Joseph Lautner, Anthony Lachman, Dr. Steve Csaktornyay, John Balazs, Henry Gross, and three other members to be delegated by associations on the South Side.</p>
