   <p>We have received word that the managers of the Chicago Bush Temple's German Theatre have contracted to produce Frank Lehar's "Ciganyszerelem" (Gipsy Love) operetta, for six performances. This event has brought us great pleasure, for the reason that today, when our homeland is surrounded on all sides by enemies, in this far off land that is now our country, we find a nation that shows appreciation of Hungarian fine arts by producing Hungarian operettas. This operetta of Lehar's is fashioned after life in Rumania, but has the Hungarian literary style and beauty interwoven in its performances. Not long ago we had the opportunity to see this operetta, here in Chicago, presented by our artists. We can safely say that all of us will enjoy the performances at the German Theatre.</p>

   <p>By this we do not mean to belittle our artists. We must take into consideration the German Theatre's original costumes, ornaments and the eminent orchestra. We must not forget the disadvantages of original Hungarian form of managership, whereby, attention must be focused on the whole production, even to the smallest details. We hope to see the Hungarians of Chicago, attending the performances in large groups. The theatre is located at Chicago Ave, and Clark St.</p>
