   <p>The Literary and Singing Club will celebrate its thirty-fifth anniversary on January 27, at the Lincoln Auditorium. On this occasion it will present the "Mezeskalacs" (Gingerbread), a three act operetta.</p>
   <p>The "Mezeskalacs" cast will include the most talented amateurs, who are members of the Club also. The "Mezeskalacs" is not a pretentious operetta, but a simple Magyar musical presentation.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the program will be an exceptional one, and the Club expects all those who have given it their moral support for the past thirty-five years to attend this jubilee.</p>
   
   <p>The churches and societies are requested not to hold any affairs on this day, which would divide the attendance. The club has always done likewise, if requested.</p>
