   <p>We have noticed that at the meeting called by the directors of the World's Fair the radical Hungarians have no intention of cooperating with the conservative patriotic Hungarian group in arranging of the Hungarian Day celebration.</p>
   <p>The radical group does not want to show to the American public <span class="page-break">2</span>the Hungarian culture and artistry, but wish to use this occasion to make charges and false allegations against Hungary.</p>
   <p>The unfortunate remark of Doctor Barothy, temporary chairman, was due probably to his unfamiliarity with the Hungarian language. He stated that the assistance given by the Hungarians was negligible, and that the most important thing to do was to gain the cooperation of the Americans. This statement gave the radicals group a chance to withdraw demonstratively from the meeting.</p>
   <p>The reds saw their opportunity to drive a wedge between the two <span class="page-break">3</span>Hungarian groups, and persuaded Joseph Lautrer to call a special protest meeting. This meeting was held June 18.</p>
   <p>The radical group then began their destructive work. They wished to use the Hungarian day for their own selfish purposes. They demanded majority representation on the committee, and threatened, if their demands were not granted, to make a demonstration at the Hungarian Day Celebration.</p>
   <p>The result of this radical attack was that Lautrer resigned, and Petrovits was elected in his place on the committee.</p>

   <p>We would not be surprised to hear that the committee has disbanded altogether.</p>
