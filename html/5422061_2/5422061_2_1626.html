   <p>The Swedish consul, who also represents the Hungarian government in this country, has asked us to inform the Hungarian people that he has received an official bulletin from Hungary advising all Hungarians who wish to emigrate from the United States to postpone the trip until peace is officially declared in Hungary. Due to the unsettled conditions in Hungary, employment and food are very scarce, and transportation facilities are very poor. The government does not recommend the emigration of Hungarians from the United States at this time.</p>
   <p>In connection with the above information, this newspaper has also learned that the Swedish consul has stopped the issuance of Hungarian passports. According to this, those who have definitely decided to return to Hungary should cancel all plans.</p>

   <p>This is official news, but there is a possibility that there are other reasons for the issuance of the bulletin. Should the Hungarian government decide not to accept the Articles of peace and war continues such circumstances will put immigrants in that country in a very precarious position.</p>
   <p>When this paper went to press we received information that the Hungarian government had denied signing the peace pact.</p>
