   <p>We are greatly pleased to inform our readers of a praiseworthy movement which is being launched among our Chicago Hungarians, We believe that this movement is so worthy that it deserves the full cooperation of the entire Hungarian population of Chicago.</p>
   <p>A few of our good Hungarian citizens got together and organized the "First Chicago Hungarian Benefit Society for Orphans and Sick Children." The chief purpose of this organization is, as the name implies, to aid orphans and poor children. The money for this charitable work will come from donations.</p>
   <p>The officers of this new Hungarian society are as follows: Paul Toth, president; Elizabeth Acs, vice-president; Nandor Boldorjan, treasurer; and Frank Hronyec, comptroller. Doctor Holmos has offered to give <span class="page-break">\2</span>medical care, free of charge, to those needy children who are to be aided by this organization.</p>
   <p>Up to the present, the organization has received donations totaling $37.50. This amount has been deposited with the Prudential State Bank.</p>
   <p>The charter members deserve a great deal of praise for initiating such a great and notable activity among the Chicago Hungarians.</p>
