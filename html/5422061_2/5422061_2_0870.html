   <p>The First Hungarian Benevolent Society of South Chicago, which was formerly associated with the Associated Hungarian Benevolent Societies', third class, after having been severed from that class for many years, has re-established itself with the Associated Hungarian Benevolent Societies. This society has not been placed in the third class, but is now classed as a suburban member.</p>
   <p>We are happy to learn of this, for it proves that in unity there is strength. It also shows us, beyond any doubt, that being divided is poor policy.</p>
