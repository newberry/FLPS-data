   <p>A queer and unexpected event took place in the editorial room of the Magyar Tribune this week. The shipwrecked members of the Chicago Peoples Theater, who were stranded in Toledo, Ohio, came back to Chicago to begin again where they left off.</p>
   <p>The fact is that the Chicago Peoples Theater (Inc.) has been disbanded. The cause of this is not known to us now and we have no wish to discuss it until we have a clear understanding of the matter. However, we cannot close our eyes to facts.</p>
   <p>At the present time, six of the members of the company are here in Chicago and desire to make a livelihood. They do not ask for alms, but wish to earn their daily bread by honest work. They have formed a new company and have <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>named it the Chicago Hungarian Theater. Their purpose is not to tour the country, but to offer the Chicago Hungarian theater-going public amusement and pleasure with their art.</p>
   <p>Among the members of the new company we find the cream of the Chicago Peoples Theater, who are all favorites of the Hungarians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The director of the new company is the veteran actor Louis Horvath, who has been an American-Hungarian favorite for twenty-five years....</p>
   <p>The first performance of the new company will take place on February 8....</p>
   <p>We are convinced that this new company will strive to do its best to earn the respect and admiration of the Chicago Hungarians....</p>
   <p>We cannot demonstrate our love and attachment for Hungarian culture in a better manner than by attending the initial performance of the Chicago Hungarian Theater on February 8.</p>
