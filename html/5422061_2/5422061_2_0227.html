   <p>The San Carlo Opera Company gave a contract to Rozsika Szabo', the favorite of the Chicago Hungarians, who was Hungarian Queen of the Chicago Auto-Show in 1936. Miss Szabo' will be away from Chicago for five months, and her first station will be Detroit, where she will dance next week a solo dance. The company will tour in Florida, California, and from there goes to the Southern States. The progress of Miss Szabo' causes joy to her dancing teacher, Professor Petri, and the 1. Chicago Hungarian Junior and Amateur Club, and every Hungarian in Chicago rejoices in seeing the success of Miss Szabo.</p>
