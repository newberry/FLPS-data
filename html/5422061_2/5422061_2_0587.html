   <p>The First Hungarian Air Theatre Club requests the cooperation of all Hungarians to make their picnic a success. The expense of keeping up a radio hour is always growing and the only way to raise money is to arrange entertainments for its benefit.</p>
   <p>The directors of the Hungarian Air Theatre realize that this is not the most opportune time to ask the assistance of the Hungarian because the depression is at its height, but they are forced to do so, <span class="page-break">2</span>if they are to keep up the radio hour.</p>
   <p>The total receipts of the day will be used for the maintenance of the Hungarian radio hour.</p>
   <p>The picnic will be at the House of Niles Picnic Grove on Sunday, June 17.</p>
