   <p>The Society for Aid to Chicago Hungarian Indigents and Orphans held its annual meeting a few days ago, at which time a report of its activities was made public. This is further proof of the Society's noble aims.</p>
   <p>The report shows that the Society distributed food and clothing to ten needy Hungarian families this Christmas. Furthermore, it shows that the Society has one hundred twenty-four members and a working capital of $268.78.</p>
   <p>At this meeting the following officers for 1929 were elected: Ferenc Ronto, president; Irene Halmos, vice-president; Ferdinand Boldorjan, secretary-treasurer; Dr. A. C. Halmos, physician (without salary).....</p>
   <p>We wish to call the attention of our readers to the coming benefit affair of the Society, to be held at the Prudential Hall Club on March 2, 1929. Music will be furnished by the Society's own orchestra.</p>
