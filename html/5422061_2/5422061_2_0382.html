   <p>The American-Hungarians were recently saddened by the report that Hungary wouldn't take part in the World's Fair. Their pleasure [was great] at the announcement that in the last hour their country had erected the Hungarian pavilion, and that the Hungarian exhibit had already begun.</p>
   <p>The unfortunate economic situation and other circumstances were obstacles, but the exhibitors themselves overcame them, and we are at the Fair.</p>
   <p>South of 22nd Street, close to the Old Heidelberg, there is a small, but very nice Hungarian pavilion, which cost about $10,000.</p>
   <p>We find the exhibit of Manfred Weiss' conserve products, consisting of varieties of canned goulash, stuffed cabbages and peppers, pate de foie gras, and fruits.</p>

   <p>There is a separate entrance to the Hungarian Hall. On the walls, we see paintings of Budapest, familiar scenes that were sent by Ibusz.</p>
   <p>On the right, we see the tobacco exhibit of the Royal Hungarian Crocan. All kinds of Hungarian cigars, cigarettes, and tobacco, are sold in original packages.</p>
   <p>There is the Pannonia sheepskin refining exhibit, the Krausz Brothers' jewelry display, the Szechenyi Export Company's exhibit of home industry, the Charles Adam's character-doll factory exhibit, the Herendi factory's display of porcelain.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian pavilion is a great success. The small place is jammed all the time.</p>
