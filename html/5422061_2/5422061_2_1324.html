   <p>Again, March 15, has come, and with it the memories of March 15, 1848 are brought to all good Hungarians. This date brings back memories when dawn broke on Hungarian liberty. For the past sixty-two years, we have been celebrating the memory of the day when we began our battle for liberty. It is with deep feeling and respect that we mention the names of warriors of the battle of March 15, 1848. We rejoice as the opportunity presents itself to observe this particular holiday in a most fitting manner. March 15 is one of the most important national holidays of the Hungarian people. It touches the hearts of the Hungarians with memories of long ago.</p>

   <p>We again celebrate March 15. Again, we will hear many speeches. O Lord, what a difference there is between March 15, 1848 and March 15, 1920! The cause for which we celebrate this day has lost some of its meaning. It would be a laughable matter today for us to cry about the tactics of our cursed enemy, Austria. The Austria of old does not exist today. Hungary is a free and independent country today.</p>
   <p>Regarding these matters, the holiday, March 15, is of no consequence to some of us. Yet we still are forced to celebrate March 15, and we must celebrate it with greater enthusiasm than in the past.</p>
   <p>We must give March 15, 1920 a new meaning and show others what it really means. Our enthusiastic leaders of the past who encouraged the celebration of March 15 have not been so active in this direction. They show little concern whether or not Hungarian-Americans celebrate March 15 as <span class="page-break">\3</span>a holiday. The dignitaries and leaders are satisfied now that the aristocrats again have gained power in Hungary. They say that judges and other people in high office take orders from the aristocratic class of Hungary. The aristocrats like this situation and that is why they want to have a king.</p>
   <p>These people would like to scratch March 15 off the calendar. We would not feel bad if they were to ask us why March 15 should be recognized as a holiday, or why Louis Kossuth was born. "Long Live The King!"</p>
   <p>Will there be enough pride left in us as Hungarian-Americans to cast aside these so-called leaders and continue faithfully celebrating this great Hungarian holiday? Or shall we bow before the attitude of these people and join them in shouting: "Long Live The King?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>We should regard March 15 in the same manner to be in accord with the ideals of Louis Kossuth. He maintained the ideals of justice and independence for Hungary high above all. It is with these ideals in mind that Hungarian-Americans should go forward and celebrate the true meaning of March 15. The Hungarians of the United States must object very strongly against the establishment of a monarchy in Hungary.</p>
   <p>We must advocate and preach the ideals of Louis Kossuth concerning cooperation, and by adhering to such principles, Hungary can establish peace with the entire world. This idea should be advanced by the Hungarian-Americans. Perhaps we can start a new history of March 15.</p>
   <p>We are of the opinion that if some Hungarian-Americans do not wish to celebrate March 15 in the true spirit, then they should give up the idea. They should openly deny the fact that March 15 is a Hungarian national holiday, rather than be disgraced by such mock celebrations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>If there yet are people who want to give new life to the ideals of Louis Kossuth, they will faithfully abide by his ideals and celebrate March 15 with the true spirit and put forth effort to relieve distressed conditions which now exist in Hungary.</p>
   <p>Do the Hungarian-Americans want to advocate the ideals of Louis Kossuth, or do they want to go back to Long Live The King? Louis Kossuth has spoken.</p>
