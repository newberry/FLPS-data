   <p>Several articles have appeared in the columns of the Magyar Tribune, in regard to the idea put forth by our good Hungarian friend William Hartman, and his proposal that a Hungarian cemetery he purchased, equipped, and opened.</p>
   <p>That the different articles have had effect can be readily seen from the expressions of interest, and the inquiries we have received concerning this matter. Some people are wholeheartedly for it while others seem rather indifferent.</p>
   <p>There have been many questions asked in regard to the Hungarian cemetery, and we believe that we will be doing our duty in attempting to answer them right here and now.</p>
   
   <p>According to our friend Mr. Hartman, this undertaking would be a profitable one in which individuals, as well as societies, and all Hungarian organizations, might cooperate and do their part of the work.</p>
   <p>In other words the cemetery would be bought jointly by individuals and Hungarian organizations; naturally space for burial purposes would be available here at a large saving.</p>
   <p>Even though these burial spaces would be much cheaper than space in any other cemetery, the stock holders could still make quite a large profit on their investment.</p>
   <p>Disregarding the profits that might be derived from such an investment, there are a hundred and one other reasons why we should make a definite decision and carefully consider this problem.</p>
   <p>This matter deserves careful consideration and thought, and we believe that we should take over this project. If the idea is handled by responsible parties it will be a huge success.</p>
   <p>The sooner the activities start, the sooner the Chicago Hungarian people will have their own cemetery.</p>
