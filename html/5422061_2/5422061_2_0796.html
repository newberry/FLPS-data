   <p>The speaker of the day was the Reverend John Muranyi, pastor of the West Side Hungarian Reformed Church.....</p>
   <p>Old Hungarian-American settlers, charter members of the Tarsalgo, were also present, thereby demonstrating that although they spent the greater part of their lives in America and are loyal citizens of the United States, the love for their mother country is still in their hearts and they are proud of their Hungarian origin.....</p>
