   <p>Chicago's intelligentsia has succeeded in saving the good name of this three and one half million metropolis by opening the doors of the Opera, even if for a shorter season.</p>
   <p>Of the conductors, we must give special note to Leo Kopp, the young Hungarian, who is one of the most talented young men in the group. Mr. Kopp's name is equally well known to musical circles here and abroad. He is the brother-in-law of Dr. Victor Sonda, professor at Loyola.</p>
