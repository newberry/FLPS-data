   <p>Brethren! The first National Conference of Magyar America has taken place and has given us a constitutional organ for conducting our mutual affairs. Its name is the National Federation of American Hungarians. Justice for Hungary! Peace for the world!</p>
   <p>This organ is governed by a council of nine members. We who were appointed by our people to this council are deeply impressed when we assume our office and offer our strength and capabilities in the service of the sacred aims that the Buffalo National Conference designated.....</p>
   <p>At the Buffalo National Conference, we became united for the revisionist <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>cause. All true brothers were hand in hand in this endeavor. We demolished all the old barriers, prejudices, and hatreds so that we might work together in the spirit of forgiveness, in unity, against Trianon, for the liberation of Hungarians under foreign rule.....</p>
   <p>The Council has started to execute the Buffalo "blood agreement"....with the help of God, and the co-operation of all Hungarians, abiding by the decision of the first constitutional body of Magyar America that all its activities are for our welfare.</p>
   <p>The Anniversary of Trianon</p>
   <p>The murderous verdict against Hungary was rendered on July 20, 1920. Trianon took away everything in its power from our mother country. Two-thirds of Hungary and the Magyars were thrown under foreign rule.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>The victorious armies were, and remained, soldiers. They tossed aside the rights of a thousand years, violated God's will and upset the laws of nature that they might insure their reign for a longer period of time.</p>
   <p>More than three and a half million of our brethren are suffering under a foreign yoke. More than half of our Magyar land produces bread for aliens.</p>
   <p>In Buffalo we all took an oath that we will inform the American public about Trianon and that we will do all in our power to work peacefully for peace, the first condition of which is the revision of the peace treaty of Trianon. Justice for Hungary! Peace for the world!</p>
   <p>The anniversary of the sorrowful event of Trianon is near. Let this be the first opportunity when the significance of the National Conference of Buffalo will be confirmed. On June 23, the Sunday after June 20, let <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>us demonstrate outwardly the sorrow that is in our hearts and let us ring the church bells to gain the attention of the American people and ask for their understanding.</p>
   <p>Let our pastors hold memorial services, our societies commemorative affairs, our newspapers frame the printed words in black, and let each Hungarian individual be a living protest, our will a trumpet before the public opinion of the American people. Let this day be a day of mourning, Trianon.</p>
   <p>It will become apparent to us how the people of America will react to our sorrow. Today they may only listen, but tomorrow they may support our cause, and the greatest nation in the world will demand with us the revision of the Trianon treaty.</p>
   <p>Brethren! On June 23, let us all think of mutilated Hungary, of Trianon, of the terrible curse that is on the Magyars, and let God be with us.</p>
   <p>The N F A H Council.....</p>
