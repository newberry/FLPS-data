   <p>Perhaps it would not be uninteresting to dwell a little on the subject of the Hungarian theater in America now when everyone feels so uncertain about the future. Day after day old firms and banks are running into bankruptcy. It cannot be denied that in these troubled times the Hungarian-American theater is like a lost soul, because our people need their money for food and clothing and cannot think of expensive diversion.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, the Hungarian-American public that patronizes the theater has been often disappointed with the performances of our professional actors. For this can be advanced the excuse of their lack of organization, the inconvenience of traveling from place to place, and the lack of technical advantages.</p>

   <p>We can hardly wonder at the failure of the Hungarian-American theater if we consider that even on Broadway--the hub of theatrical activity--three fourths of the theaters are closed.....</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, the theater is a necessity. Certain groups and nationalities have solved this problem according to their temperament. In ancient Rome, "Bread and Circus" was the slogan of the people.....The theater followed the era of the circus and now, in the twentieth century, nations vie with each other in the production of colossal plays. We note with quite a bit of pride that in this race the cultured Hungary is among the foremost.....</p>
   <p>The practical solution to the problem of developing a successful Hungarian-American theater lies in finding a way to give good performances at lower admission prices. If it can compete with low-priced cinemas, the Hungarian public will support the theater.</p>
   <p>The theatrical company of Jeno Endrey will present the "Homely Girl" Sunday <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>at the Turner Hall at a fifty-cent admission price.</p>
   <p>This is the first step to successful performances, because those days when one-dollar-fifty-cent and two-dollar admission prices were charged are gone.....</p>
