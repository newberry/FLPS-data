   <p>p.4..................Studying the other nationalities in the United States and their love for their mother country, we come to the conclusion that the Hungarians -compared with other nationalities - are progressing in a Negative direction.</p>
   <p>Looking for the cause, in almost every instance we are confronted with the answer that they didn't get anything from the mother country and that their indifference is justified.</p>
   <p>Nationalities far inferior to us in every way donate millions for foundations, knowing that this is the only way they can preserve their national customs in another country.</p>
   <p>What did the mother country give the Sicilian? Still he longs to go back, knowing that he would have to contend with the same poor conditions. He dosen't ask "What did my country do for me?" because he knows that love of country is a divine feeling which is in the heart.</p>

   <p>Only among the Hungarians do we find in great numbers, people who demand material instead of spiritual benefits from the Homeland. We quote a well-known author, who said, "The citizens is for his country - not the country for the citizen." This author says that those nations who didn't feel this way, fell prey to their enemies and in a short while were completely destroyed.</p>
   <p>Ninety per cent of the emigrants left the country of their birth, because of living conditions, but they still love their country and teach their children to honor it. The best example of this are the Irish. Their fathers were born here, but still on St. Patrick's day they proudly wear the shamrock.</p>
   <p>How long will our indifference last and how long will we be the black sheep among the nations?</p>
