   <p>p.24.................The Hungarian Csardas Group of Chicago consists of sixteen girls, all of Hungarian descent. They have danced at many Hungarian affairs during the past year. Most of these girls were members of the group that danced at the first Carnival of Nations program in the fall of 1931 and again in 1932, in the second Carnival of Nations. They were organized as a permanent group by Mr. Delbert Chute at the beginning of 1933. He was very fortunate in obtaining the assistance first of Mr. Gustave Woytas and later of Mme. Antoinette Ludwig, who has most generously given of her time and experience in teaching the girls the technique of ballet and in creating dances for presentation purposes. Mme. Ludwig is one of the finest teachers of the dance in America, having been with the Berlin Royal Opera, the Metropolitan Opera of New York and the Chicago Opera.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chute, the musical director is known among Hungarian circles of Chicago, owing to many Hungarian friends and his own interest in Hungarian music. He also teaches piano and voice in the Chicago Conservatory.</p>
   
   <p>The Csardas Group was the outstanding feature of the Magyar Day program at the World's Fair last summer and was selected to represent Hungary on the program of all nations, for which it received a silver cup from the exposition authorities as a trophy.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chute hopes eventually, to develop the group into a singing ensemble as well as a dancing group to specialize in Hungarian material.</p>
   <p>It is hoped, that the group will present a dance program in a down-town theater in the near future.</p>
