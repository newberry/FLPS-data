   <p>p.11................God give us wine, wheat and peace! One of the main conditions and laws of life is growth, development. This applies not only to nature, but also to the social and economic institutions. The moment anything living ceases to move forward, it stagnates and begins degenerating and finally dies.</p>
   <p>We see, that social systems, that do not progress become static and perish almost over night. Institutions, in which the driving forces of development, and the will to live have ceased, inevitably fail.</p>
   <p>It is scarcely a year and a half, since a new idea appeared in the ranks of the Chicago Hungarians, or rather within some of the Hungarian associations; the idea of a federation of the Hungarian associations. The associations felt keenly that in order <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to achieve something in the interest of the Hungarians, to make themselves known, they must get together, co-operate. This Federation did live through its infancy, but now it has a duty to develop itself, to grow into an institution which can serve the interests of the Hungarians of Chicago. It is necessary that all those associations, which did not join, should do so now, and that the basic-idea, on which this Federation was created, and which is now insufficient, should be further developed. If we want to serve the Hungarians and their different associations, we have to participate in the conduct of their affairs. We should consider not only their material and social well-being, but also the development of their body and mind. If we look at the activities of the various nationalities, do we see anything Hungarian on the arena of public life? Do the Hungarians have anybody in a leading position who could serve as a mouthpiece of the Hungarian interests? Why is it, that every nation has some sons in the general public political field except the Hungarians? Because all the other nationalities support their co-nationals. The Federation does not need to participate in politics, but is should use every means, grab every possible opportunity, to serve Hungarian interests.</p>

   <p>Propaganda comes second in importance. We have to use the press and the radio. We should advertize the good qualities of the Hungarians, thus strenghtening the brotherly love and understanding. We have to uphold the pride of our national origin. We can be and we are good Americans, but we do not have to forget our national origin. For the guarding of this pride of our national origin among the young, the best procedure would be the formation of Hungarian Sport Clubs. We should promote and support the Hungarian Sports. Why could we not have a proper gymnasium , swimming pool and open field for the Hungarian youth of Chicago?</p>
   <p>Why should it not be possible for the Federation to maintain, during the depression, and employment office, where both the employers and the jobless could come with full confidence and which would be entirely free for both? There are often cases, when the associations or some of their members need legal counsels. There should be a Legal Department of the Federation, with a Lawyer at its head, to which those in need could turn for legal aid.</p>
   <p>We could continue mentioning all kinds of social and economic institutions needed for our Hungarian brethren, but we should also remember the needs of their body. We <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>should organize a department of health and hospitalization in order to assist our members in case of sickness. We should aid in lengthening the lives of our members by providing them with periodical medical examinations. Briefly, we have to develop the Federation to an independent organization, the members of which would have all kinds of benefits.</p>
   <p>Certainly, to attain this goal the Federation needs money, but this money is easily obtainable even in these days of depression. The main thing is reciprocal confidence, co-operation and the will to do it. There is no need for lengthy discussions and debates, only deeds count. And if we do as told above, we should enjoy a success, which will advantageously reflect not only on the members alone, but will be to the glory of all the Chicago Hungarians, and then: God has given Wine, Wheat and Peace!</p>
