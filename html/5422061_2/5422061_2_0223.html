   <p>The Hungarian people should anticipate a pleasant surprise on October 31, when a Hungarian playlet will be presented. Two new Hungarian operettas will be given. The presentation will take place in the Aryon Groth temple, Eighth Street and Wabash Avenue under the management and direction of Emil Erdelyi, while Stephen Kautz will have charge of the music. It goes without saying that whenever these two men are associated together in the production of plays or operettas, success usually crowns their efforts.</p>
   <p>The cast of characters has been carefully selected; each one being well fitted for the role to which they are assigned.</p>
   <p>All persons who enjoy real culture should purchase tickets immediately in order to see the performance, thus avoiding disappointment.</p>
