   <p>The war was a source of inspiration to many artists. Among them was a Hungarian painter, whose paintings reveal the influence of the war. Bela Ormio, a Hungarian artist who lives in Chicago, has been working for the past two years on his war pictures. He has now placed those pictures on exhibition at the Aeolian Hall, 118 South Michigan Avenue.</p>
   <p>The five pictures all deal with war subjects. The first is a picture revealing the message of war. The second shows the dissolution of the family group. The third shows the horrors of war. The fourth shows the aftereffects of war, and the fifth is a moralist painting portraying the effects of war on human morals.</p>
   <p>This Hungarian artist has not only gained recognition for himself, but has brought recognition to the Hungarian people as a whole.</p>
   <p>These pictures have been seen by many of the greatest artists in Chicago, who <span class="page-break">2</span>have praised them highly. We trust that all the Hungarians will see this art exhibition by a Chicago Hungarian artist.</p>
