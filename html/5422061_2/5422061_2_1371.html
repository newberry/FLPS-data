   <p>The Rakoczy Sick Benefit Society, which has more than 16,000 members has just concluded its convention, which is held once every four years.</p>
   <p>Never before since its beginning were there more important matters to settle.</p>
   <p>The convention has put an end once and for all to bolshevik "boring from within" tactics with which they worked to ruin this organization. One or two red agitators even dared to be present at the convention, but outside of empty mud slinging, they couldn't do their destructive work.</p>
   <p>This victory over the bolsheviks should not satisfy anyone and make us think that they won't try to undermine all decent undertakings. It is therefore advisible for all organizations to be careful.</p>
