   <p>The Hungarians received a gift this month from an unexpected source. The National Geographic Magazine, one of the foremost periodicals of America, has made its June issue a Hungarian one. It contains three articles about Hungary, and sixty-five Hungarian illustrations, of which twenty-seven colored. Anyone who sees these pictures, will admit that nothing like them ever appeared in an American magazine about Hungary.</p>
   <p>The magazine is a little bit expensive, costing fifty cents a copy, but to us Hungarians it is worth much more. Hungarian parents can't give a better thing to their children than this magazine, which is so thick it is almost like a book. The Hungarian parent should not only talk about Hungary, but show something of its beauty. The ideal way to do this, is to show the children this magazine, with its pictures of the cities, villages, the harvesting, and life on the plains.</p>

   <p>Our churches and schools should get these magazines for their Hungarian summer school children.</p>
