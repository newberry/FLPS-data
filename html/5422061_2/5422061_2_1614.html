   <p>Little by little it is becoming clear what is awaiting the Magyar-American who plans to return to Hungary.</p>
   <p>At last the text of the Land Purchase Bill has been drawn up, after long deliberation, but the date of its being put into effect is still unknown. We are interested in the fact that the landless Magyars living in America were entirely ignored when the bill was drawn up. The healthy agricultural life was the only thing that could draw the Magyar-American back to his native country. The Magyar-Americans would be more inclined to return to Hungary if they were certain that the government of their native country wanted to make the purchase of Hungarian land easier for the returning Magyars, so that the big landowners could no longer take their hard-earned money away.</p>
   <p>But the price of land in Hungary is higher than in the United States, even if the price were paid in dollars. The taxes, assessments, requisitions, and <span class="page-break">\2</span>property redemptions are so heavy that the farm earnings, on some pretext or other, have to be handed in to the state treasury.</p>
   <p>These disappointing conditions are awaiting everyone who has been dreaming about Hungarian land, while he is toiling for his money and saving it in the hope of a better future.</p>
   <p>Recently, a Reception Committee was organized in Budapest to save the returning Magyar-Americans from exploiters and swindlers. This committee is to meet the Magyar-Americans at the eastern depot in Budapest. We read in a cable of last week that the Reception Committee is carefully watching for the returning Magyar-Americans....The communication says that two Magyar-Americans were lured by impostors from the depot into a nearby forest, where they were robbed of their money and killed. Any emigrant to Hungary may expect a similar reception.</p>
   <p>We mentioned in our issue of February 4 the horrible war reparations imposed by the Supreme Council of the Allies. For forty-two years, a certain percentage <span class="page-break">\3</span>of every German workingman's pay will be appropriated for war reparations. A German expert has calculated that every German workingman is compelled to work fourteen hours daily to make it possible for the country to pay off the war reparations.</p>
   <p>Hungary, in spite of the territorial losses imposed on her, cannot avoid the war reparations either. As soon as the Allies finish with Germany, they will deal with Austria-Hungary. The Allies will not spare her either, and we are afraid that they will deal more mercilessly with Hungary than they have with Germany.</p>
   <p>Hungary has hardly any gold. According to the present value of the korona, she does not possess even one gram of gold, and the German mark is eight to nine times higher than the Hungarian korona on the exchange market.</p>
   <p>No matter how small an amount the Allies fix as a war debt for Hungary, it will be so burdensome that every Hungarian workingman, through a whole generation, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and perhaps through a whole century, will groan under the burden.</p>
   <p>Every Magyar who is preparing to return to Hungary should realize that he and his children must work for years to liquidate the war debt, if he wants to live in Hungary. Therefore, it is much wiser to wait here in this country until circumstances change. Then we will be able to help our loved ones come to this country.</p>
