   <p>The World's Fair had the contest among nations on Monday and Wednesday.</p>
   <p>After the Monday evening program, the Hungarian participants, who danced the national group dance, were awarded the Stroller Medal.</p>
   <p>Wednesday evening, the Hungarian group won second prize with their national costumes. The Ford Company gave the members of the group Ford Medals.</p>
   <p>Now that the World's Fair is over, we have to commend the unselfish work, in behalf of the Hungarian cause, of Mrs. Dennis Gyorke and Mrs. Rose G. Carroll.</p>
