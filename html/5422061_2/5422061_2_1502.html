   <p>Since Rev. Eugene Boros has taken over the three Hungarian Reformed Churches of Chicago which are located on the West side, South Chicago and Burnside, there has been new life poured into the religious activities of the Hungarian people of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The three congregations have developed to such an extent that Rev. Boros has found that it was impossible for him to take care of them all, and therefore he has resigned from the South Chicago and the West Side Hungarian churches.</p>
   <p>The West Side church elected Rev. Julius Hanko of Columbus, Ohio for their pastor, while the South Chicago church elected Rev. Gero Garay as their pastor. Both pastors accepted the invitations.</p>
