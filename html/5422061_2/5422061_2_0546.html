   <p>In the Hungarian Daily News we find that the Swedish consul in Chicago, who is the representative of Hungarian interests here, has had published an announcement in which he asks for the address of a certain Hungarian family which is supposed to be living in Chicago or in its vicinity. The article requests this family either to send to the consul their address or to present themselves at his office. We need not add that articles of this nature originate, generally, in our native land, where some member of a family is seeking lost relatives.</p>
   <p>It is completely in order that the article should have appeared in the Hungarian Daily News, for this paper is read by Hungarians in Chicago and its suburbs. Why it did not also appear in the Nepszava and the Elore, Hungarian papers which are likewise read by Hungarians in Chicago and its suburbs, is something that we can not worry about. Let them worry about it.</p>
   <p>But as to why this article or advertisement did not appear in the Magyar Tribune of Chicago, which is in fact the only Hungarian paper in this city published weekly--we certainly have some opinions to express regarding this discourtesy!</p>
   <p>There are two points that we wish to make clear before we express ourselves on this matter. The first is that in this discussion we make no personal reference to any one. We do not know the Swedish consul, nor do we know the person in charge of Hungarian interests. We have no ill feeling against them personally. It is only that their actions toward us were scandalous. The second point to be made clear is that though we live in a material world, in this case the amount of the price of the advertisement is absolutely of no interest to us. We do not know whether they paid for this advertisement or not. If they did pay for it, we know that the sum does not amount to such a figure as to be worth mentioning in an article of this size. For the cost of writing this article is much higher than the cost of those small advertisements which consuls are accustomed to have printed.</p>
   <p>Our article is not written for business reasons but from the standpoint of fundamental principles. From the standpoint of fundamental principles, in Chicago and its suburbs, the Magyar Tribune cannot and must not be overlooked or ignored.</p>
   <p>Those who wish to serve the interests of the Hungarians in Chicago and its suburbs must take advantage of our paper and not ignore its large circulation. Do not think for a moment that we are conceited, or have dominating instincts or wish to be dramatic in this pronouncement. We are the sincere guardians of Hungarian interests, the reporters of opinion, the mouthpiece of our native land, and the news agency of the Hungarians in Chicago and its suburbs. For six years we have served without relaxing our efforts and with patient loyalty.</p>
   <p>There were times when others made efforts with pen and paper to maintain a newspaper, and while we went through fire and withstood many trials and tribulations, they simply gave up and went out of business. Now we are alone, and our existence can be stopped only by dirty politics. Those who believe that they can ignore the Magyar Tribune in Chicago and suburbs by playing dirty politics are gravely mistaken.</p>
   <p>If the consul, because of dirty politics, does not notice us, then he not only is playing poor politics but is also guilty of sin. This sin caused the writing of this discussion. The sin is committed against those poor people in our native land who are patiently awaiting signs of life from these relatives of theirs who live in Chicago and its suburbs and desire to initiate closer relationships. The sin is also against those that live here and wish to communicate with those who are looking for them.</p>
   <p>Now then, without any question, our paper, the Magyar Tribune, is the most highly developed Hungarian paper existing in the Chicago area and the paper most widely circulated and most widely read, among the Hungarians. This we write not as an advertisement but simply as a matter of fact. Consider, if you please, the three Hungarian papers issued daily, the Szabadsag, the Nepszava, and the Elore. The total subscriptions of these three papers for Chicago and its suburbs, we are certain, is doubled by our list of subscribers. This fact gives us the right to feel proud, and we do not say this to soothe our wounded pride but to prove how ill the interests of Hungarians are represented by the Swedish consul.</p>
   <p>He who contemplates doing business with Budapest or with Szeged must consider which city has the larger population; he must not play politics. Szeged may be wealthier, healthier, more virtuous, more Hungarian than Budapest, but Budapest is the capital of the country and has the largest population of Hungarian cities. This is a fact, and here all discrimination stops, and all arguments end. This is how we stand compared with the Hungarian Daily News. We agree that the Hungarian Daily News is an older paper, is much wealthier, is issued oftener, is well known, and has a better income; but--in Chicago and its suburbs--the Magyar Tribune is the largest and most influential paper. Those who wish to send a message to all the Hungarians in Chicago and suburbs in the surest way can do it through our paper. This is the fact and the truth. Here end all arguments and all partiality. This is an axiom.</p>
   <p>If the consul is looking for Hungarians in Chicago and its suburbs, then it is, without the remotest doubt, his duty to seek them through our columns. He can seek them elsewhere, also; we have no quarrel with that; but he must take advantage of our columns without fail. First of all, he owes it, to those who entrusted to him the job of finding their lost relatives to do this. Secondly, he owes it to those whom he seeks to give them this great advantage, for those people most certainly are readers of the Magyar Tribune. Thirdly, perhaps he owes it to us, who are loyally serving the interests of the Hungarians better than any consul or other official is representing them.</p>
   
   <p>This would be the smartest procedure from the business standpoint and would be playing smart politics. Or do we still stand where we stood at the beginning, on the assumption, that, smart actions are not to be expected by Hungarians of their consulate?</p>
