   <p>Of late we have been reading--and writing, too-articles on how we ought to unite in order to help the jobless Hungarians. The Hungarian press has done its duty in bringing all Hungarians together--that is its job.</p>
   <p>The noble group who has taken on its shoulders the promotion of this movement has begun its work, and the result of its efforts will be felt in the near future. But all by themselves, the members of this small group are unable to solve the immense problem that looms ahead, unless all Hungarians come to their aid. The duty of all Hungarians is to support this group in its endeavor to aid our jobless countrymen, so that the approaching winter will find not even one of our brethren suffering from cold or hunger. Let us give the lie to that well-known proverb: Full stomachs do not feel the suffering of empty ones.</p>
