   <p>The editor of the Banyaszlap (Miners' Journal) discusses a problem of general interest, saying there is an obvious difference between the old immigrant and the new, a difference which leads to their misunderstanding each other.....</p>
   <p>Fay Fischer, the editor in question, came to this country during the postwar period and he pours out his own grievances.</p>
   <p>Since the war many people have occupied themselves with this problem. Naturally, everyone maintains his own viewpoint. We, too, maintain ours.</p>
   <p>The new immigrant, jokingly called a "greenhorn," has to bear the burden of the "green" years and the stamp of unripeness until the process of <span class="page-break">\2</span>assimilation--the acceptance of American customs--enables him to become as well Americanized as the old-timer.</p>
   <p>We have noticed that a greenhorn, after being here for a while, is the first one to criticize newer immigrants, their mistakes and appearance--the very same things held against him before he became an old-timer. This is how assimilation took place before the World War. The war, however, checked this normal procedure of assimilation.</p>
   <p>During the World War no Hungarian immigrants came to the United States, and as a result there were no greenhorns and the foreign element in America, including the Hungarians, became more uniform.</p>
   <p>The gap was filled by our lengthy isolation in America, our dependence upon each other, and the great melting pot that American life is.</p>
   <p>The life of the postwar immigrant is presumably as difficult as that of the prewar immigrant.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>However, the old-timers know that those who came to the United States after the World War have had a much easier, smoother road to travel than those who came fifteen, twenty, and thirty years ago. The work of pioneering and the grievous hardships of the beginning were already accomplished by the old-timers. Furthermore, the immigrants' social, economic, and political standing became fixed to such a degree that the unnatural difficulties, unreasonable prejudices and obstacles confronting the old-timers have been almost eradicated.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we must admit that, due to the privations they suffered during the war, the immigrants who came here after the World War are more sensitive, determined, ambitious, self-conscious, and even more greedy than the old-timers.</p>
   <p>The direct cause of the present complaint comes from the Hungarian intellectuals. After the war more intellectual workers came to America than before, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and their quest for suitable employment gave rise to no small amount of friction, often among the newcomers themselves.</p>
   <p>Neither the United States nor the American Hungarians could absorb this influx of intellectuals fast enough, since this is not a fertile ground for them.</p>
   <p>This country, after all, is only a self-contained young giant, where pressure is centered on industrial, commercial, and agricultural production. The high proportion of intellectual workers in such an environment upsets the equilibrium and results in an absorption rate smaller than that of prewar times.</p>
   <p>The complaint of the intellectual, whether he is prospering or not, is justified when he says that he is not satisfied with America, his American relatives, or his newly found friends. After all, the distance from Budapest to America is not a short one.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>We like these so-called "greenhorns" in theory and in practice....</p>
   <p>We, too, were grateful for a helping hand from the old-timers when we were "green".....</p>
   <p>These new immigrants are starting a new life here just as we did at the time of our arrival and we must help them.....</p>
