   <p>Last Sunday afternoon, February 2, the Thalia Literary and Song Society held its regular quarterly meeting, in which practically all the members were present. After the secretary, the treasurer, and the different committees made their reports, many important topics were discussed, topics which in all probability will elevate the position of the organization and help it branch out further in Chicago.</p>
   <p>One of the important topics--which later became a resolution--was the establishment of a library by the organization, which, with its classes in the different literary arts, will be greatly benefited by this addition. At the same time the society announced that the members of the small group attending these classes are showing a great stride forward due to their energetic and wholehearted work.</p>
   <p>A resolution was made that all Hungarian sick benefit organizations be asked to send people to this association, in order that a large male choir may be formed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The purpose of this choir would be to attend the funerals of the members of the different organizations having representatives in the choir.</p>
   <p>Another resolution was passed to the effect that, through the membership of the choir, different organizations should keep in touch with each other, thereby avoiding the possibility of two or more programs being given on the same day by different organizations.</p>
