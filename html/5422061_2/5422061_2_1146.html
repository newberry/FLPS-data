   <p>We should not delude ourselves in the belief that the management of our Hungarian associations will be successfully continued in the hands of our Hungarian second generation. For the last several years we have been stressing the necessity of attracting our young Hungarians to our associations, but if we attain as much success in the future as we have attained until now, our efforts will be in vain.</p>
   <p>It is useless to cry over the mistake we made several years ago, when we failed to turn our eyes to the youth, when we not only did not take them into our associations but even excluded them from our midst. All this crying now will not help us any.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>There is only one remedy for this, and it is that we should get busy on the work of attracting the youth to our associations. This work was begun some years ago, but we have to do this task with more willingness, diligence, and understanding.</p>
   <p>Those who have attentively followed the work of our associations will find that the latter, especially in the case of large institutions, are still headed by the same old Hungarians who were there twenty or thirty years ago. Sometimes there is a change here and there, but generally we can see nobody but old Hungarians as heads of our institutions.</p>
   <p>This certainly is not a healthy condition. Who will lead these Hungarian associations after these old Hungarians are dead? Who will take care of Hungarian interests, the worth of which by now we estimate at millions of dollars? Who will continue to stand for the good reputation, the good name, and the institutions of the Hungarians who were torn from Hungary and who are now Americans? These are questions to which the answers <span class="page-break">\3</span>must be given quickly, as it might be too late in a decade, and it certainly will be too late in two decades.</p>
   <p>What we failed to do in the past, we have to do now and do it quickly. We must attract the youth to our midst and hand over to it the work and responsibility now in the hands of our old Hungarians.</p>
   <p>Besides our own aloofness, another reason why our young generation stands so apart from us is that the Hungarian associations are not organized like the American ones. Though our associations satisfy our expectations and our conceptions, they do not comply with the ideas of the American-born younger generation. We cannot deny the fact that, even ten years ago, our associations were so primitive that they could not stand the competition of American institutions. The young Hungarians knew this, and therefore it is not to be wondered that they did not attach themselves to our associations but rather preferred the greater American institutions instead.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>But now the situation is not the same. The Hungarian associations are more up to date. Our youth can now find in the Hungarian associations everything the American institutions are offering. What is more, even the greatest insurance companies do not offer more than our greater associations are offering. This fact we now have to bring to the attention of our younger Hungarians, as they themselves do not care much about that. It is in the interest of the older Hungarians that the youth know about this, that it join us, that it take over our work. Naturally, we too have to relax on our old customs and conceptions, or otherwise we would block all intercourse with the youth. We old ones will never be entirely assimilated but our young generation is, since it goes here to school and is reared in the spirit of this country. They will have an easier task in managing our associations in the American way than we older ones had.</p>
   <p>Now is the time to think this over, because now we have the chance to make a choice, since the elections of officers in different associations is close at hand. We have not only to organize the youth into our institutions <span class="page-break">\5</span>but to put them to work in our organizations as well, even against their will, against their hesitancy.</p>
   <p>We can see that in many places Hungarian administrators from sixty to seventy years old are taking care of the interests of much more younger members. Many of these old men do this work out of good will or just because they are used to it--many, again, for the simple reason that if they step aside there will be nobody who would do the work.</p>
   <p>That is by no means in order. However much the old Hungarian may love his association, and however much good will is prompting him to serve it, he must realize that he cannot do his work as efficiently as a younger man. With this in mind, he should step aside and make room for the younger people. And where the old are working because there are no young ones to do the work, in this case the young ones should be ashamed of themselves, as it is not fair that old men should work for the benefit of the younger ones.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Further, the young Hungarians should be told that these Hungarian associations, which they have slighted, are for their benefit, as the money which these associations pay when the old men die will not be buried with them but will be handed to their heirs. And if the youth is only too willing to accept help from the Hungarian associations, it is only reasonable to expect from it to do something in return for them.</p>
   <p>From whatever point of view we look at this question, and in whatever form we express ourselves,the time is ripe to make room for the younger generation in the management of our associations, as this is in the interest of both the old and the young.</p>
   <p>With the month of December, the elections of officials started among our associations. The destiny of an association depends on its officials. If the officials are good, the business of the association is good, which rule we have experienced for the past decades. Diligent, conscientious officials, unshaken in their Hungarian feelings, always bring prosperity and new blood <span class="page-break">\7</span>into an association. Where the officials are of this type, the association lives and the members work and conquer all dangers, even in such times as those of last year.</p>
   <p>Our associations were in good hands this year. Experienced conscientious, efficient officials were managing them. We came through the year without any mishap or shock, and now the time is to think on the future. We cannot afford to elect officials in a hasty and superficial way. We have to consider many things this time, as the years become more and more difficult for the associations.</p>
   <p>We consider it our duty to remind the members of the associations that, as with almost all of our institutions, the foundation for success lies on the idea of our Hungarian brotherhood. It is this fraternal link that holds together our institutions even today. If we disassociate this brotherhood from any of our institutions, whichever it may be, the latter collapses. When electing new officials, first of all we have to judge <span class="page-break">\8</span>whether they are fit to keep the association together, and whether they are able to keep it Hungarian, for, no matter how prosperous the association may be, if its Hungarian foundation collapses, the need for its existence ceases.</p>
   <p>By this time we know each other quite well. We also know those in whose care we trust the fate of our associations. Therefore, let us elect for officials only those who are men enough to do this work fittingly.</p>
   <p>There is something else to which we have to call the attention of the members of our associations: it is not enough to elect good officials unless the members support them, for no official, however fit, can attain any success all by himself. Even the greatest military genius would lose a battle if the soldiers don't do their duty.</p>
   <p>It is a malady of long standing in the lives of our associations that some members of the minorities, when their candidates are defeated, not only <span class="page-break">\9</span>refuse to support the elected ones but do everything in their power to hinder them in their duties, so that the official be unable to accomplish his work successfully. Unfortunately these dissatisfied members fail to realize that by hindering the work of their officials they are working against their own interests, for, if the association does not prosper, their own interests suffer. In the first place we have to get rid of this cancer in the life of our associations, and to restore to them the unselfish brotherly love which is the foundation of all our institutions. Once that is done, the officials will be able to fulfill their obligations and succeed in developing the associations to the joy and full satisfaction of the members.</p>
