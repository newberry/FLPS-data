   <p>It is very important that those of us who are living in this country realize that the nation which has provided a haven of freedom and has freed those who have been oppressed in other countries, shall be adequately protected. This nation unlike any other nation was organized by immigrants, and the Hungarians have taken a big part in the development of this nation.</p>
   <p>We must realize that conditions provided for the working man in this country are so much better than the conditions in other countries that they cannot be compared.</p>
   <p>This nation pays a fair wage to the worker. A machinist gets a very good wage, but so does the ordinary working man.</p>
   <p>Housing conditions are excellent. In Chicago the industries are much further advanced than in any other city in the world.</p>

   <p>The industrialists are forever trying to improve conditions for the workers, both mentally and physically. The people that provide the work are forever striving to make life so much easier and more comfortable; they try to promote thrift among the workers. The industrialist has done a great deal to make life easier and finer for the workers. In other words, they want to prove to the worker that they are true friends.</p>
   <p>Those men working in industries located in Chicago and vicinity are almost considered as members of the family to whom the industry belongs.</p>
   <p>The employer always takes care of the worker who faithfully performs his duty. Those employees who stay faithful find no trouble in getting ahead.</p>
   <p>There,of course,is the worker who is never satisfied. He becomes a detriment to his fellow,worker and employer. He himself becomes a stumbling block in his path to success, and in time this man becomes a load for society to carry.</p>

   <p>You should be loyal to this country. You should keep the interest of this country at heart; the interest of your employer is your interest. His success is yours and if you keep these things in mind you will be assured of work in these great United States.</p>
