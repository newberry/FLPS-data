   <p>The Stolen Bride, American film with Hungarian background,was shown at one of the largest theaters this week. The management of the theater stressed the point that the story of the picture takes place in Hungary, no doubt,taking into consideration the many Hungarians living in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Much to our sorrow, we came to the conclusion that such films as this are not a credit to the Hungarians. We do not blame the theater nor the film company, but we do condemn the author.</p>
   <p>There are quite a number of Hungarian writers in Hollywood working for the big studios, but whoever the author of the "Stolen Bride" may be, he put money-making possiblities before art.</p>
   
   <p>We don't expect literary masterpieces from the movies, although several novels have been adapted for the screen. We do expect, however, that an author who calls himself Hungarian should not arrange contrasts, deliberately casting shadows. An author, the aristocrat among intellectuals, should bear in mind the theory of "noblesse oblige."</p>
   <p>We cannot find excuses for the author on the grounds that he is inexperienced, because he very expertly contrived to make every detail of his story effect the audience in a way to make them hate the country where it was enacted. The writer depicts the country as semi-civilized and uncultured.</p>
   <p>The trade marks "Tsikos," "Goulash" and "Paprika," fairly yell at one, diluted with a sentimental love story.</p>
   <p>If Pospischill, a Czech writer, would have written this as anti-Hungarian propoganda, we could understand it; but in this case we agree with the strict Hungarian criticism, which distinguishes between an Hungarian writer and one who writes Hungarian.</p>
   
   <p>It is not enough to be able to write in the language of the country of our birth; we must absorb, understand and digest its history and traditions.Only with this background and proper knowledge may anyone criticize, that is,only those who possess our culture are in a position to pass judgment.</p>
