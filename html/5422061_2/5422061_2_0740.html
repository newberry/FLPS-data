   <p>The article appearing in Ferenc Gondor's political weekly newspaper [not a Chicago paper] came at an opportune time. It happens that we had been repeatedly requested to write about this coming national event [the unveiling of Kossuth's statue].</p>
   <p>What we have to say about the unveiling of the statue of Kossuth, we will say with our customary sincerity and bearing in mind Gondor's comments.</p>
   <p>It had been decided to unveil the statue of Kossuth on March 15, in New York. ....It was not difficult for the Amerikai Magyar Nepszava (American Hungarian People's Voice)....to collect more than thirty thousand dollars in a year and a half for this monument.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The glorious, historical name of Kossuth, his lasting achievements, his legendary, outstanding personality, cannot be obliterated in the minds of the Hungarian people, although attacks are being made on Geza D. Berko (owner and publisher of Amerikai Magyar Nepszava), who fostered the idea of Kossuth's statue.....</p>
   <p>One of the objections to Berko, meaning the Amerikai Magyar Nepszava, is that he is conducting the affair very domestically.....</p>
   <p>We do not resent this. We think it is natural. We were not indignant even when there was no competitive bidding as to who should build the base of the statue. It would not surprise us even if, instead of the revolutionist, Habsburg-dethroner Kossuth, the sculptor, John Horvay, would immortalize someone else.</p>
   <p>A conservative newspaper like the Amerikai Magyar Nepszava and the Kossuth Statue Committee dread the usual democratic business procedure of advertising for bidders. They took care of this little matter of expending <span class="page-break">3</span>fifteen or twenty thousand dollars for the building of the base of the statue and the landscaping of the grounds around it in their own inner circle.....</p>
   <p>We believe that the American-Hungarians will have a beautiful celebration on March 15, at the unveiling of the statue of Kossuth in New York. Anyone disturbing the solemnity of this occasion is a boor and unworthy of being called a Hungarian. The prestige of all American-Hungarians is lowered by any untoward demonstration during a great national celebration like this. There are other methods of demonstrating disapproval than by disturbing the peace of this celebration.</p>
   <p>We recommend to the patriotic churches and societies of Chicago and vicinity to make adequate preparations so that they will be represented fittingly at the unveiling ceremony. We owe this much to the memory of Kossuth.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Those who have not yet contributed anything to the fund for the erection of the statue of Kossuth should not hesitate or delay any longer, but should send their share immediately. We are not supporting the committee with our contributions, but are insuring the completion of the monument. He who has respect for the name and ideals of Kossuth will not shrink from bringing a small sacrifice.....</p>
   <p>It is a moral advantage to all American-Hungarians to have had such a world-renowned stateman as Louis Kossuth and that we are erecting a monument to him.....</p>
   <p>Let us not forget that Berko and his ilk will pass away in time, but this statue will stand and live long after, and we can gather around it whenever we wish. Neither the American nor the Hungarian reactionaries can stop our enthusiasm for the dethroner of the Habsburgs, the liberator of the peasants, the flag-bearer of freedom, of equality and brotherly love--the republican Louis Kossuth.</p>
