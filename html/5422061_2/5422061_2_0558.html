   <p>This newspaper is a new publication, although the people of Chicago have heard something about it. After it is read the first time it will have become a true friend and neighbor to all who feel that they are Hungarians.</p>
   <p>The Magyar Tribune is two years old, formerly it has been known as, A Nep, and we are going to adhere to the same principles that the original newspaper followed, and that was, to help the Hungarians in their aims and purposes, help them become educated to the modes of this country.</p>
   <p>The small newspaper formerly known as, A Nep was too small to represent the great Hungarian population of Chicago. The Hungarian population of Chicago deserves just as much recognition from the press as the other nationalities have received.</p>

   <p>We call our readers' attention to the fact that we will write about the different happenings in Hungary, but our American political viewpoints shall be governed by the belief of our readers, we will remain independent of any profiteering or religious organizations, but at the same time we want our readers to know that we are not opposing any of them.</p>
   <p>From now on we will stick to the above platform and we will be at the service of all our readers; we will present the viewpoints of our readers, whether it pertains to religion, politics organizations, or any news item pertaining to the interest of Hungarians living in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Our doctors, lawyers, and other professional friends will always be ready to help our subscribers.</p>
   <p>We the publishers trust that this much larger and better paper will be met by the Hungarians of Chicago with high acclaim.</p>
   <p>The Editors of Magyar Tribune.</p>
