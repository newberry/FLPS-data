   <p>Laszlo Kaczander, famous long distance walker, who set up a world record by walking from New York to Los Angeles in sixty days, will leave Chicago on Dec. 21.</p>
   <p>Mayor Cermak will give him a letter to the Mayor of New York.</p>
   <p>Police Chief Allman will give him motorcycle escort to the outskirts of the city.</p>
   <p>It is too bad that the Hungarians are quite indifferent toward Kaczander's achievement, because it is only complimentary to us that a sportsman, who sets up a world record, proudly states that he is one of us.</p>
   <p>It would be a nice gesture to have as many Hungarians at City Hall as possible to wish Kaczander luck in his difficult venture.</p>
