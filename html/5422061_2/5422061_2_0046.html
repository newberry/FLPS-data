   <p>After participating in the unsuccessful fight for Hungarian liberty, the father of Dr. Arpad Barothy emigrated to America. He settled in Iowa, where he became a farmer. He offered his services to his adopted country during the Civil War, and acquitted himself with honor.</p>
   <p>His son Arpad is a native-born American, and has travelled extensively throughout the United States. When Dr. Arpad Barothy was nineteen years of age, he visited his father's homeland. The memory of that visit will live with him until his dying day.</p>
   <p>Young Arpad selected the medical profession as his life career. He was a pioneer in the development of electrical therapy, and became one of the best known doctors in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Dr. Arpad Barothy is a staunch advocate of farm development. He believes <span class="page-break">\2</span>that every man should have a certain amount of land to which he can retire when he becomes too old to work and where he can make his own living for the remainder of his days. Doctor Barothy owns large farms in Michigan, and he plans to buy a large tract of lend in Florida in the near future.</p>
   <p>Doctor Barothy is a true Hungarian. He is a tireless fighter for the truth, and he is a modest and good-hearted individual. He has performed a countless number of good deeds among both Hungarians and Americans. He is greatly interested in art, music, literature, and the theater. There has hardly been a Hungarian visitor to Chicago who has not enjoyed the hospitality of Doctor Barothy's home.</p>
   <p>He was president of the Hungarian-American Federation. During the World War, he was a leader in the western division of the Loyalty League. He is honorary president of the Chicago Hungarian University Club. He is also a member of many American societies. There is hardly a Hungarian activity that he is not interested in and for which he does not work untiringly.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Doctor Barothy's home is located near the lake front. He owns many works of art by celebrated painters and sculptors, which are famous throughout the world.</p>
   <p>His wife is a well-educated American. Her interests are centered in social work and literary activities. They have two children, both boys, who embody the true Hungarian ideal of manhood.</p>
   <p>[Translators note.- Doctor Barothy is still active in the field of medicine in Chicago. He is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, Hungarian residents of Chicago. He is still active in all Hungarian functions, and is an authority on Hungarian history in Chicago.]</p>
