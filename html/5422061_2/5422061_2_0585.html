   <p>The Hungarian Radio Hour is in its fifth year. Countless times its justification has been established.</p>
   <p>The First Hungarian Air Theatre is not only the first regular Hungarian Radio Hour in America, but if all the Hungarian radio hours and programs, outside of Hungary, were added up, the total number would not equal the frequency with which the First Hungarian Air Theatre has broadcast. This is a daring statement yet true.</p>
   <p>The First Hungarian Air Theatre has entertained its listeners for years. The time has come for those listeners to prove that there is a necessity for a regular radio hour. They should fully support the noble movement it has started for the benefit of the refugees from Jugo-Slavia. These unfortunates, through no fault of their own, were expelled from that country.</p>

   <p>The First Hungarian Air Theatre is arranging a series of entertainments, and the net income will be donated to our unfortunate brethren. If, for no other reason, by this act the sponsors deserve our whole-hearted support.</p>
   <p>The programs will be new. The directors are: Frank J. Kovach and Mrs. John Zboray.</p>
   <p>Let us cooperate with the First Hungarian Air Theatre and, at the same time, aid the refugees.</p>
