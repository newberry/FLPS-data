   <p>Last year there was hardly any Hungarian who made so many children happy at Christmas time as did our well-known compatriot Eugene Petrovits, and his wife. Petrovits, who is a hardware dealer, began the distribution of Christmas gifts a year ago last Christmas at the hall of the Hungarian Roman Catholic Church, where he presented one hundred Hungarian youngsters with gifts.</p>
   <p>As this year the depression struck more Hungarian people, this Christmas Petrovits doubled the number of gifts, appearing at the Hungarian Roman Catholic Church as Santa Claus and giving presents to two hundred Hungarian children, making them all very happy.</p>
   <p>Eugene Petrovits and his wife deserve the praise and acknowledgment of the Hungarians in Chicago.</p>
