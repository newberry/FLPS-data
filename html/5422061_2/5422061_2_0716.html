   <p>We cannot find words to express sufficient praise and admiration for the grand piece of work that the Chicago and Cleveland All-Star Hungarian team accomplished by defeating the Chicago Soccer League's All-Star team by a score of 1-0.</p>
   <p>Even though both teams played a strenous game the day before, this game was played with the aggressiveness of two fresh teams.</p>
   <p>The game was a very exciting one to watch, filled with action and thrills. The first half of the game ended without either side scoring a point. The second half was more exciting due to the fact that both sides were exerting their energies to the utmost in order to score a goal. During the last <span class="page-break">\2</span>four minutes of play, the Hungarians scored a goal, which proved sufficient to defeat the Chicago All-Stars.</p>
   <p>Each member of the Hungarian team deserves the highest praise. Their names will go down in the history of Hungarian-American sport life.</p>
