   <p>As usual by the proclamation of the president of the United States, the last Thursday of November, will be celebrated as Thanksgiving Day and declared a national holiday. The factories and all business houses will be closed. This will give the people a special opportunity to thank the Lord, not only for past blessings which helped the nation grow to its present greatness, but also for the success of one of its most recent enterprises, the sale of the Liberty Bonds which will enable this nation to continue its fight to make the world safe for democracy.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian lodges and churches will feature special programs on this day.</p>
