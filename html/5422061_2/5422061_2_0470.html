   <p>It gives us great pleasure to inform the Chicago Hungarians that the Chicago Thalia Literary and Song Society, will meet January 24, and every Friday thereafter, at Schoenhofen's Hall, Ashland and Milwaukee Avenues, 8 P.M. Classes to develop literary and musical talent will be tonight. Every one is urged to participate in these classes regardless of age, especially those who have artistic ambitions along the lines of drama, or are musically inclined. These classes will endeavor to teach the pupils the more technical points of literary art.</p>
   <p>There are no special fees except that one must pay regular dues to the Chicago Literary and Song Society. This fee is ten cents a month for women and fifteen cents a month for men.</p>
