   <p>The Chicago-Burnside Hungarian-Greek Catholic Church takes advantage of every opportunity to promote the religious education of its members. On the occasion of Holy week, a religious motion picture, two and a half hours long, will be shown March 23 and 24, at the Greek Catholic Church School Hall.</p>
   <p>The title of the picture is "Jesus Christ's Life and Death." Wherever this film has been exhibited large crowds attended. Prominent actors portray the characters in the picture of the life of Christ.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that many people desire to see this motion picture, the church committee has decided to exhibit it two days. We call the attention of the Hungarians to this religious film. Don't miss it. The performance begins at 7 P.M. and the admission is 25 cents.</p>
