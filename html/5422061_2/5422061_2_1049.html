   <p>Is there a stranger of another nationality among our Hungarian people who is well-known and respected by all of us? Is there a man who does not understand our language, who is not our kind, and yet has stood by us in good faith when the world looked dark and dismal, who extended a helping hand and worked tirelessly for the welfare of the Hungarian people?</p>
   <p>Truthfully speaking, there aren't many such men. If we do find some, the first will be James K. Pedlow, an American captain, who was the first to extend a helping hand to the hopelessly defeated and discouraged Hungarian nation.</p>
   <p>After the World War, the disheartened people of the world, before extending aid to an individual, would ask what nationality he was, but this was not so with Captain Pedlow who went to the Hungarians bearing gifts, and who was ready to help without asking any questions.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Many years have passed since this happened, but Captain Pedlow remained right alongside of the Hungarians. For many years, Captain Pedlow has been deeply concerned with the suffering of the Hungarian people. In all probability there is not another man in the world who has been mentioned by Hungarians in prayer as many times as has this American Captain.</p>
   <p>Suffering has increased in one place and decreased in another. The War has been over for a long time, and mankind now has every reason to offer aid to the weak. Captain Pedlow realized that the Hungarian people were suffering greatly and he decided that he would help them as long as they needed help.</p>
   <p>Fall came, and with it the frost, introducing a cold, bleak winter and a sad and impoverished Christmas. Captain Pedlow considers it his duty to brighten the sorrowful Hungarian Christmas. He has called upon the legendary brotherly love and good heart of the American Hungarians, so that he may join <span class="page-break">3</span>hands [with them] in bringing happiness to the Hungarian nation.</p>
   <p>This charitable activity is a great blessing to Hungary. Everyone can appreciate it who knows what it means to stand in a cold room at Christmas time, without food or gifts. Just imagine your brother or sister, or perhaps your own child enduring such a Christmas.</p>
   <p>Foodstuffs and warm clothing should be available in every home--if not, there are always a couple of dollars available. By means of the Pedlow charitable activities, every Hungarian can assist the Christmas happiness of a friend or relative. If it should be that you do not know of anyone who might be in need, you can send money or gifts to one of the charitable organizations in Hungary, and they will see that a worthy family receives these gifts.</p>
   <p>We all know that the shipments, as arranged by Captain Pedlow, are in safe hands. We know this from past experience and from the kindness he has shown the Hungarian people.</p>
   <p>Hungarian Americans, let us be no less a friend to those suffering brothers of <span class="page-break">4</span>ours, than is Captain Pedlow. What can we do to ease the suffering of our brother Hungarians, when so much aid is extended them from a man like Captain Pedlow, an American?</p>
   <p>Captain Pedlow is doing his part, and the only thing for us to do is to pack up a bundle and participate in this great relief work which is being sponsored by Captain Pedlow.</p>
   <p>All bundles should be mailed to Captain Pedlow's Relief Center, 28 Union Square, New York City. We feel that all Hungarians will be as co-operative in this movement as has been Captain Pedlow.</p>
