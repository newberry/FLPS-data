   <p>The grand old newspaper friend of ours, the Cleveland Szabadsag published two editorials with reference to John W. Davis, the Democratic candidate for president, and his stand against the Ku Klux Klan, about which we also had a brief editorial last week.</p>
   <p>The first one was meant to be a leader article and was written very mildly. This was natural because the writer of this first article could see nothing but the Republican Party, and regardless of what LaFollette or Davis said he was still for Coolidge and the Republican Party, this was done because his boss was Doctor Cserna, a lieutenant of the Republican Party and a member of the Republican Committee.</p>
   <p>Our paper being an open-minded publication, we cannot discuss this article very well, even if we accepted the facts of this editorial and admitted the <span class="page-break">\2</span>talents of the writer and his familiarity with the articles appearing in the American press.</p>
   <p>The other article had the following title "That Reminds Us" and was written nore open-mindedly, discussing the facts freely. We think that the second editorial should have been used as the leader.</p>
   <p>Before we analyze this problem and the article, we think that we should reprint a few of the more important paragraphs of this article.</p>
   <p>"John W. Davis was right when he suggested that both candidates from the two major political parties issue a statement in regard to their stand for or against the Klan. After this statement was issued he thought that the Klan question should be eliminated from the field of politics. Because it is true that the more the Klan is bothered, and the more the politicians stress the <span class="page-break">\3</span>question, the more this will aid the Klan. The Ku Klux Klan would never have gotten as strong as it is, if it hadn't been for the publicity it receives from the daily newspapers. The majority of people are easily lead; and we all know that a bad example is not always enough to scare people away, instead many are attracted by some of these bad examples.</p>
   <p>"Let us not be fools. Let's look these white-sheeted ghosts in the eyes, but we do not want to fight them, or take them very seriously. We should laugh at them and tell them that our childhood days are past when people wearing long white sheets could scare us. We have outgrown our ghost story days. We will not tear their white sheets off of them: why should we? We know what is under these white sheets.</p>
   <p>"We, who according to the census takers are considered foreign born, shouldn't <span class="page-break">\4</span>care about the Ku Klux Klan, because by caring we are doing them a favor. We are aware of the fact that in certain Hungarian districts the Hungarians are organizing to combat the Ku Klux Klan, but we should not follow this example, because by doing this we only supply the Klan with ammunition. We, who are partly concerned, should keep away from the issue. Not because we are fools, but because we should be proud of ourselves for we are smarter than they are. Let the fight be handled by Davis, Coolidge, and LaFollette. Let us stay as a respectable audience and applaud when the time comes.</p>
   <p>"The Ku Klux Klan is openly against the colored, the foreigner, the Jew, and the catholics. Let us look at the census of 1920 and see what this organization is going to fight: In the United States there are 20 million catholics, 11 million colored, 14 million foreigners, and approximately 4 million Jews. This total represents the number of people the Klan is attempting to fight.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>"Aren't we right? Let's laugh in the faces of the Ku Klux Klan!"</p>
   <p>What the Szabadsag recommends is the easiest and simplest end to this matter. But this problem cannot be solved this way. To give advice such as this in regard to a situation involving an American problem is not only out of the question but it is a sin. Therefore, we want to take this opportunity to say to our friend newspaper that this newspaper's viewpoint of this situation, both politically and actively, is different.</p>
   <p>We will state why.</p>
   <p>There are two reasons why we think the Szabadsag's standpoint is wrong.</p>
   <p>One of the reasons is that we think the Ku Klux Klan is a serious and destructive political power in the United States. It is true that neither <span class="page-break">\6</span>Cleveland nor Chicago are very strongly organized; but in Texas, Indiana, Maine, Oklahoma and throughout the entire Southern States its organization is strong.</p>
   <p>There are certain towns and cities, both in Illinois and in Ohio, where the Klan is powerful. In these towns and cities the minority is ruled by terror. This terror is not brought on the minority because they are waging a battle against the Klan, but because the aims of the Klan are to take away those privileges upon which the principles of the government of the United States was founded. They are terrorized by the fact that the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness will be taken away from them. The terror of the Klan does not stop with scares and threats, but they have been known to inflict bodily injury.</p>
   <p>The Ku Klux Klan can't be subdued by laughing at them, nor by ignoring their <span class="page-break">\7</span>activities, and we must not leave the others alone to fight the Klan. The Klan is a secret political organization. This organization was formed secretly and the only way to defeat such an organization is to bring the battle out into the open.</p>
   <p>We must bring the sunlight into this darkened pit. The brightness of the sunlight and publicity will eventually break this secretly built castle.</p>
   <p>There are spoiling buds that develop only in the darkened dampness of a cellar. When these buds are brought out into the fresh air and sunshine they fade and die. This is the way we will be with the Klan. Since the New York World began writing articles which are unfavorable towards the Klan, and the press throughout the entire nation has been giving them unfavorable publicity, the power of the Klan has diminished, and all self-respecting, native born Protestant persons have kept away from this undesirable secret organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>The aims and purposes of the Klan are such that if brought out in the light they will not bear up under pressure; therefore, it is our duty to work against the Klan, so that it will fade and die like a musty flower.</p>
   <p>What publicity can't do, the strongest form of defense-organization, will gain its purpose.</p>
   <p>Yes! we must organize against them just as they have organized against us. Only we will not organize secretly, but openly, like they did in Texas. Their strength here will be broken just as it was in Texas.</p>
   <p>Let us look back eight or ten years. What did the Anti-Saloon League's activities look like at that time? In Chicago and in Cleveland we laughed at these fanatic modifiers and reformers. The editorial staff of the Szabadsag would have bet <span class="page-break">\9</span>any amount of money that there would be absolute prohibition in Chicago, Cleveland, and New York.</p>
   <p>Prohibition was thought of as a big joke ten years ago. On theatre stages the Anti-Saloon League was made fun of, and every once in a while the newspapers would write humorous articles about this childish movement.</p>
   <p>Prohibition was regarded the same way that the Szabadsag regards the Klan movement. People thought that they could drive these prohibitionists out by laughter and ignorance. Organization was not thought of, because it looked as though it was unnecessary, in fact they were afraid because they thought the Anti-Saloon League would gain more power.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, the Anti-Saloon League entangled the nation in a net, with the <span class="page-break">\10</span>exception of the larger cities, and leaned on congress, and waited for the psychological moment, the World War, when they made prohibition possible as a war measure, which later made absolute prohibition possible.</p>
   <p>After prohibition became a law it was useless for the alcoholic beverage dealers to organize for action; it was too late, the damage had been done.</p>
   <p>Prohibition was born and it stayed while others laughed; they were organizing.</p>
   <p>In organization, there is strength and success.</p>
   <p>This is not only a good by-word, but it is the golden truth. It is a tried and proven fact.</p>
   <p>The other reason why we don't agree with the standpoint of the Szabadsag is <span class="page-break">\11</span>that they write directly against organizational work, and especially against the Hungarians organizing.</p>
   <p>We have emphatically stated how important it is to organize against the Klan as an American movement, but now we would like to say a few words with reference to pure Hungarian organizational work. We realize that it is a rather neglected subject, but this seems to be the ideal time for it.</p>
   <p>The Szabadsag, as one of the most powerful Hungarian organs in the United States, must grasp this opportunity to awaken the Hungarians from this sinful lethargy, of which it has been suffering during the past few years.</p>
   <p>Please believe us that this is being written for the benefit of the larger Hungarian newspapers, calling to their attention the fact that the Hungarians of this country are without any kind of a national or political organization.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>Water can not wash this sin from us. Although we have come to the decision that due to the sorrowful political situation in Europe, the larger papers, for diplomatic reasons, cannot be engaged in organizational work. But we do think it would be a rather wise move to start an American-Hungarian national organization. Because the large newspapers can bring this about if they have the will to do it.</p>
   <p>It is up to the Szabadsag to start this movement and to make such an organization a reality; not only because it is a Hungarian newspaper, but because of its traditions during the past thirty years and the ashes of Tihamer Kohanyi dictate this fact.</p>
   <p>Tihamer Kohanyi had many faults, but we must admit that he was active in Hungarian organizational work, even if some of his ideas were not accepted by the more prominent leaders. He was always willing to donate space in his paper and work by his staff for the betterment of Hungarian movements and organizational work.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\13</span>
   <p>During Kohanyi's time the Szabadsag did not have such a good financial status as it does today. Many Hungarians seem to think that because the financial situation of the Szabadsag is so good today that it is neglecting the interest of the Hungarians, but we do not believe this. We believe that the men running the Szabadsag are unselfish, self-sacrificing, and willing workers.</p>
   <p>Such men as Cserna and Fonyo, without mentioning the others connected with the Szabadsag are not afraid of organizational work among the Hungarians, and they have no reason to be.</p>
   <p>Taking everything into consideration, we recommend that the fight against the Klan be stopped. Publicity and organization are the best weapons to fight it with, and we must take these in our hands.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\14</span>
   <p>Without paying any attention to party affiliations, we must stand with those who openly take their places against the Klan.</p>
   <p>As far as we are concerned this is a very important matter, and until Coolidge renders a decision on this matter, as Davis and LaFollette have, we will have to stay away from Coolidge.</p>
   <p>We must do the same thing with all other candidates for office; we must force each and every candidate to show his colors. Those who are with us we will help to the best of our ability, and those who do not express their attitude towards this question, are against us; therefore, we will not show any mercy towards them in the field of politics when election day comes.</p>
   <p>The statistics as stated in the Szabadsag are also wrong. They talk about 20 million catholics, 4 million Jews, 11 million colored people, and 14 <span class="page-break">\15</span>million foreign born people. In the first place we must not consider that there are 110 million people in the United States. Among the 14 million foreign born there are a few million catholics, some Jews, and even a few colored people. Among the 20 million Catholics there are those who are foreign and those who are colored.</p>
   <p>Most of the colored people live in the South, where their political power means nothing.</p>
   <p>In other words, if the plan of the Ku Klux Klan works out so that all the white Protestants, who are native born, join their organization they will control the nation's most important public offices, and their power would not be centered in individual states, they would get so strong that their power would mean a deciding factor in Congress.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\16</span>
   <p>Therefore, we advise you not to laugh at this matter, but to organize in order that the Klan may be defeated.</p>
