   <p>Official Bulletin of the Hungarian-American Transoceanic Flight</p>
   <p>There is not one Hungarian-American today who does not know about the Hungarian-American transoceanic flight and its goal. Thousands of Hungarians are aware of the great enthusiasm with which the idea of a transoceanic flight has been received. The Hungarian-American press--with the right of criticism-is recording the facts.</p>
   <p>Members of Hungarian churches and societies have been informed by their leaders about the plan to send the plane "Justice for Hungary" across the ocean to Hungary during the summer of 1930.</p>
   <p>The American press and the American people are showing great interest in the Hungarian transoceanic flight. The pilot of the projected flight and the Committee that sponsors it, are of the belief that the flight will be possible only if the Hungarian-Americans are willing to contribute and co-operate. The <span class="page-break">2</span>Committee has availed itself of every means to induce Hungarian-Americans to buy souvenir cards at one dollar each. The proceeds from the sale of these souvenirs will swell the funds needed for the flight. These cards may be bought from the Committee's members, churches, and societies that support this project.</p>
   <p>Pilot Sandor Magyar, as well as the Committee of the Hungarian Transoceanic Flight, asks the Hungarian-Americans to do their share, since the sacrifice requested is not so great. Besides, the souvenir cards, which will be carried on the "Justice for Hungary," will bring a great deal of happiness to the loved ones across the ocean. The Committee itself is doing an almost superhuman task without compensation.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as the preparatory work of the Hungarian transoceanic flight must be completed by the end of May, the Hungarian-Americans are requested to purchase the souvenir cards before the Committee turns them over to stamp collectors <span class="page-break">3</span>for commercial uses. Everyone should bear in mind that the sacrifice asked is very small in comparison with the risk taken by the two Hungarian flyers.....</p>
   <p>The interest aroused by the Hungarian transoceanic flight is further illustrated by the fact that Lord Rothermere, distinguished English peer and a friend of the Hungarians, has accepted sponsorship of the project. He sent the following cablegram to the Right Reverend Elemer Eordogh, chairman of the Committee:</p>
   <p>".....I have received your letter of March 28 with much pleasure and gladly give consent to use my name publicly as patron of the Hungarian-American flight. I trust you will be able to raise all the money necessary and I wish every success to your brave aviator Sandor Magyar.</p>
   <p>"Please cable Capt. Martin, France.</p>
   <p>Rothermere."</p>
