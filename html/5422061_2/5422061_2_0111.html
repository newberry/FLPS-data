   <p>Again we read Hungarian names in the American newspapers and the criticisms are so flattering that we publish some of them verbatim. The reviews concern Mesdames Renee Engel-Lidge, pianist, and Irma Ferenczy, soprano. We are especially proud of these two artists, because they live among us here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Tribune of March 23, says [Editor's note: Text here is in English]:</p>
   <p>"Madame Renee Engel-Lidge and Madame Irma Ferenczy were at Kimball Hall. Mme. Engel-Lidge is a pianist of both rapid and powerful enunciation, with the evidence of careful training in her performance. She made an excellent impression with a Roumanian dance by Bela Bartok, playing it with great dash and fervor.....</p>
   
   <p>"Mme. Ferenczy's voice was of unusually brilliant quality and she was well received in the ancient and seldom heard Cavatina from Meyerbeer's 'Roberto Diavolo', following it with an attractive tune called 'Liliomszal' ['A Lily'] by Oscar Dienzl....."</p>
   <p>From the Chicago Daily News:</p>
   <p>"Madame Renee Engel-Lidge, pianist, and Madame Irma Ferenczy, soprano, both Hungarian artists of routine and public experience, gave a joint recital of piano and vocal music at Kimball Hall last evening. Mme. Engel-Lidge's interpretations disclosed a comprehensive and advanced technical prowess, a taste for poetic musical expression.....</p>
   <p>She made a distinguished success at this, her Chicago debut.</p>
   <p>Madame Ferenczy has an engaging stage presence and a voice which in the higher ranges is clear and powerful."</p>
   
   <p>We wish continued success to these two talented Hungarian artists that they may bring more laurels to us Hungarians.</p>
