   <p>The Hungarian-American Amateur Club, at its last monthly meeting, decided to organize a football team to promote an increase in membership, and a closer relationship. Action followed the proposition. The most enthusiastic members went out to try their skill with the football. The result was that most of them were more skilled at applauding than at kicking the ball.</p>
   <p>Our young people are willing to undertake their obligations, and the Hungarians of Chicago welcome their efforts with interest.</p>
   <p>We need only perseverance, then we will be victorious.</p>
   <p>Practice matches are being held every Sunday afternoon.</p>
