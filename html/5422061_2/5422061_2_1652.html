   <p>During the early part of the War it looked very much as though the central powers were going to win the war and out of this came the thought that many people would emigrate after the war was over. But now that the United States had entered the war, it has almost become an impossibility with the United States aiding the allies for Germany to win; she is standing with her back against the wall. The masses who believed that Germany would win the war previously have still some faith in the possibility that the war may he won by Germany, therefore, they have not given up the idea of emigration, and with this idea in mind,they believe that if the central powers win,there will be countless opportunities in the countries that claim victory.</p>
   <p>Without considering what will happen in this country if this emigration takes place, we must think of what conditions await the emigrants who arrive in these lands of opportunity. Emigration in such great volume as is predicted <span class="page-break">\2</span>would be a terrible blow to this country, and its industries, but the right to emigrate cannot be denied those people who desire to do so. Enactment of laws to stop emigration also seems to be an impossibility. Probably the only way mass emigration can be stopped is by acquainting the people with the conditions that will exist in Central Europe, especially in Austria Hungary more so than in Germany. One must bear in mind that when we came to this country there was a reason for it, there must have been some fault or something we did not like about the social or economic system in the country from which we came.</p>
   <p>There is a very mistaken idea that, due to the great number of people lost in the war the entire central European set-up will change, and that it will offer countless opportunities.</p>
   <p>It is true that agriculture in Austria Hungary became a business proposition but when this happened this industry became mechanized and, therefore, threw a great number of men out of work. These men were soon absorbed by this country. Most of the people thinking of emigrating are those who before <span class="page-break">\3</span>coming to this country were engaged in agriculture. The only condition under which these people should go back to their home countries would be if it were certain that there will be room for them in agriculture. This, however, is very questionable, and Hungary and the other central countries of Europe are not industrially inclined, therefore, it seems as though the people who are planning to leave this country have been somewhat misled.</p>
   <p>The land question is the most important question in Europe. There has been a great deal of blood shed in order that the land question might be solved.</p>
   <p>The continuation of revolts has proved that people do not value any one thing more dearly than land which has been taken away from them by force. These revolts have netted the people nothing because the landlords were always protected by an armed force.</p>
   <p>This war is being fought because it will test the strength of the soldiers or <span class="page-break">\4</span>servants of the landlords. This does not only apply to the depressed people but concerns the entire world; that is the four countries of the world. If these junkers are defeated,and the only way they will be defeated, is by a victory on the part of the United States, then the people will have hopes of getting their lands back. This, of course, should not be misinterpreted to mean that just as soon as the war is over the land will be divided among the population. It would only be the start of a great social reform and will mean the death of the junkers. We must make this notation, however, that if the emigration from this country is too heavy, these landlords or junkers will use this as a tool to battle off those who have been seeking land.</p>
   <p>The emigration question is not a subject that should not be discussed; it is just the opposite; now is the time when the Hungarian masses should be fully informed of the problems of emigration. We must advise the people who are considering emigration, taking their interest whole heartedly or conscientiously, so they will not be victims of propaganda.</p>
