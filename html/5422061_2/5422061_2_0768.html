   <p>Very often we hear complaint that there are not many large Hungarian activities of importance within which organization harmony prevails, but instead there is bickering among them. This is not true.</p>
   <p>Our societies, for the most part, always try to keep alive patriotic feeling and set an example of national unity. Just recently, the St. Stephens Society celebrated its fortieth anniversary, and on this Sunday, an important society, the Rakoczi, <span class="page-break">2</span>will do the same. Not only will this be a celebration of an anniversary, but manifestation of gratitude toward a national hero, Terencz Rakoczi.</p>
   <p>Two centuries have passed since the Magyars have scattered thousands of miles, but time nor distance have no power to destroy hero-worship in the Magyar soul or to forget to be grateful to these great sons of Hungary.</p>
