   <p>We do not advocate hasty or foolish political organization. We want to advise our readers to plan carefully a well prepared, sensibly organized program.</p>
   <p>We are now in the middle of summer, but all of us who are new Hungarian-Americans know that this Fall we will face one of the most important of all elections, the presidential election. We will discuss the presidential election with our readers from time to time. The election of many state officials take place this year also. We will elect one new Senator from the State of Illinois also, and many new Congressmen. In Chicago, and Cook County, there will also be many jobs up for consideration.</p>
   <p>From the above mentioned facts, it is readily seen that this election will play a very important part in the political history of the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The voting citizens will face many problems and questions of great importance, and will have to exercise great care and caution in casting their votes, in order that these notes be used practically and to the best advantage.</p>
   <p>This paper, as in all other election years, will be non-partisan this year. We will voice our opinions openly, and criticize fairly, and without partiality. It is possible that people may think that this is sufficient, but we think that to voice our opinions and criticisms to the best of our ability is only getting started in producing good citizens and careful voters.</p>
   <p>Besides our above duties, this newspaper has a more important duty in the name of good citizenship toward the United States, and to instill this spirit into the Hungarian citizens of the United States.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>We think it is our duty to ask the Hungarian citizens of the United States not to neglect their interest in the political warfares of this country, but to be good American citizens. We should attack the political question with heart and soul, and become active political fighters. By so doing, we will be working in our own interest and in the interest of the entire Hungarian population of the United States, at the same time, fully living up to our obligations as citizens.</p>
   <p>There will be three different parties seeking victories: the Republicans, the Democrats, and the Socialists. The real election will take place between the Democrats and the Republicans, because the number of Socialists in this country is negligible with reference to a presidential election.</p>
   <p>It is our wish that the Chicago and vicinity Hungarian-American citizens pick that political party which they think is sober minded, and truly believe it to be the best. Those who want to be Republicans, they should organize as a Republican Hungarian citizen. Those who feel that they should work with any other political party, should organize under the name of that party as Hungarian-American citizens.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>We feel that we should write the truth, and it is this; the Socialist party is very active in organizational work among the Hungarians and, therefore, they need not be called on for additional organization. But we think that it is a pitiful situation that neither of the other two parties, the Democrats or the Republicans, is carefully organized, and from those ranks will come the next President of the United States. Neither of these parties has Hungarian organizations. We are aware of the fact that there are a large number of Hungarian Democrats in Chicago. We also know that these people took an active part in previous elections. We know that there are a large number of Republicans among the Hungarian-American citizens, and that they also took active part in elections without success.</p>
   <p>If there has ever been a time for organizing with renewed vigor, now is the time. We openly ask all Hungarians, leaders of societies, workers, leaders, and Hungarian business men, to bring the Hungarian citizens together in a friendly way, in order that this political question may be discussed. Those who wish to go with the Republican candidates, should organize under that flag, and those who are for the Democratic candidates, should organize with the Democrats.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>We have no other aims but to keep the Chicago-Hungarians and their interests in mind, in order that they may become interested in the political life of this country, thereby becoming better citizens of this country. We will all become better Americans, understanding its principles and destinies of its future.</p>
   <p>Any organizational work in the interest of American politics among the Hungarians will receive full cooperation from this newspaper, and everyone connected with it.</p>
   <p>Hungarian brothers, and citizens, please start this movement.</p>
