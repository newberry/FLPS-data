   <p>The Hungarian group, under the chairmanship of Dr. Arpad Barothy, held their first meeting on the proposed World's Fair of 1933 on Monday, May 28. The meeting naturally concerned itself only with forming committees from the delegates of Hungarian organizations. It was decided that on June 14 another meeting will be held at the LaSalle Hotel, to which each of the societies is to send three delegates. The societies are requested to send the names of their secretaries to Reverend Julius M. Hanko, 4323 West Carroll Avenue, so that they may be notified officially of meetings.</p>
   <p>The Chicago World's Fair is not just a local affair because the whole world will be interested in it. Therefore, it is fitting for the Hungarians to do--as other national groups are doing--our share in this great work. We will gain the appreciation of the sons of our adopted country, as well as respect from other national groups.</p>
