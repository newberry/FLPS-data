   <p>Count Michael Karolyi, Hungary's first president, who is in America on a lecture tour, is now in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Availing ourselves of his stay here, we asked him for an interview, which was granted.</p>
   <p>The Count is stopping at the Sherman Hotel, where we found him exhausted and ill.....</p>
   <p>The interview proceeded as follows:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Question: "What impression did you, Mr. President, get in Chicago during your lectures here? How were you impressed by Chicago generally and the Chicago Hungarians?"</p>
   <p>Answer: "Chicago was the most successful of my stops up to the present time. I consider the Chicago Hungarians as seriously thoughtful of their mother country and generally of the future."</p>
   <p>Q. "What are your immediate plans for the future, Mr. President?"</p>
   <p>A. "At the present I am under contract to write a book about the years of my emigration (exile). When I complete the book, I will begin a consistent war on Fascism and will tour Europe, Australia, China, Canada, and Mexico."</p>
   <p>Q. "If conditions in Hungary change or should you be granted amnesty, would you return to Hungary?"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>A. "No! I would not return to Hungary under any circumstance save one, and that is if I could be the granter of amnesties."</p>
   <p>Q. "Can you, Mr. President, conceive the failure of the Horthy-Bethlen government? And if so, what will bring this about, internal or external causes?"</p>
   <p>A. "The Horthy and Bethlen regime will not be in power forever. Their failure will be hastened by external causes but their downfall will be precipitated directly by internal troubles."</p>
   <p>Q. "How do you imagine that the small European countries will continue to progress?"</p>
   <p>A. "The small countries cannot develop and progress amid the present political and economic order. The whole of Europe is sick. From the East, Soviet <span class="page-break">\4</span>Russia, and from the West, America exert such tremendous pressure on Europe that without a thorough change in the life of Europe, the pressure on two sides will completely crush it."</p>
   <p>Q. "What do you think of the chances for progress in Hungary?"</p>
   <p>A. "The era of romanticism is over.....The basis for progress, in my estimation, lies in putting an end to feudalism, because a country cannot exist under feudalism today."</p>
   <p>Q. "In what, Mr. President, do you see the possibility of bringing about world peace?"</p>
   <p>A. "Peace! Permanent world peace can be brought about when the whole world will become conscious of the necessity of equalizing the financial differences between nations, which are now at such a marked contrast."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Q. "Is it your intention to organize the American-Hungarians?"</p>
   <p>A. "No. At the present time that is not my intention."</p>
   <p>This ended the interview, except that Karolyi added that his permanent headquarters will be in Paris.</p>
