   <p>Many newspaper articles of the past have been devoted to the discussion of the possibility that the American-Magyar population will form a united fraternal and benevolent institution set up in such a manner as to make provision for the payment of compensation to itssick members. So far, no definite substantial plan has been presented with enthusiasm to any group. This is because we are not interested in the future, and because individual societies have been awaiting for others to start the movement, believing that the society to lead it, will be in need of the additional protection afforded by a combined membership. To organize <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>with this purpose is a necessity for all. The foundation for this movement was laid in 1919 at a conference. During this conference, many questions and ideas of great interest were discussed at great length.</p>
   <p>We have found that the little attention paid to the formation of one united mutual benevolent society is not due to the inability of the societies to pay claims. On the contrary, the fact is that every society, according to modern standards, is materially sound. Thus, it follows that, to strengthen such organization and make it safer in relation to the future, re-organization is very necessary. Let us assume a sincere attitude in the discussion of this matter, so that <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>we may determine whether it will be of any benefit for the membership to effect a consolidation, or let things remain as they are. I favor re-organization; first, because when any of several scattered societies ceases to function, a large loss is suffered by its members. The following is an example: A member of many years standing in the Rakoczi society, after this society cracks up due to poor experience and withdraws from activity in the State of Illinois, joins the Petofi society, which advertises a $1,000 death benefit insurance. The member, after withdrawing his membership from the Rakoczi society, to which he paid premiums and dues for many years, loses all rank and benefits and becomes a member of the Petofi, the dues of which he keeps on paying for a period of years until he meets with a misfortune that causes his death.</p>
   <p>This person's family would be happy to receive the $1,000 death benefit from the society, but as this society has been declared insolvent, they <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>receive no monetary or other benefit at all when it is most needed. If the Magyar organizations were united, the shifting about of members from one society to another would be avoided.</p>
   <p>The combined wealth of the American-Magyar's four largest societies is nearly one million dollars, with a combined membership of about fifty thousand Magyars. To set forth in detail the advantages that would accrue from a consolidation of these scattered organizations, would require a long explanation. I will, therefore, limit myself to touching on the material side of the situation.</p>
   <p>In the event of a re-organization, the membership should be grouped at a central point.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>Hence, it follows that those who paid dues or premiums should be grouped separately. This procedure would bring about the conservation of a large sum of money to face the problems of to-day in dealing with matters of this kind.</p>
   <p>It is a fact, proved by statistical figures, that the death-rate in a large group is proportionately smaller than in a small group. But, let us assume that the death-rate shows a proportionate increase at one intermediate point. In that case the obligations of the society could be met with money earned as interest and the prompt receipt of premium payments, which is not permissible under the present system.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Some may ask why? In my opinion, our present day societies ply one another with too many quarrels, jealousies and revenges. This will continue until the young people will lose respect for all of them and the membership that is left will be unable to guarantee security for old age.</p>
   <p>In my opinion, the Magyar's plan of re-organization is very beneficial and, for this reason, the leaders of the societies, should not bicker so much. Instead they should consider the start of the proper movement, calling a meeting of all societies to discuss it. If the purpose at heart is to save the Magyar societies' future, this is the proper action.</p>
