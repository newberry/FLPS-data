   <p>One of the most illustrious Chicago Hungarians, Dr. Geza Takots, professor of surgery at Northwestern University, held a very interesting lecture at the Chicago Magyar Club last Sunday. Taking cancer, prevention and treatment as his subject, he recounted the progress of re search the progress of research and experiments, whereby, together with surgery, x-ray or radium treatment, definite results can be obtained. As recently as two decades ago, professionals had pronounced cancer cases as hopeless and incurable. Today, if discovered in time and treated properly, it can be cured entirely or arrested, and the life of the cancer patient lengthened.</p>
   <p>Dr. Takots illustrated his lecture with motion pictures, which made it understandable.</p>
