   <p>The success of the World's Fair was somewhat overshadowed, and the good name of Chicago periled, when on the last day, in conjunction with the Halloween celebration, a riotious crowd looted and damaged property on the Fair grounds.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian pavilion, too, was broken into, and Dr. Joseph Vizsolys suffered the greatest loss. The riotious mob raided the Hungarian pavilion in the early evening. Doctor Vizsolys already had the exhibited objects packed in cases and locked up the place. He left, without any thought about their safety. He was mistaken because the mob forced the lock and entered. They broke valuable Zsolnay and Herendy porcelain ware and stole all the imported cigarettes and tobacco. Doctor Vizsolys's loss is estimated at several thousand dollars.</p>
