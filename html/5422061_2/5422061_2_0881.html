   <p>The Independent Hungarian Society, on January 22, gave a mask-ball in the beautiful Prudential Hall, which was filled to capacity with masked merrymakers, dressed in beautiful costumes.</p>
   <p>At the ball prizes were awarded to those who wore the best costume. There were many prize-winners. The music of the Juvenile Orchestra of the society, made a wonderful hit with their skillful way of playing, and everybody expressed their appreciation for the work of the society making it possible for the children to get free musical training, and taking care of sick members. We are not surprised that the ball was a success, because we know that everybody was working with heart and soul to make the affair a splendid one.</p>
   <p>Extending their thanks to all members for their full co-operation.</p>
