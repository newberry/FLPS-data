   <p>The First Chicago Hungarian Social and Sick Benefit Society, as usual is going to celebrate the sad anniversary of October 6, 1849. This date is a very important holiday in the history of Hungary.</p>
   <p>A very interesting program is to be given that evening at the Wicker Park Hall.</p>
   <p>There will be two speakers on the program; namely, Mr. Louis Szappanos and Mr. Lester Megyessy. Mr. Louis Szappanos has recently returned from an extended trip through Hungary. He has many interesting things to tell those attending this celebration.</p>
   <p>The celebration proceedings will be arranged by Joseph Rakos, the president of this organization. We are confident that the program will be worthwhile for both young and old, and urge every Hungarian to attend this celebration.</p>
