   <p>This morning, when we opened our foreign mail, we were sincerely elated. Among others, a Parisian musical publication claimed our attention. This periodical lists song hits of other nations, and while glancing over this column, we were pleasantly surprised to note the first name, Karoly Kovacs.</p>
   <p>Karoly Kovacs, composer, is very well known and loved by Chicago Hungarians because he makes his home here. It is, therefore, a great honor to know that his compositions have gained recognition abroad, also. His newest song hit, "Katicabogarka" [Little Ladybug], is translated into French, and all Paris is singing it.</p>
   <p>We have also heard that Carl Fisher, distinguished American publisher who has already published six of Karoly Kovacs' compositions for violin, has agreed to publish another violin composition. The publisher has instructed Karoly Kovacs to compose Hungarian rhapsodies.</p>

   <p>We are happy at this success and hope that Kovacs will bring continued glory to the Magyar race.</p>
