   <p>In our last issue we told our readers that the Hungarian people would participate in the Woman's World Fair which is being held at the Furniture Mart.</p>
   <p>The Fair opened last Saturday, and the parade which was part of the opening ceremonies was led by a group of Hungarian girls, dressed most artistically in Hungarian costumes. Last Tuesday night was Hungarian night at the Fair, and we think we ought to make a few comments about this occasion.</p>
   <p>It is very good to know that there are a few Hungarian men and women who are willing to step forward to aid in the promotion of an event as significant as the Woman's World Fair. These men and women arranged a program which was at once noteworthy and very suitable for the occasion.</p>

   <p>First of all, we shall mention Elizabeth Felegi, who danced the Hungarian Csardas [Hungarian folk dance]. Another excellent feature on the program was a piano solo by the son of Reverend Boros. Charles Hatvary, a great Hungarian tenor, was accompanied at the piano by Miss Steinberg in several Hungarian and American songs.</p>
   <p>The people who arranged the program and the Hungarian exhibit at the Fair can rest assured that the people of other nationalities who saw the program and the exhibits had nothing but praise for their work.</p>
   <p>It is activities such as this that our Hungarian people should participate in, in order to show the rest of the world that the Hungarians are culturally as far advanced as any other nationality.</p>
