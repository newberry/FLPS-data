   <p>p.28..........Some days ago there came into my hands the picture of Joseph Zsedi, which was given me by him when he visited Chicago, on September 21, 1902. As associate director of the National Alliance of Hungary, he brought with him a Hungarian flag, intended as a gift to the Hungarians of America and which he carried with him to the unveiling of the Kossuth-Monument in Cleveland. If my memory does not deceive me after these thirty years, there was a deed with this flag, by virtue of which the guardianship over that flag would be entrusted for only one year to each of the Hungarian societies. Last summer we found the flag in Detroit. The Committee for the Hungarian Day of the Century of Progress Exhibition did everything in their power, to secure the flag for that occasion, but failed. When the one-year term of guardianship expires, for the Hungarian society in Detroit, which society became the guardian? Who are these men who decide the question? So far I know the Federation of Hungarian Societies of Greater Chicago demands the distinction of becoming the guardian for the next year of this, from Hungarian viewpoint, historical flag, so it should be kept in Chicago for the next year.</p>
