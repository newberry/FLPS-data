   <p>Sunday, the 2nd of May opens the first conference of the Hungarian Reformed Ladies Society after a preliminary church service in the South Side Reformed Church, in the Hungarian House at Burnside. The conference is arranged by the Ladies Society of the Chicago South Side Reformed Church and the delegates of the other Reformed Ladies Societies from the cities in the vicinity of Chicago will come together, such as those from Gary, East Chicago, South Bend, Milwaukee, Indiana Harbor, Whiting, Joliet, Racine, South Chicago, Aurora etc. The conference will probably last till 6:00 P.M., after which there will be a banquet in the dining hall of the Hungarian House.
