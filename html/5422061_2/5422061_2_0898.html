   <p>The title, New Hungarian Sick Benefit Society, does not quite fit this article, because this society is not an absolutely new one. It is only being introduced to the Chicago-Hungarians under a new name. In other words, this organization was a Hungarian branch of the English Sick Benefit organization known as the "113th Branch of The Columbia Circle." The name of this new Hungarian organization is "The Independent Hungarian Society," and from all indications the word "independent" bears the true meaning of the word. The Hungarian liberty loving people do not intend to push any one around, but neither do they want to be pushed around in the social world without fair representation. This new Hungarian organization is affiliated with the Federal Life Insurance Company. This company handles the insurance end of this organization.</p>
   <p>The organization, officially, took place on Sunday May 16. On this day, the officers were elected, and a constitution was adopted, dues and initiation fees <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>were decided upon. The following were elected: Marton Benedek, president; Frank Peto, vice president; Frank V. Gulyas, treasurer; Stephen Riman, secretary-treasurer; Joseph M. Tauber, corresponding secretary; Ballas Molnar, secretary; and Mrs. J.M. Tauber, vice president of the women's division.</p>
   <p>There are high hopes that this newly formed organization will grow rapidly, and that it will rank with the largest Hungarian organizations in Chicago.</p>
