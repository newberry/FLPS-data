   <p>The facts which we printed in our editorial column in our last week's issue with reference to the Hungarian Home establishment, were found to be worth while by the members of the different Hungarian societies.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarian's two most powerful societies namely, the Chicago Hungarian Social and Sick Benefit Society, and the Chicago Hungarian Rakoczi Society, held their meeting in regard to matters concerning the Hungarian Home subject, and practically the same ideas were put forth as the ones we discussed in our editorial.</p>
   <p>Both of the above mentioned Societies are interested in the Hungarian Home idea. They have shown so much interest in it that the Hungarian Social and Sick Benefit Society, and the Chicago Hungarian Rakoczi Society voted to contribute two thousand dollars, and fifteen hundred dollars respectively.</p>
   
   <p>These contributions will be made on condition that a new building be put up and the idea of buying an old building is dropped.</p>
   <p>The building that the Hungarian Societies Central Committee had selected to buy, is located at the corner of Bissell and Willow Streets. To rehabilitate this building it would cost a great sum of money, and the two societies mentioned above believe that the construction of a new building would be cheaper.</p>
   <p>The hardest problem seems to be to find a practical central location where this building should be built. The older Hungarians of Chicago know what great changes have taken place in Chicago in the last twenty-five years.</p>
   <p>Certain districts which were residential twenty years ago, have become rooming house, manufacturing, and warehouse districts. The Hungarian districts also have changed. For instance, twenty years ago along Grand Avenue,the Hungarian language was very common, and practically all business along the street was conducted by Hungarian people, while today there are very few in this district.</p>
   <p>Today, North Avenue seems to be where the majority of the Hungarians are. Therefore, we do not have anything definite so as to guarantee the fact that these Hungarians will stay here for the next five or ten years. With the center of Hungarian population changing, it is hard to pick a central location for the Hungarian Home. We must also consider the transportation problem. This Home must be so located that there is some form of transporation to it from all parts of the city. A home such as this will serve to develop Societies, both of cultural and social activities, making it of utmost importance in the life of our people that the Hungarian Home be built.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian Home can only become a reality if all the rest of our Hungarian societies give the question the same serious thought as the two societies mentioned in this article.</p>
   
   <p>Ten thousand dollars are necessary before we can start talking about building a Hungarian Home. So the different societies must report how each will donate toward this cause.</p>
   <p>The Independent Hungarian Society has announced that they would donate three hundred dollars, but we haven't heard from any of the others as yet. We do not think it quite right for the delegates representing the different societies to voice their opinions referring to the construction of the Hungarian Home, because many of these societies either are not in favor of the idea, or they are not in a position financially, to contribute toward the fund for the construction of the Home.</p>
   <p>The governing committee of the Hungarian Home project should consist of those people who represent societies which are financially interested in the future of the Hungarian Home. This is dictated by a democratic and business principle.</p>
   <p>Another item we must concentrate our attention on, is that the Hungarian Societies Central Committee, should not be the only deciding body in this matter. This matter should be decided by the votes of the members of all the organizations who decide to participate in this movement. There has been news spread among the Hungarians, that the committee representing the Hungarian Societies Central Committee wishes to drop this important matter, and give it up as a worthless idea.</p>
   <p>The greater part of the advice which has been given in this editorial, was obtained while this subject was under general discussion at the meetings of the different societies. We have also received many letters with comments urging us to present their ideas to our readers. We also received many letters praising the article which appeared last week.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian Home idea will be kept in our files as a subject to be followed up closely, as we are always willing to accept new ideas and criticisms.</p>
