   <p>The Chicago Cultural and Benevolent Association of Women held a meeting in January and at the same time honored the Association's newly elected officers.</p>
   <p>We are facing a hard winter and the directors of the Association have to overcome many difficulties. The members, who number two hundred and forty, believe that the new leaders will exert every effort to surpass last year's record of benevolence. During the past year, $1,368.75 was distributed among the needy. The treasury of the Association is affected by unemployment and the depression in a great degree, since donations are decreasing month by month while disbursements are increasing out of proportion.</p>
   <p>The directors of the Association request the support of the Chicago Hungarians and take this opportunity to announce that they will hold a fifteen-year anniversary in the near future. The founders of the Association will be honored on this occasion.</p>
