   <p>p.2...The Hungarian students at the University of Chicago will arrange a Hungarian night at Mandel Hall, East 57th Street at University Avenue. The Chicago University never had enough Hungarian students before to do anything like this, but now the fourteen Hungarian students will try. In order to contribute to the success of the evening, we call this event to the attention of our readers and ask them to attend.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian night deserves our support, because we have been informed that the revision question will be brought up. The meaning of "Magyar" will also be explained to the American public.</p>
   <p>The program, which begins at 8 P.M., will be followed by dancing until 1 A.M.</p>
   <p>It would be desirable if our young people could attend this affair in national costumes.</p>
