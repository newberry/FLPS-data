   <p>There should not be a single Hungarian missing from the demonstrative parade, in order that the Hungarian people may show the American people their loyalty to and co-operation with the President and the country in which we live. Let us join hands for the common interest of all the people.</p>
   <p>Let us all be prepared for May 5,for this will be the first time that all the Hungarians have been together at one time and place since the first Hungarian settler came to Chicago.</p>
