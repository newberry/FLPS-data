   <p>Miss Jane Addams, founder of Hull House, the philanthropic friend of Hungarians, who is also active in international politics, left recently for Europe.....</p>
   <p>Miss Addams, who is president of the International Women's League, will attend the World Congress of the I W L in Prague.</p>
   <p>After the adjournment of the World Congress of the International Women's League, Miss Addams will visit Central Europe, including Hungary, to study the political, social, and economic situation there.</p>
   <p>We Hungarians expect much from this visit, because Miss Addams' opinion carries weight in influential American circles and because she considers the peace treaty of Trianon just as impossible as we do. To top it all, Miss Addams is the real, unselfish friend of the Hungarians.</p>

   <p>Miss Addams, who founded Hull House forty years ago, will be the center of interest this year. She will be a candidate for the Nobel prize because of her work in the field of charity. We believe that it will be awarded to her.</p>
   <p>In the meanwhile, we are following Miss Addams' summer mission with bated breath, because if she will consider us Hungarians worthy enough to interest herself in our troubles, we can expect more good than if a dozen diplomats were concerned, because diplomats only talk but do nothing.</p>
   <p>From time to time we will bring news to our readers of Miss Addams' activities.</p>
