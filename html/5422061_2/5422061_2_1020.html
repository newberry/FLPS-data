   <p>If we wished to scrutinize Hoover's administration malevolently, we could say that he was more concerned with the establishment of charitable institutions than with attempts to solve the economic crisis. When analyzing these problems, even political adversaries are expected to be objective....therefore, we too will endeavor to be objective in giving our views. In our opinion, Hoover's administration either is spineless or is deliberately serving that class which does not consider the time ripe for drastic measures in solving the economic problem....It--the Hoover administration--has chosen the easiest, but the most humiliating method: it wishes to aid the unemployed through charity....</p>
   <p>We remember that Hoover,while serving as the American Food Commissioner <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>during the World War, was successful in organizing relief and alleviating the suffering of the Belgians. Equipped with this experience, he is preparing for the coming winter and for the very critical presidential election..</p>
   <p>We must concern ourselves with charitable movements, because winter is approaching rapidly, and from the intensive national and governmental relief activities we can conclude that there will be no recovery from the business and industrial slump and that this winter will find millions of people out of work. Therefore, the millions of unfortunates must be taken care of..</p>
   <p>This will be the third hard winter since the fall of 1929, when the crash started this world economic depression. It is natural that all classes and strata of society should feel that we are living in hard times. Those who expect miracles are doomed to disappointment, because miracles will neither solve the economic crisis nor alleviate the hardships of a bitter winter. We, too, will do well, if in the given circumstances we make suitable <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>preparations for the fast-approaching winter.</p>
   <p>The city of Chicago has already begun a campaign for contributions to provide the unfortunates with clothing, food, and fuel. All the organized charitable institutions of Chicago will cooperate with one another this winter, and charity in Chicago will be systematized....The city charitable institutions conduct their activities on a scientific and practical basis. Their personnel have years of experience and are all especially trained in social science.</p>
   <p>We note the foregoing primarily to reassure our readers and secondly to provide them with an example. It is a well-known fact that the Chicago Hungarians, too, are hard hit by the depression. We know that during the past two winters many of our wealthier countrymen, as well as our societies, were called upon to contribute to the aid of our Hungarian brothers. By the beginning of this month we had already been notified of five Hungarian charitable movements.</p>
   <p>The willing spirit and motivating power behind these Hungarian "help your <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>fellowmen" movements are touching and praiseworthy. However, even these Hungarian charitable movements must be conducted systematically this year. We have only words of praise for those wealthy individuals who conduct their own charity work and give of their worldly goods to others who are less fortunate, but for those, who wish to practice charity through organized channels we have a few words of advice.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian unemployed of Chicago will have as much right to apply for public aid as any other Chicago resident. Probably many of them will turn to the city agencies, because undoubtedly many Hungarians are facing this winter without employment. We know, too, that our wealthier countrymen and those who are steadily employed contribute as freely to public charities as any other Chicagoans. On the other hand, we also know that the nine-million-dollar city fund, which will be distributed to the needy this winter, will leave many homes cold, many children unclothed, many sick unattended and without medicine, and that some of our countrymen who have seen better days will probably not have enough to eat.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>It is only natural, therefore, that individual national groups are endeavoring to do charitable work among themselves to aid their countrymen in facing the relentless rigors of winter. The same humane motives also characterize the charitable movements in Hungarian circles.</p>
   <p>It is expected that these Hungarian charitable movements will supplement city aid, that in fact we will call upon city charity only when it becomes imperative to supplement our own charities. This will depend, however, upon the amount of money the Hungarians can accumulate for this purpose. One thing certain is that it is to the interest of our unemployed and needy that the Hungarian churches and societies organize their charitable activities and centralize them to induce co-operation with the city fund.....</p>
   <p>In this widespread unemployment situation many of our modest countrymen are seeking public aid for the first time. They must not be made to suffer because of the professional beggar.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>The methodical, unbiased, fair practice of charity is a requisite of organized action. Those who dispense charity impulsively in these lean troubled months do good with one hand and with the other withhold aid to worthy, needy families; in other words, they are unjust.</p>
   <p>It will be easier for us, as Hungarians, to investigate a Hungarian applicant for charity than for the city authorities to do so, and we can thus be of assistance to the authorities and to the applicant as well....</p>
   <p>The first step is to organize the charitably inclined Hungarian churches and societies. We owe this much to those of whom we expect contributions. It would not be fair to solicit contributions from one individual repeatedly, while others are not even approached once. Just as an applicant may receive aid from all sources if there is no system in the dispensation of charity, a stingy, well-to-do countryman may evade making a contribution if there is no record of the contributors.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>We repeat that we are not concerned with the individual actions of our wealthy countrymen, but we do advise those churches and societies to which needy Hungarians would turn not to shun publicity, thereby making things more difficult for the applicant and for those who would contribute money and time.</p>
   <p>The Magyar Tribune, as always, offers its help in these charitable activities. However, if anyone attempts to exploit this movement for his own selfish motives, this newspaper will expose such acts relentlessly.</p>
