   <p>The Hungarian Working Men's Self-Educational Society, Lodge No. 53, started a very useful and beneficial work when it decided to hold free scientific lectures for the Magyar public.</p>
   <p>The next lecture will be given by Dr. Ernest Lowinger, physician and fellow-patriot, who will speak about venereal diseases. The lecture will be given at 3 P.M. Sunday, Feb. 3, in the Red Men's Hall, 4118 W. Lake St.</p>
   <p>We recommend these lectures to the Magyars and urge all to attend them. There is no admission charge.</p>
