   <p>One of the outstanding Hungarian newspapers, the Szabadsag (Liberty), has been publishing the history of the Hungarian people in American in installments. The readers of this newspaper are usually interested only in the news items, and they barely glance through the section which contains this important and interesting history.</p>
   <p>People do not realize what a serious undertaking it was for the Szabadsag and for Geza Kende, who was entrusted with compiling this history. It has always been found important to make notations of important functions of societies and other Hungarian organizations, but up to the present time no one has had the time, or perhaps the serious thought, to start writing the history of the Hungarian-Americans.</p>
   
   <p>It is indeed a noble and great deed of the Szabadsag and its editor, Dr. Cserna, who, with Geza Kende, gathered this material and arranged it for publication.</p>
   <p>We, as editors of newspapers, realize perhaps better than anyone else how important an undertaking this was. We know how important it will be in years to come, when someone wants to know what the Hungarian people did to help build such great American cities as Chicago, New York, Cleveland, Toledo, etc.</p>
   <p>The history that appeared in the Szabadsag is now being printed in book form. The first book deals with the period from 1583, when the first Hungarian set foot on American soil, to the time of the Civil War. One of the most important parts of the book contains the history of Louis Kossuth and his travels in America.</p>
   <p>We think it rather important that the Hungarian people of America and their children get acquainted with this history which deals with the things our forefathers did for this country and the hardships they had to overcome. We know that the younger generation will feel mighty proud of themselves when they find out what an important part was played by the Hungarians in the Civil War.</p>
   <p>Geza Kende is a newspaper writer and a very good one at that. In his first book he wrote elegantly and truthfully about the pioneer work done by our forefathers in preparing the present America for us.</p>
   <p>The second volume will be a more difficult piece of history to write because it will deal with a more active and trying situation than did the first volume. This second volume deals mostly with Hungarian-American history during the past twenty-five years.</p>
   <p>We recommend that all our readers buy these books so that they may become acquainted with the role of the Hungarian in the development of the United States.</p>
   
   <p>We will write in a more detailed manner about the second volume in a later issue.</p>
