   <p>The slogan, "Justice for Hungary," originated in America. In this slogan, the sorrows and tragedies of a nation, and the injustice of the Treaty of Trianon, are expressed. This demand was "carved indelibly on the skies" between Budapest, Rome, Paris, London, and Washington, by the Hungarian fliers, and is the instrument of our search for justice.</p>
   <p>Sandor Magyar, the Hungarian Press has invited the pilot of the "Justice for Hungary," on its trans-oceanic flight, to be its guest. He will be with us next week. Emil Szalay, who made the flight possible by his financial assistance, will be a guest also.</p>
