   <p>We have at all times urged, and will continue to urge, our youth to take an active interest in American life. America is the land of their birth and, undoubtedly, will be their final resting place.</p>
   <p>American history is as much theirs as it is those whose ancestors came over on the Mayflower.</p>
   <p>And yet we have never failed to urge our youth to dedicate a portion of their time also to a study of the history, tradition, culture, and language of the country from whence their parents came. This, in no way, conflicts with American life and demands. American ideals do not demand that we become so narrow-minded as to ignore everything but that which is American. On the contrary, America urges us to become familiar with the best that other nations can offer. America is sufficiently fair-minded to realize that the main roots of its civilization are buried in the soil of the old world, and that its culture is principally a combination of European tradition and American environment.</p>
   
   <p>"Very good", say our readers, "I am willing to study the Hungarian language, history, and culture, but what practical value will I derive from this study other than that of becoming a more cultured person?"</p>
   <p>This question is taken under consideration by a French scholar and pedagogue, Abbe Ernest Dimnet, who, after touring America, recorded some of his observations in his book, "The Art of Thinking." The book is excellent and should be read by all young American-Hungarians. It is written in English.</p>
   <p>In a chapter entitled "Obstacles of Thought," the writer delves into the so-called "parasitic" thoughts, and then goes on to "How mental parasites are produced" by criticizing the methods used in educating children in American schools.</p>
   <p>Abbe Dimnet proceeds to show how important a role the knowledge of Latin and Greek play in the development of culture, not to mention knowledge of modern languages. But in America, he says the study of foreign languages is hindered by one great "parasite:" "The mass wants easy methods, and so the methods are easy. It wants immediate results, and practicability is considered first. Easy methods seem to be a dogma with Americans," As a result, Dimnet's book, "French Grammar Made Clear," has been misquoted many times because French grammar cannot be made easy. Nor can Latin grammar. Both ought to be made clear and interesting.</p>
   <p>As we can readily see, this applies just as well to Hungarian grammar and composition as to any other language. In the study of the Hungarian language, the very best psychology is to persuade the pupil that hundreds of people less intelligent than he have conquered those dry beginnings by mere perseverance.</p>
   <p>We bring this to the attention of our readers. Let them not fall into the error of regarding the study of the Hungarian language from the purely utilitarian viewpoint, but let them bear in mind the words of Abbe Dimnet that "Utilitarianism in education is as disastrous to culture as the easy methods are to scholarship."</p>
