   <p>p.2.............In the Hungarian Roman Catholic Church, Burnside, the missionary week will begin this Sunday, March 18. Two guests, Dominican Father Cornelius Bohle and Bertalan Badalik, will officiate at the invitation of Father Stephen Soltesz, pastor of the church.</p>
   <p>Both distinguished guests have done much in the way of church work in Budapest. They are from the Dominican Church in the capitol of Hungary. Father Bohle is a great orator and author. His prayer book, Queen of the Rosary is the best liked of all new religious books.</p>
   <p>The Dominicans look back to seven-hundred years of religious work in Hungary. The "Credo" Society, a sister organization of the Sacred Heart, has forty-four branches. Father Bohle and Badalik take part in the society's direction.</p>
   <p>No doubt many will go to hear these fathers during their stay in Chicago and with true penitence partake of the Sacraments. With stronger faith, they shall prepare for the coming of Easter.</p>
   
   <p>Services during missionary week: 5:30 A. M. low mass, 9:00 A. M. high mass, 7:30 P. M. holy blessing and oratory. The missionary week is from March 18 to 25, inclusive.</p>
