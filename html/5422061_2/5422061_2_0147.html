   <p>We present Micholas Gaspar, the painter, who came to America after the war, and settled in Chicago. His life, naturally, was full of struggles. And yet, on that road, so difficult to most artists where so many fail, and even perish - he succeeded. He did not have anybody to encourage him, yet he succeeded. Every step toward success was a struggle. But he fought the battle. Today, not only are there many in America, and especially in Chicago, who know the name of Nicholas Gasper; but according to experts,he possesses one of Chicago's first art studios. It is a large grand church-like place.</p>
   <p>The wall paintings of Nicholas Gaspar are best, and most widely known in America. For example, it was he who painted the famous frescoes of the Chicago Medinah Athletic Club. There are also many churches, whose walls are decorated by the religious paintings he has done.</p>
   <p>In the contest for plans of the famous Chicago Tribune Tower his design won the third prize. This in itself is quite a feat.</p>

   <p>At the Century of Progress Exposition his forty-eight pictures constituted the best part in the decoration of the General Motors Building. The frescoes of the Fisher Building in Detroit, which are known all over the United States, also is a testimony of the genius of Nicholas Gaspar. So then, the discovery of the Hungarian's genius, "is after all, not a mere tale."</p>
   <p>Nicholas Gaspar is the child of the present generation, his art developed, so-to-speak, before our eyes into a mighty universal art. We remembered him here almost as "in a nutshell," but we hope we will have an opportunity to say more about him in these columns to come in the future.</p>
