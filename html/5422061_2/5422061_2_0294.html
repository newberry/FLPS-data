   <p>The Catholic Magyar Amateur and Youth Circle gave an enjoyable and greatly applauded performance Sunday afternoon in the Social Hall of the Chicago North Side Hungarian Catholic Church. The stage director, as well as the amateurs, did everything in his power to make a success of this afternoon, in order to serve the Hungarian Culture. Both the arrangement and the performance were excellent, and that is the reason why the show turned out so well. Two one-act plays were shown--"When the Dead Come Back" and "The Suitors of the Girl".</p>
