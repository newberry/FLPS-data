   <p>Bela Martay, violin virtuoso, has returned from a five year stay in Europe to the home of his parents on the West Side of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Press wrote at length about Bela Martay five years ago; and he at that time, gave promise of becoming a great artist.</p>
   <p>Bela Martay studied diligently for five years under the tutelage of the greatest masters in Europe, among them Jeno Hubay.</p>
   <p>We greet the young virtuoso in our midst and hope to hear him in a concert soon.</p>
