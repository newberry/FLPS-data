   <p>The writer of this column has been a resident of Chicago for quite some time, and has sorrowfully followed the activities and services rendered the Chicago Hungarian Roman Catholic people, and has noted that the Hungarian Roman Catholics of the North Side of Chicago are seriously in need of a parish which would tie these Hungarians closer to the religious life and the teachings of Christ. A few months ago I read an article in the Magyar Tribune, which was written by Father Lipot Mosonyi; this article gave a very clear picture of the situation as it exists in Chicago today. Dr. Mosonyi pointed out very concretely the need for a Hungarian Roman Catholic church on the North Side of Chicago. A church to these people would not only be of moral importance, but would also bring them closer together socially.</p>
   <p>At that time I gave Dr. Mosonyi credit for his declaration and I felt that every good Catholic felt the same way about this matter, and that with a little effort a <span class="page-break">2</span>Hungarian Catholic parish could be realized. The truth about the matter is that those Hungarian Roman Catholics living on the North Side of Chicago could build a beautiful parish which would be a credit to the Hungarian population of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Naturally these possibilities would depend on the type of priest that would be put here, because these plans cannot be achieved through fanaticism, but may be accomplished by the teaching of the gospel in the name of Christ.</p>
   <p>Dr. Lipot Mosonyi was in Chicago a short time ago with the idea of organizing a parish on the North Side of Chicago. In a personal letter to me, he informed me that he had tried to contact Father Soltesz. He asked Father Soltesz of the Burnside Hungarian Roman Catholic church, to help the Hungarian Roman Catholic people of the North Side in their work to organize a parish of their own.</p>
   <p>It is a sad situation, but Father Soltesz was afraid that his financial income might be endangered, and he simply turned his head and declared that there were <span class="page-break">3</span>not enough Hungarian Roman Catholic people on the North Side, and a Hungarian parish was unnecessary. This poor hungry priest even went so far as to inform his immediate superior, the monsignor, in order that the idea might never go further.</p>
   <p>Does this represent the teachings of Christ? Is this what Christ would have done? When a priest deals this way with his brothers, because he is financially hungry, it is detrimental to the Hungarian Catholic population of Chicago. Christ told us to love thy neighbor as thyself. This commandment cannot be found anywhere in the principles of Father Soltesz.</p>
   <p>Instead of love, hatred is practiced by this man who is only playing the part of a priest. How blessed his work is can readily be seen by his activities when he forced Father Farkas out of this parish, and the people were divided into two factions. The real Christians are those who can't forget that Father Soltesz literally forced Father Farkas out, although the personalities of those two men are very different.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>I could tell my Romen Catholic brothers much more about this matter, and if Father Soltesz would like me to tell more, I would be only too glad to do so.</p>
   <p>The idea of writing this editorial struck me when on March 9 I attended the funeral services of a very good Hungarian Catholic friend. The quality of this service was far below the quality of the usual Hungarian Catholic funeral services.</p>
   <p>I once asked Father Soltesz what the spiritual effects would be if he were the really fancy robes instead of the plainer and lighter ones, during funeral services. His very plain and simple answer was that there was no difference; he said that I shouldn't for a moment think that he would wear those robes which were much heavier and much more beautiful unless he were adequately paid for it. This is the way we stand, my doer Hungarian Catholic brothers, with regard to our priest whose jealous attitude is an obstacle to us.</p>
   <p>I have been thinking of writing this editorial for years, but now this North Side funeral and the articles that were written by Dr. Lipot Mosonyi have forced me to take my pen in hand. The respectable Hungarians of Burnside have known me for <span class="page-break">5</span>quite some time, and they know very well that I am familiar with the circumstances which tore them away from Father Farkas who was replaced by Father Soltesz. The Hungarian Catholics did not like this move; this can be seen by the number of Hungarian Catholics who attend services at the Irish Catholic Church in that locality.</p>
   <p>I do not want to bother Father Soltesz's quiet and fattening life in Burnside, but I do protest in the name of the Hungarian Roman Catholics of the North Side against his forcing himself upon us and especially upon the Archbishop. He can keep his flock in Burnside; we do not know him and we do not want to become acquainted with him.</p>
   <p>We want an ideal priest of Christ and not a priest who is only interested in getting fat and accumulating great wealth and is anti-Christ.</p>
