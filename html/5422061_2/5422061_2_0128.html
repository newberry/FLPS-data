   <p>p.4... Every Hungarian should tune in on WTAY at 6:45 P.M. December 20, because Gyozo Szabadi, a graduate of the Conservatory of Music in Budapest, will give a violin concert. His accompanist at the piano is also Hungarian, Louis Gregsamer of Budapest.</p>
   <p>Gyozo Szabadi is quite a young man who has already gained an enviable reputation, and we hope that in time he will be known as one of the wonder-violinists of Hungary. At present he has a studio in Chicago at 4140 Wilcox St.</p>
