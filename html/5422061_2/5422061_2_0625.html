   <p>p.2. The Hungarian day - summer school's 125 pupils will have their final public examination at the Magyar Home on August 10.</p>
   <p>These children enrolled in the summer school as soon as the American public schools closed. They have foregone the pleasures of their vacation for the opportunity of learning about Hungary and our religion. In the summer time, instead of cooling off in the lake as their American friends were doing, they studied. They have their reward in as much as they have made nice progress in reading and writing of the language of their parents, also they have learned quite a bit of the history of Hungary.</p>
   <p>Everyone is invited to attend the final examinations, which will be combined with a church bazaar.</p>
