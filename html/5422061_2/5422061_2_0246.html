   <p>Again a thousand people were present at a Hungarian performance. We speak of the successful benefit concert held last Sunday, in the Apollo Theater. A thousand people saw the performance, which proves that one can bring together a large Hungarian audience if one offers something worthwhile.</p>
   <p>We are glad to see that at long last something is being done to help the unemployed. Our congratulations spring from our very heart at the sight of this success, as there will be many of the poor who will partake of the funds derived from this performance.</p>
   <p>A thousand people were present, a thousand people applauded this Hungarian performance, where our artists reaped a Hungarian success.</p>
