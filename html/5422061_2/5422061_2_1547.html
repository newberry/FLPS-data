   <p>Martin Dies, Democratic Congressman, has found a new way to put an end to unemployment. Dies, who cannot be one hundred per cent Anglo-Saxon, judging from his name, has already submitted a bill to Congress last year. According to this bill, those foreigners who are not naturalized should be deported and immigration restricted to the lowest figure. Congress has not voted on this bill yet, and Dies is demanding early action.</p>
   <p>According to Dies, there is a multitude of illegal entries in this country, besides 6,200,000 aliens here who are not naturalized. These foreigners, says Dies, send approximately three hundred million dollars to Europe annually.</p>
   <p>Needless to say that Dies' data is fictitious.</p>
