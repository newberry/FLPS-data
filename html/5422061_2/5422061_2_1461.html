   <p>A contract was entered into between the Elmwood Memorial Park Company, Inc., as the proprietor of the Elmwood Cemetery in River Grove, Illinois, and the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association under the following terms:</p>
   <p>1. The Elmwood Memorial Park Company binds itself to turn over the land designated on the attached map of the "Hungarian Section" as numbers seven and eight, in the form of cemetery lots, each containing 108 square feet or more (on the southeast fractional quarter of Section 28, Township 40, Range 12 in Cook County, Illinois), without any special obligation, to the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association, so that the Association in return can sell the lots to Chicago Hungarians without profit under the following conditions.</p>
   <p>2. The purchasers of the first thirty lots have the privilege of paying $175 instead of $250 in the designated section, if they make a down payment <span class="page-break">2</span>of ten per cent of the purchase price and arrange to pay the balance on terms of $7.88 semi-annually during a period of ten years, no interest to be charged in the first two years, but six per cent to be charged there-after. The buyer has a right to pay the full amount at any time.</p>
   <p>3. Any Hungarian, regardless of religion, may purchase any of the first thirty lots for the price of $175 by making a down payment of ten per cent and arranging to pay the balance in equal installments without interest in twenty-four months.</p>
   <p>4. After the payment of ten per cent of the purchase price of the first thirty lots, any Hungarian organization may purchase cemetery lots at $175 for its members (at least thirty lots per organization) and pay for them during a period of five years, the first two years without interest and thereafter at six per cent. The first payment in these cases is also ten per cent.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>5. In the event that two hundred lots are sold within ninety days, and a payment of ten per cent is made on their purchase price, the Elmwood Memorial Park Company binds itself to turn over the lots designated on the attached map of Section Nine according to the terms of this contract as stated in paragraphs three and four. If the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association cannot sell the lots designated on the attached maps within a year, a prolongation of the option must be requested from the Elmwood Memorial Park Company.</p>
   <p>6. After the payment of ten per cent of the purchase price of one thousand lots, the Elmwood Memorial Park Company binds itself to set up a Hungarian monument, planned by a Hungarian artist, the cost of which cannot be less than four thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>7. The Elmwood Memorial Park Company binds itself to give a deed to each purchaser through the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association. Furthermore, it binds itself through the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association to keep <span class="page-break">4</span>the purchased cemetery lots in good condition forever (sprinkling, mowing, etc.).</p>
   <p>8. It is understood that the Elmwood Memorial Park Company guarantees that the purchasers of the individual lots will have nothing else to pay nor have any other obligations than the purchase price.</p>
   <p>9. The charter members of the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association are not obligated to buy or sell any lots besides those actually purchased by them. The Elmwood Memorial Park Company cannot hold the charter members liable for any unsold lots.</p>
   <p>10. The Elmwood Memorial Park Company binds itself to give wide publicity to the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association, and will assume the expenses of advertising, if the cost does not exceed ten per cent of the purchase price. Furthermore, the Elmwood Memorial Park Company will pay one dollar--if ten per cent of the purchase price is paid--from the sales price of each <span class="page-break">5</span>lot to the Chicago West Side Hungarian Reformed Church for the use of the pastor's office, through which the sales are to be handled.</p>
   <p>11. The lots in the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery can be sold only through the sole agents, the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association, and in every instance when an individual or a Hungarian organization wishes to purchase some of these lots, the Elmwood Memorial Park Company will notify the managing office of the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association or instruct the prospective buyers to contact representatives of the Association directly.</p>
   <p>12. In case a purchaser of a cemetery lot dies without leaving any heirs and only ten per cent of the purchase price has been paid, he is to be buried on his lot, but the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association is liable for the unpaid balance, since the lot automatically reverts back to it. However, in any case, the body, once buried, cannot be disturbed.</p>
   <p>13. The Elmwood Memorial Park Company is obligated to reserve a parcel of <span class="page-break">6</span>land, 12 x 24 feet, for a Hungarian monument, upon the receipt of the down payment on the first thirty lots, without any extra charge, this parcel to become the property of the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association when ten per cent of the purchase price of a thousand lots is paid.</p>
   <p>14. The Elmwood Memorial Park Company binds itself to make no change in the price of the lots for a period of one year (beginning today)--that is, lots of 108 square feet or more, instead of costing $250, will cost the Chicago Hungarian Cemetery Association's members $175.</p>
