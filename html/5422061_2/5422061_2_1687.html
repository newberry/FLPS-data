   <p>Thomas Masaryk, the aged president of Czechoslovakia, an astute politician, announced that there is room for discussion about boundary adjustment--in other words, revision--where the territories are populated by Hungarians.</p>
   <p>Naturally, Benes and his followers, who hate the Magyars, protested loudly against this.</p>
   <p>The fact is that the thought of territorial and boundary adjustment is gaining ground even in Czechoslovakia and Rumania. On the other hand, it must be admitted that the greatest hindrance to revision is the [present] internal reactionary turmoil [that prevails in Hungary], which makes it impossible for neutral and important public opinion to stand by Hungary's rights.....</p>
   
   <p>We American Hungarians, faithful children of the country of our birth, vainly try to present the plight of Hungary in a favorable light--the intelligent stranger can't be convinced because of the present reactionary politics of the Hungarian government.</p>
   <p>How could one write or talk in America about revision when, out of a clear sky, the Daily News, together with its whole syndicated service, publishes a series of articles, by John Gunther, in which the author gives an account of his experiences in Hungary?</p>
   <p>For a whole week, John Gunther--whose opinion is accepted not only by the Daily News and other newspapers but by Harper's Magazine as well--presented a series of articles about Hungary.</p>
   <p>His articles mean well; they constitute a historical analysis, a criticism [of present conditions in Hungary]. Whenever he can, he praises the Hungarians--their hospitality, wine, cuisine, nobility, the natural beauty of the country, and Budapest. Undoubtedly, our excellent food and beautiful women did not dull his perceptions.</p>
   <p>With his keen insight, he saw the misery [of Hungary] and the reason for it. It would require many of our memorial services on the anniversary of Trianon to make the American public forget the writings of John Gunther.</p>
   <p>So that our readers who have not read John Gunther's articles may get an idea of what we mean, we are publishing here a few excerpts taken from them.</p>
   <p>One of the articles, entitled "Hungary's Land Owned by a Few Noblemen," says:</p>
   <p>"Hungary reached the modern world very late, later than any European country save Russia. Serfdom in Hungary was abolished only in 1832; the nobility was tax exempt until 1848, and Latin was the official language of the government until the same year.</p>
   
   <p>"Some of the landowners have been rescued by the settlement of the optant dispute with Rumania. This dispute involved 610,000 acres belonging to some sixty magnates, taken by Rumania after the treaty of Trianon, but to be paid for by the Rumanian government. After ten years of squabbling, the Rumanians have agreed to pay--out of the Hungarian reparations account! This was decided by the recent Oriental reparations conference in Paris, with the result that the hard-pressed Hungarian taxpayer is in fact refunding the Hungarian noblemen for the loss of their estates. Rumania pays nothing. Count Bethlen, the prime minister, was one of the Transylvanian property owners to whom repayment is due now. He will receive, I am told, 11,000,000 pengoes (about $1,950,000), but even this enormous sum is less than his estates are worth.</p>
   <p>"The crucial domestic problem of Hungary is land reform. Frontiers or no frontiers, king or no king, the question of the land remains.</p>
   <p>"There are upward of 9,000,000 horses in Hungary today. And there are today exactly 6,672 private automobiles. Hungary, in other words, is backward--another reason. Beyond all this is something fundamental. Hungary is potentially one of the richest agricultural countries in Europe; yet the poverty of Hungary is all but intolerable.....</p>
   <p>The condition of this mass of people (850,000 peasants)--one tenth of the total population of Hungary--is extraordinarily miserable. Thousands are unemployed (estimates vary from 125,000 to 200,000).....The wages of these peasants run from 1.20 pengoes to two pengoes (20 cents to 35 cents) a day--when there is work. Their wives and children get less.....</p>
   <p>"Domestically the results are even worse. It is not exaggeration to say that people are starving in Hungary today.....Hunger marches have begun in Budapest. Up in the North, people say, peasants are being buried in sacks, because they can afford coffins no longer."</p>
   
   <p>Naturally there is nothing in the foregoing that we Americans of Hungarian origin did not know.....John Gunther's articles only add support to the assertions of this newspaper regarding conditions in our mother country.....</p>
   <p>With the exception of Russia, no other country was criticized in such a manner by an American news reporter. Try to repudiate all he writes and blame it all on the treaty of Trianon! The result would be that we would be ridiculed.....</p>
   <p>Until there is a change in order inside of Hungary, we Hungarians in America can't win sympathy for our mother country.....</p>
