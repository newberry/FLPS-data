   <p>Last Sunday evening the Chicago People's Theater, under the direction of Jeno Endrey, gave a brilliant performance at the North Side Turner Hall. The operetta "My Broken Violin" was written by Emil Zerkovitz.</p>
   <p>The North Side Turner Hall was nearly filled to capacity by theater-loving Hungarians.</p>
   <p>The story of the operetta differs from others. The battle between jazz and gypsy music, bobbed and long hair, the modern and the old-fashioned wife, are combined into a delightful tale.....</p>
   <p>After the curtain came down on the second act, Endrey addressed the audience.....He told of the attack that was launched against him and the Chicago People's Theater. He refuted the charge that the Company is on the verge of bankruptcy. Furthermore, Endrey said that the stockholders had all received the interest and dividends on their shares.....Many stockholders who were present testified publicly to the truth of Endrey's statement.</p>
