   <p>There is turmoil in the whole world, but it seems that the unfortunate people of Hungary are suffering more than others. Not long ago, I was in Hungary and saw the terrible conditions there. They face a hard winter, if the American-Hungarians do not extend a helping hand immediately.</p>
   <p>After the War, the American Red Cross, whom I represented there, did wonderful service in relieving poverty and suffering. Because I love the Magyar people, and wish to aid them, I ask the help of the American-Hungarians.</p>
   <p>Everyone of us has someone in Hungary, father, mother, brother or other relatives, to whom we can send something. Picture the joy of the recipients of a package containing clothes, shoes, and food.</p>

   <p>The S. S. Dresden leaves on September 17 with my cargo of gifts. There is still time for you to prepare a package and send it with mine. I will personally see that each gift is delivered to the addressee.</p>
   <p>I wish to mention that the packages must contain only such articles of necessity as clothes or food. No one should send radios, gramophones, perfume or tobacco, because the duty on these in Hungary is very high.</p>
   <p>All packages must be sent to Capt. James G. Pedlow, 1505 First Avenue, New York City.</p>
