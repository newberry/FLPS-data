   <p>The Endre Ady Circle decided at a meeting, at the Kellshore Tea Room's meeting hall, to send the following wire to Count Michael Karolyi:</p>
   <p>Count Michael Karolyi,</p>
   <p>Paris.</p>
   <p>"The Endre Ady Literary Club greets your coming to the United States with the greatest joy and considers your entry as a victory over reaction, and respectfully invites you to give a lecture, under our auspices, before the Hungarians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Endre Ady Literary Club,</p>
   
   <p>Paul Soos, President,</p>
   <p>Bela Ruhig, Vice-President."</p>
   <p>As evidenced by the foregoing, the Hungarians of Chicago have expressed their desire to hear Michael Karolyi. We are glad to bring news about this notable decision and congratulate the brave progressive men and women who have invited this great Hungarian exile to Chicago, thereby giving him an opportunity to make himself and his life known to us. The events of his career are milestones in Hungarian history.</p>
   <p>It is time now to prepare for a reception appropriate and due to such a distinguished personage as Count Karolyi. Chicago Hungarians! Receive him with respect and love.</p>
   <p>If any of our readers wish to help and take active part in the arrangements, our staff or the president of the Reception Committee, Bela Ruhig, will be glad to give further information.</p>
