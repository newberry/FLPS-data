   <p>Almost all the nations of the world, even such obscure lands as Lithuania and Latvia, which only in recent years were brought back to life, recognize the necessity of being represented at the World's Fair, which opens at the end of this month under the name of A Century of Progress, and where man's accomplishments in industry, art, and science during the last century will be exhibited.</p>
   <p>It is to be regretted that our thousand-year-old Hungary, guardian of Western civilization against Eastern Europe, will be the only nation conspicuous by its absence at the Exposition. Official Hungary tries to blame the depression, with the social institutions in the old country playing the same old tune of destitution. This has been carried so far that we fear the Hungarians will play no role at the Exposition. Just imagine, Hungary, one of the oldest and worthiest nations in the world, left out in the cold! It is with great satisfaction that we hear now that the Hungarians here at long last woke up and, through the Federation of Associations, will tell the world they are alive, and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that Hungary is not dead but just sleeping. What role the Federation will play is at present not yet clear. The belated action of the Federation had been preceded by the action of the directors of the Hungarian radio hour in Hammond, who decided to present a radio hour of Hungarian songs and music to the millions visiting the Exposition. This action will in some measure counterbalance, so far as our reputation of cultured people is concerned, the negligence, partly due to our poverty and partly to our indifference, on the part of the Hungarians.</p>
   <p>The directors of the Hammond Hungarian radio hour, fully aware of their duties, have signed a contract for the duration of the Exposition, that is to say, six months. The contract entitles them to use the 750-seat studio of the broad-casting station, right within the Fair grounds, and to broadcast twice a week Hungarian masterpieces of music and song.</p>
   <p>This enterprise, which serves to bring fame and recognition to the Hungarians, deserves all praise and should be supported by the public, the more so as it <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>could be done without any material sacrifice on the part of anybody.</p>
   <p>To cover the expenses necessary to maintain this service, the management of the radio hour will give a ball on June 4 at the Hungarian Home.</p>
