   <p>p.2....................The South Chicago First Hungarian Sick Benefit Society at its meeting on September 11, decided to greet Lord Rothermere by cable and assure him of the society's co-operation in the movement which he is sponsoring (Revision of the Treaty or Trianon).</p>
   <p>The society added its contribution to that of its President,Ambrose Benko.</p>
   <p>The society asks the other Hungarian societies in Chicago to do their share and take part of this worthy movement. The members should discuss it at their meetings and act as all true Hungarians must.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Magyar Club together with four Milwaukee organizations set an example to be followed, and if the nearly one-hundred Hungarian societies will do their share, results can be obtained.</p>
