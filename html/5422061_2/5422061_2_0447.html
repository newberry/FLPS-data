   <p>On February 1, the Hungarian branch of the Twentieth Century Ladies' Society sponsored a dance which they called "The Peace Party." The Hall in which this celebration was held was too small to accommodate this party. There was entertainment for young and old. On the whole, the entertainment was very good, but there was one act which was outstanding. Two little girls, about 8 years of age, Rose Friedman and Gertude Biss, performed a number of Hungarian folk dances and American ballet dances. The affair was a complete success, the society reports.</p>
