   <p>The amateur group of Branch Number 346 of the Verhovay Aid Association presented a very successful play last Saturday evening at the Social Hall of the Hungarian Catholic Church--which hall, the author himself, William Feifar, decorated for this occasion. The title of the one-act play Feifar wrote, and which he himself arranged for the stage, is "What the Old Woman Is Good for." The play deserved the great applause it received. The public was very much pleased at the display of artistic decorations and enjoyed the performance greatly.</p>
   <p>We do not want to flatter the author, but we have to admit that he wrote this one-act play excellently and arranged it for the stage masterly. [Translator's Note: Here the article goes on to praise each of the fourteen players and other persons connected with the play.] The music was furnished by the newly organized band of the Verhovay Aid Association. Those who didn't come to see this play have missed an unforgettable and agreeable evening.</p>
