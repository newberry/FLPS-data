   <p>The editors of this newspaper have been informed that the Chicago Hungarian Independent Song Society will present the famous Hungarian Operetta, Prince Bob at the North Side Turner Hall on March 7, 1919, under the direction of the well-known Chicago Hungarian, Mr. Paul Berak.</p>
   <p>We have also found out that the principal parts in this operetta will be taken by such well-known Hungarian actors and actresses as, Mr. Michael Redey, Mrs. Petrovics, and Irma Almassy. We think that the fact that these people are in the cast of players is enough to guarantee that the performance will be of the very best grade. We believe that the Chicago Hungarians are going to witness a production of which they will be proud, and they should be especially thankful to Mr. Paul Berak for his tireless effort in producing this play.</p>
