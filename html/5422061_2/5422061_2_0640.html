   <p>The Hungarian Patriotic Association has taken upon itself to educate the Hungarian people in public speaking and in the principles of the English language.</p>
   <p>These classes were opened last week, and despite the fact that the weather was hot, there was a large turnout.</p>
   <p>The school was opened by an address by Louis Nagy, who later introduced Joseph Rakos, the president of the Association, who told the prospective students why this association is engaged in this work. This speech impressed the audience, since it came from a man who belongs to the working class of Hungarians. President Rakos then introduced Mr. Zarniczkyt, representing the State Council of Defense, a member of the editorial staff of the Chicago Daily Tribune, who praised the work of the Association in seeking to acquaint the Hungarian people with the objects of Germany in the war.</p>

   <p>The next class will be held on June 18 in the State Council of Defense Building, located at 120 West Adams Street.</p>
