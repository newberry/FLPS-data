   <p>p.2. The Knights of Columbus, Catholic organization will arrange a charity carnival at the Sherman Hotel on December 11, 12 and 13. The net receipts will be used to aid the Chicago poor, cripples, and the unemployed.</p>
   <p>Tickets for the carnival are being sold by a number of young ladies. The young woman, who sells the most tickets will receive a Cadillac automobile and a trip to Cuba. We vote one Hungarian lady's name on the list. She is Miss Violet Kemeth Joo.</p>
   <p>We wish to call the attention of our readers to the fact that at the coronation of Miss Columbia, the winner, there will be huge crowds and in the event of Miss Joo's victory, the Hungarian question of the injustice of the Treaty of Trianon will be publicized. Therefore, if anyone offers tickets to the carnival to our readers in Miss Joo's name, please do not refuse, because the sale of each ticket means 125 votes.</p>
