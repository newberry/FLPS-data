   <p>Of late, conditions have changed so greatly in Hungary that they have caused a large number of professional people to emigrate. Of these professional people a large number are doctors, many of whom have come to Chicago and settled opening their practice here.</p>
   <p>Because many of these doctors are unacquainted with one another, Dr. Oscar Offner took it upon himself to bring these men together for an evening where they might get better acquainted with one another. So last Wednesday night at the Schwartz Restaurant, this meeting was called together at which time there were twenty-three doctors present.</p>
   <p>It was decided that these get-togethers would be held monthly in order that different topics relating to the medical profession might be discussed, and many of the new theories of medicine threshed out.</p>

   <p>This is the first time that the Hungarian doctors of Chicago have ever tried anything like this.</p>
