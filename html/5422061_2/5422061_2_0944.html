   <p>The idea that we must make some provision for the aged Hungarian-American people has been in our minds for a long time. Articles were written about it and there were discussions. However there were no results until a group was organized which set this idea as its goal. It is called "The American-Hungarian Old Peoples' Home Association of America." This noble institution wants to take care of those aged Hungarians, who have worked for decades in steel mills, mines, and elsewhere. Many of these workers did save money for their old age but they lost it during the depression years. With their savings gone, their homes lost, and being unable <span class="page-break">\2</span>to find employment because they are too old, they were forced to turn to charity for relief.</p>
   <p>It is necessary, therefore to have such an instituition that will care for these unfortunates. We ask the Hungarians to rally around the flag of this cause, so that this noble institution may become a reality.</p>
   <p>Several benefit parties are being planned by organizations in Chicago and vicinity. The Burnside people will have a bunco party on April 25.</p>
