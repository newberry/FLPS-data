   <p>The Chicago-Hungarians feel very much relieved now that they can communicate with Hungary by mail.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian Patriotic Association of Chicago has made arrangements with the American Red Cross, who will act as a forwarding agency for all mail coming to and going from Hungarians in the United States. The Hungarian Patriotic Association has also made arrangements with the Immigrant Protective League, at 324 South Halsted Street to have a Hungarian in their offices twice a week to receive the letters personally from all those who belong to the Hungarian Patriotic Association and can identify themselves as such. The Immigrants Protective League will then forward these letters to the Red Cross.</p>
