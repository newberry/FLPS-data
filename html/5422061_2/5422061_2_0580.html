   <p>Tuesday, Nov. 5, Dr. Elmer Horvath, correspondent of the Royal Hungarian Chamber of Commerce in Chicago, gave a very interesting discourse about Hungary. This was done in a conversational form with the station announcer, during which the history of Hungary and the deplorable situation created by the Treaty of Trianon were discussed. The interviewer asked questions about Hungarian literature, art, and intellectual accomplishments. Dr. Horvath depicted eloquently what Hungary has contributed to culture, the technical world, and what progress it has made in music and the finer arts. He related furthur that tourist trade in Hungary is on the up-trend, even the Prince of Wales visited there twice last year.</p>
   <p>The recorded Hungarian "Credo" completed the program.</p>
