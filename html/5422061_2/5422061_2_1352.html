   <p>The officers of the Poor Orphan Association of Chicago, under the leadership of our compatriot Ferdinand Boldorjan, are now diligently working to distribute Christmas presents among the poor and needy children and their parents. There will be great rejoicing in all those homes where Saint Nicholas is not expected this year, and whose members have to rely on the donations of goodhearted fellowmen. Those who are sharing this work of procuring the necessary donations for the poor, the orphans, and the widows, deserve the praise of us all, whether we are in need of this help or not.</p>
