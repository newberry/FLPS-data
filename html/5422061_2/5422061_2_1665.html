   <p>To avoid misunderstandings and dissatisfaction or loss of money and time, the following information was issued by the Chicago-Hungarian Consulate:</p>
   <p>The article of the law of 1909, II 57,000 - 1909, D. M. 5 par., says that all emigrants to overseas countries, including the United States, may use only such steamship tickets as have been issued by those steamship companies authorized to sell them. Tickets bought by the emigrant, or sent to him by relatives, are not valid unless the steamship company is authorized. Prepaid tickets, inasmuch as they are purchased from unauthorized agencies, cannot be used, and in these cases the refund is made by the company with a 10% discount. For the information of those concerned, a list is given of the authorized agencies:</p>
   <p>Canadian Pacific Railway Co., "Chargeur Reunis" Compagnie Francaise de Navigation a Vapeur; Societe Generale de Transports Maritime Vapeur; Compagnie de Navigation Sudatlantique; Italia; Cosulich, Hamburg Amerkanische (Hapag); United States Lines, Inc.; North German Lloyd; Cunard-White Star Line.</p>
