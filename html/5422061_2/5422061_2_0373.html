   <p>The World's Fair's designation of Hungarian Day is gratefully acknowledged by the Hungarians in Chicago and other places all over the United States. But, no doubt, the Hungarians who visit this magnificent Exposition for the first time are sadly disappointed.</p>
   <p>Is it because A Century of Progress does not offer them what they expect? No not at all. As a matter of fact they are amazed at and completely satisfied with the many exhibits from all over the world, the ingenious and phenomenal lighting effects, as well as the marvelous parade of wonders and collections shown at the Fair.</p>
   <p>However, the Hungarians, like other national groups, look for their own pavilion. When they see it they sigh.</p>
   
   <p>The Hungarian commercial exhibit is just a corner on one of the leading business streets of Budapest. We are happy that they are there with their excellent wares and that Hungary is at least represented on the grounds of A Century of Progress. But this is not what we expected; not what our people deserves. It does not do justice to our native country, nor does it do justice to this triumphant demonstration of A Century of Progress. Our thousand-year-old Hungary deserves a special pavilion of her own in the World's Fair, because she has a fascinating story to tell the visitors coming there and because she has greatly contributed toward culture in the last hundred years, a fact which Hungarians ought to be proud to show the world.</p>
   <p>But when such a desirable opportunity as to take part in the Chicago World's Fair is offered, the government of Hungary fails to grasp its significance and pleads economy and poverty, thus missing a great chance, to the regret of all Hungarians.</p>
   <p>I do not wish to indict the Hungarian government for this omission and and neglect; but I have no doubt that were we to examine the Hungarian national budget we would find less important items for which double the amount required for representation at the Fair has been appropriated.</p>
   <p>There is in Hungary a semiofficial organization for the revision of the Treaty of Trianon, which has money for all kinds of patriotic purposes, especially to show the world the great injustice committed against Hungary. Had it exhibited the old and the new maps of Hungary at the World's Fair, in a Hungarian pavilion, the attention of America, as well as that of the world, would have been centered on the crying injustice to Hungary committed at Trianon. What a pity that this opportunity was not taken!</p>
   <p>We who love Hungary are disappointed everytime we visit the alluring grounds of the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>Our only consolation is that at the Fair there is so much to see, so much to learn, so much to enjoy, that we bury our disappointment in the wonderful accomplishments A Century of Progress brings together before our eyes.</p>
   <p>We admire each and everyone of them and, above all, those really gifted and far seeing men and women, who are responsible for this gigantic and magnificent Exposition.</p>
