   <p>The Chicago Thalia Artists and Singing Society, after a long absence from the cultural field, resumed its work on April 25. They presented the play "The Worst of The Village," which was enjoyed by all present.</p>
   <p>The play was presented in a very pleasing manner and we compliment the actors for their excellent performance. We must also say a few words about the beautiul songs rendered by a mixed chorus made up by members of this organization.</p>
