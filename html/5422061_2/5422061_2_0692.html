   <p>The Hungarian College Club, representing the highest classes of Hungarians in Chicago, has a very exclusive membership, for it requires, of members joining, a college diploma.</p>
   <p>This organization passed a resolution at its last meeting to give instructions and advice to Hungarians, by means of lectures and readings, with reference to behavior in times of war. Thus they are trying to maintain that splendid reputation which the Hungarians have established in peace times among the American people. They are teaching Hungarians, who have become citizens, how to conduct themselves in reference to the war. Instructions will be given to those who wish to secure their naturalization papers, and also to those who have not as yet obtained their first papers. The latter will be taught what is expected of them, while the United States is at war.</p>
   <p>Likewise will advice be given to those who have surplus funds to invest, showing them how to place investments here, while such are barred in foreign countries.</p>

   <p>The first lecture took place last Tuesday at Burnside; the next will be held in West Pullman. These lectures, apparently, meet with the approval of the Hungarians, because quite a number attended the last one.</p>
