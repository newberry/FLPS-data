   <p>p.11.............We Hungarians, whenever we happen on to a foreign map, a schoolbook, a coin or stamp collection, almost unconsciously turn to that part which deals with the details pertaining to Hungary or to the Hungarians. After the great world fire brand ,we are anxious to know what is the world's opinion about us. To satisfy curiosity of ours, we could not find any better place than that, where the different nations are lined up to exhibit their culture, their industry, art, their moral or physical strength. It is only natural, that such an event, as the participation of the Hungarians in the World's Fair, can leave no Hungarian uninterested.</p>
   <p>When we approach the vast exposition from the 23rd St. entrance bridge, in the shadows of the proud towers,there modestly hidden we find the Hungarian Pavillon, on top of which flutters in the air the Hungarian flag, the sight of which lifts our heart and soul high above the stone and steel <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>structures of the city. We live in a free country, where the wind plays with the red, white and green of Hungary just so as with all the other nations colors. In the life of the Hungarian-Americans the Hungarian colors are not rare guests, but this flag is something different; it is the flag of a very great association-that of fourteen million Hungarians. We raise hats when we notice it, and uncover again before we enter the pavilion. The foreigners first enter into the rooms marked "Hungary" and when they learn to know their native land from the materials exhibited therein, they may give the salute due our tricolor when they come out.</p>
   <p>But, is it possible to parade all the culture of a country on such limited space? Why, certainly, it is. And what is more remarkable, we offer more than those imitations of cities, made of paper, and which, in some cases only misrepresent their countries. That which is offered in those "villages" are neither folk-art, nor national life, nor even art, which would satisfy even a medium class public. They are built with an eye to the weary visitor, who after a prolonged sight-seeing walk hardly can keep himself on his feet. He will greet a chair to sit on if for <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the price of 25 cents he can see something, provided it does not happen too often that he is obliged to pull out some change to pay for something or other. The programs are intentionaly short ones, so the visitors should have time, to buy something in the selling stalls of these stage wall houses.</p>
   <p>How much better it is to know, that there were no attempts to make any paper-Hortobagy, where some overworked comedian would impersonate the Hungarian peasant. No pure blooded Hungarian would stoop so low as to dance for money in his unique Csiko's costume. On the contrary, every visitor is free to come, to study and if he wishes, to buy something in the Hungarian Pavilion, where there is no entrance fee to be paid. In our modest, almost conspicuously simple pavilion there was a color display, which would put to shame that of Fableland. I do not refer simply to the group of the many hundred little dolls clad in Hungarian costumes, which resemble so many flower-bouquets, but also to those pieces of folk-handicrafts which are worthy of being exhibited, and which are to be seen right next to the entrance, further inside the world renowned Zsolnay and Herendi-porcellains, which could stand all possible criticism and the like of which you cannot find in the whole exposition. The best authority on the Hungarian Folkarts, Mr. Victor Unterreiner,puts a whole collection before the eyes of the visitor. He selected out the market-pieces with the eyes of a good <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>business man, as well, as those pieces, which have their places in the show-windows, thereby offering the opportunity both for the widening of our knowledge and for trade by selling some of the pieces to the customers. In his collection we can find the most beautiful pieces of the folk-arts of Buzsak, Mezokovesd, Sarkoz and other vicinities. He did not forget even the "Arvalanyhaj." He has also some copper and color etchings, the works of some of the best Hungarian artists. It is also to his credit, that he succeeded to import a greater quantity of Hungarian wines. The importance of this is hardly necessary to strees. It was high time, that the world's best and most famous wine should reach the American market. I was astounded to hear, there is on the market some kind of a wine, under the name, "Canadian Tokay" but can not understand, how they can use that name. In the Hungarian Pavilion one can find besides the Tokay wine of 1916 vintage also the Hungarian Champagne Togley.</p>
   <p>Maybe there are many of us who did not know, that in the last years the Hungarian tobacco industry and especially that of the cigars, gained <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>world fame. In England, the best cigars are of Hungarian origin, and France takes a considerable quantity of tobacco from Hungary every year. The Hungarian Tobacco Monopoly sent out Dr. Joseph Vizsolyi, to represent the Hungarian tobacco on the World's Fair. He also represents the Hungarian Tourist Department, the beautiful posters and photographs of which are real decorations to the Hungarian Pavilion, and which are teaching about the culture of our less known native country, and the character of Budapest as a health resort.</p>
   <p>The foreign hunters left much money in Hungary during the last few years, for the privilege of shooting some big game. The hunting association "Hubertus" took care to call the attention of the American hunters to the hunting possibilities in our old country.</p>
   <p>Elmer Nagy, the engineer-jeweler had a valuable collection of masterpieces of the old-Hungarian jewelers' art. The exhibition of the famous Gerbeau candies serve to show, that besides the Hungarian cook the Hungarian conditor is also first of his kind in the world.</p>
   <p>In one corner of the pavilion there is going on almost mechanically the <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>painting of pictures for sale. Geza Vincze and Marras painters are "creating" with great speed. The former creates landscapes in five minutes, the latter makes colored portraits. Naturally under the given circumstances it is impossible to produce real art products. I have to mention another painter, Nicholas Gaspar, who painted all the reklame-pictures of one of the exhibition halls. He is a marvelous decorator and in one of his pictures, that of the harvest one could almost smell the air of the Hungarian Plain, the Alfold. The group of his pictures ends in an unfolded world map. On this map, my collegue, Gaspar accomplished that for which the Hungarians are hoping the revision of the Peace treaty. He simply cut off on the map a goodly portion from each of the neighboring countries and the territories so gained he added to Hungary, thereby making it as big almost as Germany is. Well, why should not the foreigners see that we have been, are now and will be always some bodies on this unfolded world globe.</p>
