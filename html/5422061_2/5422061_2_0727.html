   <p>Sunday evening, June 9, Chicago Hungarians will get a chance to see the first Hungarian-American wrestler to ever enter that professional field. The wrestler of whom we are speaking is the "Great Davo." A few years ago he gained recognition as a weight lifter, when in the New York Hipprodrome, he let a 7,000 pound truck run over his chest. Since that time he has entered the field of professional wrestling, and up to the present has not lost a match.</p>
   <p>On June the 9th, he is matched to wrestle, Arthur Frece, the fat and clever Swedish champion.</p>
   <p>This match has attracted the interest of a great number of people in Chicago, and we hope that the Chicago Hungarians will show their appreciation for the appearance of this outstanding sport individual.</p>
   <p>The match will be held at the North Side Turner Hall. We hope this hall will be filled with sport loving Hungarians.</p>
