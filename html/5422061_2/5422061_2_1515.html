   <p>p.2........There is a good deal of enthusiasm toward the plan of having a Hungarian cemetary in Chicago. The idea is so important that more thought has to be given the matter. There is not another nationality who has not in some way solved this problem. We are the only ones who bury our loved ones in cemetaries where everything is strictly business like.</p>
   <p>The idea belongs to William Hartman, Chicago undertaker. Mr. Hartman has been serving the Hungarians for the past thirty-eight years.</p>
