   <p>The Chicago Hungarians have added to their cultural wealth in the formation of a new society. A few days ago, Frank Kalman and Joseph Csajaghy came to our offices and told us of the organization of a club called "The Hungarian Social Club." This organization has already been given its charter. The club was formed on a very democratic platform with the purpose of promoting a desire for the study of the Hungarian language and the development of Hungarian literature and cultural activities. All Hungarians are asked to become members regardless of class or creed. When the membership fee has been definitely decided, it will be published in this newspaper. Until then, we wish the charter members success in all their undertakings.</p>
