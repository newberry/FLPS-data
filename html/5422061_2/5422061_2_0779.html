   <p>We consider it our duty to report to the members of Hungarian associations the progress of the work of the National Protective Federation of Hungarian-American Associations and to show ways and means whereby we propose to operate in the interest of all Hungarian-Americans.</p>
   <p>The Federation's Executive Committee notices with pleasure that association members all over the country have begun to join our campaign in ever increasing numbers. From Milwaukee, South Bend, Dayton, Aurora, Columbus, Cleveland, Detroit, Buffalo, Youngstown, Hammond, Canton, etc., come news of successful meetings and of more associations joining the movement. The Federation, after reading the many letters it has received, does not palter with the truth when it says that in spite of every effort by some interests to frustrate this movement, the Hungarian-Americans are willing to act to save their associations and to join our forces.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>But not so the leaders of the greater Hungarian institutions of the nation! To them the collapse of small associations means little. The retention of aged members and those in danger of being stricken off the list, is not an urgent task for them as yet. At least this is our impression, to judge by the fact that, although the Federation's Executive Committee, pursuant to a resolution adopted at the convention, wrote asking them to join the action, they have not replied as yet. The Federation's National board of directors sent two representatives to the meeting of the board of directors of the Verhovay Aid Association to ask the latter to indorse the program adopted at the convention. The Federation's Executive Committee insists that the bond and bank losses of our great associations should not be borne by such members as were dropped from their rolls, and that the money the members paid through years as dues should not fall to the benefit of the treasuries of the great national institutions.</p>
   <p>The Federation intends to help all members--the aged as well as those facing loss of membership, and at the same time aims to put our institutions on a <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>healthier financial foundation, so that in the future the officers of the associations may not rejoice everytime an old member, whose death is in all probability near, drops out. When an old member drops out, the treasury of the association is not obligated to pay insurance when he dies, which would otherwise be paid out sometime to the heirs of the insured, should he still be an active member at the time of his death. So, the Federation, while still keeping open the places reserved for the representatives of the national institutions in its National Board of Directors, is now urging the branches of these institutions to join this movement, regardless of the attitude of their central offices, and advises the same kind of invitation the Cleveland and South Bend branches of the Verhovay Aid Association gave their leaders. The Federation's Executive Committee feels that the action to induce the associations to join should take the form of public meetings attended by all organizations concerned.</p>
   <p>We should visit every local branch and invite it to join the Federation. If it is true that some individuals and groups are working to disunite the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Hungarians (and perhaps this is the way they earn their daily bread), then the association members, who feel to their sorrow the collapse of their associations and the loss of their membership rights through no fault of their own, will surely want to act to rescue their money, paid through many years as dues, and to secure their membership rights.</p>
   <p>Ample examples are the letters of three associations in Whittman, West Virginia in which they complain to the Federation that they were not invited to the convention by the Preparations Committee (the reason why they were not invited was that the Preparations Committee did not know their addresses). The Hooversville, Pennsylvania, Federation of Associations expressed its regret that, on account of lack of funds its associations were unable to be represented at the convention and asked that resolutions adopted at the convention be sent to them, as they pledged themselves to work for our mutual interests.</p>
   <p>These and other similar reports plainly demonstrate that our associations <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>certainly want to retain their aged members, as well as those who face being stricken off the rolls, and that they want to reinstate those who already have been dropped, as well as rescue those associations which operate on a fraternal basis and which are now on the verge of collapse. They want governmental loans through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to compensate for the losses suffered by the associations in their bonds and other assets. Finally, they demand social insurance against old age, physical inability to work, and unemployment. They will strive to achieve all these in spite of all hindrances and obstructions.</p>
   <p>Forward, therefore, with the work! Let the members themselves save our institutions!</p>
   <p>In the name of the Executive Committee of the National Protective Federation of Hungarian-American Associations,</p>
