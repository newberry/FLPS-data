   <p>The Reformed Church of the South Side conducts a summer school each year. This summer, 142 children are enrolled. For six weeks, students and teachers have endured the heat in order to show progress in this session.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday, August 4, the summer school pupils will have their final examinations at the Magyar Home.</p>
   <p>After the children's program, the church bazaar will begin. This year many novelties will be on display for the benefit of buyers at the bazaar.</p>
   <p>We extend a cordial invitation to all. To those who do not care to attend these functions because of the intense heat in summer, we offer a special <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>inducement. A picnic will be held in back of the Magyar Home. This is a shady and cool spot. Everything is being done to make this an outstanding affair.</p>
