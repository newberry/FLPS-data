   <p>The growth and development of Chicago constitutes one of the most remarkable feats in sociological history. In the place where one hundred years ago trappers used to sell their wares in wigwams, we find today the greatest inland city in the world.</p>
   <p>Of the five million people in Chicago and immediate vicinity, sixty per cent are immigrants from forty or more different countries. These immigrants will arrange a great international exposition at the Century of Progress World's Fair.....</p>
   <p>The Century of Progress will be not only the World's Fair of Chicago but also an exposition of all the nations of the world.....The United States Congress declared the event as of national importance and the Federal Government issued invitations to the nations of the world, Hungary included.</p>
   <p>We, the leaders of the Hungarian group of the Century of Progress, were commissioned by the Central Committee to organize the participation of the Hungarians.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>We do not wish to monopolize this commission, but ask the fraternal co-operation of all Hungarians who can be of assistance in working out a program.....</p>
   <p>In connection with the Chicago World's Fair, the task of the American Hungarians is divided into two parts:</p>
   <p>1. In the Hall of Fame, where international cultural achievements will be shown at the Century of Progress, we must find room to exhibit everything that the Hungarians can be justly proud of. Among the links of the chain of artistic, scientific, and technical achievements, the contributions of Hungarian geniuses must take their proper places. The material to be exhibited here will be provided by the Hungarian government.....</p>
   <p>2. An artificial island of thirty acres in Lake Michigan is nearing completion. "Old Europe" will be built on this island. Every European nation <span class="page-break">\3</span>which participates in the World's Fair will be allotted two acres of land on this island. We Hungarians, too, will receive land, so that we may exhibit "Old Hungary's" national characteristics. This is the place where we will be permitted to build the only "Csarda" (Inn) on the Fair grounds. The whole territory will be the amusement ground of the various foreign groups--on a commercial basis.....The [Hungarian] Committee, following the example set by other national groups, made inquiries as to the cost of official participation in what is outlined in Paragraph 1.....Hungary, in its present economic condition, cannot bear all the expenses of official representation. The members of the Committee unanimously decided that our activities on the territory allotted to us on the "Old Europe" island shall be of a commercial nature, the income thus derived to cover the expenses of Hungary's exhibition in the Hall of Fame.</p>
   <p>Since contributions of money by the Hungarian-Americans are out of the question, the plan is to form a financing company with a capital of one million dollars. We invite those of our countrymen who have the necessary money for investment and probably business ability also, to become members of this financing company.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>If our countrymen won't volunteer to subscribe the necessary amount, the Committee will endeavor to propose its plan to an American financing company.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, respectfully ask those who have plans or capital to invest to get in touch with Dr. Arpad Barothy, Chairman of the Hungarian Committee, 180 North Michigan Avenue.</p>
