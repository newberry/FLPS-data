   <p>The Virgin Mary Society, which a few years ago took into its fold the St. Imre Young Peoples' Society, is the largest and richest society, not only on the South Side, but also in the city of Chicago. This organization is one that the Hungarian population should be proud of, not only because of its organizational work but also because of its cultural activities. Perhaps many people wonder why a Catholic society that even bears the name of Virgin Mary commands such great respect among people belonging to different religious creeds.</p>
   <p>The explanation is very simple: This society has been under the guidance of capable and hard-working men and women who are interested only in the advancement of the Society. Another reason for its high standing among the Hungarian people is that the majority of its members were liberal-minded with respect to religion and its officers were, also, conforming in their <span class="page-break">2</span>principles to that old saying and rule of true Christian life: "Love thy neighbor as thyself."</p>
   <p>This sensible attitude has meant success to this organization. Today the Virgin Mary Society boasts of a membership of 850 adults and the children's division has a membership of 300. Their cash resources amount to $17,781. The dues of this organization are a mere fifty cents per month, for which the member receives seven dollars per week sick benefit; in case of death the beneficiary will receive eight hundred and fifty dollars.</p>
   <p>Twenty years is a long time in a person's life, and sometimes many great changes take place in this period. Many things happen in twenty years of society life, and some of these may be incidents which prove whether an organization is capable of just existing or whether it will keep on bettering itself and keep growing. In order to have an advancing organization, the most important of all is to have capable and enthusiastic leaders.</p>

   <p>When we hear that Joseph Bukovics, John Kovacs, and Joseph Kocsis have missed only two or three meetings in the past twenty years, we know why the Virgin Mary Society has been so successful.</p>
   <p>The members have been waiting with great enthusiasm for the celebration of this twenty-year anniversary. The festivities were opened with a parade of both grown-ups and children, the children all being dressed in Hungarian costumes.</p>
   <p>John Kovacs opened the celebration at the Hnights of Pythias Hall with a very brilliant speech relating the past history of the Virgin Mary Society.</p>
   <p>When John Kovacs had concluded, Joseph Kocsis was given the floor. He told of the activities of the organization during the past twenty years.</p>
   <p>Alderman Cross was present and was called on to speak. In the course of his speech he told of how much he appreciated the honor of being one of <span class="page-break">4</span>the guests at such a noble celebration. He explained why such an organization was necessary in the lives of the Chicago Hungarians, and said that he would be glad to do anything he could for the Hungarian people at any time.</p>
   <p>Our own Ignatio Izsak gave a speech congratulating the members and officers upon their enthusiastic participation in the activities of the Society during the past twenty years.</p>
   <p>Next, John Redvay, the secretary of the society, read a condensed form of the minutes of activities of the past twenty years. This aroused general interest.</p>
   <p>Thomas Lemberger, the secretary of the finance committee, then made his report. From this report we learned that the Society was first formed with twenty-five members. This number was augmented by the formation of <span class="page-break">5</span>the young people's society, with its twenty-three members. Then, in 1917, the St. Imre Young People's Society merged with the Virgin Mary Society. From that time on the Society grew with leaps and bounds, until it became the most powerful and the largest society in Chicago. We also found out that in the past twenty years the total income of this society was $99,775.70, and that the expenditures were $81,994 leaving a balance of $17,781.70.</p>
   <p>The organization and its activities were then blessed by the Reverend Father Joseph Feczko, a Greek Catholic priest.</p>
   <p>The presidents of six other large Hungarian organizations also took part in the program with speeches.</p>
   <p>The press was represented by Mr. Kauffman, of the Hungarian newspaper Sabadsag, and by Martin Benedek, of the Magyar Tribune. They also spoke, <span class="page-break">6</span>and at the same time took the opportunity to compliment The Virgin Mary Society for organizing the Hungarian youth, which means so much in the future life of the Hungarian people of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Alex Kirner was the last speaker on the program. His speech was directed toward the young people. He explained to them what their duties were as good Hungarian children and future Hungarians of Chicago. His speech had great effect upon the young people who were present, as could be seen by the enthusiasm they displayed.</p>
   <p>We feel that a great deal of credit is due the committee who handled the arrangement of this twentieth anniversary, as the program was interesting and went along very smoothly.</p>
   <p>The anniversary celebration was successful in every respect, both socially and financially, for there was a net profit of $1,127.75.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>The president of the organization, John Kovacs, wishes to take the opportunity to thank the Hungarian people for their kind co-operation in making this affair such an immense success.</p>
