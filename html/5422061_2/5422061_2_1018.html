This cheap labor threw many people out of work. Over a half million Chicagoans. are without work.</p>
   <p>The majority of the Hungarians in Chicago were employed by the Illinois Central and the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad companies, but seventy-five percent of them were laid off indefinitely.</p>
