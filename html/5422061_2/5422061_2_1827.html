   <p>News from Budapest tells us that the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of Hungary have most nobly decided to donate ten tons of wheat to Empress Zita and her children.</p>
   <p><span class="gap">[gap]</span> this a very <span class="gap">[gap]</span> charitable <span class="gap">[gap]</span>ve if these <span class="gap">[gap]</span>s would show the same consideration towards these people who plant, cultivate, and harvest, this wheat.</p>
   <p>It is a sorrowful situation to see that the Hungarian dukes do not have the same feeling toward those who will really have to give this wheat.</p>
   <p>Has anyone heard of an instance where these dukes at any time gave up as much as an acre of land to the landless <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Was any he <span class="gap">[gap]</span> certain amount of wheat to the starving children of Hungary, or the students and other unfortunates.</p>
   <p>We have never heard of this.</p>
   <p>The history of Hungary in the past four hundred years has been rather bitter due to the absolute domination of the Habsburgs. It has happened more than once that innocent patriots gave their lives in order to overthrow the detrimental government. After the defeat during the war for liberty, the more noble ones of us were banished shamefully, and yet the generation which has come up since 1848, has been taught hate against Italy whereas hate towards the Hapsburgs should have been taught.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian people were fed with facts which taught them that the war for liberty was lost because Italy stepped in to take the losing side, but they <span class="page-break">3</span>weren't told that it was the Hapsburgs who called in Italy.</p>
   <p>Today, as a greying man, I feel ashamed that I believed these strange stories. I clinch my fist, when I look back thinking of how the Hungarian youth was taught false history to create international hate in order to divert their attention from the real sinners.</p>
   <p>The unfortunate ending of the World War gave Hungary its independence even though she became quite crippled. We could have believed this if the wishes over a period of years had come true, but Hungarians will not believe the Germans. Then the historians would have changed their version of the picture and would have denied any relationship with the Hapsburgs.</p>
   <p>The facts prove the opposite of all this. No one can imagine or picture the things that are happening in Hungary.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The Hapsburg princes are occupied on nation-wide trips, welcoming committees are organized, then correspondents of Hungarian-American newspapers throughout this country inform us that there is no such things as Habsburg propaganda.</p>
   <p>If there are any meetings held during which the Habsburg clan is criticized, the police step in and break the meeting up.</p>
   <p>Some time ago we told our readers that a very noble gentleman from Chicago wrote to Empress Zita and offered any assistance he might be able to extend to her from this country. A letter was written in reply thanking the gentleman for this kind gesture, but they were being taken care of by the Spanish household.</p>
   <p>Now the Hungarian dukes have another thing in mind, and that is to trade <span class="page-break">5</span>the false statements of history and tell the people how their Empress and her children ago starving.</p>
   <p>They want a child for king, one they can shove around, just as an organ grinder does with his monkey.</p>
   <p>A few weeks ago, a Mr. Jeno Rakosi wrote a letter to the Hungarian people of the United States asking for aid in order that his news publication might be saved. While he was asking for aid from Hungarians in this country, his wife. Szidi Rakosi, who was making public appearances, received a cash award amounting to approximately two million crowns. She volunteered to turn half of this award over to Empress Zita.</p>
   <p>We do not have any objections to anyone who wishes to aid Zita and her children. They are human beings and have just as much a right to live as <span class="page-break">6</span>anyone else has.</p>
   <p>What we are objecting to and what we consider a sin, is to rob the Hungarian American population through falsehoods and shameful propaganda.</p>
   <p>All those who returned from Hungary more recently have formed the same opinion, that those over there, have more money than we have. Coffee houses and cafes are filled and money seems to be plentiful. There are a lot of poor people there also, and even starving children, but these questions could be solved, if the people there would think seriously and respectfully.</p>
   <p>A nation where the people think that rank comes before hard work will surely be lead to destruction.</p>
   <p>We think that it is our respectful duty to call to the attention of the Hungarian-American people that the time has come when they should call a halt <span class="page-break">7</span>to all these pocket-book <span class="gap">[gap]</span>, regardless of where the call might come from.</p>
   <p>Those people <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that we are treasure chests that cannot be emptied, and that all they have to do is tell a sad story and there will be a down-pour of American dollars for their benefit.</p>
   <p>We want to say truthfully that even though the Hungarian-Americans earn their bread by the sweat of their <span class="gap">[gap]</span> they hold, they command <span class="gap">[gap]</span>re respect than the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> of Hungary with two exceptions, <span class="gap">[gap]</span>.</p>
   <p>There is one <span class="gap">[gap]</span> that is that the realise that the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> start <span class="gap">[gap]</span>struction activities. At the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> interesting that the city of <span class="page-break">8</span>Szered--the birth <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the <span class="gap">[gap]</span> terror--wrote to Bethlen and and a to know <span class="gap">[gap]</span> The governgment <span class="gap">[gap]</span> the accepted <span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
   <p>These people have done nothing in the past few years. They breed robbery, murder, and graft, and with the aid of other great abuses they aid in creating a nation of hate.</p>
