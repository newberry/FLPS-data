   <p>Since the death of Arpad Heltay, promoter of Magyar theatrical productions, activity along this line has been tossed around back and forth, much as an orphan child. A new foundation has been already built, but it suddenly ceased to function because the leaders failed to agree and broke up into a number of companies, each trying to outdo the other.</p>
   <p>Now we have word that the leaders have buried the hatchet and that the organization will remain as Heltay left it, that is, with the same cast of stars, and managed under the principles of Heltay, the old guard leader. Both actors and actresses have promised to do their best in giving the finest performances on the stage. Our beloved Louis Hegedus, after expressing great happiness over this turn of affairs, said that not only is the old guard together again, but the followers of Heltay will still pack the theatres along the entire route of the company.</p>

   <p>At last Sunday evening's performance, at the Aryon Grotto Theatre, we were happy to witness the arrival of thousands of high class Hungarians, who arrived at 8 P. M. in automobiles that rivaled in beauty with each other. The crowd around the theatre was so impressive that it drew the attention of hundreds of passers-by. The writer of this article heard an intelligent American ask of persons in the crowd the cause of the enormous gathering. Upon being told, he remarked, "Oh, the Hungarian is an art-loving people."</p>
   <p>After the second performance, we regretfully heard Bela Szende, the manager, announce that, although they had performed for an exceptionally large audience, the expenses were much greater than the income. This caused him to declare that he will never bring his company to Chicago again. Later, he said, his company may return to Chicago, after four or five months, where it will give matinee performances to cover expenses.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The Hungarians of Chicago can fill to capacity any theatre twice a month, but not on consecutive days of the week. If the performances were held every two weeks, the plan to have a permanent Hungarian theater would be successful.</p>
   <p>We know now that it is impractical to give performances on succeeding days of the week and expect capacity audiences. So, therefore, we cannot expect to gain anything by holding matinee and evening performances the same day. The few reasons that make this an impossibility are:</p>
   <p>First, the Hungarian Colony in Chicago does not live in any one central location as a group. They are spread out over the entire city and suburbs, and not as in New York City, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh, where they are grouped together in a certain section of the city. Because of this, in order for a Hungarian to attend a matinee performance, he must leave his home before noon. To attend the evening performance, he must leave his home way before supper time and eat in strange restaurants, which he detests.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The theatrical productions in New York, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh, are given on alternate Sunday evenings and draw capacity audiences. Second, because of the tremendous expense involved in travel to Chicago from New York, Pittsburgh, or Cleveland, it would be impossible to bring the Company here just for one performance and then have it return to the East.</p>
   <p>Here is where the conflict starts in this business. Every time a manager for a reputable visiting Hungarian troupe from Hungary approached Bela Szende in order to include his cast in Szende's, or to ask him to sponsor a different production, he was not permitted to make any headway on his mission of progressive cultural functions. Szende quieted him by saying that his company was an entertaining troupe of the stage on business, not on an artistic or cultural mission. Taking into consideration the position and the conditions of life of the actors and actresses while on a road tour, no one could expect artistic and cultural performances. They have to keep traveling without any stop-offs, performing in a different city every day, on platforms three feet long and two feet deep, in stinking places. They must haul heavy luggage with them continually. They have no decent regular <span class="page-break">5</span>hours to eat or sleep. As far as the question of productions with extemporaneous tawdry parts are concerned, the audience's preference leans more towards this form of entertainment than towards the parts of the play with musical or literary beauty.</p>
   <p>In writing this article, we have stepped on the toes of the leaders of theatrical productions. This is because the production of fine arts was stimulated by rotten tawdry bits of performances, causing a contest between the theatrical producers, who soothingly tried to outdo each other in their fine arts.</p>
   <p>Now that the theatrical production company will not come back to Chicago, we feel that the good, old-time fine arts players should step forward with a progressive program. Let the old tried leaders of the fine arts productions step forward. Among us in Chicago lives one of the greatest of leaders, and managers of fine arts productions that ever lived in Hungary, Michael Redey. He is also an excellent fine arts player. We can feel <span class="page-break">6</span>positively certain that Redey will form his company from the good old-time fine arts players, and will give such a good performance that the Chicago Hungarians will be indemnified for the loss of the other production.</p>
   <p>Here in distant West Pullman, the old-time fine arts players regained consciousness and stood ready to obey the orders of the veteran leader, as did Louis Irsza. The rehearsals for the production of "Ordog Matkaja" (Devil's Bride), are progressing rapidly and with the greatest enthusiasm. We know how Louis Irsza has struggled for many years, in West Pullman, to produce fine arts productions. To his name is credited, the success of many excellent performances. Like the aged warrior who after much struggle finds himself facing a disillusioned end, the developers of our fine arts again turn against the old guard. This stimulates a contest with the youthful players ... Our faithful old time leaders will not stain the Hungarian literary theatrical productions with vulgar parts that cause audiences to blush with shame. Our artists shall perform as the author wrote the story, according to Hungarian literary style.</p>
