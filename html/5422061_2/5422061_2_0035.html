   <p>Dr. Joseph Kerekes, who is well known and well loved in Hungarian circles of Chicago, has been honored by the staff of the Murphy Hospital, which last week elected him chief surgeon of the Hospital.</p>
   <p>Dr. Kerekes' promotion to this post is quite an achievement, especially considering that he came to America ten years ago. His election by such an eminent body as the medical staff of a high-class hospital, is certainly a sign of appreciation of his merits. Our congratulations!</p>
