   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Reformed Churches' Hungarian summer school celebrations will be held and carried out according to the following program:</p>
   <p>The West Side Hungarian Reformed Summer School will hold its closing celebration on Saturday evening, August 16. Besides having the regular oral examination the school children will present a children's play called "Rosmarin." Thirty-eight children will take part in this play, which will be directed by Charles Kovacs.</p>
   <p>The Burnside and West Pullman School's closing celebration will be held on Sunday afternoon, August 17, at Pilat's Grove. The children from Burnside will present two plays, one called "Spring Fantasy" and the other "Rosmarian." The children from West Pullman will present two other plays, one known as "A Dream In the Woods," and the other known as "The White Dress." At Burnside there are 115 children under the guidance of Rev. Eugene Boros and <span class="page-break">2</span>forty-one under the guidance of Charles Kovacs. At West Pullman there are forty-four children under the guidance of Daniel Bodor. There will be a total of 200 children taking part in the school's closing celebration in Pilat's Grove. The vast area of Pilat's Grove will be filled with voices and the strains of beautiful Hungarian music.</p>
   <p>The South Chicago School's closing celebration will be held Sunday evening, August 17, at 8 P. M. There are thirty-two children here, being taught by Daniel Bodor. This group will present two plays in the school auditorium. The names of these two plays are "Prisoners' Orphans," and "A Box of Candy."</p>
   <p>Due to the fact that on these two days there are no other Hungarian celebrations in the city of Chicago, it is believed that the closing celebrations of the Hungarian schools and these children's plays will be a huge success. This gigantic affair involves 270 children, who have spent many precious moments of leisure time studying the native tongue of Hungary.</p>
