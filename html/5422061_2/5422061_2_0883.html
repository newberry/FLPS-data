   <p>The First Hungarian Social and Sick Benefit Society held its first annual meeting on January 9, when the officers of the society were elected. At this meeting many important matters came up for discussion. Among them the most important resolution was the one raising the sick-aid fees to $10. The resolution was unanimously passed. The society will send two young ladies, dressed in Magyar national costumes, as representatives of the society, to President Harding's inauguration. This resolution is of interest to the Magyars living in America, because this gesture brings the American Magyars into a closer contact with the American people.</p>
