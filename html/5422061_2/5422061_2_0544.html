   <p>Last week we wrote and published in our paper an editorial about the speech of President Coolidge in Minneapolis. A copy of last week's issue of our paper was sent to the White House. In reply to this editorial we received the following letter.</p>
   <p>The White House,</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>June 22, 1925</p>
   <p>My Dear Mr. Izsak,</p>
   <p>I have received your letter of June 20, and of course remember meeting you in Chicago.</p>
   <p>I am indeed glad to have the editorial which you were good enough to send to me, and I shall have pleasure in showing it to the President as you <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>suggest. I know how deeply he will appreciate this evidence of your continued interest in the administration.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Everett Sanders,</p>
   <p>Secretary to the President.</p>
