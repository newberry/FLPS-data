   <p>On the twenty-third day of this month the First Chicago Hungarian Casino and Aid Society held a special meeting. The members gathered in great numbers, and amid enthusiastic acclaim the name of the society was changed to Endre Ady Circle.</p>
   <p>This is the first organization in America which has taken the glorious and immortal name of Ady [the poet-laureate of Hungary]. With this change, a part of Paragraph 3 of Section I of the bylaws--"nurturing our culture"--will become the actual program of the society. The enthusiasm that the members have manifested toward their society until now will serve as a basis for the literary work that the society is destined to spread among Chicago Hungarians.Everyone who is interested in this excellent venture and who wishes to help in the work is invited to come to the Endre Ady Circle, 2847 West Division Street.</p>
