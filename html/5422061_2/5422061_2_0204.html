   <p>Joseph Viz, became known to the Hungarians of America on May 4, 1924 when he appeared on the program at a Hungarian music festival which was given in Chicago. His crystal clear bell-like voice seemed to be like a magnet the way the audience was attracted by it. This young artist, who came to this country only a short time ago, has become a favorite among the Hungarian-Americans, and we Hungarians should feel proud of him. Joseph Viz is devoting a great deal of his time at present to organizing, The Chicago Hungarian Theatrical Association. He is endeavoring to secure the services of the best Hungarian amateur actors and actresses in and around Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarian Theatrical Association, has designated as its purpose the presentation of the best Hungarian plays for the benefit of the Hungarian theatergoers.</p>

   <p>It is certain that the Chicago Hungarians will not be cheated by attending each and every performance sponsored by this newly formed group.</p>
   <p>Their opening performance will be a Hungarian operetta written by James Farkas. Rehearsals and preparations are already taking place. The name of the play is "Across the Great Ravine" with the following people taking principal parts:Joseph Viz, Manci C. Toth, and Henry Somlai, while the lesser parts will be taken by the better amateur players of Chicago. This play will be presented on November 16, at the Italia Hall.</p>
   <p>Preparation are also being made to present the operetta "The Blue Meadow," by Lehar and "Rur," by Charles Capeks. The latter is a fantastic play and duplication of Sandor Petofi's life.</p>
   <p>The music for these operettas will be directed by Paul Pavella, a well-known choirmaster of Chicago.</p>
