   <p>In the memory of the American-Hungarians, the Hungarian Day at the Chicago World's Fair will live forever. Hungarians from all parts of the country came in great numbers. From Cleveland alone, 500 came to this mid-western metropolis to prove their cooperation.</p>
   <p>About 24,000 Hungarians attended this celebration. The huge success of the Hungarian Day exceeded the most optimistic expectations.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarian societies worked hand in hand and overcame the obstacles and differences of opinion that always occur when so many organizations meet.</p>
   <p>Each and every one of the performers, almost a thousand men, women, and children, most of them in national costume, did their best to make the program successful.</p>
