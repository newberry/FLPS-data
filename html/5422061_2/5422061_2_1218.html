   <p>In another year we will hear convincing speeches made about how wonderfully excellent the government in Washington was under the Coolidge administration.</p>
   <p>We are not talking now of economic well-being. Those who do not notice the economic depression that is slowly descending on the small business man and worker, are asked to please report this fact to us, because we hear unfavorable news from all sides. The Republican prosperity and good times begin to have a bitter and sour taste.</p>
   <p>But we are still hoping!</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Perhaps President Coolidge's supporters will grant us another year of plenty.</p>
   <p>Please Mr. Coolidge and Company! Please!</p>
   <p>But we have other facts to note about this administration which cannot be overshadowed either by plenty of job opportunities or by oratory.</p>
   <p>We will not forget Mr. Kellogg, bosom friend, advisor and supporter of Mr. Coolidge.</p>
   <p>Kellogg is the representative of American imperialistic and reactionary interests. We Hungarian-born Americans were more deeply disappointed than others because we know the injustice of Mr. Kellogg's refusal, in the name of American democracy, to grant a visa to Count Karolyi, and his wife.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>But this was only the beginning for Kellogg. He refused entry to an English representative, and even the right to travel through the United States to a Russian diplomat.</p>
   <p>What his machinations are in Nicaragua, Mexico and China is a diplomatic secret and we know nothing definite about it, but we shudder to think that he may cause trouble for the Americans who hate even the thought of war.</p>
   <p>Otherwise he is a past master in making mistakes.</p>
   <p>We, who don't know anything about diplomacy, see the obvious and ridiculous mistakes of Kellogg.</p>
   <p>The newest diplomatic coup of Kellogg is the exclusion from Haiti of Utah King, United States senator. Haiti is a small island, a protectorate of this country, governed by General Russell. Senator King, in his official <span class="page-break">\4</span>capacity, criticized the government of Haiti. This offended the Haiti government and the Department of the Interior.</p>
   <p>Naturally, even Coolidge has no right to punish the Senator for the remarks he made in the Senate, but Kellogg, the arch diplomat, had a great idea Senator King wanted to visit Haiti, to see and learn more about the general conditions there. He has the right to do this, and is to be commended for taking his duties seriously.</p>
   <p>Then a cable came from the president of Haiti stating that the impending visit of Senator King was undesirable.</p>
   <p>Kellogg was astounded. What could be done for the senator? He told the newspapermen that he would not allow this! It was absurd to exclude a senator from a country that is under our protection!</p>
   <p>But among his intimates he rubbed his hands in glee. As in the case of <span class="page-break">\5</span>Karolyi's exclusion from the United States, he thought he had accomplished something great.</p>
   <p>We advise Senator Borah, the brave member of the Senate, not to try to take an excursion to Nicaragua, because he may find himself in the same predicament as his colleague, King. He won't be admitted!</p>
   <p>It so happens that Senator Borah criticized the government of Nicaragua, and since there are so many American soldiers stationed there, the Nicaraguan government will comply with any request made by Kellogg.</p>
   <p>King talked against the oppression of the people in Haiti. He advocated a free press and free speech, which rights had been taken away from the people by their government, with the assistance of the United States.</p>
   <p>Karolyi and his wife wanted to continue their struggle here [in the U. S.] <span class="page-break">\6</span>against feudalism in Hungary. They wished to sow the seeds of democracy among the Hungarians here in America.</p>
   <p>Kellogg stopped them for Bethlen's--(prime minister of Hungary)--sake.</p>
   <p>We are undaunted in our belief that Senator King's ideals, and his fight for the liberation of the oppressed, will live in the memory of mankind when Kellogg's name will be a thing of the past.</p>
