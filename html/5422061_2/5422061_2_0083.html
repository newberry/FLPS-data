   <p>For a long time the Turner Hall had not seen such a great mass of Hungarians inside its walls as it did on Sunday, when the Chicago Hungarian Actors Theatre brought to the stage for the first time the operetta "The Wheatears Are Ripening". The performance was faultless--in fact one could truthfully say that it was far above the level of all Hungarian shows presented up to now. The story of the operetta appeared in one of our recent issues, so that we will limit our report to a description of the achievements of the performers.</p>
   <p>Frankly, we have to state that at long last we saw a stage which really blended with the background of the play, and which was in itself a sight worth seeing. The success of the performance was greatly aided by the fact that when the curtain was raised the audience saw a beautifully arranged stage, which spurred the interest of the public toward the play. The remarkable cast, the excellent interpretations done by the performers, and the delightful melody of the music--all combined to offer a moment of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>unforgettable delight to the public.</p>
   <p>We do not have to introduce Irma Komarik-Ferenczy to the Hungarians of Chicago, for this very talented artist has long been the favorite of our theatergoing public. Nor can we find an adjective to describe the art of this sweet lark of ours, whose voice rings like a silver bell. We must admit that she was the head, the soul, and the bouquet of the performance. On the stage she transformed herself from an English girl into a sweet, gracious, fiery Hungarian wife, and all so well that one can hardly imagine her part could have been played better by anybody else. The repeated applause proved beyond doubt that she conquered the public entirely in her role of "Betty Garfield."</p>
   <p>Not in the least is smaller the success achieved by Adrienne Tomory in her role as the widow of Adam Ban de Belezna. Her part as a mother who sacrifices herself for the sake of her loved children, always keeping their happiness before her eyes, was excellent. The public rewarded its <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>beloved artist with almost never ending applause.</p>
   <p>We discovered a new star in the person of Miss Eva Humay, who played the role of Eva Ban de Belezna, and whom we saw for the first time on the stage on this occasion. We can conscientiously say that she has won her battle with brilliant success, and appeared on the stage as an accomplished artist, which, expressed in other words, would mean that a new star has arisen on the firmament of the Hungarian Theater. With her graceful appearance, charming and well-disciplined acting she has earned a complete success, and we hope to have more occasion to enjoy the acting of this young artist.</p>
   <p>The role of "Andrew Ban de Belezna" was played by Simi Varga, an extremely talented actor. Ban de Belezna, a Hungarian aristocrat, was almost a chauvinist in his love and admiration of everything Hungarian. The excellent arrangement, as well as the painstaking coaching received by the players in their roles, goes also to his credit. We have to thank <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Simi Varga for this delightful performance, as it was thanks to his efforts and his artistic taste that the public could enjoy such a charming evening.</p>
   <p>Louis Horvath was a guest player in the role of "Steve de Belezna" and deserved the applause he received for his good acting and singing.</p>
   <p>The role of "Eugene von Wittensberg" was played by Henry Somlay, who kept the audience in good humor whenever he appeared on the stage. He deserved in full measure the immense ovation he received.</p>
   <p>Ladislas Szilagyi played "Peter Toszod" very well. He, too, received great applause.</p>
   <p>In their minor roles, Henry Szigeti, Louis Havas, Louise Bayer, and Tibor Tomory gave excellent performances and contributed materially to the success of this evening, as did also the dancers and choir singers.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>It was Ladislas Nagy, the pianist who instructed the players in their preparations and it was he who accompanied the singers on the piano during the performance. The difficult and responsible work of the prompter was done by Gisele Szilagyi.</p>
   <p>Taking everything into consideration, we come to the conclusion that the Hungarian [artists] of Chicago have great opportunities ahead, since the necessary support from the public is in full measure available, provided of course, the performances are worthwhile. This performance satisfied the expectations of the public in every regard.</p>
