   <p>p.4....The Chicago Southside Catholic Church celebrated its thirty-year jubilee last Sunday. After Holy Mass, the Hungarians, seemingly, all of the southside, gathered at the Hungarian House, and the great hall seemed too small to shelter all.</p>
   <p>Aside from the pastor, Reverend Ernest Hovath, there were pastors from the northside, as well as from Gary and South Bend Hungarian parishes. There were also representatives from the Irish Church in Burnside, and the Catholic Church of Oak Park.</p>
   <p>It was a grand and beautiful festival. The guests were served in two shifts, at the tables.</p>
   <p>The youths danced until sunrise.</p>
