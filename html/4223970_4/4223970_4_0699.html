<p>The young Lithuanian Pleasure Club held its 11th banquet on March 5th
at the Freiheit Turner Hall. The hall was filled with people.</p>
<p>This club not only expects to have banquets for pleasure, but also is
interested in national affairs. The secretary of the club, Mr. John
Bagdziunas, announced a speech by Mr. Kazimieras Gugis, who came to
talk about the bloody Sunday in Petersburg, Russia. The speaker told
of the horrible, inhuman massacre of people by the tsar in St. Petersburg, 
Russia, on the 22nd day of January. He urged all to bring donations
to help the wounded and the orphans made by the tsar. They collected
$8.22, which was divided, $4.11 for the martyrs in jail and $4.11 for
the revolutionary movement.</p>
