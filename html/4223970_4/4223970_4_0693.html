<p>We have seen the revolt of the Russian oppressed masses against the despotic
regime of the Czar. Many people, even Americans, are contributing to the
revolutionary movement in Russia, so we Lithuanians must not lag behind others.
The enemies of the revolution in Russia say that this revolution is brought
about by Jews. This is not so. The revolution is brought about by the people
themselves, who have begun to understand that they are human beings, and that
they want to enjoy the fruits of western democracy. Even the ignorant
Russian soldiers are taking part on the side of the people.</p>
<p>This revolutionary movement in Russia, is not only the movement of the oppressed
people, but of the oppressed nations as well. This includes our fatherland,
Lithuania. Thousands of people in Russia have been shot, hanged and exiled
because they have demanded liberty for the masses of the oppressed. We must
come to their aid in their struggle for liberty. Therefore, we few friends
of Chicago Lithuanians, after discussing the Russian revolution, decided to
donate as much as we are able. P. Galskis donated 50 cents; D. Dragas, 50
cents; J. Dapkus, 50 cents: A. Slakenaitis, 50 cents; Total $2.00.</p>
