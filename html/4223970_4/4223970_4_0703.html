      <p>When Lithuania got permission to print literature in the Lithuanian
language, the Poles printed their appeal in the Lithuanian language.
In this appeal they congratulated us and told us that they helped
to get our press. Now the Poles begged us to unite with them to
form one nation under Polish control and supervision.</p>
      <p>Such is the substance of the long Polish appeal, signed by the committee 
of the National League.</p>
      <p>Let us take this into consideration and scrutinize impartially what
the Poles have done and how much they did help Lithuanians in getting
the Lithuanian press in Lithuania.</p>
      <p>In many churches of Lithuania, when Lithuanians have demanded that
sermons be preached in the Lithuanian language, the Poles started
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
riots, and caused many bloody fights in the churches. Prior to 1867
the Polish teachers and even the Polanized priests used to beat
Lithuanian children in the schools mercilessly for speaking Lithuanian. 
The Poles were spies for the Russian government. The Poles
betrayed the Lithuanians to the Russian government for selling
Lithuanian literature secretly. Thousands of Lithuanians were exiled
to Siberia, just because the Poles betrayed them for selling or

contrabanding Lithuanian literature.</p>
      <p>We have nothing against the Russian people as a people. They have

been our friends. They never betrayed Lithuanians as the Poles have

done.</p>
      <p>When the Lithuanians in England, France and in the United States of

North America collected money through contraband brought the

Lithuanian literature to Lithuania, the Poles laughed at us and at

the first opportunity they betrayed Lithuanians to the Russian

government for spreading the literature in Lithuania.</p>
      <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
      <p>Now when Lithuania has obtained the right to print literature in

the Lithuanian language, of course under the censor, the Polish

newspaper Poseglad Wszehpolski in Chicago asks the Lithuanians

to unite with the Poles, but with the Polish language as official

in Lithuania. How can self-respecting people accept such an idea:

to denounce their own language and accept a foreign language.</p>
      <p>How can we have union with Poles, while the Poles in America have

as many parties as the Poles. They are fighting foolishly among

themselves. True, We Lithuanians have parties and fights among

ourselves, although we have no such baseless fights as the Poles
have.</p>
      <p>We will fight the battle ourselves and we will win the right without

the treacherous Poles. Our fight is for the national cause, not for

the cause of a few privileged Poles.</p>
