<p>p.5................There will be no more secrets kept from the young folks. So here
goes the news: â€œThe Young Folks" are planning a happy get-together. And we want to
tell you this get-together will not have any political purpose or any hidden intention
of pulling somebody away from something.</p>
<p>This will be just a friendly party. Our desire is to become acquainted with as many
young people as are desirous of becoming acquainted with us. We are not going to sell
you anything and we are not going to knock anything. You may belong to any and as man;
clubs as you wish; we shall even respect you the more for it.</p>
<p>Our aim is to bring together young folks of many and varied interests. We want to be
the collection - and distributing center of young folks' ideas.</p>
<p>Watch for further news about our big inter-club young folks' friendly get-together.</p>
