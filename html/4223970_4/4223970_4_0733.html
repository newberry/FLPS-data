<p>The appeal of the Siberian martyr, Meszkutis, should be an inspiration
to us to help the martyrs. We have donated before, but this is not
enough; we ought to donate more in order to help the martyrs in Siberia.</p>
<p>Just think for a moment if we would be in the place of the martyrs! It
is hard to suffer, but it is a pleasure to help them! He who does not
want to donate cannot call himself a Christian, because our Savior said:
"Love thy neighbor as thyself."</p>
<p>I confirm the committee for distribution of donations, consisting of
Dr. John Szliupas, editor Sernas, and Olszewski. I don't think that
there will be anybody against the above named committee. If there is
no delay in electing the new committee, none of the martyrs will go to
his grave for not receiving our help while still alive.</p>

<p>Let us hurry with the election of the committee so that it may start
the collections immediately.</p>
