<p>When Lithuania gets the right to publish literature in the Lithuanian language, 
we will have freedom to read books in our native tongue. We must
remember that the people in Lithuania are lacking such literature, and
newspapers, as we have in America. Every reader of Lithuanian newspapers
in America, when he finishes reading them, should send them to relatives
or friends in Lithuania. The people in Lithuania are eager for the
Lithuanian newspapers from America, because these newspapers are not
censored'by the government, they can write freely, etc.</p>
<p>We have in America many good scientific books. Send them to Lithuania, let the people read them ....</p>
