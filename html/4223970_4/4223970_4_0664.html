      <p>To the societies of whom we have no addresses we send this appeal:
Brother and sister Lithuanians! We need weapons! Our brothers in Lithuania
are appealing to us in order to destroy the terrible oppressor of humanity,
the tyrant who drank our blood, that tsar and his mob...</p>
      <p>In our fatherland, Lithuania, our brothers are shedding their blood for
our cause. When we return to Lithuania we will reap the benefit of liberty.
They are shedding their blood that the future generations shall not
suffer because of oppression and starvation. Brothers! We cannot be deaf
to the appeal of our brothers who are starving and fighting for liberty,
for the good of our brothers, sisters and neighbors! They are laying
down their lives. We should at least donate our pennies. We, the Chicago
Central Revolutionary Committee of Lithuania, are inviting you, brothers
and sisters, to join us in this holy work, the struggle of our brothers

for the good and freedom. We invite you to donate from the societies'

budgets to help our brothers gain freedom. Send the money without

delay to the treasurer of the Chicago Central Revolutionary Committee,

St. Marcinkevicia, 4607 S. Ashland Avenue, Chicago, Ill.</p>
      <p>J. Varkala, President</p>
      <p>S. Marcinkevicia, Treasurer</p>
