      <p>At its most recent meeting, the society of United Lithuanian Brothers elected
the following officers for 1919: Joseph Blankus, president; Anthony Gedraitis,
vice-president; Matthew Kliostoraitis, recording secretary; Peter Jokubonis, 3
financial secretary. The only change was in the post of vice-president.</p>
      <p>Though this Society is young, it has distinguished itself by its achievements 
in behalf of the welfare of Lithuania. Disregarding its earlier
accomplishments, we must mention what the Society did at this meeting.</p>
      <p>After a brief explanation of Lithuania's need for funds had been made,
the Society decided to contribute one hundred dollars from its treasury.</p>
      <p>In order to give even more help to Lithuania in its fight for independence,
those present were asked to contribute as much as possible [as individuals].
Collectors went through the hall and netted $111. In this manner, the
donation of the Society was increased to $211.</p>
