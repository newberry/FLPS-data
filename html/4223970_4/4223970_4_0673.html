<p>Mr. J. Jancauskas delivered a very energetic speech which showed how the
revolutionists are fighting for the cause of freedom and laying down
their lives for the destruction of despotism. The speaker said that we
cannot at present participate in the struggle for freedom, so we must
participate by donating our pennies. Then Mr. Gugis spoke. He urged that

the people join the struggle of the Russian people in order to help
as much as we can our brothers who are fighting for liberty. Mr. A.

girls.</p>
