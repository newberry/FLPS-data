      <p>The said club held a banquet to help the revolution in Lithuania. The
profit was $50.00. The money was sent to Mr. Duda, treasurer of the Central
Revolutionary Committee.</p>
      <p>It would be easy for other Lithuanian organizations to arrange such banquets,
in order to raise money for the revolutionary cause in Lithuania. Everyone can
understand from the appeals, that material help is very essential to the
revolutionary movement in Lithuania.</p>
      <p>We are sorry to say, that when we mailed tickets for this banquet to the
societies in Chicago for them to sell and join us in helping the revolution,
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
we received complaints from some of the societies saying that they don't 
want to have anything to do with it. Some of the societies even told us
that there is no revolution in Lithuania, and that the money does not
reach the revolutionists, etc. Only two societies participated in this
banquet, the Young American Lithuanian Pleasure Club and the King David
Society.</p>
      <p>We are not surprised, because the weather is cloudy in Chicago, and many

people cannot see what is going on in Lithuania. Brothers, it is time to

wipe the dust from your eyes, and help our brothers in Lithuania to throw

off the paw of the Russian bear. Our brothers in Lithuania are shedding

their blood and laying down their lives for the cause of freedom, but we

still are doubting, hesitating to help them.</p>
