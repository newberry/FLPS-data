      <p>On Sunday, January 24, at 11 A.M., about fifty young Lithuanians from all
Lithuanian colonies in Chicago assembled at Ausra Hall in answer to a
recent call through the newspapers to the Lithuanian youth of Chicago
to become more strongly organized.</p>
      <p>The main points on the agenda were as follows: Make arrangements for a "get-acquainted"
entertainment for the youth of Chicago, and elect an organizational 
committee for the purpose of forming a city-wide organization
of the Lithuanian youth of Chicago.</p>
