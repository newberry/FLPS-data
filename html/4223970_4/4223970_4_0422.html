      <p>Mr. John Liutkauskas was the principal speaker at a mass meeting held in
Columbia Hall last night. Very few people were present.</p>
      <p>Dr. A. Zimontas, the first speaker, denounced all those who hamper the collection 
of donations for Lithuania's liberty. He told the audience that he
intends to make known the names or all such persons--even if they are priests--
to the people of Lithuania, so that the latter may know who are the ones that
are obstructing the campaign for Lithuania's independence by demoralizing the
[Lithuanian-American] people, by persuading them not to make donations, and by
destroying their unity.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Zolp recited the poem, "Brothers, Let Us Cease Weeping Today".</p>
      <p>Mr. Liutkauskas then gave a clear interpretation of current events in their bearing 
upon independence for Lithuania. He recalled how the Poles, in the era of
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
feudalism, had strangled the Lithuanians for centuries; and how they
are now planning intrigues in Washington and elsewhere against the
Lithuanians. Mr. Liutkauskas urged the audience to contribute as much money
as possible, so that we might be able to fight back against the Poles; otherwise 
we will be lost under their yoke.</p>
      <p>The largest donations came from the following: Joseph Baciunas, president of 
the Lietuva Corporation, $200; Joseph Elijosius, president of the Universal 
State Bank, $50; Zigmas Malisauskas, $20; and A. J. Kareiva, $25.</p>
      <p>The total amount collected was over five hundred dollars.</p>
