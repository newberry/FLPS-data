      <p>During the three brief years of its existence, the Lithuanian Youth
Society has attached to itself the respect of everyone who has had
any contact with the organization, or who merely knows of the
society's existence, because of the many creditable achievements
for which it has been responsible. Organized by Vytantas Beliajus,
who has been the leader of the society during the entire three
years of its life, the society has had for its purpose the fostering 
of an interest in Lithuanian culture among the descendants of
Lithuanians in America, and the dissemination of information concerning 
the little known Lithuanians among those of other nationalities.
In keeping with this purpose, the society has sponsored several exhibits
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
of Lithuanian popular and fine arts, the most recent of which had
its showing during the month of May of this year in the galleries
of the Mandel Brothersâ€™ Department Store. This particular exhibit
was one of great success. Counted by many the finest exhibit of
its kind ever to be conducted in the states, it had in the fine
arts division works of the eminent Lithuanian sculptor Petras

Rimsa, the distinguished painter Simonis, and the works of lesser

known Lithuanian artists, both from Lithuania and from the states.

The display of popular art was one of magnitude, having represented

in it, work in every field of popular art.</p>
      <p>The society has published a literary magazine, the Furrow, which

has given to literary-minded American-Lithuanian youth the opportunity 
to present their works to the reading public. As with the

arts exhibit, so it was in this case also a pioneering achievement.</p>
      <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
      <p>In addition to the Furrow, the society has maintained in Naujienos

an English page, as an added means for literary expression.</p>
      <p>Representing the Lithuanians of Chicago, the Youth Society has always

taken a very active part in all festivals and cultural programs which

occur in the city. The society's costumed folk-dance group, one of

the finest in the city, is already well known through its many

appearances, at which it always enjoys acclaim.</p>
      <p>The outstanding event was the participation of the group in the first

Chicagoland Folk Dance Festival, sponsored by the Chicago Park District

and held at Soldiers Field on Labor Day of 1936. Seventy-six young

people of both sexes took part to present a gay and imposing picture

to the thousands of guests who came to witness the first of these

unusual affairs.</p>
      <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
      <p>Festival and cultural days have been employed in the past for bringing 
into contact with the Lithuanians cultural organizations of

other nationalities, making for a better understanding between these

people. A festival of this type, called Lithuanian Day, will be

held on January 9th at La Follette Park, 1400 north and 5200 west,

where various national groups will gather to become acquainted with

the young Lithuanian generation. The evening's program will consist

of swimming, social and folk dancing, the serving of a Lithuanian

plate lunch and acquainting the people with the ways of the Lithuanians.</p>
      <p>This year's officers of the Lithuanian Youth Society are Vytantas

Beliajus, President, 5657 S. Saginaw Avenue.</p>
