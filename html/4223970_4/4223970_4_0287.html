      <p>An immigrant probably never feels more helpless and deserted than at that moment 
when, standing at the very gates of the "American Paradise," he must first
go through the Ellis Island station (Castle Garne), the special "purgatory"
for immigrants.</p>
      <p>Practically every immigrant has been there and has had a taste of its pleasures.
It is no wonder that the immigrant remembers it later and sympathizes heartily
with his brothers who go through the same "purgatory" by the thousands, daily.
Recalling his own bitter experience, he tries as much as possible to ease the
plight of his later-arriving brothers. Several thousand immigrants pass through
this station daily. The representatives of the government do not have much
time to "play" with each immigrant. Often they cannot even understand each
other and, because of this, hundreds of immigrants are unjustly sent back.</p>
      <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
      <p>Because of this, each nationality is forced to strive to have its own representative 
in Castle Garne, so as to aid their fellow-nationals who meet with misfortune.</p>
      <p>Every nation which sends large numbers of immigrants to America today has its
representatives on Ellis Island. Several years ago the Lithuanians also began
to concern themselves with this matter. And it was worth doing so, for it
seems that about twenty thousand Lithuanians are arriving in this country
annually.</p>
      <p>However, this matter of protecting the immigrants is not well organized by us.

Up to now the Lithuaniana were not able to place even one of their own people

on Ellis Island as an official. All that we have been able to accomplish was

to get under the wings of the other nationalities, like some kind of orphans.

The Polish St. Joseph Immigration Home aided us out of "sympathy." Later we

<a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
became so wealthy that, for a few dollars, we were able to make a deal for our

own corner in the Slovak Immigration Home. And, to this day, we Lithuanians

are "cornering" in this manner. That we are reaping little benefit out of

such "cornering" was revealed during the Waterbury convention of the Lithuanian

Alliance of America. There it was explained that, though the upkeep of the

"corner" with the Slovaks costs us several hundred dollars annually, our man,

however, lacking an official representative's rights, cannot even get near

the immigrants.</p>
      <p>The Lithuanian Alliance convention, therefore, decided to use all its power in

striving to have a Lithuanian representative at Ellis Island. It invited its

colleague, the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance of America, to cooperate in

this matter and the latter agreed. Both Alliances donated $250 each and elected

three members each to a committee. In this manner, a knot was tied between the

largest Lithuanian organizations, for the first time, to work at a common,

vital task.</p>
      <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
      <p>The Lithuanian general public will, undoubtedly, sympathize with such a task

and its support cannot be doubted.</p>
      <p>However, the smoothly begun work--the newly launched life-boat to save the

immigrants--almost hit the rocks which threatened destruction from the very

beginning. Articles provoking arguments about who should be the leaders--which 
of the Alliances, the National or Catholic, should have control of the

matter--began to appear in the organ of the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance, 
the Draugas (published in Chicago). It was pointed out that not only

the bodies but also the souls of the immigrants in Castle Garne need help.

In other words, the Lithuanian representative there must be a good Catholic

and it should be avoided that a freethinker or godless man should sometimes

squeeze in there. He might save the immigrants' "bodies" but would lose their

"souls" by drawing them into the nets of free thought and godlessness.</p>
      <p>Therefore. we see that, in the very middle of the started work, that "religious

<a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>

point" on which more than one Lithuanian project has been shattered, has raised

its head. The unfortunate practice of measuring everything with a religious

or anti-religious ladle is still in full sway among the Lithuanians. We attempt 
to dress everything in religious or anti-religious clothing, disregarding

the fact that there should be no place for that clothing here.</p>
      <p>If our Catholic masses could see that such an immigrants' protective institution 
was really trying to trap immigrants in the nets of godlessness or free

thought, they would undoubtedly have the right to complain and refuse their

support to such an institution. It would be an equally unfortunate task to

"save not only the bodies, but also the souls"; that is, to make a religious

mission out of an immigrants' protective institution.</p>
      <p>If we will regard the protection of immigrants only from a religious or anti-religious 
viewpoint, we can state beforehand that not one faction nor the other

<a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
has the desire to aid the immigrants. Both factions would then be hypocrites

who, under the pretext of protecting immigrants, desire to conduct their individual 
missions.</p>
      <p>Is it not so? Why, the immigrant who is in Castle Garne is concerned with one--

and only one--matter: to get out of Castle Garne as soon as possible and to

enter this country freely. It is for this purpose and not any other purpose

that the Lithuanians want to establish an immigrants' protective institution

and to have a Lithuanian representative.</p>
      <p>Neither faction can argue that this is not the sole purpose. It is obvious

that if we are not hypocrites but really concerned with the position of the

immigrant, we will strive as much as possible to attain that one, clearly defined, 
purpose. . . . .</p>
      <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
      <p>It is really surprising to us that such religious and anti-religious questions

could be raised on such an undertaking as the task of protecting the immigrants.

From the examples of the past, we can predict that if we place other aims in

place of this one aim, we will never complete this task.</p>
      <p>The hunter who wants to shoot a wolf does not aim at the fox. If he were to do

that, we would call him the most idiotic of all idiots.</p>
      <p>We Lithuanians have agreed to finally "shoot the wolf"--that is, we must help

our immigrants get out of that "purgatory" of Castle Garne. Therefore, let us

not shoot at the fox, for we will then deserve the same description given to

the above-mentioned hunter.</p>
      <p>The common committee of the two Alliances, into whose hands this task was

entrusted, will have to pay close attention to this matter.</p>
      <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
      <p>The representative of the Lithuanian immigrantsâ€™ institution should be

neither a freethinker, nor a socialist, nor a catholic, nor a godless person,

but a good Lithuanian: one who is conscientious and who understands his task;

one who would strive to achieve his real task, which is to give help to those

Lithuanians in Castle Garne who need it. A person who carries the stamp of

a hot, fanatical freethinker, socialist, catholic or godlessness on his forehead, 
is totally unfit for the position.</p>
