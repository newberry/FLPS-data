      <p>A private meeting was held on July 2nd at Mr. J. Girijotas', and
$5.50 was collected for the revolutionary movement in Russia. The
contribution was given to me, and I have sent the money to the
Workers' Voice publishers, Scotland.</p>
      <p>The contributors are J. Girijotas, Mrs. E. Girijotiene, J. Valentovic,
and J. Zaluba. They have donated 25 cents each. M. Andriejevskis, K.
Songaila, J. Ugianskis, J. Valentinas, Ralciunas, J. Mickevicia, and
V. Mickevicia donated 50 cents each, and T. Druktenis, $1. Total $5.50.</p>
      <p>In the name of the Social-Democratic party of Lithuania I thank these
donors most heartily.</p>

      <p>This ought to be an example for all the nationalists. All should
donate as much as they can to their fatherland, Lithuania, to help
the revolutionists there to fight for Lithuania's freedom. The
time has come. The bell has rung the last hour for the despotic
regime of the tsar and his hirelings. The revolution in Russia is
spreading from one end of the empire to the other. This revolutionary
movement will overthrow the old despotic regime and will give birth
to new and free governmental rule. Honor to the fighters for freedom

and honor to the contributors for the revolution!</p>
      <p>I. Ilgandas</p>
      <p>Representative of the Social-Democratic Party of Lithuania.</p>
