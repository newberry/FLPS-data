      <p>This article is scornfully written about the Lithuanian priest Kolesinski,
against whom the committee of thirteen made protest in the same issue of
Lietuva.</p>
      <p>It states that during the rebellion of Poles in 1863 the priest lived in
Lithuania, and that the priest raped many young Lithuanian girls; that the
Russian government for his immorality exiled the priest to Siberia. The priest
escaped from Siberia and came to the United States.</p>
      <p>Then the same priest had a church in Pittston, Pennsylvania. The priest
began to act immorally -- attacked a saloon-keeper's wife. But as she was a
moral woman she called up her husband, then both of them beat the priest.
About the dissolute manners of this priest, those people notified bishop
O'Hara of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The bishop unfrocked the priest. Then this
unfrocked priest wrote a letter to the bishop in Lithuania, telling that
bishop that he had lost his consecration papers. So the bishop from Lithuania
sent to this priest other papers.</p>
      <p>Now, the Lithuanians of Chicago ought to know with whom they are dealing
and what a dissolute man the priest is.</p>
      <p>By Pittstonian friend of the priest.</p>
