      <p>Every civilized nation has its art and artists. When there is no art,
there is no nation. The Lithuanians, too, have their art from ancient
times; but who has ever seen Lithuanian art?</p>
      <p>The beautiful work of our artists is scattered among other nations.
The Lithuanian artists are not recognized for their work. Many
Lithuanian artistic works are to be found in towns and villages of
Lithuania. They do not get there recognition or respect. Many times we
have admired the art of other nations, while our own neglected. Many
times have we written about the collection Lithuanian art. Now the
exhibition of Lithuanian art will be held in Vilnius, Lithuania, on
the 27th day of December, 1906.</p>
