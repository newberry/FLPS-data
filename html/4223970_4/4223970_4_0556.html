      <p>At the suggestion of Dr. K. Drangelis, the Lietuva (Lithuania) will conduct a
column entitled "Kaledos ir Lietuva" (Christmas and Lithuania) for the purpose
of raising funds for a Christmas present for Lithuania. The money will be
sent to Lithuania around Christmas, and is to be used for the sole purpose of
helping Lithuania regain political independence. A list of the donations and
names of donors will be published in the special column every week until
Christmas.</p>
      <p>To get the fund off to a start, Lietuva has contributed $25. Others who have
already contributed are as follows: Dr. K. Drangelis, Mr. and Mrs. Bruno K.
Balutis, Dr. A. Zimontas, and Justin Kulis, $10 each; Joseph Giraitis and
Pauline Giraitis, $5 each. The fund thus gets under way with a total of $75.</p>
