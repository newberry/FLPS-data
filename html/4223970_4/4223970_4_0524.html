      <p>Those Lithuanians who, before the war, were active in the Lithuanian national
movement were usually referred to by the Poles as Russophiles or hirelings
for Russian rubles.</p>
      <p>Today, when there are no more Russians in Lithuania and when the Lithuanians
are energetically demanding complete independence for their nation, the Poles
can no longer call these same men Russian hirelings, for they have already
declared their independence of Russia. Therefore the Poles are now shamelessly 
calling them German hirelings.</p>
      <p>In Chicago there is an alleged Polish-Lithuanian society which calls itself
"Polsko-Litawskie Towarzysto Unia Lubelska No. 1" -(Polish-Lithuanian Society
Lublin Union No. 1).</p>
      <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
      <p>On March 2, the Chicago Polish newspaper Dziennik Narodowy reported that
the "Lithuanian" members of this Society drew up an appeal, which was approved
by the Society, entitled "Do Braci Litwinow W Stanach Zjednoczonych" (To our
Brother Lithuanians in the United States).</p>
      <p>The appeal mentioned here could have been written only by people who are either
complete ignoramuses or conscienceless slanderers-most likely the latter. The

appeal reads as follows:</p>
      <p>"Dear Brothers!</p>
      <p>"At our most recent meeting, on February 9, there was a serious and comprehensive 
discussion of the unfortunate political hostility which the present war

created between Lithuania and Poland, two nations which have been friendly for

generations.</p>
      <p>"Unfriendly intrigue on the part of the Prussians, on the one side, and

certain Lithuanians seeking benefits for themselves and not working for the

good of the nation, on the other, has led to the point where Poland and Lithuania, 
by breaking the union established at great sacrifice by these two nations

<a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
centuries ago to protect themselves from the rapaciousness of the

(German) crusaders, must now face each other, as enemy faces enemy, so that

in the future (according to Prussian intrigues and plans) they will fight

and weaken one another and will finally yield to seizure by never-satiated

Prussian militarism.</p>
      <p>"Brother Lithuanians, be on your guard!</p>
      <p>"The Plans (This refers to the demands for Lithuania's independence.--Sau-Bajoras.) 
of those who assume crusaders' cloaks [Translator's note: In

other words, pro-Germans] are not the wishes of the people who live in

Lithuanian cottages....They do not express the feelings of virtuous hearts

from the beloved fields and pine forests along the Nemunas (Niemen) River

.....In these plans can rather be discerned the voice of opportunists, of

whom there is no shortage anywhere today; the voice of those who, until now,

have been unable to exploit the people because they are known and are

measured by the right yardstick; the voice of those after whom, like a

personal bodyguard, marches a helmeted German with a bayonet attached to his
rifle.</p>
      <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
      <p>"In preparing the irreparable partitioning of two of the most dangerous

nations to Prussianism, Poland and Lithuania, the Prussian employers are

acting very wisely, while we, enveloped in the expectation of hypothetical 

independence, idly wait, doing nothing.</p>
      <p>"Recall the history of these countries. For centuries after the German

Knights of the Cross first appeared, in 1190, under the cloak of the propagation 
of the faith, Lithuania and Poland suffered the same fate as that

which now, during the present war, is being encountered by Poland, Belgium,

and other countries, because of the aggression by the heirs of the German

Knights. The time has come when, to save the lives of these nations, union

is absolutely necessary. In 1386 the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Vladas

Jogaila, wed the Polish Queen Jadvyga....not because there were no beautiful

girls among the nobility in Lithuania.....With an aching heart Jadvyga,

Queen of the Poles, sacrificed on her country's altar her love for Duke

Rakuski, and married Jogaila.....They did this because the existence of both

<a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>

countries depended on the union of these two royal families. [Translator's note: 
The elision marks are the author's.]

"That (marriage) foiled the German plans and finally led to war....to the 

never to be forgotten Battle of Zalgiris, in 1410, in which heroic Lithuanians, 
Poles, and Ukrainians shed their blood to weaken the Crusader's

might. [Translator's note: In 1410, Grand Duke Vytautas of Lithuania led 

a victorious army against the German Knights at Tanenberg, called Zalgiris 

in Lithuanian. The power of the German Order was crushed for all time in

this battle.] In 1569, Lithuania and Poland joined in the Union of Lublin 

and thus postponed for centuries the misfortune which faces us today.</p>
      <p>"Today, however, there is a shortage of these people of Jogaila's time.....

Today Lithuania is travelling on a different path because the Germans wish

it so, because there are Lithuanians who serve, not Lithuania, but Germany.

They, according to German instructions, favor the policy of separation from

the nation to which freedom from the German yoke means as much as to the

Lithuanians. They are scheming to break the union with Poland, for the

<a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>

plans of the Germans are to separate, to break up brotherly nations,

to create an ineradicable intolerance between certain relatives so that, in

the future, weakened by arguments, unable to endure each other, they will
never again stand shoulder to shoulder as they did at Zalgiris, in common 
defense. Thus they would easily be swallowed by the Knights of Cross, 
with no more hope of return!</p>
      <p>"Our voice, authorized by the Lublin Union No. 1, is the voice of Lithuanians 
and Poles united in this society. We appeal to you, brothers:

awake! . . . . speak! . . . .write! . . . .protest against the contempt shown for the

glorious deeds of the Lithuanian Grand Dukes, Jogaila and Vytautas, and the 
union of two nations, blessed by Lithuanian blood!</p>
      <p>"Raise your voices in warning and protest, for Lithuania, Poland, Samagothia,

and Ukrainia, fooled by Germany's promise of liberty, are stepping into a

grave on which the German is sacrilegiously sculpturing a false statue of
liberty.</p>
      <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
      <p>"In the name of the society: S. Zukowski, Dr. L. S. Szumkowski,

F. Okulanis, J. Zelnia, A. Mazylewski, W. Bielinski."</p>
      <p>Such is the appeal issued by "half-Lithuanians". Who the two supposedly

Lithuanian signers, F. Okulanis and J. Zelnis, are, I do not know. We knew

long ago that the Poles were blackening, in the worst way, the names of

those Lithuanian leaders who have defended and are defending the Lithuanian 

nation from the Polish yoke, but up to now nobody would have expected that

people with Lithuanian-sounding names would sign such malicious statements. 

It would be a good thing if Chicago's Lithuanians would take a hand and

warn the Lithuanians belonging to this society. They should be told how the 

Poles, under the pretense of saving the Lithuanians from the Germans, are

seeking to put a noose around their necks, to hang the Lithuanians on a

Polish rope.</p>
      <p>

There are so many absurdities, so much poison spilled in the above appeal,

that any intelligent Lithuanian can easily see through this trick of the

Polish fusionists. To accuse those Lithuanians and everybody else, who want

<a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>

and work for Lithuania's liberty, of being hired by Germans, one

must be either a villainous intriguer or a complete lunatic.</p>
      <p>
On the other hand, it is easy to understand what an ax is placed into the 
hands of the Poles by our own Socialist intriguers who, for their own

partisan reasons, made the same kind of villainous accusations through that

unfortunate Chicago Lithuanian (supposedly Workers') Council.</p>
      <p>
The Poles can make use of this fact and can shout to the world that even a 

part of the Lithuanians accuse the fighters for Lithuania's freedom of

being German hirelings. You can see how, through the foolishness of some, 

the villainy of others, and the intrigues of yet others, attempts are made as

to drive wedges into Lithuanian unity.</p>
