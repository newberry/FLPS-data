<p>Lodge 194 of the Lithuanian Alliance is located in Cicero. Anyone may join
it--man, woman, or child. At its last meeting the Lodge donated five dollars 
from its meager treasury to the cause of Lithuanian independence, and the 
members added $22.60 more. The money and the names of the donors have been 
sent to the organ of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, the Tevyne.</p>
<p>The Lodge also selected a committee of three members to solicit donations 
for the Lithuanian cause. It is believed that this committee will be able 
to do a great deal. Lietuva will undoubtedly help us in this matter. We
have only to work together, in perfect harmony, and our efforts will be
more successful than they have been in the past.</p>
