<p>Through its secretary, Frank Morrison, the American Federation of Labor
has informed the Immigration Committee of the House of Representatives that 
the Federation would like to see the Burnett Bill become a law. The bill
will come to a vote within a week or two. Its most important provision, as 
everyone knows, is the "literacy test," that is, a reading and writing test. 
If the bill is enacted, no immigrant who cannot read or write in at least 
one language will be permitted to enter the United States.</p>
<p>The purpose of the bill is to restrict immigration. The Federation of Labor 
endorses the bill because it thinks the flow of immigrants into this country
is harmful to the workers of America. The greater the number of workers
coming into the United States, the more difficult it is for them to find
jobs. The supply of workers exceeds the demand, and the value of their
<span class="page-break">2</span>
labor consequently decreases--exactly like any other commodity [of which

there is a surplus].</p>
<p>But the competition offered the workers of this country by immigrant workers

is especially harmful because of the fact that the immigrants readily allow 

themselves to be exploited by the capitalists. They have become used to 

poverty in their native countries. They do not know how to organize, and 

they have no understanding [of the problems of labor]. The capitalists can 

hire these immigrants at lower wages than the workers of this country demand, 
so that the latter lose their jobs in the factories. Cheap, uneducated labor

ousts the better-paid, and more educated workers. Therefore, the Federation 

of Labor is fighting for the bill with the slogan "Against Cheap Labor!"

The Federation believes that illiterate immigrants form the majority of the 

cheap labor responsible for worsening the worker's lot in America.

We must admit that the opinion expressed by the Federation--or, to be more

<span class="page-break">3</span>

exact, by the officers of the Federation--is true, at least in part. Cheap

labor is detrimental to the progress of the working class. Most of this

cheap labor is supplied by backward countries in which even an elementary

education is beyond the means of the masses of the poor. Our "Holy Lithuania"

is among such countries.</p>
<p>But the officers of the Federation err when they think they can resolve this 

problem by stopping the immigration of the uneducated. The ability to read 

or write is very far from being a satisfactory criterion for distinguishing 

cheap labor from "dear" labor. There are more people than there need be, 

even among those who have mastered the mysteries of the alphabet, who are

unenlightened, who have no knowledge of a trade, and who have no understanding 
of the benefits to be derived by workers through organization. On the 

other hand, the mysteries of the alphabet are not so great that they cannot

be mastered by anyone. Does a worker who has learned to read and write

differ so much from one who has not that he should immediately be transferred 
from the "dangerous-to-America" category to the "nondangerous"?
<span class="page-break">4</span>

Of course not! The supporters of the Burnett Bill are themselves well

aware of this. They also admit that the literacy test is not a perfect

means of protecting the American labor market from undesirable competition.

They admit that it is merely the most practical method thus far conceived 
to restrict immigration. What they are really after is the curbing of 

immigration and, if possible, its complete stoppage.</p>
<p>The stopping of immigration at the present time is a dream which cannot be 

fulfilled. Even a considerable restriction of immigration is a dream which 

cannot be fulfilled. There are too many ties between the various countries 

to make it possible for any one of them to fence itself off with impregnable 

walls. The migration of people from one part of the world to another is

increasing continually; therefore, attempts to stop people from migrating

into one country or another are retrogressive, and are opposed to the

progress of the world. They are doomed to failure.</p>
<p>Instead of dreaming about how to chase immigrants from the American shores,

<span class="page-break">5</span>
the officers of the Federation of Labor would do better to think about

how to protect the rights of the immigrants already in this country.

There are plenty of harmful competitors in the American labor market who

agree to sell their labor to the capitalists for a low price. Even if it 

is true that the majority of them are from the ranks of the people who have 

come here from Europe and Asia, what is to be done with them? They are in 

America now, and you cannot send them back. The supporters of the Burnett 

Bill say nothing in reply to this question. They think that all they have 

to do to separate the low-paid workers from the well-paid workers is to 

put up a special kind of fence. They use the labor unions as just such a

fence. Skilled workers should be organized into unions, and the unions

should dictate the working conditions in the factories. But the doors of

both the unions and the factories must be closed to the unskilled laborers.

This is the position of the leaders of the Federation of Labor--a fence on

the outside and a fence inside the country. For the one there is the

Burnett Bill, for the other a system which bans the majority of workers

from the ranks of organized labor.
 
<span class="page-break">6</span>

However, life flows in too strong a current to be stopped by the dams

erected by shortsighted politicians. Just as no bills of any kind can

stop the migration of masses of the people from one state to another

following the extension of systems of communication and transportation, so 

no craft-union methods can separate the working class into two distinct

groups as long as the use of machinery is increasing in industry. The wider 

the use of machinery, the less significant does the training of a craftsman 

become. It is not difficult to learn to operate a machine. Having learned 

to work at a machine, the "laborer" becomes a "skilled worker," and then

competition between him and other "skilled workers" is unavoidable if he is

not a member of their organization. In this manner, the skilled workers 

will have to admit more and more "immigrants" from the mass of the "laborers"

In this manner, therefore, the unions are continually losing their privileged

character. From organizations of the privileged they become organizations of

the working class.</p>
<p>Such is the way of progress. It has already forced far-sighted union leaders
<span class="page-break">7</span>
to abandon the narrow egotism of the craft movement. It has proved that

the workers benefit more when they interest themselves not only in the

welfare of their own trade, but also in the welfare of the working class

as a whole. The working class extends over the whole world. An intelligent 

worker, therefore, will not be satisfied to concern himself only with benefits 

for workers in his own country. If the workers of one country attempt to

benefit at the expense of the workers of another country, they will harm

themselves also. Looking at the matter from this point of view, the Burnett

Bill should be condemned. The workers should oppose it.</p>
<p>The American Federation of Labor is urging its followers to send letters and 

telegrams to their Congressmen, demanding that they vote for the bill.

Intelligent workers should do just the opposite; they should demand that the

Burnett Bill be defeated.</p>
