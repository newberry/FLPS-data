<p>p.3. Just a word in explanation. Our former English section known as “The
Young Folks" will continue from now on under the heading: “Direct Echoes."</p>
<p>All of our previously announced policies will be strictly adhered to, and in this
issue a few of them will once more be set forth and analyzed.</p>
<p>"Direct Echoes" will contain articles on the activities of various young folks'
clubs, and it will include news items about anything and everything we hear
concerning young people, regardless of their political or religious beliefs and
affiliations.</p>
<p>Our aim is to become the medium of exchange of club news and opinions of young
Americans of Lithuanian descent.</p>
<p>Our interest in the American youth of Lithuanian descent is sincere and genuine,
and "not restricted" by any sect-favoritism or prejudice.</p>
