<p>The Young Lithuanian National Club of America, on November 27, Thanksgiving
Day, at St. George's Parish Hall, arranged an evening with a varied program,
consisting of a drama, a concert, and a banquet. This club presented a
beautiful and impressive four-act play, entitled "Wounds of the Age". Besides 
 the fact that this play was well presented, it is necessary to say 
that the Young Lithuanian National Club of America gave us several hours of
pleasure during the entire evening. Although it was not long ago that this 
club began its theatrical activity, it is progressing rapidly. Since this
club has made such a good beginning, we hope that it will go forward with
its cultural and diverse activity. The stage manager was Mr. B. Vaitekunas.</p>
<p>The evening was enriched by an excellent concert, consisting of ten numbers.
The concert was comprised of a choir, directed by Mr. J. M. Girnas, an
<span class="page-break">2</span>
orchestra, solos and duets on musical instruments, etc. The
concert concluded the program with the same beauty and left the
same favorable impression, as had the actors, with their performance, in
the beginning. The choir is much larger, and has made remarkable progress.</p>
<p>After the program, there was a banquet. An unfavorable impression was made
at this, because some persons wore caps on their heads during the entire
evening. The evening supervisors should take notice of this and eliminate

such occurrences. Otherwise, everything was good.</p>
