      <p>The Flower of the Future (Ateities Ziedas) Children's Society held an affair
at the Meldazis Hall last Sunday, May 19. The Society is directed by Miss S.
Staniulis.</p>
      <p>The children presented a play, "Happy Days", written by Grigonis.</p>
      <p>It was presented fairly well--Julia Micevicius and Stephanie Staniulis were
especially good--but the songs were even better than the play. A mixed chorus
of about fifty children sang several folk songs. One little girl of about ten
years sang "The North Wind Blew" (Oi, Pute, Pute) as a solo. She has a strong
voice and sang excellently.</p>
      <p>One thing should be pointed out here. That is the fact that our "progressives"
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
are inclined to adopt that which is foreign, regardless of whether
it is good or bad. Here is what happened at this affair: A young
boy came out on the stage with a girl to sing a duet; their song was the Bolshevik 
hymn; and everybody in the audience rose. In other words, they gave it the
same honors they would the Lithuanian or American anthems.</p>
      <p>We would add no importance to this action if the Lithuanian anthem had also been
sung at this affair. But it was not. This reveals the spirit of the sponsors

of the event. Why should the Lithuanians be concerned with the Bolshevik hymn?</p>
      <p>At the affairs sponsored by our radicals, often we can observe that half the audience 
remains seated while the Lithuanian anthem is being sung.</p>
      <p>I do not blame Miss Staniulis, for she was forced by the "progressive" women who

sponsor this Society to have only the Bolshevik hymn sung.</p>
      <p>Miss Staniulis should be given much credit for training such a large group of

children; it is not an easy task.</p>
