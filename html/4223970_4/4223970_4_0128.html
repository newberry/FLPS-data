      <p>Through the effort of the Lithuanians in Chicago, they saw for the first
time their own church.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday, February 5, with a great celebration, the Lithuanian church
was consecrated. Many Lithuanian societies joined this celebration and helped
the parish to decorate the church. The church was very nicely decorated. The
church was packed with people. The organist, Mr. Butkewiczius, with music
delighted the people, and for the first time the mass was held in a Lithuanian
church.</p>
      <p>It seems that Lithuanians of Chicago were pleased with their accomplishment,
they freely gave money for the church, they bought a lot and in a short time
established the church.</p>
      <p>There were many priests at this consecration. <span class="gap">[gap]</span>
and effort we are thanking the Lithuanian societies,
the parish and the organist.</p>
