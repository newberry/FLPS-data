      <p>At the meeting of Mr. J. Mockus on January 29, Mr. M. Janasievicz
sponsored the collection for Lithuanian affairs. He collected
$4.25. The money is donated to our brothers who are at present
fighting in the revolutionary ranks against the Russian despotic
tsar.</p>
      <p>I wish that all the Lithuanians would follow this example to help
our brothers to go forward with the revolution in Russia.</p>
