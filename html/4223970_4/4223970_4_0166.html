      <p>As announced last spring, there is a movement being made by
Direct Echoes to bring closer together the various clubs
of young people.</p>
      <p>Although we did not take any definite steps during the summer
months, we still have this movement on our program, and we
shall begin to act now.</p>
      <p>At present we are corresponding with and discussing our plan
with the following well-known Lithuanian young folks’ clubs:</p>
      <p><a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
Birute, a choral club, which claims a high percentage of young
folks in its membership; Golden Stars, a very active men's
club, featuring sports; Kulturos Ratelis (Cultural Circle),
more popularly known as the K R's, whose membership consists of
a limited number of Lithuanian young women; Lambda Gamma Kappa,
an enterprising group of wide awake young men; Ruta Gay Girls,
representing the younger set of young women; Marquette Maroons,
a branch of the Lithuanian alliance of America organization, a
young folks' group that is always doing something.</p>
      <p>We should like to hear from any other Lithuanian young folks’

club or associations.</p>
      <p>We shall soon arrange a get-together.</p>
      <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
      <p>Let us hear from you at once, so that we can include your

club in our invitation list for the get-together, when we

shall explain how our plan concerns each and every Lithuanian

young people's organization.</p>
