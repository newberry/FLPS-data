      <p>p.5. As we have mentioned previously, we are planning a get-together for
young folks of varied interests and activities, with clubs and organizations
of young folks of Lithuanian descent. We are aiming to bring into closer
contact as many as we possibly can. No, we do not plan to unite them; we
only desire to introduce a more friendly attitude toward and between each
than is now extant.</p>
      <p>If the officers or members of any organization, or if anyone has any
suggestions, please let us know.</p>
