      <p>Money was sent to our newspaper Lietuva to help the martyrs who were
trying to enlighten our brothers in Lithuania, and who are now exiled
in Siberia by the Russian government. The $96 that we have received for
this great cause were sent to the committee in Europe for distribution
among them. As soon as we receive the acknowledgement from Europe, we
will announce it in the newspapers.</p>
