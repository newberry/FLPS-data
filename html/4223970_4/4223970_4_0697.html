      <p>By reading, the newspapers we see how the Lithuanians of other cities
have made contributions to the Fatherland's workers and the friends of
liberty who are fighting for the freedom of our Mother Lithuania.</p>
      <p>The men of our vicinity are doing nothing for the great cause of Lithuania's 
freedom, so I have decided to take up a collection. I went among
my friends and collected $3.10 for the revolutionary movement in
Lithuania.</p>
      <p>Even though in Roseland and Kensington there are many Lithuanians, they
are slumbering, doing nothing for the good of our nation Lithuania. It
is a disgrace to stay here and do nothing.</p>
      <p>Mr. A. Kulesiene.</p>
