<p>We have news that some Lithuanians, of course Christians, on the North Side of
the city of Chicago, held a protest meeting against Japan, for fighting against
the Christian Russians. It looks as if their heads have been twisted! They
do not know that many times Christians act in an un-Christian manner and to that
class belong the Christian Russians, who are persecuting the Lithuanians. True,
in the Russian war against Japan, the Russian government had sent many Lithuanians
to the war front. Many Lithuanians will be killed there. When the Lithuanians
lose their lives, the Russian government is responsible for it.</p>
