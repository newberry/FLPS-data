<p>As we have already reported, a resolution concerning the independence of
Lithuania was recently sent by the Lovers of the Fatherland Society to
President Wilson, to senators and congressmen, and to the ambassadors of
various countries in Washington.</p>
<p>Dr. A. Zimontas, president of the Society, has received many replies concerning 
the resolution. From the White House, Mr. Tumulty, the President's secretary, 
wrote that the resolution "would be brought to the President's attention."
Acknowledging the receipt of the resolution, Champ Clark, Speaker of the
House, pointed out that "this matter will be carefully considered."</p>
<p>The British Ambassador sent the following reply (we print it here, translated 
into Lithuanian):</p>
<span class="page-break">2</span>
<p>"Dear Sir: I wish to announce that I have received your letter of January
28 with the text of the resolution concerning the fate of Lithuania, which
was adopted by your organization.</p>
<p>"Copies of your letter are being sent to London for the information of the
British government.</p>
<p>"I remain, respectfully yours, etc."</p>
<p>The above reply shows in what manner the Lithuanians of America can attract
the attention not only of the government of this country but also of the governments 
of the other Allied nations to Lithuanian matters and Lithuanian
demands.</p>
<span class="page-break">3</span>
<p>Favorable replies were received from the following United States Senators:
Senator W. J. Stone, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee;
Senators G. M. Hitchcock, Hiram J. Johnson (California), Boise Penrose
(Pennsylvania) , Axle J. Gronna (North Dakota), James Hamilton Lewis (Illinois),

J. W. Weeks, Wesley L. Jones, and others.</p>
<p>The reply of John Sharp Williams (Mississippi), chairman of the Library Committee, 
is interesting from several points of view. Among other things he says:</p>
<p>"If Lithuania desires the assistance of other liberty-loving nations of the

world when this war is over, she ought now to be fighting Germany. She can

rest assured that any good service for the cause of liberty in the trenches

now, at this moment, will be acknowledged by the republics of France and

America and will be evaluated by the English monarchy. Those who skulk will

be left to take care of themselves. I am sure that the people of Lithuania

will not skulk."</p>

<span class="page-break">4</span>
<p>In his reply, William E. Mason, Congressman from Illinois, says among

other things:</p>
<p>"I fully sympathize with your resolution. I have had the opportunity to

meet many of your people and to learn somethingâ€™ of your history, and I know

that the only way to achieve permanent peace is--to apply the doctrine of

self-determination. When we sacrifice the lives of our children and tax our

people until they cannot carry the load....we have the right to demand that

Lithuania have the right of self-government.</p>
<p>"I shall be happy to hear from you at any time concerning this important matter."</p>
<p>Congressman Guy E. Campbell (Pennsylvania) points out:

"President Wilson has decided that, in the readjustment following the war,

all the nations will have the right to decide their individual forms of government, 
present boundaries notwithstanding."</p>

<p>On February 1 Congressman William J. Gary (Wisconsin) wrote:

"I have just received a copy of the resolution passed by the Society

of which you have the honor of being president, and I have carefully studied

the resolution. The wishes expressed therein meet with my approval, and I

will be pleased to present them to the House, when it meets tomorrow."</p>
<p>Congressman Stuart F. Reed (West Virginia) pledges that "this matter will have

my sincere approval when it is presented in Congress."</p>
<p>Favorable replies were also received from the following Congressmen: Scott

Ferris, chairman of the Public Lands Committee; R.D. Heaton, representing

Pennsylvania's Twelfth District; Julius Kahn, a member of the Committee on

Military Affairs; M. F. Phelan of Massachusetts; J. Hampton Moore of Pennsylvania; 
John R. Ramsey of New Jersey; and many others.</p>
