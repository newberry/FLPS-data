<p>p.7...............The Young Lithuanian-Americans' National Club elected new officers
at their last meeting. Among those elected were J. Jankauskas, president; D.
Gulbinas, secretary; T. Radavicius, treasurer.</p>
<p>All young Lithuanian men and girls who are interested in the study of art, such as
music and acting in theatrical presentations are invited to join this club. Besides
the teaching and presentation of musical and dramatic programs, this club is also
engaged in mutual aid to its members during sickness. Therefore it is a worthwhile 
organization to join for all young Lithuanians.</p>
<p>Mr. J. Girnus, composer, is the choral instructor. Mr. B. Vaitiskunaa is head of
the dramatic section.</p>
<p>Monthly meetings of the club are held at Radaviscius Hall, 936 West 33rd Street,
where choral and dramatic rehearsals are also held.</p>
