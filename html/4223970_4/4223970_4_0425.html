      <p>Last Thursday evening, a mass meeting was held in Milda Hall, at which Mr. John
Liutkauskas of New York was the principal speaker. Rain and bad weather held
the attendance down; not many people were present.</p>
      <p>Mr. Lukas acted as chairman of the meeting. He informed the gathering of the 
purpose of the meeting, and pointed out that it is the duty of every Lithuanian 
to contribute to the cause of Lithuanian independence. The Lithuanians of America, 
who have come to Lithuania's aid many times in the past, must do so again.
This is the purpose of Mr. J. Liutkauskas' trip through the Lithuanian conununities
of the United States. Mr. Liutkauskas is a member of the Executive Committee of 
Lithuanian Councils in Washington, D. C. The chairman reminded the audience that
the Lithuanians have never surrendered to their enemies in the face of persecution, 
and that they will not do so now. Having thus opened the meeting, Mr. Lukas
introduced Attorney F. P. Bradchulis.</p>
      <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
      <p>Mr. Bradchulis traced the history of the Lithuanians under the Russians
and the Germans, and pointed out what is necessary for the Lithuanians of America 
to do now. It was his opinion that, in the final analysis, the war was won
by the smaller nations. When the smaller nations under Russia and Austria
rebelled," he said, "the larger nations fell."</p>
      <p>Then the speaker sketched the history of Lithuania's long and slow fight for

liberty. He related how the Lithuanians built schools, and how they Lithuanianized

Vilnius, where, according to the speaker, even the Poles admit that only eight

per cent of the population do not understand Lithuanian "What would happen in

Vilnius," asked Mr. Bradchulis, "if the Lithuanian government could stay there

a few more years?" He urged the audience to donate money for sending; representatives 
to the Peace Conference in Versailles, where they would be able to win

full independence for Lithuania.</p>
      <p>Mr. John Liutkauskas spoke next. He gave "a very clear picture of the present


<a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
political predicament of Lithuania. Point by point, he examined the

Polish intrigues in this country, which are designed to prevent Lithuania from

gaining her independence. The Lithuanian Council in Washington has always

striven--and will continue to strive to bring those intrigues to light.</p>
      <p>Speaking of the enemies of Lithuanian independence, the honorable speaker pointed
out that the Lithuanians have two enemies: the Poles, and an internal enemy. He 

said that the internal enemy is "misunderstanding, fanaticism, and disagreement".</p>
      <p>The speaker discussed democratic principles, pointing out that the motto of

democracy is the ancient phrase, "Vox Populi, Vox Dei"--the voice of the people

is the voice of God. He emphasized the fact that the Lithuanians of America

demand a democratic republic, which would be governed by the voice of the people.</p>
      <p>The Poles are sticking out their feet in an effort to trip us in the pursuit of

our aim. They make a great noise all over the world about their alleged

<a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>

accomplishments and deeds in behalf of civilization, claiming that they

made Christians out of the pagan Lithuanians. As a matter of fact, Lithuanians

have created Polish culture: their greatest writers--Mickevicius, Kondratavicius,

Krasauskas, and many others--were actually Lithuanians. The Poles are revealing 
to the world today what kind of "culture" they have by slaughtering the poor 

Jews.</p>
      <p>During the intermission, donations were solicited. The collection was aided by 

a statement made by Attorney B. K. Balutis, editor of the Lietuva. "We laugh

at the Poles," he said, "but they are attempting to raise ten million dollars

for their country. We often laugh at the Russians, but this time we should take 

them for an example". Here he related how the Russians defended themselves

against the Poles in 1611 and 1612. Two Russian patriots, Minina and Pozarski,

assembled their people and said to them: "We will sacrifice everything for the

defense of our country. When we have no more money, we will pawn our wives and

children...." And the Russians repelled the Poles, and were successful in

<a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>

defending their native land which the enemy wanted to seize.</p>
      <p>"We do not as yet have to pawn our wives and children," the speaker said, "but

we can give hundred-dollar bills and Liberty Bonds. Who will come forward with

their hundred-dollar bills and Liberty Bonds for the fatherland?"</p>
      <p>And at this point the hundred-dollar bills and Liberty Bonds really did begin

to flow in. They poured in so fast that it was impossible to get all the

donorsâ€™ names. Here are a few: Justin Kulis, Dr. A. Zimontas, Attorney F. P.

Bradchulis, Attorney B. K. Balutis, Dr. K Drangelis, F. Judzapaitis, M.

Stapulionis, and M. Kiras, who were among the first to donate a hundred dollars

each.</p>
      <p>The audience was greatly impressed when Lodge 208 of the Lithuanian Alliance of

America--a women's lodge--through its treasurer, Mrs. Kiras, donated a hundred

dollars for Lithuania's liberty. This lodge was organized only recently and

<a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
has only about thirty members. With its generosity it probably takes

first place among the Lithuanian Societies in Chicago. The public applauded

enthusiastically when the donation was announced.</p>
      <p>Mrs. K. Drangelis, one of the few women in the audience, presented her individual

donation of twenty-five dollars.</p>
      <p>When the donations were added, it was announced that a total of $1443 had been

collected. A collection was again taken "to make it an even fifteen hundred".

Several girls took a Lithuanian flag and, holding it outstretched, passed up and

down the aisles. Small donations began to pour into the flag. When it was

all over, all the collections were counted again. Including the Liberty Bonds,

the total was almost $1900. (The exact amount will be announced in the report

to be published later.</p>
      <p>There were between two and three hundred people present--probably closer to two

<a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>

hundred than to three. Therefore, their generosity to the cause of

Lithuanian liberty was truly astounding.</p>
