      <p>On December 17, 1905, in the Providence of God parish hall, at 7:30 P. M.,
was held a Chicago Lithuanian public meeting for aid to the orphans and
the revolutionists who are fighting for freedom in Lithuania. The meeting
was called to order by Mr. J. Varkala. Lie explained the necessity and
duty of the American Lithuanians to help our brothers in Lithuania. Then
he asked the Dr. Kudirka chorus to come on the stage. The chorus sang
the "Marseillaise." The first speaker was Mr. Eismontas; the second,
Mr. Gugis; and young Zimontas read the poem "Marseillaise." Then spoke
Mr. J. Bagdziunas. After the speech a girl eight years old, A. Kabasinskiute,
delivered the poem "Liberty." The last to speak were J. Petrocius and
St. Marcinkevicia.</p>
      <p>All the speakers said that the struggle for liberty is holy to the people
of Lithuania and to everyone born from a Lithuanian mother. Liberty has
always won, not by the mercy of rulers but by the blood of the oppressed.</p>

      <p>Bureaucratic rule is under the control of a few idiots who are drinking 
and fattening themselves by the labor of the oppressed and exploited.

The speakers urged the people to come with their aid without any hesitation, 
in order to help our brothers in Russia and in Lithuania to

overthrow the tyranny.</p>
