      <p>There is distress in our parish, the priest Kolesinskis does not want to
hold holy mass every day in the Lithuanian church. The priest wants to convert 
our beloved church into a chapel and the priest himself wants to remain
in the Polish church. The priest does not pay the debts of our church and
does not give to us any accounting.</p>
      <p>The priest made friendship with the Polanized Lithuanians and wants to
sell our church on auction.</p>
      <p>Therefore, brothers, if you love God come to the meeting after the evening
service in the church hall where we will decide how to put order in the management 
of our church.</p>
      <p>Committee</p>
      <p>P. S.</p>
      <p>The meeting, as always, was troublous, there were no results, but the priest
Kolesinskis took heed from the parishioners and agreed to hold mass every day.
The parishioners agreed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
