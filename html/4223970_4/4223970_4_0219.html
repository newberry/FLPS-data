<p>The chorus of the National Club of Young Lithuanians in America observed its
first anniversary: one year has gone by since the chorus was organized and
became active. To mark this anniversary the Club arranged a special affair
at the Freiheit Turner Hall, March 8, which included a play, a comedy, and a
concert. R. Bracco's one-act drama "Pietro Caruso" was presented. The acting 
was good. The good acting in the roles of "Pietro Caruso"  "Margarita,"
which were played by M. M. Juodis and Miss J. Lukosevicius, should be pointed
out.....In the comedy part of the evening, which consisted of couple of monologues 
and a dialogue, B. Vaitiekunas, who presented "Sam, the orator," should
be mentioned. The concert was varied and long, including--in addition to the
chorus of the anniversary celebrants--the Blue Flower Chorus from Melrose Park,
Illinois, and piano playing. It was apparent that here, too, there had been
attentive and careful preparations made.....Miss Radavicius should be praised
for her piano playing.</p>
