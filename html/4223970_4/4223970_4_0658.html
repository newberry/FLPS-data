<p>March 3, on the namesday of Casimir Znota, a few friends were present.
After talking and discussing various problems, Mr. J. Bruzevicia
reminded us the revolution in Lithuania, which is carrying the burden of
the tsar's yoke. He also spoke about the present conditions of the workers
in America, where we have freedom but where the workers are exploited by
the capitalists. In this country the workers themselves are at fault. They
are politically blind and have no unity. During elections they vote for
the capitalists' candidates who give them a glass of beer or a cigar. The
workers, due to a lack of political understanding, cannot have their own
candidates in the state and national assembly.</p>
<p>We decided to contribute to the revolutionary movement in Lithuania. We
collected $3.70, and the money was sent to Mr. Lizdeika, a representative
of the Lithuanian Socialist Labor Party, with a warning that no part of
this money should be given to the Democratic or the Roman-Catholic party.</p>
