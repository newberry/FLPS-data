<p>Mr. A. Balciunas has collected from the Chicago Lithuanians the sum of
$15.25.</p>
<p>Friends! Take this as an example and try your best to make collections
in other cities for the suffering victims who have fought for our
fatherland Lithuania.</p>
<p>Remember that during this revolution many families have lost their bread-winners. 
Many are dying of starvation at home; others are dying in prison.
By contributing each of us a few cents, the many donations will make a
large sum of money, even though each has donated only a few cents.</p>

<p>This will be a great help to the martyrs. Let us show that we love our
fatherland, that we are striving for the liberty of our nation! Let us
prove to be loyal children of our former dukes Keistutis and Vytantas!
Let us help the martyrs of the revolutionary movement in Lithuania!</p>
<p>All the contributions and the names of the contributors will be published
in Lietuva and in the Workers’ Voice.</p>
<p>To both the collector and the contributors to this donation, in the name
of the Workers' Voice, I am extending hearty thanks.</p>
<p>J. Ilgandas</p>
