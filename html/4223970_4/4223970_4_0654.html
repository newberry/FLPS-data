      <p>There is no necessity of giving a long explanation about the revolution
in Russia. Our fatherland is submerged in tears and blood. But we hope
that our countrymen will get rid of the foreign yoke which has kept
them in oppression for many years. We, as the children of our fatherland,
must help our country in her struggle for freedom. Therefore, we are
appealing to all the Chicago societies and individuals to unite in
action in order to help our brothers in Lithuania in their struggle for
freedom. It is impossible for us to participate in the actual fight, to
lay down our lives for the cause of liberty; but we can help them
materially and spiritually by donating as little as one cent per day.</p>
      <p>In Chicago, on June 10, there was organized a committee of the united
societies, endeavoring to help our brothers in Lithuania in their
struggle for freedom. The following societies have joined this united

committee: The liberty society, the Simonas Daukantas Society, the Young
Lithuanians Friendship Club, the Lovers of Truth Society, the 36th
Branch of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, St. George Society, St.
Rokas Society, the King David Society, the Society of the Grand Duke

Algirdas of Lithuania. All societies that do not belong to this unity

of societies yet, should elect three delegates and send them to the

meeting which will be held on August 18, at 7 P. M. at Rugis Hall,

53rd and Morgan streets.</p>
