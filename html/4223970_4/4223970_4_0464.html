<p>The Society of the Sacred Heart of Jesus held a meeting in the Peter Woodman 
Hall on December 1. After the business of the Society was finished,
Joseph Peckus moved that the Society donate two hundred dollars from its
treasury toward helping Lithuania obtain its independence.</p>
<p>The president of the Society, Ben Butkus, explained the matter in detail, and 
pointed out that it was not sufficient to donate only from the treasury, but
that donations should be made by the members individually as well, for the 
time had come when everybody had to do as much as they could for Lithuanian
independence.</p>
<p>The members agreed to the motion and voted to donate two hundred dollars [from
the Society's treasury]. A collection was taken up among the members, and in
this way, seventy-one dollars more was added, making a total of $271. The
money was sent to the Executive Committee of the Lithuanian councils in
Washington, D. C.</p>

of sending the money to Washington.</p>

for 1919: Ben Butkus, president, August Misevicius, vice-president,
