      <p>The purpose of the Immigrants' Protective League is to protect all immigrants 
who come to Chicago. The League, at its headquarters, 745 Plymouth
Court, takes care of immigrants, who, when they come to this city, have
no place to go. It especially protects the immigrant girls who might
fall into the hands of white-slave agents. During 1912, the League took 
care of 253 Lithuanian girls who came to Chicago.</p>
      <p>The League has appointed Mrs. M. Jurgelionis to take care of Lithuanians.
The League supports itself from its membership dues, which are $2.00 a
year, as well as from donations.</p>
      <p>In 1912, the Chicago Lithuanian Societies' Association donated $15 to the
League. Up to the present time, so far as we know, only one Lithuanian,
Mr. S. Tananevicius is a member of the League.</p>
