      <p>At its meeting held last Friday night, members of the local White Rose Club 
decided to make a donation to the cause of Lithuanian independence. The
total donated was $152.75.</p>
      <p>After the Club's business was finished, Mr. L. Paukstis moved that a donation 
be made to the cause of Lithuanian liberty, and Mr. L. Gelezinis suggested 
that the Club donate the hundred-dollar Liberty bond which was in
its treasury. Mr. Gelezinis' suggestion was approved by the other members
present. Then several good patriots took up a collection among the members 
and thus increased the donation to the amount mentioned above.</p>
