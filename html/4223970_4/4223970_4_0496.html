<p>The St. Joseph Society of Bridgeport held a regular meeting November 25.
During the discussion, a patriotic Lithuanian raised the question of winning 
independence for Lithuania. Then the secretary pointed out to the
audience how difficult it had been for the Lithuanians to exist under the
yoke of foreign nations.</p>
<p>"How would it look", he said, "if our fatherland, Lithuania, remained enslaved 
by the Poles or some other nation?"</p>
<p>After being reminded that now is the time to obtain independence for Lithuania
by donating as much money as possible, all of those present--some were moved
to tears--agreed that a donation should be made.</p>
<p>The Society is small--has only thirty-five members--but it decided to

donate twenty-five dollars from the treasury.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: The money has been received by Lietuva.)</p>
