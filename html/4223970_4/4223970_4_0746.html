the people, he started a similar organization for Lithuanians. On March 25,
1897, the Keistutis Building and Loan Association was organized. He is still
a member of this financial association.</p>

<p>As Joseph Gurinskas was always active, he attended a meeting of the Polish
organization Lubelska Unija. At this meeting the Poles were trying in a
"brotherly" way to take control of Lithuanians, but the Lithuanians saw at
once the selfish aim and the falsity of the "brotherly" love which Poles

professed toward the Lithuanians. The Lithuanians demonstratively left

the meeting.</p>
<p>Joseph Gurinskas married Miss Ona Zemeliute, Feb. 16, 1885. At present he

is 73 years of age and resides at 3347 Lithuanica Avenue.</p>
