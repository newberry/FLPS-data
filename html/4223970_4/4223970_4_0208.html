      <p>A number of programs were arranged in connection with the recent convention
of the Lithuanian Students' Alliance of America. The largest of these affairs 
was the last, held at the Meldazis Hall Monday night.</p>
      <p>The long and varied program was made up of two parts. Music was emphasized
in the first part. Miss Tutulis played a few pieces on the piano quite well.
Then Mr. Pratapas, a student, made a speech entitled "The Scholastic World
and Us". A string orchestra played a few numbers, some good ones among them.
Mr. Naujalis delivered a monologue, "A Dzukas in America". [Translator's
note: A Dzukas is a Lithuanian inhabitant of a certain district in south-eastern 
Lithuania, around the town or Alytus. They are so called because,
in pronunciation, they always add a "z" sound after a "d" and "t".] The
first part was brought to a close with a vocal duet rendered by Mlles. O.
Rudauskas and E. Rudauskas. Miss P. Rudauskas provided the piano accompaniment. 
They achieved their usual success.</p>

      <p>The second part was made up of the presentation of the one-act
comedy, "Salaputris;" a violin solo, and the antics of Stepukas
(Mr. Brusokas). According to the program, Mr. Stuogis was to sing the solo
but, as the master of ceremonies explained, had to refuse because of ill
health.</p>
      <p>"Salaputris" is a short little comedy which has a cast of only four performers. 
Its contents are weak, but it is a very lively play. The actors,

B. Vaitekunas, Mr. Briedis, Miss L. Zilvitis, and Miss M. Montvilas, are

well known to the Chicagoans and do not require any recommendation. But

the common fault was apparent: some of them hardly knew their roles. Because 
of this the comedy lost some of its liveliness. Mr. K. Bigeliukas

rendered the violin solo. Stepukas, as usual, dumped a whole bag of laughs

before the audience. The theme or his monologue was up to date. He explained 
how he succeeded in overcoming all obstacles to travel from Lithuania,

through Germany, to America.</p>
      <p>A large crowd attended in spite of the rainy weather. The start of the
<a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>

program was delayed an hour and a half. There was dancing after the

program.</p>
