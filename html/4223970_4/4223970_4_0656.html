      <p>During the revolutionary movement in Russia and Lithuania, the tsar, in order
to save his tottering throne, announced to his constituents that he would call
an all-Russian Duma; that the people of Russia could elect their representatives
to this national assembly. The people thought that the thoughtless tsar had at
last come to reason. They elected their representatives; but soon they found
out that the people's representatives must obey and take orders from the tsar,
not from the people whom they are representing. So the tsar's Duma is simply
a bluff. In order to help the people gain complete freedom in Russia, we must
donate as much as we can to help the revolutionists overthrow the Russian
tsar's despotism.</p>
      <p>The date set for the convention of the Lithuanian Alliance of America is at
hand. This Lithuanian organization consists of 6,000 members. If every member 
would donate one dollar for the revolutionary cause in Lithuania there
would be $6,000 available for the revolutionary propaganda.</p>

      <p>Therefore, the Lithuanians of America must help their brothers in their
fatherland to fight against the tsar's regime. Send your contributions

to the treasurer of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, John Skritubskas,

New Britain, Conn., or to the National Convention of the Lithuanian Alliance,

South Side Turner Hall, 3143-47 S. Halsted St., Chicago.</p>
