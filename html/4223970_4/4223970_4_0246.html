<p>A conference of lay students was held in Chicago September 28 and 29, which
founded the Lithuanian Students' Alliance, an organization similar to the
recently created Lithuanian Roman Catholic Students' Alliance. The difference
lies in the fact that the former did not fortify itself behind religious barriers 
and all Lithuanians may join it no matter what their religious or political 
views are..... The following were elected as officers of the Alliance:
Petraitis, president; K. Drangelis, secretary; Sinkus, treasurer; S. Biezis,
editor; K. P. Gugis, Mikolaitis, and Bucinskas, Literary Committee.</p>
