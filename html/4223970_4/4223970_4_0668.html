      <p>Last Monday evening the Relief of Widows and Orphans Revolutionary Aid
Committee called a meeting at the St. George's hall, in memory of the
Bloody Sunday, January 22, in St. Petersburg, Russia. This meeting was
called to make a collection for the revolutionists and to decide to
whom the money should be sent. After the lectures, the chairman brought
up the question as to where send the $300 that we have now on hand. Then
the Rev. Krawczunas asked for the floor and took the speaker stand.
Staggering and wobbling he raised his hands but was unable to say a word.
At last with great difficulty a peculiar sound came, "Oh!!!...," and again
staggered and wobbled: "Brothers Samogetians ....," and lay down on the
table. After a while he woke up and cried out, "The Russians with their
bayonets will force you....! They will come and force you with their
bayonets...." With these words he wants us to understand that he said
"Do not contribute to the revolutionists, do not send money, do not go

against the tsar, the revolutionary movement is useless; the Russians

will come and force you to obey the tsar." Again the priest lay on the

table. "My uncle accepted orthodoxy....," raised up his hands and

trembling he exclaimed: "Oh, you cannot have a strange wife!" He lay

down on the table again. "Brothers, Samogetians, Catholics....!" He

raised his hands and tottering cried: "Down with the Socialists!"

Again he lay down on the table and after a few minutes he woke up and

staggering went and sat down.</p>
      <p>The listeners were surprised and asked each other what kind of trick

it was. "What is the matter with the priest?" some asked. The people

have various ideas about him; what they are I will not mention. Someone

in the public took the floor and asked the priest what wrong the Socialists

have done to him. In his speech he criticized the priest's conduct for

sticking his nose in other people's affairs. The priest put his nose to

the floor with downcast eyes. Even though he wanted to say something, he

did not dare to reply.</p>

      <p>When the speaker finished another took his place. He criticized the priest

for attacking the Socialists, and then the speaker said that when God

created man he gave him free choice to be a democrat, socialist or

clerical. Then the priest arose and cried: "Stop. You are not a priest.

It is forbidden to you to mention God's name! I am the priest and I forbid

you to mention God's name!" (I wonder if Rev. Krawczunas has copyrighted

God in Washington, D. C., that he dares to forbid others to mention His

name.) As the speaker paid no attention to the priest's interruption

and went on with his speech, the priest came to the speaker and, putting

his hands on his mouth, said, "I am the priest. I will not permit you

to speak....." Then the speaker stepped on the top of the table, so the

priest could not reach his mouth. The priest climbed on the table and

tried to reach the speaker's mouth and they started to push each other.

Both fell down on the floor. The public than rose from their seats and

ran to the table. Some of them were trying to protect the priest; others,

the speaker. They started to scold, denounce and push each other. The

commotion became much worse. The people demanded that the speaker go on

with his speech, that he should pay no attention to the priest. Someone

shut the lights off and the friends of the priest begged him to go to

his rectory.</p>

      <p>The people said, "Dear priest, go and lie in bed; if they call the police

you will be taken to the police station."</p>
      <p>At this the meeting for the Widows and Orphans Committee at the St. George's

parish hall came to an end. The public went to the Laudanskas hall to end

the meeting, and at this meeting decided to send the money to the Social

Democratic Party in Lithuania.</p>
      <p>Upon reviewing Rev. Krawczunas' conduct at this meeting, one wonders

what is the matter with him. The priest played his part in a funnier

way than a five-cent circus side show.</p>
