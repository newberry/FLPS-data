<p>Last Sunday, Aug. 27, the Society of the Province of God had its banquet.
We are proud to say that the banquet was very successful.</p>
<p>The new Pulaski Hall, 800 S. Ashland avenue was packed with a Lithuanian
and Polish audience. The music, under the direction of Mr. Hens, was fine.
There were many young people at the dance.</p>
<p>The Society of the Province of God never thought that this banquet would
be such a success. A profit was made of over $100.00.</p>
<p>Therefore, all Lithuanians should belong to the Catholic societies, as
they benefit all of us.</p>
