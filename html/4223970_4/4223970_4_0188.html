      <p>One big step forward was made through the gathering at children into
groups. But this is not enough and it is not much important. We have
to make one more step forward and group them properly, so that after
they grow up they would leave us, but would remain in our organizations
and would be a benefit to themselves and society.</p>
      <p>Today we have many good trained children on all kinds of musical instruments. 
It would be possible to organize a considerable orchestra.
We have just to organize and train them. We would have to take some
grown ups from the younger groups, those who love music, and combine
them into one orchestra which would have about forty or fifty members.
It does not matter what instrument one would use.</p>
      <p>We have capable teachers who would arrange all instruments and hero
lovers of music will get good practice. Today many parents are spending
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
much money for private lessons, but children have little benefit of it
because they are getting little practice. By being with an orchestra

they would have to practice every week regularly, and go ahead without

interruption. Besides the orchestra, a band could be organized which

would help us in our doings. We have good material and it will certainly

grow better, but we have to manage it properly.</p>
      <p>This work depends entirely on the committee which would gather all children 
playing instruments. This committee ought to take everyone's name

and address, specifying that instrument everyone plays or wants to play.

It would have to take also the names of parents, as we have to apply

for their consent in this regard. In my opinion it would be possible to

organize those groups in the colonies of Bridgeport, North Side, West

Side, 18th Street, Brighton Park, and Town of Lake.</p>
      <p>This work should be started at once, as by next fall we have to have

them ready to introduce them to the people.</p>
      <p>All committees, to work! Let us hope this work will bear good fruits.</p>

      <p>(Translator's Note in Re: "Future Bud of Flower Children's Society")</p>
      <p>Six children societies have been organized among the Lithuanian population

of Chicago.</p>
      <p>The purpose of these societies is (1) To remove children from streets

during their idle hours. (2) To teach them songs and drama in their

parental language, (3) To create a desire for better and cleaner life.</p>
      <p>The first organizers were Joseph Kuzmicki and Kleofas Jurgelionis. The

first children's society was organized in Cicero, in about 1915. This

was followed by other organizers, Mr. Kleofas Jurgelionis, who in

1916, in the vicinity of the Mark White Square Park, located at 30th

and South Halsted Streets, organized another society. Similar societies

were organized later in other parts of Chicago. They were operated individually 
and supported by parents.</p>
      <p>After the World's War, and after the organization of the Lithuanian


<a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>

section of the American Workers' Party, the members of this Lithuanian

section have started to take active part in these children's societies.
When the old, active members became tired and the newcomers took their

place as managers and leaders, these same children became different in

mind and action. Instead of old folk songs they were taught revolutionary 
songs, etc.</p>
      <p>When these societies united under one management, they adopted a new

name, "Future Bud of Flower Children's Society."</p>
