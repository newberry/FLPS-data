<p>(Translator's note: -- This society -- the Lovers of Truth -- was inspired by
the Freethinkers' activity, by the followers of Robert G. Ingersoll. Many
Lithuanians, at that time, were readers of the freethinkers' weekly paper
The Truth Seeker, and the name of that society was taken from that paper's
name. The society still exists.)</p>
