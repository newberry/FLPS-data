<p>The Lithuanians of Spring Valley, Illinois, have donated $15.45 for
the revolutionary movement in Russia. We would have donated more,
but unfortunately, the national bank closed and many Lithuanians
have lost their money.</p>

<p>The Young American Lithuanian Pleasure Club of Chicago held its meeting 
on July 11, 1905. Dr. J. Kulis made a motion to make contributions
to the revolutionary movement in Lithuania against the tsar. The club
approved the motion and donated $10 for the cause of the revolution.
The money was sent to the central committee's treasurer, Dr. Sliupas.</p>
