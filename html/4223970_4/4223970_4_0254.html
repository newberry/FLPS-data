<p>At the last meeting of the Young American Lithuanian Pleasure Club
it was decided that one or more books should be published at the expense of the Club. The
book must be written by a political prisoner, or a student. The book can be
romantic or scientific, but not anti-religious. Such a book must contain from
one hundred to two hundred pages. Also, a student or a person may write a
book about the Russo-Japanese war, or about the present revolutionary movement
in Russia. For the written book, the Club will pay the writer, plus 10%
royalty. The book must be written by a political prisoner, or student who
is getting stipends, but no others. If some one has a manuscript, mail it
to us and tell the price. Address the Club's secretary, John Bagdziunas,
3314 Mospratt Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
