      <p>p.6...Now that the International Labor Defense has been formed, all funds
intended to aid political prisoners in Lithuania must be sent to the
Lithuanian Section of the International Labor Defense. The funds will then
be forwarded to the International Committee in Berlin, Germany. From there
the money will be forwarded to the Central Committee of the Red Relief in
Lithuania, which is devoted entirely to relief of political prisoners in
that country.</p>
      <p>We must remember that the International Labor Defense is a section of a
world-wide organization, whose sole purpose is to assist political prisoners
and their families. That organization assists victims of the white terror
in Lithuania, and is the only medium through which we can assist our
unfortunate comrades in the old country.</p>

      <p>This organization also accepts funds for relief of prisoners and their families
in this country. A detailed account of all funds is made regularly in the
Lithuanian Communist daily newspapers, the Vilnis (The Wave), and the Laisve
(Liberty).</p>
