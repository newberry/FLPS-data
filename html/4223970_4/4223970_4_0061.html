      <p>After the revision of Rev. Krawczunas' parish statement, 
given to his parishioners, we are convinced that the income and expenses are false.</p>
      <p>The rubric of income shows that the parishioners donated $63,739.79
but in the general sum Rev. Krawczunas shows only $63,145.30. This is not
all: it shows that some of the parishioners have paid their yearly dues of 
$6, but the priest has marked just $1; others who have paid $10 were
marked just $3 or $5.</p>
      <p>Now let us look a little further: it shows that certain debts of
$10,410.37 were paid off. We know that there were no such debts of the
parish. Also expenses of $2,463.17 for repairs, but does not show what
the repairs were. Therefore, we cannot understand on what so many thousands
of dollars were wasted. We asked in our newspaper that the priest or his 
committee give us an explanation of what the expenses were, what the 
debts were for, and what the repairs were.</p>
      <p>The committee did not answer our question, and we are not wondering why,
because not one in the committee knows properly how to read and write. When
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
the committee received the parish books, no doubt they believed the priest 
was distributing the litany of All Saints, and with this, their knowledge 
came to the end. To answer the question, the priest tried to vindicate himself. 
He was seeking for a plan, and at last he found it. He selected a
committee of four of the most confident parishioners and gave them the
treasury books to examine. Even the most confidential servants of his were
unable to vindicate the priest.</p>
      <p>They, after examining the Rev. Krawczunas expenses, found only $41,758.50 
used for expenses, but not $85,140 of expenses as the priest showed
in his statement of 1895 and 1896. Therefore, the priest's own committee
proves that the priest is lying. This is not all, the committee willingly
or unwillingly, showed that the priest has laid the debt of $21,000 on the
parishioners' necks, and this debt our priest kept covered for a long time.</p>
      <p>How much income there was, how much money the parishioners gave to
the priest, the committee concealed. It looks as if the priest asked the
committee not to mention to the parishioners that for the last three years
<a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
the priest has collected $80,000 from the people, while the parish expenses

were $41,000, and the balance of $39,000 the priest spent for his own

affairs. Of course, the priest also knows that if the people would find his

graft, then the people would sue the priest or ask him to return the money.</p>
      <p>Now, since the people learned about the priest's graft, and when the

priest goes to houses for collection, we hear that the people are refusing

to donate money for the church, that in two houses the priest gets a scolding, 
while in one house he gets a collection; that all the societies decided

to hold the parish meeting, and to make complete revision of the parish budget,
and than with the complaint go to the bishop; but if the bishop would

pay no attention, then go to the civil court.</p>
      <p>The statutes of Illinois are watching such persons who are controlling

the people's funds, that the money cannot be used for any purpose without

knowledge and consent of the people. All of the societies, except Simonas

Daukantas society, decided to call the parish meeting. The Daukantas Society

<a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>

has a few servants of Rev. Krawczunas, so they brought the priest to the

meeting, and the priest asked the society not to interfere in the parish

treasury.</p>
      <p>The priest said: "What do you need the parish meeting for? Why do you

need the second committee to examine the books? Why don't you believe Mr.

Dichawiczius, whom all of you know as a good Catholic? Why are you not

believing Dr. Stupnickis, who is an enlightened man and good Catholic? Why

you are not believing Ostrauskas and Zacharewiczius, who are good Catholics?

Do you believe the editor of Lietuva, who does not go to church and lives

with a German woman?</p>
      <p>Now, you see the priest's justification of himself in spending the

parish money. Instead of vindicating himself and explaining what he has

done with the parish money; the priest makes a personal attack on the

editor of Lietuva, upbraids the editor as to why he does not go to church

and why the editor boards with the German people.</p>
      <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
      <p>Not long ago the newspaper Gatsas (Sound) gave us instructions that

we should not make personal attacks on the priest. At the beginning of

the struggle between the parish and the priest, we never made personal

attacks on the priest. But when the priest started on us with a personal

attack of course in such a struggle we were forced to make a personal

attack on the priest. The priest complains that the editor lives with

the German people. But the same priest, in the Lithuanian church, is

upholding the Polish spirit.</p>
      <p>Many of the parishioners came to us for information and complaint,

saying that Rev. Krawczunas refuses to return their money which they have

deposited with the priest. You ought to go to the court, the court will

force the priest to return the money, and he will be forced to pay the

expenses, too. By what we have seen, the money deposited by the priest

is not in the parish name, but in the priest's name. Therefore, the

parish is not liable for that money.</p>
