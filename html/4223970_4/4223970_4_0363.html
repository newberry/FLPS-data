<p>A young Lithuanian girl, Miss Ona Plausinaite, 19 years of age, on June
16th, came from Lithuania to Chicago. At the Baltimore and Ohio station,
the policeman was unable to converse with her. In the meantime, a Lithuanian
came and stated to the policeman that he knew her and would take her to her
uncle at 34th - 14th Place. So the policeman permitted him to take the girl
there. Then the girl's brother came. He was unable to find the girl, then
asked the policeman. With the policeman he went to 34 - 14th Place. There
was only a vacant lot at this number. Then they went to Morgan Street, the
address the Lithuanian gave to the policeman, and also found a vacant lot.
If any one learns anything about this girl, notify the Lietuva office, or her
brother, Joseph Plausinaitis.</p>
