      <p>The name of this new religion is the Twelve Apostles. The priest will
have no power, he will be under the control of parish members. The priest
cannot collect money, nor charge for his service; he will get his salary
but he cannot control the parish treasure, it will be under the control
of the twelve apostles.</p>
      <p>The apostles will help the poor, the miserable and the downtrodden
as the Apostles did in Christ's time.</p>
      <p>No other religion in existence had done such a thing as helping the
poor and miserable. Our new religion will help the downtrodden, it will
be a real Christian religion.</p>
      <p>We have decided to buy a church at 12th and Union avenue.</p>
      <p>The parish secretary Albertas Stajneris</p>
