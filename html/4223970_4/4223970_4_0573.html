      <p>Lodge 208, of the Lithuanian Alliance of America--a women's lodge--gave a
reception in the Unity Club for our distinguished Lithuanian visitors, Mr. Stasys 
Simkus, representative of the Lithuanian War Relief Society of Lithuania;
Dr. John Sliupas, president of the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund; and
Mr. V. K. Rackauskas, editor of the Tevyne (The Fatherland), official organ of 
the Lithuanian Alliance of America.</p>
      <p>Although street cars were not running on account of the strike, and although
rainy weather prevailed, about one hundred people attended the reception. The 
arrangements committee was composed of Mrs. Zimontas and Mrs. Damijonaitis.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Janusauskas, accompanied on the piano by her husband, sang a few of the
musical compositions of Mr. Simkus, one of the honored guests. The popular song
"Kur Bakuze Samanota" (The Moss-Covered Cottage) was most warmly received.</p>
