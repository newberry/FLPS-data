<p>A mass meeting was held in the St. Michael Parish Hall on the North side on
Saturday, November 30. The meeting was held for the cause of Lithuania's
independence.</p>
<p>Reverend Bucys spoke seriously, and, basing his words on facts, pointed out
that Vilna must belong to the Lithuanians.</p>
<p>Reverend F. Kemesis also spoke about independence for Lithuania and derided
the liberals who, having collected very little in donations, now talk of
merging the funds. He derided them all, from Dr. Sliupas to the free-thinking
Nationalists.</p>
<p>There were not very many people present--only 118--but a total $1,160 was
collected.</p>
