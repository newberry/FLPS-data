<p>The newly formed Lithuanian-American National Council held its first meeting
on February 11th in the Great Northern Hotel, Chicago, Ill. A decision was
made at the gathering to prepare a lengthy petition to the post-war peace
congress, which will assemble at the end of the war to remake the map of Europe. 
A committee was elected to prepare the text of the petition. The members 
of the committee are: Dr. [A. K.]  Rutkauskas, Attorney A. Slakis, and Reverend F. Kemesis.</p>
<p>The petition will deal with the national aspirations of the Lithuanian nation.
An effort will be made to obtain the largest possible number of signatures of
Lithuanian-Americans to the petition.</p>
<p>The Lietuva (Lithuania) suggests that the petition should not be prepared with
undue haste, and that a special effort should be made to write the text of the
petition in an intelligent and diplomatic manner.</p>

<p>The Lietuva also suggests that the activities in connection with the petition
should not be confined to any single Lithuanian faction, because the petition
is a matter of great concern to all Lithuanians and stands out above all factional interests.</p>
