<p>In No. 38 of Rytas (The Morning) there was published an article written
by Mr. Nationalist. He brought up important questions, and we think it
is important to take it into consideration. Mr. Nationalist says: "The
more the newspapers write about drunkenness and the bad conduct of
Lithuanians, the more their bad habits are increasing. What is the cause?
By publishing the bad conduct of the people, the newspapers do not omit
the spiritual leaders. Sometimes the papers tell the truth, but most of
the time entirely without any truth, from a needle they are making a
full load. In this manner the newspapers irritate the people so much
that they have no confidence in any priest, even if he came from Heaven.
It would be much better, if they have some misunderstanding among them,
that they themselves should settle their own problems. They even can go
to the civil courts if they have any cause."</p>
<p>It seems to us that if the wide publicity in the newspapers about drunkenness 
and other blameworthy activities reveal that bad habits do not</p>
<span class="page-break">2</span>
<p>decrease but increase, this is not the fault of the newspapers. By

criticising the faulty actions it is impossible to increase them, if

they can be increased the newspapers do not bring forth drunkenness,

it is done by other causes. As among other peoples, it is the same with

Lithuanians, that example has more weight than criticism by the newspapers. 
The exemplary conduct of our spiritual leaders, not at once

but slowly, will convince even the most faithful. On the other hand,

even if the newspapers kept their lips tight about the faulty conduct

of the spiritual leaders, the people themselves will see their mode of

improper living. If the newspapers were silent about the faulty deeds

of the clergy, then the people would lose confidence in the newspapers.

And while the newspapers are supported by the people, how can any newspaper 
go against its supporters by keeping quiet about the black deeds

of their spiritual leaders? We are basing this not on the fantastic

rumors, but on the experience of others and ourselves. We do not need

to go far to search for an example.</p>
<p>At first, when the Chicago rector was not attacking us, we paid no

<span class="page-break">3</span>

attention to his activities. We did not care to interfere in the parish

affairs; we kept quiet and paid no attention to the rector. The correspondent 
from the parish wrote to Kardas (The Sword) published in Baltimore, 
Indiana, and later to Vienybe (Unity) published in Plymouth,

Pennsylvania, and accused us for not exposing the faulty deeds of the

Chicago priest. We received such accusation against us through the

mails. Still we kept silent about the priest's activities and we made

no investigation in order to convince ourselves of the faults of the

priest. Yet, our silence did not increase the people's confidence in

their spiritual leader, because the priest by his conduct was breaking

the confidence of the people. To uplift the confidence of the parishioners

in their priest, we demanded that the priest give honest account of the

parish budget. Then, close parish partisans of the priest were threatening

to shoot the editor of Lietuva for bringing forward the question of making

an account of the parish budget. Let Mr. Nationalist determine for himself 
the laborious fruit of our spiritual leader.</p>
<span class="page-break">4</span>
<p>If the priest's labor brings such a fruit, is this the fault of the

newspaper? We do not defame the other priests because we know nothing

of their faulty deeds. In our church the people hear how the priest

in his sermon denounces those people who are reading newspapers and

books. Now, when a man hears such commandments in the church, what

can he do in order to fulfill them but to drink liquor and fight when

drunkard? To read newspapers and educational books is prohibited by

the priest, then the man has no other pleasure. What remains for such

a man to do than if not go to the saloon? Then such a man frequents

the saloons because he has nothing else to do. We cannot arrange cultural 
meetings because the priest warns the people not to attend them.

When the spiritual leaders are warning the people from enlightenment,

how can we leave this labyrinth? We are asking suggestions from Mr.

Nationalist.</p>
<p>Among us today all our effort is directed to gaining influence for the

people, and unwillingly we are pulled into the struggle.</p>
<span class="page-break">5</span>
<p>The struggle is not among the civil newspaper editors, but the spiritual 
leaders are fighting hard against the editors. As a rule the clergy

does not look where justice is, they are upholding their editors no

matter how wrong the clerical editors are.</p>
<p>This is the most important cause which diminishes confidence in the

priest. If the spiritual leaders start the fight against the civil

editors, what then do such editors have to do? Whether they wish or

not, they must accept the fight.</p>
<p>Mr. Nationalist recommends that we should go with complaints to the

proper places. To which ones? Can we have confidence in the spiritual

government? For instance, take the parish budget. The rectors themselves 
are destroying the parish budget. No matter how the money is

wasted by the priest, the bishop will not punish him. There remains

only the civil government to which the people can make complaints

against the priest for trespassing the statutes. But the American

government does not alway investigate the faulty conduct of spiritual

leaders. What, then, can the injured parishioners do? No matter where
<span class="page-break">6</span>

the parishioners would go with their complaints, as the parish consists

not of one man but of a corporation with thousands of members, so they

at the start must agree among themselves. From such agreement among the

parishioners our newspaper is helping by showing to them the bad conduct

of their spiritual leaders. When the parishioners foresee and understand

the corruption of their spiritual leaders, then they understand what to

do with such a wrongdoing priest, and they might chase him out.</p>
<p>Maybe such a course is not good, but we know no better one. If Mr. Nationalist 
knows the way, let him show it to us, and then we may even come to

a partial agreement. If it is possible to settle the matter without a

struggle, we will lay down our arms. Today, when others are fighting against

us, we are forced not only to defend ourselves, but to explain that our

enemies not only have no basis for this action, that they are not fighting

for the human rights, nor for their benefit, but for their own personal

riches, that they are collecting from the suffering people. We must say

that much, that we never started an unjust fight nor we are looking for

fraudulent scandals, but our enemies the priests, are waging the unjust

fight against us.</p>
