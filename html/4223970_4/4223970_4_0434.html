<p>The committee recently elected to solicit donations for the cause of Lithuania's 
independence, is having good success. The people visited by the committee are 
very willing to contribute their dollars to the cause.</p>
<p>The societies are also contributing. The All Saints Society, at a recent meeting, 
donated twenty-five dollars from its treasury. The Society is not wealthy; 
it has only about eighty members, but they are all active, and they are also 
good patriots. For the time being, the money donated by the society is being
held by its treasurer, Mr. John Biezis. The society expects to receive more
donations from its members before it sends its contribution to one of the funds.
[Editor's note: Each of the three Lithuanian factions maintained its own
relief and autonomy funds.]</p>
