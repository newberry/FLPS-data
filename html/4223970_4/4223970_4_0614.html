<p>On August 18, the honored guest from Lithuania, Dr. Basanavicius,
visited us Lithuanians in Rockford. Mr. Ycas was unable to come and
in his place, Mr. B. K. Balutis of Chicago, editor of Lietuva, spoke.
The meeting was held at K. P. hall. Dr. J. Basanavicius spoke on
Lithuania and her progress, the Lithuanian Science Society, and the
importance of the National Museum in Vilnius [Vilna]. The second
speaker was Mr. B. K. Balutis who explained the purpose of Dr. Basanavicius' visit 
to America. The speaker explained the essentials of
unity among us Lithuanians and that in unity we can do much for the
Lithuanian Science Society of Vilnius. At intervals, the local parish  
choir sang and Mr. P. S. Jakubauskas sang a solo.</p>
<p>Rockford Lithuanians recognize and understand their duty to help the
<span class="page-break">2</span>
Lithuanian national cause, and therefore donated almost $100 to the

Lithuanian Science Society of Vilnius.</p>
<p>This meeting was arranged by the Right Reverend Taskunas of the Lithuanian

parish of Rockford, and Mr. P. P. Petrenas.</p>
