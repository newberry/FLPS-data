<p>Last week two Lithuanian student conventions were held in Chicago. The
Lithuanian Roman Catholic Students' Association held its convention in
St. George's parish hall, and the Lithuanian Students' Association met in
the Aurora Society's hall. Nothing unusual or important can be reported
about these conventions because no important problems were discussed. They
both spent most of their time in discussing their bylaws. Neither one of
these students' associations is yet beyond the organizing stage; they have
had no time to build a strong foundation. Our students, the young students,
are in the process of development; therefore it is too early to prophesy what
the results will be. At both conventions certain symptoms were displayed
which threw light upon the intelligence of our students--intellectuals as
well as nationalists.</p>
<span class="page-break">2</span>
<p>At the beginning of the organizational work of these alliances our sympathies 
were with the Lithuanian Students' Association, not because we 
objected to any one's religious views, but because we have believed, and

we still believe that the students should unite for cultural purposes only,

regardless of their religious or political views. Then they would give to

our people an example of tolerance. Therefore, we repeat that for this

reason our sympathies were with the Lithuanian Students' Association.</p>
<p>Today, after viewing the activities of both conventions, we must publicly

announce that the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Students' Association is superior

to our favorite nationalistic "[Lithuanian] Students' Association. It is unpleasant 
for us to say this, but we must acknowledge the fact. We are not

speaking of the greater activity shown by the Roman Catholic Students' Association 
during the last year; setting that aside, we have seen in the "clerical"

association much greater ability and intellectual advancement among the students 

(in point of general education). The "clerical" convention consisted

<span class="page-break">3</span>

of young people who had a better conception of the Lithuanian nation and 

of cultural affairs than those or the so-called nationalistic association.

The above decision was reached after very careful investigation of the

students' views [as revealed at their conventions and of their attitude

toward the project of erecting a National Museum in Vilna.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Students' convention donated out of its meager treasury

$10.50 for the Lithuanian National Museum of Vilna. Thus they officially

expressed their desire to support Lithuanian national culture.</p>
<p>The nationalistic students' convention sustained a blot [on their reputation]

which will not be easy to wash out. One of the students, a medical student,

Mr. Mikolaitis, brought to the attention of the convention the fact that

A. Petraitis, president or the Lithuanian Students’ Alliance had disgraced

all Lithuanian students by signing his name to the resolution or the Lithuanian 
Socialists, Chicago district, in which those honorable gentlemen,

<span class="page-break">4</span>

Dr. J. Basanavicius and Mr. M. Ycas, were called "beasts". A little trouble
arose at the convention when the same Petraitis stated that he would sign

such a resolution again, and then he began to talk on certain medals [of

translators' note below], etc. He was strongly supported by Mr. P. Sinkus...

other students expressed the view that it was disgraceful for students to take

such an attitude toward those who are doing a cultural task. Then a question

was brought up: Shall this convention protest against the said resolution

of the Socialists? The vote was seven for the protest and nine against it.

Then the winners, the so-called Socialists, applauded very heartily.

Seen through the eyes of adults, this action of the young students has no

practical importance. Yet, as a fact it has its significance and will

have its results. It will not harm the growth of Lithuanian culture nor

the mission of these two honorable guests, but undoubtedly it will harm
<span class="page-break">5</span>

the students themselves. The Lithuanian Student's Alliance, which up to 

this time has been considered a nationalist organization, has demonstrated

through official action that it endorses those disgusting and very foolish

insinuations made by bitter opponents of Lithuanian nationalism against so

highly respected and active a leader of the Lithuanian nation as Dr. Basanavicius.</p>
<p>Fifty or a hundred years hence our descendants will celebrate the anniversary

or Dr. Basanavicius as we celebrate today the birthdays of Daukantas, Kudirka,

and others, and at these celebrations the youth of the future will contemptuously 
remark the fact that the Lithuanian students in America spat in the

face of the Ressurectors of Lithuania.....The Lithuanian National Home will

also have written in its history, and that page of the history will not be

torn out, that the Lithuanian students in America revealed themselves as enemies

of the sacred institution to be erected in Lithuania.

<span class="page-break">6</span>
The names of Petraitis, Sinkus, Naikelis, and others of similar character

are insignificant, but the name of the Lithuanian Students' Alliance is 

important, and it will be disgracefully smeared.</p>
<p>In fact, such is the irony of fate--the students are going against--what?

Why, against the Lithuanian Science and Art Society, against cultural affairs.

and against the tireless workers for culture. We believe that on this globe

we shall not find students of any other nation except Lithuania revealing
 
themselves as or so low in cultural development. Thus we see that we have

no real cultural students’ association. We have two extremes; one of the

students' alliances is too religious, but even so it supports culture and

national affairs. The other is extremely internationalistic and carelessly

disregards Lithuanian nationalism and culture ...</p>
<p>We ought to mention that among these students we find those who support and

approve of national culture--and such students we value highly. But what

they have accomplished at their convention is not worthy of our praise.</p>
<span class="page-break">7</span>
<p>When we see how the public is supporting and promoting the mission of these

two delegates from Lithuania, we know that we shall make no mistake in saying 
that such an action as that of our students' alliance will not be approved 
of by the Lithuanian public. It is very unpleasant for us to state this--

but the Lithuanian students' convention does not deserve anything better

from us. [Translator's Note: Why did the Lithuanian Socialists of Chicago

adopt such a resolution against one of the delegates, M. Ycas, and why did

Editor Balutis denounce the Lithuanian Students' Association for not supporting 
the mission of these two delegates? Neither the Lithuanian Socialists

nor the students were against the erection of the Lithuanian science building 
in Vilna, nor were they against the collection of money for that purpose.

They were against one delegate--M. Ycas, who was a representative of Lithuania 
to the Duma in St. Petersburg, Russia. Mr. Ycas, in the Duma, was

against any reform in the Russian government. Ycas strongly supported the

reactionaries in the Duma. Ycas was against any form of freedom. When the

Czar gave medals to those who were strong supporters of his regime, Ycas
<span class="page-break">8</span>

received one. For this reason the Lithuanian Socialists of Chicago adopted

a resolution against Ycas, and for the same reason the Lithuanian students’

association at their convention voted against the support of Ycas' mission

_in this country.]</p>
