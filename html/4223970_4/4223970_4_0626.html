<p>On July 15, the representatives of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association 
held their meeting at Elias Hall, 46th and Wood Streets. Dr.
Basanavicius and Mr. Ycas, the honored delegates of the Lithuanian Science
Society of Vilnius [Vilna], Lithuania, and Reverend Skrypka, of Town of
Lake, were present at the meeting. It was unanimously decided that the
board members of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association were to
appeal to all of the Lithuanian organizations of Chicago, regardless of
their political views and religious beliefs, for the purpose of raising
money for the Lithuanian Science and Art society building to be erected
in Vilnius, Lithuania. For this purpose, a committee was elected to go
to the meetings of every Lithuanian society to explain why we must support
this Lithuanian project, and what benefit the Lithuanian nation will
derive from the erection of the science building.</p>

<p>Since the Chicago Lithuanian Societies have no organized central
office where the names and addresses of their officials can be found, and

the time and places of the meetings, the secretaries of the societies are

therefore asked to write immediately to the general secretary, Mr. J. J.

Hertmanavicius, 3227 Emerald Avenue, giving him the names of their societies' 
presidents and the time and places of their meetings.</p>
<p>Those societies that are willing to donate, without being asked, to the

Lithuanian National Home at Vilnius should send their contributions to

the treasurer of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association, Mr. Antanas

Bierzinskis, 4601 South Ashland Avenue, Chicago. Since every Lithuanian

society is obligated by its bylaws to support every worthy national cause,

there is no doubt that every society will see the benefit to the Lithuanian

nation of the erection of the Lithuanian science building in Vilnius, and 

will unhesitatingly come forward with their contributions.</p>

<span class="page-break">3</span>
<p>It is about seven or eight years since Lithuania obtained the freedom

of her own language press, and the right to have her own organizations.

During this short period, we have seen that our brothers in Lithuania have

made tremendous progress. Now we see established in Lithuania good newspapers,
libraries, schools, and industrial and business organizations which

give life and inspiration to Lithuania to go forward. But the central power

(the motor) of all this movement, of all those picturesque changes, is the

Lithuanian Science and Art Society in Vilnius, which was organized and is

under the direction of the honorable Dr. J. Basanavicius.

The society there takes under its wing all the nationalist workers. They

hold conventions, arrange exhibitions of all the national handiwork, collect 
national products (handiwork), revive the national spirit, and spread 

the nationalist concept. They are paving the path of enlightenment for 

the nation's future. These societies are giving life, freedom and fortune 

to the nation.</p>

<span class="page-break">4</span>
<p>In order to accomplish all this, they are trying to establish a national 
home in our capital city, where they can place all the national treasures, 
concentrate all the national ideals. What person that has not yet

lost his nationalist spirit could refuse to participate in such a project,

or wilfully accept the name of national traitor? Therefore, Chicago

Lithuanians, extend your hands to our national leaders. When they go back

home, let them be able to remember that we are Lithuanians. Even though

we are living far from our country, our hearts are still full of love for

the fatherland. We are always ready to help our fatherland by our own

activity.</p>
<p>We remind you that on August 30 a banquet will be held at the Sherman

Hotel for our honored guests, Dr. J. Basanavicius and Mr. Ycas. We invite 

all Lithuanians, especially the benefactors of the Lithuanian Science Society 
of Vilnius. . . . .</p>

<p>In the name of the board of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association:</p>
<p>J. J. Elias, president,</p>
<p>J. J. Hertmanavicius, general secretary.</p>
