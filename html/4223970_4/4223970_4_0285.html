      <p>The financial status of the immigrants is as follows: 1,056 brought at least
fifty dollars each; 15,249 brought less than fifty dollars each. The immigrants
were found to possess a total of $427,564 during the examinations at Ellis Island.
Non-immigrant Lithuanians brought a total of $37,565 into the United States

during the year of 1914. Lithuanian immigrants brought a total of $3,263,720

into the United States up to and including the year 1913. With the 1914 figure,

the total is $3,691,284. By adding to that total the sum of $37,565 which

non-immigrants brought in 1914 we find that from the year or 1899 up to and

including the year of 1914 Lithuanians brought a total of $3,728,849 into the

United States.</p>
      <p>The above statistics include only those immigrants who were officially

registered as Lithuanians. It is a well-known fact that many Lithuanian

immigrants were erroneously registered as Russians, Poles, and Germans.</p>
