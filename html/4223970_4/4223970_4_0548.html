<p>We hereby announce that, after we had already sent a Christmas gift of $1,733.l8
to Lithuania to help the cause of Lithuanian freedom, we received more than a
hundred dollars in additional donations at the offices of the Lietuva.</p>
<p>Being tired after the holidays we did not have the time to announce the donors
in this issue, but will do so in the next.</p>
<p>Counting the sum already sent to Lithuania, the total of the special gift fund
now reaches well over eighteen hundred dollars. Some of our friends are urging us 
to continue this fund until an even sum of two thousand dollars is
reached. Then, they say, we could "kiss the table" and say, "Well, men, this
is enough; now we will rest." [Translator's note: The expression "kiss the
table" is a reference to a Catholic priest's final action at the completion of
a mass--the kissing of the altar stone.]</p>

<p>Two thousand dollars would not be bad--it would look nicer. However, the
general who led the drive is so tired that he can hardly drag his feet along.
Therefore, if there are any courageous volunteers, let them tie the final knot.</p>
