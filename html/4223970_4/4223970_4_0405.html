      <p>Comrades, workers, the heart breaking news has reached us. On January
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
19th the Lithuanian government shed workers' blood. On this day our rulers
slaughtered three workers and injured over 30. Mounted police have trampled
masses and cut them down with cattails; also people hidden in the churches
were not overlooked. And what for? Just because hungry people went to the

city hall to beg for a piece of bread. Instead of bread the self-elected

government fed them with lead bullets. Three are killed, thirty injured

and how many of the arrested will be sent to death?</p>
      <p>Comrades, workers, can we neglect the Lithuanian workers? Can we keep

quiet before this government of slaughterers? No! Let's gather all at

this mournful mass meeting and vigorously protest against this self-elected 
government.</p>
