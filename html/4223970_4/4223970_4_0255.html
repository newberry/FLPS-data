<p>After the Lithuanians began to stir from their national slumber and to insist 
upon their rights, the Poles gave evidence that they were neither
friends nor champions of the Lithuanians. As a matter of fact, the Polish
clerics and lay leaders seemed to be greatly amused by our aims. During
the struggle for our rights, the Poles, instead of helping us, turned out
to be our greatest enemies.</p>
<p>When the Lithuanians demanded the restoration of their freedom to speak and
to publish literature in their own language, when hundreds of our students
and men were sent to the wastes of Siberia for using the Lithuanian language,
the Poles not only failed to show sympathy, but also sent contrary requests
to the Russian government asserting that Lithuanian literature was unnecessary 
and that Polish literature was sufficient for the Lithuanians.</p>
<span class="page-break">2</span>
<p>The Poles used all possible means to prevent the Lithuanian people from
regaining the freedom of their press; but finally the Lithuanians regained
that freedom, Polish opposition notwithstanding. They fought for centuries
to regain freedom of speech and of the press. In this struggle they were
forced to make great sacrifices and to suffer great hardships. Many died
in Russian prisons, and a great many were sent to the wastes of Siberia,
where they were confined for the rest of their lives, never to see their
fatherland again. But their sacrifice was not in vain; they helped to regain 
the freedom of the press for their fatherland. Then, soon after the

first Lithuanian newspaper was published, various Polish publishers began

to ridicule and to throw mud at the paper.</p>
<p>The Poles made every effort to suppress the oldest living language of the

white race. It is akin to and older than Sanskrit, the sacred language of

the Brahman Hindus. The Lithuanian language has been highly praised by

Benjamin Dwight, Isaac Taylor, and other philologists all over the world.

However, we need not dwell on the subject of Polish depotism and persecution

of the Lithuanians in Europe, for that subject is familiar to everyone. At

this time I would like to mention a few incidents that occurred at St. Cyril

and Methodius, a Polish seminary in Orchard Lake, Michigan. The financial

standing of the school has been very poor since it was founded. In the beginning 
this seminary was attended mostly by Polish and Lithuanian students.

As the number of the Lithuanian students increased, they began to study their

native language, and later, after several requests, an official teacher was

finally appointed to teach the Lithuanian language. But after the Polish

student enrollment increased, the Poles became hostile toward the Lithuanian

students, and often insulted them by their malicious remarks. As a result

of this unpleasant situation the number of the Lithuanian students gradually

decreased, until only a few students remained at Polish seminary. But

after three years had elapsed the number of the Lithuanian students began to

increase again. As soon as their number increased sufficiently, these students 
immediately began to reorganize their old Saint Kazimiero Draugiste

<span class="page-break">4</span>

(St. Kasimer Society). They found Lithuanian books, bearing the stamp of

the Kasimer Society, in the seminary library, whereupon they asked that

these books be returned to the Society. The Poles not only refused to returned 
the books, but also forbade the Lithuanians to read them unless they

joined the Polish societies. When the Lithuanian students failed to recover 
the books they appealed to the seminary's board of directors. Having

observed that the Lithuanians were not becoming Polonized but were rapidly

becoming Lithuanian patriots, that they were studying their native language

and speaking among themselves in their native tongue rather than in the Polish

language, the Poles became very hostile to them. The Lithuanians disregarded

them, however; for, althouqh these instructors were supposed to be Americanized 
Poles, Polish patriotism toward America amounts to no more than the

patriotism of gypsies.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate that, two years later, two Polish patriots came to America


<span class="page-break">5</span>

from the starving province of Galicia. These two Polish patriots were not

ignorant individuals but men of high learning, and were later appointed instructors 
at the seminary. One was a lay leader and the other was a priest.

These two immigrant Polish patriots decided to make drastic changes at the

seminary. To make these changes was a simple matter, for apart from the

Americanized Poles and a few Lithuanians there were no students or professors

of other nationalities there, for other elements do not attend this Polish

seminary.</p>
<p>One of those patriotic Polish professors forbade the Polish and Lithuanian

students to speak the English language in the seminary, and a penalty was imposed 
upon the students who violated this rule. When the students continued to speak 
English the professor became more severe and imposed a heavier

penalty, making the students pay a one-cent fine every time they uttered an

English word. The Lithuanian students were expressly warned to speak the

Polish language among themselves or suffer severe penalties. They were

<span class="page-break">6</span>

threatened with lowered grades, and, if they persisted, with failure in

their school work. These are the tactics which the lay professor employed.</p>
<p>The other Polish professor, the priest, was a still greater Polish patriot;

he manifested his ardent patriotism not only by warning all Lithuanian students 
to speak only Polish among themselves, but also by employing force.

One Lithuanian student sent a package to one of his friends, and addressed it

in Lithuanian. When this priest saw the package with the Lithuanian writing

he became infuriated and looked for the student. Upon finding him he shouted,

"How dare you write your name in Lithuanian in a Polish seminary?" and for

that terrible sin struck the Lithuanian student on the ear. What did that

young Lithuanian student do? If such undeserved punishment had been inflicted 
upon a Frenchman, he undoubtedly would have returned two blows; an Italian

would probably have used a knife; at any rate, anyone insulted in such a

manner would have left the seminary.</p><span class="page-break">7</span>
<p>But the insult did not stop there. The Lithuanian student was also forced

to write his name in Polish (evidently that student was a weakling). Afterwards 
the professor passed through the classroom and asked those who called

themselves Lithuanians to stand. Then the hackneyed Polish priest started

to preach. He insulted and ridiculed the Lithuanians. He laughed and misrepresented 
the history of Lithuania. He kept repeating: "Jezeli bym ja

tu byl rektorem, to zadnego Litwina by nie bylo" (If I were dean here, there

would not be a single Lithuanian).</p>
<p>It would seem that the Lithuanians should have seen to it that not even one

Lithuanian remained in the seminary. It is impossible to study and learn

under such conditions; and in America there are many seminaries much better

than St. Cyril and Methodius--seminaries where there are no ignoramuses who

don't know what they are, nor bunglers who have no calling for, or understanding 

of, pedagogy.</p>
<span class="page-break">8</span>
<p>No one has ever succeeded in making his influence respected with physical

force or cruelty. And neither will the Poles, who are an oppressed nationality 
in Europe, succeed in this manner. It is hard to believe that the

Poles would dare to commit such a vicious deed under the American flag, which

stands for liberty and equality of men. Nevertheless, they employed the

feudal methods which they had brought with them from their own country to

the United States. Their mistreatment of the Lithuanians in Europe was not

enough; they must continue to practice their feudal methods in this country.

They are deriding Lithuanian history, and eulogizing their own history, which

is the worst in all Europe. They deny the true stories of the feudal lords

and their immoral deeds. They claim to have given culture to the Lithuanian

people; they also claim to have Christianized the Lithuanian people, who,

according to them, were a pagan and uncivilized people.</p>
<span class="page-break">9</span>
<p>But now suppose we search through the true Polish history to see how the

Poles gave culture to the Lithuanian people, and what methods were employed 
to bring about this so-called Polish culture. These historical facts

which now are not included in Polish history--occurred between the sixteenth 
century and the year 1861. During that period the most tyrannical

government in the world ruled Poland. Other countries of Europe also had

the feudal system of government, but none were as tyrannical as that of

Poland. In the years following the sixteenth century many Lithuanians

left their country to escape the persecution of the Polish government and

the tyranny of Polish landlords.</p>
<p>The Lithuanian people suffered unbearable torments under the autocratic

Polish landlords. They were disgraced and humiliated, looked upon as mere

animals and treated as such. I will present a few historical incidents in

an effort to show how the Lithuanian girls were treated by the despotic


<span class="page-break">10</span>

Polish landlords. These facts are not recorded in Polish history, for if

they were recorded the Poles would not be able to point with much pride to

the so-called Polish culture which they claim to have given the Lithuanian

nation.</p>
<p>The Polish landlords had many Lithuanian serfs who worked on their land,

toiling very long hours, from sunrise to sunset every single day, with very

little rest. These serfs received the same food as was given to the pigs,

and were forced to sleep in barns, which was regarded as compensation for

their work. The Polish landlords forced the beautiful daughters of the

Lithuanian serfs into immoral relations with them, and used the girls as

their own personal property; when they became pregnant the feudal lords

forced them to marry serfs. The serf's daughter was not allowed the choice

of selecting her husband; the Polish landlord did all the picking for her.

Many beautiful, young, virtuous brides were forced to spend their first


<span class="page-break">11</span>
night of marriage with Polish feudal landlords, and then, the next day,

were returned to their husbands. This is the culture which the Poles presented 
to the Lithuanians.</p>
<p>Today the Poles preach to the world that they have civilized the Lithuanians.

Let us also scrutinize the history of the Lithuanian nation and see what this

nation, which the Poles call uncivilized, has given to Poland. The Lithuanian

nation gave real culture to the Poles through Sienkiewicz (whose real name is

Sinkus) and Mickiewicz (whose real name is Mickus). Those two famous writers

are pure Lithuanians. The Poles added Polish tails to the names of these

two Lithuanians, and then claimed them as Poles. In those days, during, the

oppression and enslavement of the Lithuanian nation by the tyrannical Polish

landlords, it was very easy for the Poles to Polonize famous Lithuanian writers.

During that period all the Lithuanian intelligentsia were forced to attach


<span class="page-break">12</span>

Polish tails to their names, as, for example, Sinkus was changed to Sienkiewicz, 
and Mickus to Mickiewicz. Today, the majority of the famous Polish

writers are Lithuanians who became Polonized during the feudal period in

Poland. This is the culture which the Lithuanians gave to the Poles.</p>
