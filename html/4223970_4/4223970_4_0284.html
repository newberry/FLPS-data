      <p>The American Federation of Labor is afraid of immigrants from
foreign countries. It does not realize that the chief cause of the plight of the workers 
is to be found in their own country and not elsewhere. Instead of protecting 
themselves against immigrants from Europe, the workers of America should 
first of all strive to protect themselves against all kinds of enemies at 
home. America first!</p>
