<p>Dr. A. L. Graiciunas, popular Lithuanian physician, was recently appointed
as a city health inspector by the Chicago Board of Health. He is the first
Lithuanian to hold such a position in Chicago.</p>
<p>Dr. Graiciunas has been assigned to the childrensâ€™ health section. He will
conduct a house to house canvass, and assist families in an advisory capacity
regarding the health or their children.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Dr. Graiciunas, who is a strong advocator of medical
science, will accomplish much good for the people in his new service. His
efforts will be devoted mostly to Lithuanian families. It is hoped that
our people will take advantage of his advice and services.</p>
