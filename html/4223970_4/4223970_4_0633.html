<p>By the time this issue of Lietuva is published, the honorable guests; Dr.
Jonas Basanavicius, president of the Lithuanian Science Society in Vilnus,
Lithuania, and Martynas Ycas, the Lithuanian representative to the Duma, in
St. Petersburg, Russia, will be in Chicago. According to the latest report,
they should have been in Chicago last Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>The plan was at first to have our honorable guests go from New York to Boston.
From there, they would go on a lecture tour through the New England states
and on to Chicago. But later the plan was changed, and it was decided that
they should come straight to Chicago because Chicago is the largest Lithuanian
community in America. More Lithuanian newspapers are published here, and
there are more Lithuanian organizations here than in any other city of America.
For this reason, the Brooklyn Lithuanians advised them to go to Chicago, and
start their lecture tour from here.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly the Chicago Lithuanians are glad that the Brooklyn Lithuanians
<span class="page-break">2</span>

have such confidence in them.</p>
<p>Lietuva, with its readers, in the name of all Chicago Lithuanians, greets

these honorable guests who are so dear to the hearts of all Lithuanians.

We believe that the Chicago Lithuanians will receive these honorable guests

openheartedly and will set an example for the Lithuanians of other communities.</p>
