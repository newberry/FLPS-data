      <p>"Honored Sirs:</p>
      <p>"For lack of time we were unable to visit every Lithuanian society in
Chicago to deliver to it the thanks of the Lithuanian Science Society of
Vilnius [Vilna], and to accept the donations which every Lithuanian society--we 
believe--will donate to the National Museum of Vilnius.</p>
      <p>"We are pleased to announce, however, that we have found a great willingness 
to support the Lithuanian Science and Art Society of Vilnius. Therefore, 
we hereby authorize the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association
Board to represent in Chicago the National Museum of Vilnius; to collect
donations from individuals and from societies, and to publish such donations
in newspapers; to send their committees to the meetings of societies to explain 
the aim and purposes of the National Museum and of the Lithuanian
Science and Art Society of Vilnius, and to ask these societies to participate
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
in this cultural activity according to their ability.</p>
      <p>"To this authorization we sign our names:
Dr. J. Basanavicius, M. D., president, Martinas Ycas, representative
from Lithuania in the Duma."</p>
      <p>The Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association Board immediately sent the
following appeal to all Lithuanian societies of Chicago:</p>
      <p>"Brothers and sisters:</p>
      <p>Chicago, Ill., August 30, 1913</p>
      <p>"The authorization above bestows honor and responsibility upon every
Lithuanian society in Chicago. The purpose and aim of the Lithuanian

<a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>

Science and Art Society of Vilnius are so important that every Lithuanian

in whose heart national feeling has not yet died must, without delay, stand

among those who are supporting the national cause not with empty words but

with their deeds and material support. Erection of the National Museum in

Vilnius is our first and most important national task, to which all Lithuanians 
are invited to lend their help. This work must be accomplished without 
obstruction and delay. After it must come the other national tasks,

which cannot be finished as long as a strong foundation has not been laid.

"For this reason we are performing the task which has been assigned to us

by the honored delegates of the Lithuanian Science and Art Society of Vilnius.

In order to fulfill the requirements of these two delegates, we are asking

YOU--lover of our nation--to contribute at this meeting of your society a

reasonable sum for erection of the National Museum in Vilnius. Send your

donations to the treasurer of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association,

A. J. Bierzinskis, 4601 South Ashland Avenue, Chicago. He will give a receipt

<a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>

for the money received and the contributions will be published in local 
Lithuanian newspapers. At the end of the month, the money donated will be

sent to the Lithuanian Science and Art Society of Vilnius.</p>
      <p>"The amount of contributions is not limited. It is desirable that every

society should donate $100. For such a sum the Lithuanian Science and Art

Society of Vilnius will name the donors "Benefactor Member," and they will

have the right to receive all the literature published by the Science Society.

Besides this, the name of the donor society will be inscribed in gold letters

on the wall of the National Museum.</p>
      <p>"We take this opportunity to announce that there is a project to organize

a similar science society in America, which in all national affairs will work

together with the Science Society of Vilnius.</p>
      <p>"It is known from the newspapers that there is a considerably large number of

"Benefactor Members" in Chicago. When other societies join, there will no

<a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>

doubt be an even much larger number of them. Among the Chicago

Lithuanian societies which have been named "Benefactor Member," the Sernas

Musical Fund has donated $250 to the National Museum of Vilnius. If other

societies will join the ranks of donors of at least $100, not only will a

large sum of money, for the National Museum of Vilnius be raised, but also

the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association will become one of the most influential 
and strongest organizations in national affairs. It also would be

an example for the Lithuanian colonies of other cities, and this would turn

into the right path the destiny of American Lithuanians. To this task, the

voice of Lithuania invites us. Every Lithuanian must listen to the voice of

Lithuania not because of innate feelings but with understanding that he is

a Lithuanian.</p>
      <p>"Besides contributing to this national altar, every society should urge every

Lithuanian to donate at least one brick for the erection of the National
Museum--and especially Lithuanian businessmen, who in the name of the nation

demand that Lithuanians support their business. Such businessmen should not
<a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>

forget that they are in debt to their fellow-nationals for success in

business, and should repay their debt. Besides paying the lump sum of

their contributions, the societies might also make arrangement for a plan

of monthly payments. Whoever donates to the nation donates to himself,

because national affairs are his affairs.</p>
      <p>"Trusting that this appeal will bring the desired results, we remain respectfully,</p>
      <p>"In the name of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association Board:</p>
      <p>J. J. Elias, president</p>
      <p>Pranas Butkus, first vice-president

(Note: The editor of Lietuva heartily approves and supports this appeal

because the erection of the National Museum is the most important and

greatest project of the Lithuanian nation. Chicago Lithuanians, and Chicago-Lithuanian 
societies have always stood in the first ranks when there was

need to support national projects. We believe that now Chicago Lithuanian

societies will not take a place behind Lithuanians of other cities; and we

see from the newspapers, that Lithuanians of other colonies are trying to

<a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>

surpass the contributions of Chicago Lithuanians. We heartily invite all

good Lithuanians, who understand the importance of science and enlightenment 
to support this appeal, and at their meetings to urge contributions

for this great national cause, and to send their contributions to any one

of the Chicago Lithuanian newspapers, Lietuva, Katalikas, or Draugas.)</p>
