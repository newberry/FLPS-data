      <p>For the killing of President McKinley by a man of Polish descent who was
born in America, and is citizen of this country, the American politicians
are denouncing foreigners and demanding that they be deported from
America. Whereas, the American government is in the hands of politicians
who do not care for justice or morality. These enemies of the foreign
people believe that their project will be passed. The politicians are
instigating all classes against foreigners. Therefore, we must defend
ourselves. We must unite, and make protest against the American politicians' 
scheme. All the moral people of America are protecting the
foreigners. These moral people have organized the Foreigners Protective
League. This League is calling on foreigners to defend themselves against
the fanatics.</p>
      <p>The White Russian newspaper, Svoboda (Freedom), states that the newspaper
editors of foreign language (publications) should print blanks and
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
distribute them among their readers; then the readers should get signatures 
from citizens and send these protest resolutions to the senators

at Washington, D. C. This is a practical project which ought to be

started at once, before it is too late.</p>
      <p>We are not urging nor begging our nationals to come to this country

and we do not say that this country is heaven, but we do protest against

the fanatics who are trying to stop our brothers and sisters from

coming into this country, just because they want to. We must stop the

scheme of the political fanatics.</p>
