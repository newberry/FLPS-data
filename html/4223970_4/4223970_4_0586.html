<p>Up to now nobody has been able to accuse the Lithuanian-Americans of lack of
hospitality. The Americans have welcomed visitors with open arms--and, during
recent times a long line of them have been visiting here.</p>
<p>The picture has changed with the arrival of the most recent visitors, Reverend
Gustaitis and Mr. J. Gabrys, who are still with us. [Translator's note.-- The
two individuals mentioned here came to America from Lithuania, seeking donations
for the Lithuanian National Enlightenment Fund, commonly called the "National
Fund." Its aim was to find one thousand individual donors--or collective donors--
who would pledge one hundred rubles each to the Fund.] A survey of our press
and the consensus of opinion expressed in it reveal the fact that the newly
arrived visitors (we should say, their reason for coming) is ardently supported
only by the newspapers Draugas (published in Chicago) and Zvaigzde (published
in Philadelphia), which represent the right or so-called clerical wing.</p>
<span class="page-break">2</span>
<p>These visitors can hardly expect support from the socialist wing, for our
socialists and their newspapers have always stubbornly opposed everything, in the
past, which did not bear a socialistic stamp; they opposed the agents of the

Saule Society and the representatives of the National Building with similar

stubbornness.</p>
<p>But the visitors had undoubtedly expected the support of the middle group, i.e.,

the nationalists and their newspapers.</p>
<p>Whenever a battle developed between the two extreme wings (the socialists and

clericalists) in the past, the support of the nationalists always decided the

victory for one side or the other.</p>
<p>We witnessed that during the revolution in Russia, when the nationalists and

their newspapers supported the left socialist wing and thus guaranteed successful

donations to Zagaras and Grigaitis, the representatives of the social-democrats,

who were generally denied the support of the clerical wing. We witnessed the

same thing the other year when the nationalists, realizing the urgent need of

<span class="page-break">3</span>

schools in Lithuania, supported the agents of the Saule Society, who had come

here seeking donations, thus assuring them success despite the vigorous attacks

from the socialist wing.</p>
<p>Therefore it was interesting to see, with the arrival of the present visitors,

what stand the nationalists and their newspapers would take this time.</p>
<p>As it is now apparent from their newspapers, they will take neither side. In

other words, using diplomatic terminology, they will remain neutral and will

let the clerical and socialist newspapers fight each other.</p>
<p>A question arises: Why do the nationalists, who had formerly supported the

same Saule Society which will also be one of the beneficiaries of the Enlightenment

Fund, now wish to remain neutral?</p>
<p>The answer is not hard to find.</p>
<p>In the first place, the Americans are utterly exhausted from those endless

<span class="page-break">4</span>

collections with which Lithuania is not only tiring the Americans but is tiring

them ceaselessly, not even allowing them to catch their breath.</p>
<p>In the second place, it seems to us that, if the Europeans are at all concerned

with the Americans, they are concerned not really with then but with their dollars.

The Americans are never asked beforehand whether it would be convenient to come

now, whether the Americans find themselves in a good financial position, and

whether support can be expected or from whom it can be expected.</p>
<p>No, they do not do that. Usually they fall on our heads unexpectedly, out of the
sky.</p>
<p>Let us take the present situation. The public has not yet had time to forget the

last generous donations. With the advent of unemployment and hard times, the

prosperity of the Lithuanians has been paralyzed; general stagnation is felt

everywhere. But does that worry our brothers on the other side of the sea?</p>
<p>We have the desire to make openly the accusation that this does not worry them

<span class="page-break">5</span>
in the least. They know about the present "prosperity" of the Americans, for

there is more written about our unemployment in Lithuania's newspapers than in

ours.</p>
<p>They strive with all their energy to stop emigration out of Lithuania and to

return as great a number of "refugees" as possible to their "homes," pointing

out that only worries and hardships await them here.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, our honored visitors arrive with the most gigantic projects.

They arrive without having asked the opinion of the Americans and even without

telling them about it in advance for the sake of politeness.</p>
<p>
The Americans love their native country and would not even begrudge their blood

for her benefit. But we believe it is already the time to say that the Americans

do not wish to regard the lack of ceremony on the part of our European brothers

indifferently. It has even come to the point that we, according to their opinion,

must welcome such visitors not only in fair weather, but also during a storm;

<span class="page-break">6</span>

that we Americans, ourselves suffering from unemployment and a crises--as though

suffering from the ague--must now support what is at present a healthier body

than our own.</p><p>

We know that Mother Lithuania does not demand this of us and that our older

brothers--the brother Europeans--are doing us injury by their behavior in this
manner.</p><p>

We believe we have the full right to complain about this and to say to those

brothers: "You are bad brothers if you look upon us not as brothers but as

some kind of slaves--if you do not consider our welfare and only seek what we

can give you."</p><p>

That is our second reason which, we believe, will be agreed upon--openly or

secretly---by the Lithuanian-Americans of all tendencies.</p><p>
Another reason, one which could have been guessed beforehand and one which

was, in fact, predicted a year ago, remains.

</p>

<span class="page-break">7</span>
<p>
It is this reason which is mostly discussed at present. And if it is not

discussed, the silence is no less eloquent. That reason, briefly speaking, is

this: the nationalists admit that the three societies (Saule, Ziburis and

Rytas), for which donations are now being collected, have their good sides.

But the nationalists think that the uniting of those three societies and the

forsaking of the Lithuanian Educational Society reveals too great a trend

toward the "dominating" clerical wing which the nationalists do not want to

support. The nationalists will always cooperate with any party in cultural

matters, but they will not cooperate if the cultural work is being conducted

clearly and exclusively under partisan slogans.
</p><p>
That opinion has been clearly expressed by the Tevne (published in Brooklyn).

The same could have been noticed in the Vienybe Lietuvninku (Brooklyn). And

the silence of the Katalikas (Chicago) and other newspapers can mean, in this

instance, nothing else.
