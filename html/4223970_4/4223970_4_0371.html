      <p>Five times we wrote about the need of the Lithuanian colony in this country.
Six families appealed to us and sent us two dollars for the cost of
advertising in American papers to buy a tract of land. Recently we had
still another eight Lithuanian families, and now we have fourteen families
ready to join the colony. As soon as we get twenty Lithuanian families,
then we will advertise in American papers for such a tract of land. We
will make a close deal. The land must be good, close to railroads, rivers,
timber, and in a good climate. Through advertising we will get all information 
from compatriots, and from agents we will get locations, maps, etc.</p>
      <p>We hope that in a few weeks we may be ready to buy a tract of land for the
Lithuanian colony.</p>
