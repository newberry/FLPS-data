<p>....Members of this organization feel the loss of Aldona Gulbin,
President, who resigned from the L.J.L. at a meeting held Sept. 29th because 
her work does not allow her to attend meetings regularly. She will be
missed, for she put all her efforts into building up Lithuanian Junior League 
to what it is today. Her resignation caused the following changes in officers: 
President Dan Dambrauskus, Vice-president Ignatius Nestokus, while other
officers remain the same. Many thanks to those who attended our social last
week. All present, I was told enjoyed themselves. A committee has already
been appointed to arrange a gala Halloween party, date of which will be announced 
in the near future. We invite members of other organizations to attend
our affairs. We in turn will attend yours.</p>
