      <p>Mikas Petraukas, the celebrated Lithuanian musical composer who returned
to Chicago from France on August 15, will reside at the home of J. Moskus,
3327 S. Lowe Avenue, where he will accept students. He will teach singing
and other branches of music.</p>
      <p>Composer Petrauskas is collecting Lithuanian national melodies. Lithuanians
who have not yet forgotten the Lithuanian folk-songs, which elderly Lithuanians
used to sing to them, are asked not to allow these songs to perish, but to
come and sing them to Mr. Petrauskas, who will make permment records of them.
In this manner Lithuanians can perform a great service for the benefit of
our national music. When Mr. Petrauskas was in Brooklyn, N. Y., he collected
about sixty of these melodies.</p>
      <p>Mr. Petrauskas is now organizing a Lithuanian orchestra in Chicago. In the 
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
beginning it is planned to play only easy Lithuanian melodies by quartets,
sextets, and later by larger orchestral groups.</p>
      <p>Composer Petrauskas has already started to give singing instructions to the

Biruta chorus. The chorus has been greatly enlarged. However, it is desired

to increase the numerical strength of the chorus to two hundred members; there

is still room for a few more new applicants. All musically inclined young

Lithuanians are urged to join the chorus at once. Every member of the chorus

will have an excellent opportunity to train his or her voice, and learn the

entire theory of music, which will be taught by Mr. Petrauskas.</p>
      <p>Regular rehearsals of the Biruta chorus are now being held twice each week, on

Monday and Wednesday evenings, at the our Lady of Vilna parish hall, 23rd Place

and Oakley Avenue, and twice weekly, on Tuesday and Friday evenings, at the

Mark White Square hall, 29th and Halsted Streets.</p>
      <p>The Mikas Petrauskas and Biruta chorus concert will take place on Sunday evening,</p>
