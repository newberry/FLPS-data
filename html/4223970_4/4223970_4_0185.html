      <p>p.5................In response to the hope expressed by one of our young people
in his article about someone to start something with reference to a club for
our young people, I am prompted to say confidentially that there is something "in
the air" right now. It will not be very long before actual steps are taken toward
this definite goal of a non-partisan, free for all (free after dues are paid)
friendly club for young people of Lithuanian descent. The year 1930, will
undoubtedly be a memorable one on account of the organization work and activities
that will take place. Watch our section have for future accounts of the progress
made in this respect. There will be a club for Lithuanian young people such as
there never was before in Chicago! Hail, 1930.</p>
