<p>A new club, called "The Young American-Lithuanians' Atlantic Club," was
formed last Sunday in the part of Chicago which is called "Atlantic"
(around State and 47th Streets). Lithuanians have been living in this
district for several years. Though their number has greatly increased in
recent times , there had been no benefit clubs here up to now. Therefore
the youth have become active here and have organized a club. The originators
and organizers of the club are John Seputis and John Naslenas, who began the
club with seventeen members. Those wishing to obtain more information regarding
the club can apply to John Naslenas, 4565 Wentworth Avenue.</p>
