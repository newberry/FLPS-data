      <p>We read in the newspapers the appeal of Meszkutis to the  American Lithuanians 
for help. Brother patriots! We, the Westville Lithuanians, got 
together a few men and decided to make donations to our brother in
Siberia. Also we elected Mr. A. Olszewski as secretary. We believe that
there will be more collections made for our patriots in Siberia.</p>
      <p>Our men donated $3.75; two girls gave 25 cents each, total $4.25. It
seems to us that our girls began to understand the patriotic work;
they do not want to stay behind the men. For this our girls are worthy
of praise.</p>
