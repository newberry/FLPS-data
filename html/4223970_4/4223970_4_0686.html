      <p>Chicago Lithuanians are planning to present a petition to the Japanese
ambassador at Washington, appealing for the release of the Lithuanian prisoners 
of the Russo-Japanese War who are being held on Sacholin Island. Although 
the petition may not produce the desired result, nevertheless it will
probably assist in the fight to free those prisoners who were engaged in the
revolutionary movement in Russia by encouraging the masses to revolt against
their exploiters and oppressors. We made up a petition in accordance with
that which appeared in Konas (The Struggle), and then we proceeded to solicit
signatures for it. However, we were not very successful in collecting those
signatures. While we were circulating the petition, we were reproached and
chided by many of our people. Of course this is a common thing among our
nationals, and we cannot expect any sympathy from some of them.</p>
      <p>Some people have stated that those who are new on Sacholin Island deserved
to be punished, for they knew very well that the Russian Government would
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
punish them for their revolutionary movement, and now let them suffer the

consequences. Why should we worry about them: If they had not been guilty,

they would not have been sent to the Island.</p>
      <p>This, however, is a very unjust attitude on our people's part. Just because

these people happen to be nonreligious, even though they are good patriots,

we unjustly condemn them. We believe that no man of moderate understanding

and intelligence would condemn these political prisoners who are suffering

hardships on Sacholin Island. They are our patriots who are fighting for

liberty and justice for our people.</p>
      <p>A proverb correctly states that a well-fed person always forgets a hungry

one. Our people in America, who are better fed than those in Russia, feel

too independent and forget our unfortunate and oppressed brothers who are

suffering hardship across the sea. In America not a single Lithuanian can be

found who left his fatherland willingly. Each one of us was forced by intolerable 
circumstances to leave our country and seek to gain his bread in a

<a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
foreign land. If not all of us were imprisoned or exiled to Sacholin Island

or to Siberia, we nevertheless suffered the persecution of the Russian Government, 
and a great many or us were forced by this cruel persecution to leave

our native country. It is a deplorable thing that our people do not understand

and do not want to know about our brothers and sisters who are still being

persecuted. We have come into contact with some of our people who stated that

the release of the political prisoners is undesirable because these prisoners

are socialists, and when released, they would increase the number of socialists

by agitation. When the question was put to them why they are afraid of

socialists, the answer was that socialists are godless people and do not attend

church on Sunday, and that in addition they are destroying people's faith in

the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
      <p>It is very difficult to convince people who are so fanatical and know nothing

about socialism and its principles. They consider socialism a godless movement 
and are as much afraid of it as of fire.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, we wish to say a few words about socialism and to explain to


<a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>

those who do not understand its principles that it is not so bad as it is

represented by some people. The individuals who so misrepresent it have

failed to comprehend these principles themselves. Thus people have been

frightened by the word socialism because they have no conception of what it

is. Socialism is not trying to destroy faith in the doctrines of the Catholic

church and in its religion. Socialism wants only to show the right road by

traveling which one may arrive at the good attainable on this earth. In order

to accomplish anything worth while in this line, all must join the Socialist

party. We cannot bring about any social justice without socialism; we cannot

abolish the poverty and the misery of the masses and the exploitation of them

without it. Socialism demands that all people shall be equal.</p>
      <p>As far as religion is concerned, socialism has nothing to do with it.

Religion, from the socialistic standpoint, is looked upon as man's private

or personal affair. Socialism does not want to interfere with religion or

to destroy or to create any religion; it leaves religion up to the individual,

for any man has the right to believe what he pleases and to belong to any

<a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
church which he wants to belong to. As a matter of fact, there are among

socialists many freethinkers, and there are also many good catholics who are

sincere followers of socialism. Many Protestants also believe in its

principles.</p>
