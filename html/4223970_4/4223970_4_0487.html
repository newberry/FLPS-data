      <p>There is much talk about our businessmen at present, when the whole
Lithuanian group is joining the fight. for the freedom of Lithuania.</p>
      <p>They are spoken of in private and at mass meetings. They are written about
in the newspapers. Generally, they receive more criticism and condemnation
than praise. They are accused of not taking enough interest in the affairs
of our nation, now when the fate of Lithuania is in the balance. They are
condemned, slurred, and reproached because their donations to the cause of
Lithuania's freedom are not evident, or are not as evident as they ought to
be from businessmen, according to public opinion.</p>
      <p>It is plain that such accusations cannot be justly made against all of them.

The truth is that among our businessmen more than one or two support the
cause of Lithuania sincerely and generously. For example, we have in
Shenandoah, Waterbury, Chicago and other cities businessmen who are at present 
offering hundreds of dollars on the altar of the nation. The newspapers
willingly stress such examples, for such businessmen are really worthy of
the respect and support of the people. However, the truth is that not nearly
all of our businessmen set such good examples.</p>
      <p>It is an undeniable fact that we have businessman who do nothing for Lithuanian

causes and whose donations to these causes are greatly missed. The public

and the newspapers have the right to turn attention to businessmen of this

sort. The newspapers have the right to do so, because they have contributed

most in teaching and urging the people to support Lithuanian businessmen.

Speakers have the right to condemn unpatriotic businessmen because speakers

hammered into the people's minds the slogan, "Trade with your own kind."</p>
      <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
      <p>The public has the right to condemn such miserly, thick-skinned businessmen 
because almost all of them are making a living--many of them a good

living--from our Lithuanian public, which is observing the slogan,"Trade

with your own kind."</p>
      <p>The hour has struck when all Lithuanians must devote themselves to the

big task of winning freedom for Lithuania. The time has come when donations

are not to be begged, but to be demanded of everybody for the sake of the

fatherland.</p>
      <p>More than donations are demanded of the businessman. A good example to

others is demanded of them, for they are regarded by the people as leaders.</p>
      <p>Formerly the public may have paid little attention to businessmen. But now,

when the greatest problem of the Lithuanian nation confronts us, the public

will not take its eyes off the businessman and all others who are able but

fail to aid Lithuania with large donations.</p>
      <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
      <p>Perhaps the reputation and honor of the businessman as a group have never

been put to such a test as this. How will they pass this test? Perhaps

some businessmen are angry because they are written about and thus exposed

to public scrutiny. They would rather remain in the shadow and have

nothing said about them. Good businessman, who are true patriots, cannot

be angry, for these criticism and scoldings do not apply to them. Undoubtedly, 
they are not angry.</p>
      <p>The businessman who are angry are those who feel the club even through

their indolent hides. It is they who spit on Lithuanian causes and do not

co-operate with the public in its efforts.</p>
      <p>As a matter of fact, not only a club, but also a whipping post, is necessary

for their kind. They should be whipped by both the public and the good

businessmen. They arouse the hatred and derision of all businessmen as a
group.</p>
      <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
      <p>The nation wants to support its businessmen. Then let the businessman

support the nation as well. "One hand washes the other in order that both

may be white." [Translator's note: This is a Lithuanian proverb.]

What we have said above about the businessman here can be said also of the

members of the various professions among Lithuanians.</p>
