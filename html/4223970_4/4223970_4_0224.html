      <p>Last Friday the Lithuanian Youth Circle, well known for its theatrical
activity in Chicago, held its annual meeting to elect officials for
the year 1914. The former president, Mr. V. Perzinskis, who, at the
same time, was the stage designer for this Circle, declined the presidency
of this Circle for the coming year because of other activities. Mr.
K. Strzineskis was then elected president in Mr. Perzinekis' place.
Mr. A.K. Kareiva was elected vice-president.</p>
      <p>The Circle demanded that Mr. J.J. Zolpis remain as the stage manager of
this Circle for another year, and he was elected. Mr. Zolpis is well
known among the Chicago Lithuanians for his activity in the theatrical
field. He is the axis of the Lithuanian Youth Circle in theatrical
activities. Even though Mr. Zolpis wished to resign as the manager of
<a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
this Circle, he agreed to accept this office for another year because
the members put such pressure on him. Mr. J.J. Zolpis has translated

and has written several dramas.</p>
      <p>The secretary was re-elected. Mr. V. Perzinskis was elected scenery

manager, and Mr. S.F. Zalpis was elected his assistant.</p>
      <p>The new officials are very energetic, and I believe that during this

coming year, the Circle will again be active.</p>
      <p>It was decided to have a family banquet for the members of the Circle

on Christmas night, in A. Berzinskis' Hall.</p>
