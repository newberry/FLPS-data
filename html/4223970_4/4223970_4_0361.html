<p>In No. 8 of Lietuva (and also in other Lithuanian newspapers) the
problem of how to help our Lithuanian immigrants has been raised.
Many of them have been sent back from Ellis Island simply because
they had no clear address of their destination. If the Lithuanians
had had a Lithuanian immigration bureau at Ellis Island, or in New
York, or Brooklyn, may of our Lithuanian immigrants, who were sent
back without great cause or reason, would have been left here. Many
of these immigrants were political refugees from Russia. They have
been sent back to the prisons of Russia because we have no such
bureau to protect them.</p>
<p>Our main organizations, such as the Lithuanian Roman-Catholic Alliance
of America, the Lithuanian Roman-Catholic Federation, the Lithuanian
Alliance of America, and the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance of America
(also the benevolent societies), must take into consideration the
immigration problem.</p>

<p>Our liberal societies and newspapers have been discussing this problem
for some time, but the clerical societies (and especially the clergy)

said nothing on this matter. The clergy have been preaching the brotherliness 
of Christ for a long time, although they have never showed or

ever practiced the brotherliness that they have been preaching. Now

is the time when the clergy can prove what they preach.</p>
<p>I think the New York City and Brooklyn Lithuanians ought to establish 

such an office, and then all the American Lithuanians would help them

financially.</p>
