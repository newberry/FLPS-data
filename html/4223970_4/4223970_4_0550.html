<p>Telegrams announce that at the conference of Germans and Russians in Brest
Litovsk both sides have agreed to permit the inhabitants of Lithuania
themselves to decide the question or whether Lithuania is to be independent
or is to belong to Germany, Russia, or Poland.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Lithuania will have the right to decide this question
by ballot.</p>
<p>What are the Lithuanians of America to do? A half million Lithuanians--one-sixth 
of the entire nation--cannot sit quietly with folded arms when the future
of Lithuania is in the balance. Several hundred thousand of them still retain
the legal right to raise their voices, for, though they are emigrants, they
<span class="page-break">2</span>
still consider themselves citizens of Russia. and each one of the half
million has the moral right to express his desires in regards to the fate
of his motherland and his brothers.</p>
<p>But what should be done? Americans, of course, will not be able to vote
on the question. However, when the fateful hour comes---and it may come
very soon--their voices ought to be heard.</p>
<p>The voices of the Americans must be heard, especially in certain parts of
Lithuania (Vilnius [Vilna] county, for instance). Every ounce of energy is
needed for the solution of this problem.</p>
<p>We believe the Lithuanians of America must be prepared, when the moment arrives,

to express our wishes with a mighty voice which would be heard in Lithuania

during the referendum.</p>
<p>The general convention of Lithuanians of America would be the most suitable medium</p>
