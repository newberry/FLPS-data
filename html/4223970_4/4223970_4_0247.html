<p>In the Town of Lake there was organized the Lithuanian Youth Enlightenment 
Club. The organizers were A. Blinstrupis, A. Brundza, and J. Leukertas.
It was organized on Sept. 14, at the Blinstrupis Hall, 4501 Hermitage Avenue.
Two hundred and fifty members have joined this new club. This club will demand 
that the city establish evening classes in the public school on 46th and
Hermitage Avenue in order that Lithuanians may be taught the English and Lithuanian 
languages, arithmetic, and other subjects.</p>
<p>All the members are young fellows, and they are eager to get an education. It
would be a very good thing for the club to make arrangements with the administration 
of the Davis Square Park, so that lectures may be held there during
the winter.</p>
