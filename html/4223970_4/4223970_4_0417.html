<p>After disposing of its regular business at its most recent meeting, held in
the Holy Cross Parish Hall in Town of Lake, the St. Stanislaus Society
turned to discuss matters pertaining to the fatherland. The members were
in full accord with the sentiment expressed in a letter received from the
National Fund [a relief fund maintained by the Catholic faction]. The letter
made an urgent appeal for contributions to the campaign waged for Lithuania's
independence. The members voted unanimously to donate one hundred dollars
from the treasury of the society. An additional twenty-seven dollars was
contributed by the individual members.</p>
<p>St. Stanislaus Society is not very old, but because of its activities it has
already won the good will, not only of its members, but also of the public at
large. It has a membership of three hundred, and a capital of three thousand
dollars. In addition, it owns three hundred dollars worth of Liberty bonds
<span class="page-break">2</span>
and five shares of Lietuva Corporation stock.</p>
<p>An election of officers for the year 1919 was scheduled for this meeting.
It was apparent that the present officers had been sufficiently zealous,
and had fulfilled their duties well enough to merit another year in office. 

They were re-elected, with the exception of the vice-president.</p>
<p>The following are the officers for the next year: A. J. Mareiva, 1805 West 
46th Street, president; L. Simutis, 4531 South Paulina Street, vice-president; 

F. Rauba, 2518 West 46th Place, recording secretary; Casimir Sanisevskis,

4600 South Wood Street, financial secretary; John Viskontas, 1809 West 46th

Street, treasurer.</p>
<p>The meetings of the Society are held on the second Sunday of each month, at

1 P. M.</p>
