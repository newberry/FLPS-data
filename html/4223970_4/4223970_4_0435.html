      <p>The Lithuanian Benefit Club of Illinois, at a recent meeting held in Dalkus
Hall, 3301 South Morgan Street, set an example for other organizations to
follow. While discussing new business, Mr. Pupauskas brought up the question
of Lithuanian independence. He pointed out that the hour has come for every
Lithuanian individual and organization to come to the aid of their fatherland
and help to win its independence.</p>
      <p>Mr. B. Butkus explained very clearly the need of donations in the fight for
liberty. Mr. A. Miseika also spoke, urging all to donate as much as possible.
Mr. M. Tamulevicius suggested that not less than two or three hundred dollars
should be contributed. The members, in full sympathy with the cause, voted to
donate three hundred dollars from the treasury. In addition, the members made
individual contributions amounting to $106.50, so that a grand total of $406.50
was realized. It was decided to send the money to the Lithuanian Independence
Fund.</p>
