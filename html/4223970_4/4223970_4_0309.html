<p>In 1913 every five hours about fourteen Lithuanians came to the
United States of America. We can say without exaggeration that one
third of them came to the city of Chicago, and most of them had a
brother, a sister, or a friend who lived in Chicago. But whether
they all were well taken care of by their relatives and friends
we don't know. But we do know that many of our immigrants met with
many hardships, and many were lost on the way to their relatives
or friends who lived here in America. We heard of many cases where
immigrants never reached their destination and disappeared completely.
Great numbers of our people were sent back to Lithuania, not because
of their sore eyes or lack of certain amount of money, but because
most of them did not know the people to whom they were going, or had
the wrong addresses. For example, there was one man who wanted his
father to come to the United States. When his father arrived in New
York he received a telegram from the immigration department which

informed him of his father's arrival. This telegram was written in
<span class="page-break">2</span>

the English language, and requested an immediate reply. Not knowing

the contents of the telegram, the man kept waiting for his father's

arrival for weeks. He did not come as he expected. He was worried

about his father's detention, yet he did not know what to do in such

a case. Finally he received another telegram and became still more

worried, not knowing what happened. He took the telegram to a certain

party who knew the English language and the party explained that

his father was being sent back to Lithuania because he was too old

to work and that his son had not answered the first telegram which

was sent to him. Excited and worried he tried to help him and made

every effort to stop the authorities from sending him back. He went

to the local Immigrant Protective League to ask for advice, but it

was too late and his father was sent back to Lithuania.</p>
<p>He could have saved his father if he had submitted an affidavit

requested by the Immigration Bureau in the first telegram which was

sent to him.</p>
<span class="page-break">3</span>
<p>All these errors are mostly due to lack of understanding the rules

and regulations of the Immigration Department of the United States

of America.</p>
<p>We have another good example in the case of a step-father who wanted

to bring to America his wife's children. He received the telegram

from the Immigration Department, but he could not read it, and

instead of giving it to a person who understood English, who would

have explained the contents of the telegram, he waited for the

children who were supposed to arrive from New York. As the time

expired, the Immigration Department sent the children back to

Lithuania because the party did not make claim during the designated

period.</p>
<p>Two examples will be sufficient to clear the situation of our immigrants 
who face great hardships from the time they start their

<span class="page-break">4</span>
journey to America and to the time they reach their destination.

There are many such examples which we cannot enumerate at present.

We must use all our efforts to help our fellow countrymen who are

coming to America, and see to it that such things do not happen

again. This is a deplorable situation confronting our immigrants

today and causing them great suffering and hardships, all due to

our negligence. We can remedy this situation and help a great
deal.</p>
<p>Our immigration to this country has continued over a long period.

Many of our people have attained a thorough education and have made

fine reputations as citizens in the city of Chicago. In addition,

we have not only one, but hundreds of societies which have good

intentions and are willing to help our people who are in distress.

We also have many good men and women who would devote their entire

time to helping our immigrants, brothers and sisters, who really

need our help.</p>


<span class="page-break">5</span>
<p>It is about time for us Lithuanians to have our own organization,

such as legal aid societies where people could come for help and

advice in legal matters. This organization is indispensable to

our people who need help and legal protection from crooks who exploit

our people and take the advantage of them, because they are foreigners

and illiterate. The legal aid society would help the people to solve

immigration problems by giving them honest legal advice when they

are in trouble and need legal protection. Heretofore we haven't had

any organization to protect our people and our immigrants. Now we

will make every effort to have such an organization, to help and

protect our people who are coming to America.</p>
<p>Now is the time to bring all well-known societies together in Chicago,

for we have a very important problem to solve. We cannot lose this

opportunity. We must act immediately if we want to accomplish our

worthwhile mission. It is our duty to organize and help our people

who are in dire need. We must all join the Lithuanian society league
<span class="page-break">6</span>

of Chicago, regardless of our differences of opinion. The Lithuanian

Society League of Chicago has a very important mission to perform

and therefore we cannot afford to lose this golden opportunity to

join this large organization. The committee which will be elected

will take care of all our future problems. For the purpose of information 
there will be a special bureau established in a short time,

where all Lithuanians, without discrimination, will be able to get

necessary information and legal advice.</p>
<p>Every society and every Lithuanian living in Chicago must help to

support the Lithuanian Society League of Chicago and in return for

his effort he will receive reward in legal advice and information

which will be given by means of the society. The Guardianship Committee 
which has been elected will handle all problems pertaining to

information and legal advice. This committee is composed of the

following members: Mrs. M. Jurgelioniene, K. Gugis, and J. Ilgandas.</p>
