      <p>October 12, at Freiheit Turner Hall, the Lithuanian Youth of America National
Club presented its affair. The program was varied, consisting of twelve parts:
speeches, songs, declamations, etc. everything was done right. The audience
felt especially happy when Miss Juze Lukoseviciute delivered a monologue entitled
"The Drunken Woman." The hall was crowded, but the conduct of the people was
far from good.</p>
