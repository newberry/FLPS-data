<p>On January 20, 1906, the Lithuanian Independent Club arranged a banquet
at the Azukas Hall, 3301 Auburn Avenue. During the entertainment
Mr. J. Dailide delivered a short speech on the present conditions in
Lithuania and the revolutionary struggle for freedom. He urged the
public to help their brothers and friends in Lithuania in their fight
for freedom. Then Mr. J. Bruzavicia spoke; he explained who the leaders
of the revolution in Russia are and for what they are fighting. He stated
that money should be sent to the Lithuanian Socialist Labor Party, which
is fighting for the rights of the workers! This organization will send
the money to the right revolutionary party in Lithuania.</p>
<p>Mr. F. Zemaitis went through the public. He collected $3.55 for the revolutionary 
cause in Lithuania.</p>
<p>I am sorry to say that there were people who said that it would be better
to buy beer with the money instead of contributing to the revolutionists.

We cannot expect anything better from such people, who are listening to
the priest, who forbids the people to read the newspapers and scientific

books.</p>
<p>Everybody remembers at the meeting on January 22, when the Rev. Kraczunas

denounced the revolutionists and praised the tsar, the murderer of the

people. God forbid that the other priests should follow Rev. Krawczunas


and forget the fifth commandment, "Thou shalt not kill."</p>
