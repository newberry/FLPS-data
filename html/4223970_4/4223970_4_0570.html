<p>A total of $204.97 was collected at four other mass meetings, as described

in the last issue of the Lietuva. (Lithuania).</p>

<span class="page-break">3</span>
without much publicity, the attendance is unusually large. The

audience of each meeting listens attentively to Mr. Simkus as

he speaks and describes present conditions in Lithuania. His talk on the

hardships of our sisters and brothers in Lithuania leaves a deep impression

upon the audience.</p>
