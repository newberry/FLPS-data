<p>A few days ago the Simanas Daukentas Society sponsored a program in which the
Birute Chorus, under the direction of Stasys Simkus, participated. Attorney
B. K. Balutis, editor of Lietuva. delivered a speech. Miss J. Micevicius recited 
poetry.</p>
<p>The speaker urged that a collection be taken up for the cause of Lithuania's
independence.</p>
<p>Collectors went through the hall with the result that [Editor's note: There
follows a list of donations] $65.42 was collected.</p>
<p>At present the donations are being held in the treasury of the Simanas Daukantas 
Society, because the Society is not satisfied with that sum. The
Society wants at least to do as well as the West Side Farmers of Lithuania
Society. Recently the latter donated three hundred dollars from its treasury
for the cause of Lithuania's independence.</p>
