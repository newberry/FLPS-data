      <p>The Chicago Lithuanians organized <span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
      <p>The society will be Catholic, and on every church holiday this society will come to
celebrate in military uniforms. Every member of this society must
go to a confession at least once a year.</p>
      <p>We organized this society in order to take up military drill, in case
of war in our country with Russia in orderV to be ready to help our brothers.</p>
      <p>We Lithuanians must show to other nations how brave we were in the time of 
Vytantas the Great, when he with the great Lithuanian army crushed the
German crusaders at Grunwald.</p>
      <p>We are asking all Lithuanians <span class="gap">[gap]</span> join our new military society.</p>
