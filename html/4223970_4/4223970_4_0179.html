that our Lithuanian grown-up friends are narrow-minded and dull. This certain young
man said he was never proud of being a Lithuanian, rather he was ashamed of
Lithuanians.</p>
      <p>Whenever he happened to be in a Lithuanian crowd he never saw nor heard anything
that could possibly attract him to their circle. If they were not drinking, they
were heatedly bantering their different beliefs and nations and making fun of all
faiths except their own.</p>
      <p>Likewise, no Lithuanian newspaper had anything that attracted his interest. The
articles were forever knocking those who were not patronizing that particular
publication.</p>
      <p>Now, to a very large degree, is not all this true? Only in recent years has American
youth of Lithuanian descent come to find a few things in common with their Lithuanian
folk.

Only now - when some Lithuanians have fortunately proved that they are capable of

toleration. The time seems to be coming when Lithuanians will stop their sectional

wrangling. They are already turning their united attention toward promoting an

unbiased feeling among the Lithuanian youth. They are attempting to form a big

alliance of Lithuanian youth regardless of their personal creeds.</p>
      <p>Here is hoping that this broad outlook will spread for that is the most inviting 

attitude for the young folks.</p>
