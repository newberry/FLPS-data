<p>One of many societies here on the West Side, the Lithuanian White
Star Benefit Club, which holds its meetings in the Meldazis Hall, is in the
second year of its existence. It is a youth organization. It not only
supplies benefits during illness, but also concerns itself with promoting
athletics among its members. The officers of the Club this year are
L. Palikevicia (president), F. Balciunas (secretary), and S. Budavicius
(treasurer). There are good men here who, it is apparent, are concerned
with enlightenment. This is proved even by the last meeting of the Club
at which it was decided to help in the upkeep of the Lithuanian Public
Library on the West Side. Ten dollars from the Club's treasury was donated
for that purpose.</p>
<p>That is all very beautiful and praiseworthy. However, it would also be good
to mention that which is not praiseworthy. The Club has a weak point. That
is its strange Anglomania: At all its affairs there are those who do not

wish to reveal themselves as "green-horns", so they speak (we should

say "try" to speak) English. From the very beginning the Club's

promotional pluggers were printed in English and distributed among

the Lithuanians. (Why not among the English?) They say they purposely do

this to raise the Lithuanians in the opinions of the other nationalities.

The Club was sponsoring a dance at the Meldazis Hall May 9, so an English

sign, with the biggest letters, hung above the doors for about a month and a

half. And that vicinity is most thickly populated by Lithuanians. Sunday,

May 3, the pluggers of this Club were distributed in front of the Lithuanian

Church--again in English... Such behavior brings no glory to the Lithuanians

and, it seems, some men must be found among the members of the Club who will

turn their attention to such "monkey-business." This matter should be explained 
to them for, though the members may have the best intentions, they

understand this matter only in their own way.</p>
