<p>A mass meeting of Chicago Prussian Lithuanians and Lithuanian Protestants was
held in Chicago, at the Milda Hall in Bridgeport, last night. The meeting
was called by a committee of Chicago Prussian Lithuanians. The reason for the
meeting was to discuss the fate of Prussian Lithuania.</p>
<p>There were many speeches and a varied program. The speakers were John Ilgaudas,
who conducted the meeting, and the following: A. Pauliukaitis, Kasper Gavene,
M. Naujokas, Reverend J. J. D. Razokas (a Lithuanian Lutheran priest),
attorney F. P. Bradchulis, editor of Lietuva, attorney B. K. Balutis, and
S. Kodis.</p>
<p>The speeches were very interesting. More will be written about them in tomorrow's Lietuva. In the meantime it will suffice to say that all the speakers
earnestly pointed out the need for unity among the Lithuanians at the present
time, when they should demand that Prussian Lithuania be made a part of
<span class="page-break">2</span>
Lithuania proper. The audience was in full a cord with these views,
and when a collection was taken up they donated almost four hundred dollars as
a beginning of the campaign. The sum is an impressive one, for there are not

very many Prussian Lithuanians in Chicago.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the meeting a resolution was passed by the Prussian Lithuanians. 

They also drew up a petition for which they will collect signatures. The petition 
will be sent to President Woodrow Wilson at the Peace Conference.</p>
<p>The petition reads as follows:</p>
<p>"To His Excellency Woodrow Wilson,</p>
<p>"President of the United States</p>
<p>"The Lithuanian people, while peacefully pursuing their own happiness, have,

since time immemorial, lived in the basin of the Nieman River and its

tributaries.</p>
<span class="page-break">3</span>
<p>"Divided by fictitious boundaries between Germany and Russia, abused

and oppressed by its neighbors who were bent on its extermination, the Lithuanian 
nation, nevertheless, has not only survived under these trying circumstances, 
but now, as never before, it feels united in spirit and purpose, and
in its desire to be one undivided and free nation.</p>
<p>"We, the Lithuanians, now residing in the United States of America, formerly 
of the German province of East Prussia (Lithuania Minor), and also their
co-religionists, the Protestant Lithuanians, hereby do solemnly declare our sincere

wish and desire that both parts of Lithuania, formerly under Russian and German

dominations, be inseparably united into one free and independent state of

Lithuania.</p>
<p>"We deeply feel that the destiny of no nation is in such need of your sympathy,

protection and support as this long-suffering, martyred, and almost forgotten

nation of ours.</p>
<p>"Therefore, we, the undersigned, most respectfully appeal to you, Mr. President,

<span class="page-break">4</span>

for your sympathy and aid in redressing the injustice done to the

Lithuanian nation; and we pray that Lithuania also may be a recipient or that

justice which has been expressed in your immortal principles of the self-determination of oppressed nationalities."</p>
