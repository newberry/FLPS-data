<p>Last Friday several Chicago Lithuanian societies met at Milda Hall to discuss
ways and means by which the Lithuanians of Chicago could best do their part
in obtaining independence for Lithuania.</p>
<p>The meeting approved resolutions demanding independence for Lithuania and
asking for the support of the United States in this cause. Copies of the
resolution were sent to President Wilson, to the presiding officers of the
Senate and the House, and to Senator Lewis of Illinois.</p>
<p>A new organization, called the "Chicago Lithuanian Council," was formed to
advance the cause of Lithuania's freedom. A special committee of nineteen
people was elected to outline plans of activity for this council.</p>
