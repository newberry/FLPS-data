      <p>Our brothers in the fatherland are giving their lives for
freedom. Let us donate at least one hour of our time to remember them.</p>
      <p>The 4th branch of the Lithuanian Socialist Party of Chicago has arranged
a lecture in memory of Bloody Sunday (January 22, 1905) in St. Petersburg,
Russia, when the blood of the people was shed for the cause of liberty.</p>
      <p>Those who stand for the welfare and freedom of suffering humanity should
come to this meeting, which will be held on Sunday, January 21, 1906,
at the Dores Hall, 2501 S. Halsted St., at 1 P. M.</p>
      <p>Your are invited in the name of humanity and freedom.</p>
      <p>Committee.</p>
