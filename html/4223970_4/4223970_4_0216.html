      <p>The National Club of Young Lithuanians in America sponsored an affair at the
St. George Parish Hall, in Bridgeport, last Sunday. A three-act drama, "The
Evil Spirit," the basic idea of which is that riches do not bring happiness,
was presented. The play pleased the audience. Of the male actors who
distinguished themselves in this play, M. Juodis (in the role of a miser) and
P. Motiejunas (in the role of a drunken farmer) must be given first place.
Both had probably the most difficult roles and both were, it can be said,
heroes of the evening. The former, especially, received much applause from 
the audience. Mr. Jankauskas (in the role of a farmer from Vieversiai) and 
K. Astrauskas (in the role of a Jew) also acted well. Mr. Mikalauskas and  
W. Bartkus proved that we can expect them to develop into good artists.</p>
      <p>In the women's roles, Miss J. Cernauskas (in the role of "Ona") , and J. L. D.
(in the role of "John's" mother) must be placed first. It is difficult to
say which of the two acted better. Both gave good characterizations in their
roles. Miss Kareivis made a sympathetic impression. However, it was possible
to see that she was probably on the stage for the first time. She can improve.</p>

      <p>After the play the Club's Chorus, under the direction of Mr. Girnius, sang
two songs. The chorus is well-balanced, has good voices and can confidently
stand alongside the older Lithuanian choruses. The affair ended with a

dance.</p>
