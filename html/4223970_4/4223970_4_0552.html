<p>Contributions totalling $63 were received during the past week for the
Christmas Fund for Lithuania. The Fund now stands at $664.38. Lietuva hopes 
to raise at least $1,000 by Christmas and to send the money to Lithuania as
a Christmas present to aid the homeland in regaining her political freedom.
The Fund was established by Lietuva five weeks ago at the suggestion of
Dr. K. Drangelis.</p>
