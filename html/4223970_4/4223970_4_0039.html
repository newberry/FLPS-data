<p>The good and honest man is not afraid, no matter what the people are
saying about him, because the good deeds of a man are appreciated by
all people. The honest man is not afraid of what the papers are writing
and the people are talking about him, because nobody writes or says
anything bad about a good man.</p>
<p>Look at the tsar of Russia. He upholds the severe censorship of books
and newspapers because he wants to keep the people in subjection. The
tsar is afraid of newspapers; his censors look over every newspaper
before publication in order to see that nothing is written about the
corruption and dissolute life of his court and among the tsar's officials.
As long as the people are ignorant they believe that the tsar is divine
and that God put the golden crown on his brainless head. It is very
easy to exploit the ignorant people, and to keep them in subjection. The
people without newspapers are blind, they blindly believe and obediently
fulfill oven the worst orders of the tsar.</p>
<span class="page-break">2</span>
<p>What the tsar is doing with censorship of newspapers in Russia is the same 
thing being done by our Rev. Krawczunas in America. The priest is more
afraid of liberal newspapers than the tsar because the newspapers are
bringing into the light the bad manners of the priest, and sharing that

the priests conduct is no different from the tsar's low corrupted life.

And because the newspapers are bringing into the light the priest's

corruption, the priest wants to destroy such newspapers by threatening

the people with hell in order to keep them from reading the newspapers

that are telling the truth. Our Rev. Krawczunas warned the people many

times not to read our newspaper. On St. Bartholomew Day, in Waukegan,

the priest told the people during the sermon that it was a deadly sin

to read tha newspaper Lietuva. Such a sermon of the priest and the

denunciation of our newspaper, as we have stated in previous numbers

of our paper, brought bad results for the priest himself, because we

received from Waukegan thirteen new subscriptions to our paper after

the priest's "great" sermon.</p><span class="page-break">3</span>
<p>In Chicago. Rev. Krawczunas does not have enough courage to denounce

our newspaper, so he told his assistant, Vicar Steponaviezius, to

execrate the newspaper which does not uphold the Rev. Krawczunas'

aim. So the Vicar Steponaviezius, in his Sunday sermon, September

11, told the parishioners as follows: "The godless newspaper accused

our rector; found out that there was no God nor the Blessed Lady. From

this day on every one will be questioned at the confessional about what

papers he reads, and whoever reads the godless newspaper will get no

absolution.</p>
<p>Priest, you are lying! Even you did not mention the newspaper's name.

We understand about which newspaper you were talking. Our newspaper

knows God better than you with your rector! If you and your rector

respected God, then you would not lie in the church, in the house of

God; you would not curse as if you were in a saloon, but you would

propagate the glory of God and love among the people. If Rev. Krawczunas

respected God, he would have not sold the house of God, the church and


<span class="page-break">4</span>

all the properties, without the parishionersâ€™ knowledge for $15,000 to

the Milwaukee Bank, like Judah sold Lord Jesus! Why, Judah himself,

when he kissed Christ, pretended that he was kissing Him from love, but

he kissed Him in order to show the Jews which one He was, and then he

sold Him to them for thirty cents. In our church, the priest, instead

of preaching the word of God, is preaching lies and blinding the people

with his lies.</p>
<p>Thousands of people are reading our newspaper; let, then, even one person

say when our newspaper said that there was no God or no Blessed Mother.

Why, the priest is not ashamed to lie in the eyes of all the people in

the church, before the altar of God! Our newspaper did not say that there

was no God, but said that there was no money in the church treasury. We

did not ask where God vanished. but what became of the money that the

people deposited with Rev. Krawczunas. Is money the god of the priest?

Where is the morality among our priests? Brothers, what benefit can we


<span class="page-break">5</span>

get from such priests who, in the house of God, are feeding the people

with lies?</p>
<p>Now you understand why some of the priests are forbidding the people to

read the newspapers. The priests know that the newspapers are telling

the people the truth, and that the truth is not afraid of light; that

the people will find out that our priests are not right. Therefore, the

priests are afraid that the people may learn from the newspapers about

their bad conduct. The priests know that the people, by reading newspapers,

will learn about their hypocrisy and will force the priests to improve

themselves. If some of the priests would not improve themselves and would

refuse to fulfill God's order, then, as wrongdoers. they shall be chased

out from the people, shall be rooted out like the kernel from the wheat.</p>
<p>Our priest have seen himself that the people know that he is lying, because

<span class="page-break">6</span>

as soon as the priest starts to denounce the newspaper in the pulpit, the

people leave the church right away. The people do not want to listen to

the priest's lies. Our Rev. Krawczunas convinced himself that with his

own words he is unable to fool the people. Now he wants to establish his

own newspaper. Well, he may have better success with a newspaper to obtain

his aim. That Rev. Krawczunas really wants to publish a newspaper we have

seen in Nos. 73 and 74 of the newspaper Saule (The Sun), published in

Mahanoy City, Pa.</p>
<p>We are willing to warn our priest that on this newspaper which he wants

to publish in order to defend his personal affairs he should not take

the money from the parish budget because sooner or later he will be

forced to make account of that money. In order to avoid trouble we are

asking the priest to buy one raffle ticket for $1.50 of the Polish newspaper 
Nowe Zvoie (New Life). The publisher of this newspaper is selling

the machinery and the newspaper on raffle tickets. We have no doubt that

God will help our priest. Therefore, he can get the newspaper and all the

machinery for $1.50.</p>
<span class="page-break">7</span>
<p>If you win this raffle then you can bring Mr. Stagaras to aid you with

your publication; then, in your own paper, you will be able to scold

and denounce your enemies. Is it not worth to spend $1.50 for this

great cause, even from the parish treasury? The second benefit from

this Polish newspaper would be to get for editor the Polish priest

Nowicki, who was in South Chicago. Then there will be a very good

company, and you will have a chance to work in the field among the

Polish people, because among the Lithuanians it looks to us that you

are standing on very weak legs.</p>
<p>If the parishioners should take from you the parish budget, what can

you do than among Lithuanians? For all of your requirements the salary

is not enough for you, and from the parish treasury you cannot take

handfuls of money anymore. And in the end, even the Lithuanians will

become disgusted with such a benefactor who has only one intention in

his life and that is how to extort as much money as possible in various

schemes from the people.</p>
<span class="page-break">8</span>
<p>Therefore, we are heartily advising to start to work among the Poles

because the Poles do not demand so much morality of their priests as

the Lithuanians do. Many such immoral priests that have been abused

by Lithuanians found refuge among the Poles. And our priest is the

first on the list now.</p>
<p>If you withdraw on your own accord from Lithuanians, you will do a

great benefit to them. Try, then you will see that for such a sacrifice

to the Lithuanian benefit, all of us will praise you. What will our priest

choose to do now?</p>
