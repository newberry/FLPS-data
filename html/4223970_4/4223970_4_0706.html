      <p>The revolution in Russia is spreading. The oppressed people begin to
realize the horrors of the Russo-Japanese war. They begin to forsee
that this war has been caused by the foolish tsar. Yet, some people
thought that the tsar was merciful and in order to get whatever was
necessary to improve their living conditions or to obtain freedom
the only thing the people had to do was to beg the tsar and explain
to him the hardship, and the earthly father, the tsar, would give
everything we ask. All the workers of St. Petersburg under the
direction of the Pope Gapon, decided to go en masse on to the tsar's
palace and to present him a petition with their demands. When
thousands of people marched in the streets toward the tsar's palace,
the tsar sent an army with orders to shoot down the marching people.
The massacre was horrible. Thousands were killed or wounded. New
the people began to realize that they could get nothing from the
tsar by begging and that only solution will overthrow the tyranny

of the tsar, and the tsar himself.</p>

      <p>The revolution is spreading all over Russia. The people begin to

understand that the only way to force the tsar to fulfill the people's

demands is by force.</p>
      <p>What must we Lithuanians do for Lithuania in this time of revolution

in Russia? Did the leaders in Lithuania prepare the people for

revolution? Did they get ammunition? Did they equip the revolutionary

forces to fight against the despotism of Russia and to free Lithuania?

If the revolution has broken out in Russia, we Lithuanians cannot

sit with folded hands and wait for the mercy of others. If we will

not help our brothers in Lithuania nobody will help them. Instead

of leaving Lithuania, the young men must stay in the fatherland and

fight for its freedom. It is much easier for the people of Lithuania

to get ammunition than for the people of St. Petersburg.</p>
      <p>True, in Lithuania we are allowed to print literature in the

Lithuanian language, but this was allowed not because the tsar wants

it, but because the tsar is beaten in the war with Japan and wants

the help of Lithuanians. He desires that the Lithuanian youth should

go and fight to satisfy the tsar's greed. The Lithuanian press in

Lithuania is under the censor. We are not satisfied with such a.

press. We must have freedom in press and speech and the independence

of Lithuania. This we will get through struggle.</p>
