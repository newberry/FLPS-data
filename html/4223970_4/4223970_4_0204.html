<p>p.4.... Last Sunday the Lithuanian American National Club held a meeting at
Radavicius Hall. Many members attended and seriously discussed important problems.
After long discussions it was decided to adopt the new "Naujienos" as the organ
of the club in place of the old "Lietuva."
This club is composed of young Lithuanians and is especially noted among Chicago
Lithuanians for its theatrical presentations.</p>
