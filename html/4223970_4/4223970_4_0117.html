<p>October 13, 1893 there was a meeting of the Lithuanian Parish. The parishioners
protested that the priest Kolesinskas did not care about his parishioners.
That when they go to see him he does not want to see them; that instead of seeing
our priest Kolesinskas, they always are met by a Polish priest; that they can
get no results because they cannot understand each other. The priest does not
speak Lithuanian, while Lithuanians cannot speak Polish. That the priest controls 
all income of the church and gives no accounting, that they wanted to get 
a final financial report from the priest on what he does with the parish money,
why the priest does not repair the church which is in a very bad shape.</p>
<p>A committee of twelve was elected to go to the priest. If priest refuses 
to see this committee, refuse to give accounting, then the parish will look for 
another priest.</p>
