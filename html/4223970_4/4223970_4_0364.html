<p>We can call emigration a bad or good thing, but we cannot deny one
thing: The Lithuanian emigration up to the present time has brought
benefit to the nation. The fatherland has lost its sons and their
labor, but what of it, when they have no chance to work in Lithuania.
Looking from the other viewpoint, the emigrants in America have
raised Lithuanianism very high; they could not have done the same
in Lithuania. Further, emigration gives perpetual material help to
Lithuania; just count how many thousands of American dollars are sent
to Lithuania yearly.</p>
<p>If the rights of the immigrants in the United States would be suppressed,
as the heavy paw of Russia suppresses on the other side, then the
Lithuanians would be pressed inside of four walls, and our brothers
would be lost.</p>
<span class="page-break">2</span>
<p>Our duty is to put all our energy against the suppression of immigration. 
We must take into consideration that when the suppression
of immigration becomes a law, no force will be able to get rid of it.</p>
<p>Our individual or group protests at the meetings will not bring the

desired results. Therefore, we are making the last and the easiest

plan which can be used by Lithuanians of good will. Do it yourself

and urge others to do likewise. The time is short but the danger is

near. This plan is not made by the editor, but impelled by the 

American organization, The Immigration Protective League whose duty

is to protect the immigrants.</p>
<p>Every Lithuanian in this country without delay should sign his name

and write a short protest and mail it to his congressman and senator.
