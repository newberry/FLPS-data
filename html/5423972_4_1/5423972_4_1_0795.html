   <p>The Chicago Tribune may congratulate itself. Its agitation for lynching and pogroms brought about good results.</p>
   <p>In our editorial "The Nearest Relative," the Chicago Tribune had recently agitated in favor of organizing a modern "Klu Klux Klan" according to the pattern of the famous inciting gang that terrorized the South after the Civil War. Its agitation was effective and the millionaire publishers of the Chicago Tribune can now hang up a picture in their palaces, for their own pleasure, portraying a wild mob of "Klu Klux Klan" or reactionaries in the act of killing an innocent man.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Tribune is progressing. Thirty years ago it had demanded that the courts should string up all socialists; now it no longer thinks of such nonsense as state justice and sentences. Why waste time and energy on such a thing that can be carried through, so easily, by "direct action."</p>
   <p>It can command its art-slave, McCutcheon, to draw an artistic cartoon which shall inspire its devoted students to further lynchings and pogroms. The brutality of the students in Valparaiso, the vulgarity of the professors, the Zionism of the capitalistic black-yellow press and, last of all, the murdering of an innocent man in the State of Illinois, - show that America is now living through an internal crisis. Everything that is bestial and corrupt within man is now publicly exposed.</p>
   <p>We are engaged in a great struggle between light and darkness; between man and animal. And the cardinal thing is not to abate the struggle for light and humanity and not to drop the sacred banner of socialism, even if it requires, thereat, many sacrifices.</p>
