   <p>The Joint Board of the Cloakmakers Union of Chicago opened a campaign yesterday to establish a 5-day working week - 8-hour day - and minimum wage of $1.00 per hour for the time they are in the shop, whether they work or not.</p>
   <p>The present wage system is very poor, and it must be altered so that when a dressmaker reports to work, he will get paid for the time he is in the shop.</p>
