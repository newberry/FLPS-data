   <p>Today is the second draft registration day in America. All young men who have become twenty-one years of age since the last registration day (a year ago today) must register today with the local boards, or at the special places which have been opened in their neighborhoods. Let every man remember that he must register today if he is twenty-one years of age, whether he is a citizen or not. Every one must register. The penalty for not registering is a very heavy one.</p>
   <p>Local Board 44 has decided to begin the registration of all new twenty-one-year-old recruits at 7 A.M. This is being done, according to Chairman Jacob Bernheim, for the convenience of those who must be at work at 8 A. M. The office of this Local Board is in Stanford Park, at Union Avenue and Fourteenth Place.</p>
   <p>For the last several days, the Courier, with the co-operation of prominent lawyers who are acquainted with every detail of the draft law, has been giving <span class="page-break">\2</span>advice to hundreds of young men about the present registration. The law clearly states that all men who have attained the age of twenty-one since the last registration, or who will become twenty-one years old today, must register. The government pays little attention to passports and other papers which are often presented to prove that a person is not quite twenty-one years old. The point is this: If you are twenty-one years of age, then you must register, if you are less than twenty-one years old, you don't have to register. The government has a detailed record of every person in America: Of those born here, from their birth certificates;and of those immigrated, from their citizenship papers or from the age given at the time of their landing in America. Therefore, let each young man who has become twenty-one years of age this year register today.</p>
   <p>The lawyers who have given good advice to the new recruits, or to their parents,are: Judge Philip P. Bregstone, Nathan D. Kaplan, Bernard Shulman, Jacob Kaplan, Max M. Korshak and Max M. Grossman.</p>
