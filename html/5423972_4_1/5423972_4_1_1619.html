   <p>If Jacob P. Adler has a monopoly on sighs, Boris Thomashefsky has a monopoly on merriment. Therefore, the former plays tragic roles, the latter happy ones. Whatever one may think of Boris Thomashefsky, one must admit that the man possesses a jubilant spirit which makes him the General-Mayor of all joyous Jews.</p>
   <p>A day came, and this general field-marshal of all merry and lively Jews on Second Avenue, New York, decided that Pottash and Pearlmutter is purely a matter of interpretation by which we can deliver "better goods." Therefore, one fine day, our brothers in New York saw an operetta in Thomashefsky's National Theater, entitled, "Upstairs and Downstairs." A most colorful travesty on Pottash and Pearlmutter, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a truly beautiful show portraying most delightfully the true to life types in more or less dialogue. Also very fine music and dances. In short, it is tremendous.</p>
   <p>Of course, in operettas, as in stories, one asks no questions. But in "Upstairs and Downstairs," now playing at the Empire Theater, one could ask many, because this beautiful play has a good plot and a lovely moral background.</p>
   <p>It portrays two Jews,--in Europe they belonged to the fifth class of mankind, --who grew, expanded, and became rich, transcending from the little to the great well-to-do, becoming the so-called Yankees of conviction from Barditchov. They are former workers, needle princes or, if you please, needle beggars who open a small business, become <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>independent, fight, work, worry, and finally become rich. An order from the government for a million rubber coats gets them big money and makes them prosperous. They become gentlemen and aristocrats.</p>
   <p>The entire development of economic life of the enterprising immigrant is here realistically dramatized. Besides, we see some interesting and life-like types from our working world. The union delegate with the immense record of twenty-five strikes, the quarrelsome scab, the Americanized children of both newly rich men, pearls of humanity, etc. Throughout it all stand the two well-to-do men: one, the good-natured; the other, the wicked.</p>
   <p>In short, the operetta consists not only of continuous action, joyous music, and beautiful dances but also of living magnificent types that <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>are spoken artistically and enacted characteristically. The whole is set to music.</p>
   <p>For the first time this season, Chicago Jews can see a performance at the Empire Theater in which all the members of the troupe perform extraordinarily well. All are excellent actors and singers who make the audience roll with laughter and almost sing for joy with them.</p>
   <p>The chorus is at first led by Sam Kestin, who immediately sets everyone laughing. In his role, Kestin has the opportunity to cast shady laughing bombs at the audience, a feat he accomplishes with ease. His part is that of the young delegate who is very proud of his fifteen years as an operator and of the twenty-five strikes he witnessed. He partakes in a successful twenty-sixth one. A joyous union delegate who wins a strike feels like dancing and singing, and Sam Kestin does both so well that you forget all your mother-in-law troubles, all your <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>worries of the Polish situation, and all the sorrows of world ills, and become very happy.</p>
   <p>The main character himself, Mr. Boris Thomashefsky, delivers the true goods. He plays the good boss with unexaggerated skill. This good boss has a tender-hearted soul; he cries, his heart aches at the sufferings of mankind. Mr. Boris is deft in his work and forever regal. The heroine, a good match for his brilliance, is Madame Abramovitz, the great mother dramatist, who plays the wife of the good boss. Her acting is naturally sweet. Other adjectives cannot describe it. She radiates so much warmth that the public is spellbound. Thus she contributes much to the success of the play.</p>
   <p>Of the younger women, these excel especially: Miss Bessie Weisman and Madame Zukerberg; the first, through her zeal and motions in <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>portraying pain-suffering actions; the other, in her singing and fine acting. Miss Zukerberg is felt in the quiet of her acting and singing, while Miss Weisman touches the heart as she fumes and boils. Bessie Weisman is without a doubt the best soubrette on the Jewish stage. You all know what that is, but a good soubrette, and at that a Jewish one, you cannot know till you have seen Bessie Weisman as a flame of fire, a thousand imps, a stormy wind, a hundred and eighty witches, a gale that deafens and blinds, yet has rythm and music. If Mr. Thomashefsky wanted to show two opposites in womankind, the one representing Jewish peacefulness, the other, the stormy wind, he could not have done better than by placing together the dove-like Zukerberg with the imp-like Weisman.</p>
   <p>Madame Frieda Ziebel, as wife of the wicked boss, plays her role well, though there appears to be a drawback. Were she less talented, her <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>role would have failed and appeared vulgar. But she is far from being vulgar, and her excellent acting suits the role well.</p>
   <p>The part of the wicked boss, called Joseph, is played with gusto and humor by Mr. Kalman Yavelier.</p>
   <p>Also the Messrs. Nathanson and Goldshwartz and Miss Ollie Zibel perform successfully in this operetta, for which Chicago has Mr. Thomashefsky to thank.</p>
