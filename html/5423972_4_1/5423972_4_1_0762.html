   <p>The Chicago landlords are getting ready for a new skin-remedy operation to be performed upon their tenants next spring. There are rumors that there will be a fifteen to twenty per cent increase in rent. Wages in many industries have been lowered by that percentage. Many industries do not pay any wages at all because there is no work. Thousands of people are not able to pay the terrifically high rents demanded now. The landlords refuse to recognize this situation, and, believing that their tenants will not be able to find new living quarters, they are getting ready for a new holdup of the tenants' pocketbooks.</p>
   <p>It is known that last year, when the landlords wanted to perform a similar operation, there arose a movement for anti-rent laws. The bills failed to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>pass in the legislature because there were not enough brave lawmakers to defend the interests of the people. But the good luck of the landlords' last year may not hold this year, because the new rentals are even more outrageous than those of last year. The landlords should not forget that the tenants are in the majority, and they will be patient only up to a certain point. Even the influence of their "friends" in Springfield will not help the landlords once they overstep that point. They will have only themselves to blame if their "right" to rob their tenants is, once and for all time, taken away from them.</p>
