   <p>The greatest "hit" of the Chicago's opera season is our renowned daughter of Bialistok, Rosa Raisa. She has especially done splendid in her part as Tosca, last Monday. She was stormily applauded after each aria. Madame Raisa was the only artist that received such a reception.</p>
   <p>A new Jewish talent that promises to become a great personality, appears this Saturday afternoon in the opera "La Sonombula" together with Galli Curci, Schipa and Lazari. She is a Jewish girl of Chicago by the name of Frances Prepitta. This is Miss Prepitta's first debut in opera.</p>
