   <p>Eighteen hundred years have passed since the fatal destruction of our country and our independence.</p>
   <p>Throughout the span of this lengthy period, our people had not encountered such an important and serious historical moment as that which presents itself today, when the fate of our people and their historical country is being decided upon for all times.</p>
   <p>For over 1800 years our country has lain desolate. During this period, our people have bled and suffered the worst inhuman persecutions, let alone ruinous pogroms and destructive bloodshed. Yet, they have maintained their existence with the last of their weakened strength, awaiting in high hopes the happy time when the powers of the world would recognize the duty they owe us, we, their victims of so many hundred years. They will finally acknowledge our right to live and exist as an independent people in our own free land, the land of our fathers, that God had promised us.</p>
   <p>At last, the happy time has come for which we had so long and ardently hoped for, while our land waited so loyally.</p>
   <p>The great, horrible, bloody World War, which brought catastrophes to our folk, accidents, and ruin, has also brought us, in its wake, the greatest happiness that ever came our way throughout our long and bitter diaspora.</p>
   
   <p>England, in a special declaration, gave recognition to the Jews as a nation, and to Palestine as our country, emphatically promising to help our people settle there.</p>
   <p>Every power, both small and large, approved the English Declaration. This was placed among those important questions that are to be read and considered at the Peace Conference.</p>
   <p>Yet, even before the Peace Conference gives its full and final decision on the matter, it is clear that the big powers, through England, have already freely opened the doors of Palestine, not merely to the Jew, but to the Jewish nation.</p>
   
   <p>The Jewish people were officially given the long expected chance to return to their historical and, what to them is, the Promised Land, the land of their forefathers, not only to settle, but to rehabilitate, create, and rebuild this homeland, for which they so ardently yearned, hoped, and waited for more than 1800 years. To us this land is as necessary as our very existence for the further development and strengthening of our nature and culture, and for the rescue of the millions of Jews who can no longer remain in those lands where they are horribly persecuted, as in Russia, Poland, and Rumania.</p>
   <p>Our redemption from the long, troubled, and bloody diaspora to again become an independent people, having our own country, depends now solely upon ourselves.</p>
   
   <p>If we do not sleep or miss this historical moment, but thoroughly avail ourselves of this unusual opportunity with its possibilities,</p>
   <p>which are now being extended to us in Palestine, then we will become a nation with a country, as all other free and independent nations.</p>
   <p>There is no other way, nor may there be any other. Therefore, I repeat, do not sleep in this historical moment and avail yourselves of the opportunities granted us by the big powers.</p>
   <p>We, therefore, appeal to the American Jew demanding that he do his duty to his country by joining the Zionist organization and lending aid with moral and financial support so that these opportunities given us may be used to advantage to rebuild our homeland in Palestine.</p>
   <p>Every Jew, not only he who considers himself a Jew, but he whom others know as a Jew; not only he who wishes to settle in Palestine to enjoy the freedom and independence there, but also he who under all circumstances remains in America; all Jews, orthodox and freethinkers, capitalists and proletarian, everyone must join the Zionist organization and help with all his strength to make an actuality of our national ideal.</p>
   <p>A Jewish home is necessary: necessary, not only for the Jewish culture and spirit, or the Jews who must or wish to make their home there, but also for the interests and well-being of the Jews who remain in diaspora countries.</p>
   <p>A Jewish homeland in Palestine will absorb the Jewish surplus population; he who is forced to wander and migrate to America, into which he brings competition and anti-Semitism, with all its evil results.</p>
   <p>A Jewish home in Palestine is just as important to those remaining in their various countries, as to those who must migrate and settle there.</p>
   
   <p>We know definitely, excluding a small group of enslaved souls, that the majority of Jews in America favor a homeland in Palestine. Yet, why this majority has not joined the Zionist organization, is due to their negligence.</p>
   <p>Let these Jews know and understand that their aloofness to our organization, which to the present has been neglected, is now considered treason in the full and true sense of the word.</p>
   <p>Now when we have among us such persons who explain like true slaves that they do not desire to be freed from the diaspora or receive our own land and independence, now must every true loyal and proud Jew join the Zionist ranks, in order to weaken the horrible impression that our above-mentioned traitors have created, and, thereby make it impossible for them to continue in such mean vein.</p>
   <p>Jews, do your sacred duty by your people and their homeland, Palestine! Make use of the membership campaign being conducted at present, and become a member of the Zionist organization.</p>
