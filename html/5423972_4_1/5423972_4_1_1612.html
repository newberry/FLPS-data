   <p>Victor Young is being acclaimed the greatest boy violinist of today by European music masters. He is the son of a chorus man of the Yiddish theater in Chicago, and is, no doubt, the greatest artistic genius Chicago Jewry has produced.</p>
   <p>Victor, although born and raised in Chicago on Maxwell street, has received his musical training in Warsaw. His first appearance was at a special concert arranged for him by the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. His success was instantaneous.</p>
   <p>Master Young's concert in Chicago will be held in Orchestra Hall on November 9. He will then start on a concert tour of America. The Chicago critics who have recently heard him play, predict that Victor Young will soon be recognized as a leading violin master.</p>
