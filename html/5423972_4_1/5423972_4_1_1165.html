   <p>Another striking confirmation of the Einstein theory of relativity has been found in the experiments conducted by Prof. Albert A. Michelson.</p>
   <p>Prof. Michelson threw two beams of light by mirrors in opposite directions through a 5,200 foot vacuum tube. If they had required identical time to make the trip, reaching their starting place together, a possible loophole had been found in Einstein's theory. Michelson stated, however, that in none of the tests thus far had the two beams come home together.</p>
