   <p>As you read these lines, great Jewish doctors in Chicago--doctors of nation-wide reputations--are discussing a scientific statement issued by a Jewish doctor, a specialist in biology and serology, regarding a cure for cancer, which the doctor claims to have discovered.</p>
   <p>I am no authority on medicine nor can I say anything about this matter, but I do believe that it would be a real godsend if a Jewish doctor, working in a Jewish hospital, were to discover a cure for cancer. I have no right to disclose the name of this doctor until we learn more about this matter. But I do have the right to reveal the name of the Jewish hospital: it is the Mt. Sinai Hospital, the only Jewish hospital in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Just imagine what an honor it would be for the Chicago Jews, for the Chicago-Jewish doctors, and for Mt. Sinai Hospital, if one of its staff doctors should discover an effective cure for cancer.</p>
