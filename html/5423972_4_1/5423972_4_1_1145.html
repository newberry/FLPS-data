   <p>Dr. A. P. Kadison, a practicing physician, was the first Russian Jewish doctor to bring with him a college diploma from a European university. He was a student of the Talmud and a lover of Hebrew literature. He surrounded himself with a group of young men and organized the Dorshe Sfath Over (Seekers of Hebrew Language). Quarters were procured on Canal street near Judd. An excellent collection of the best classic and neo-Hebraic literature was installed and the Dorehe Sfath Over became the intellectual center of Chicago Jewry.</p>
   <p>The most active member of the group was Peter Wiernick. The present owner and publisher of the Courier, M. Ginsburg, came next in zeal. Among the other members were A. A. Schneider, Abraham Bernstein, Eliazer Meites, A. S. Roe, Baruch Blumenthal and Chas. Tickten.</p>
