   <p>It is a fact that not until Congress adopted the resolution that the United States declare war against Germany, and Pres. Wilson had clarified in a brilliant manner our dispute with Germany, did any one understand clearly why the nations of Europe were slaughtering one another. America cleared the issue, and it now lips open before everyone, that the struggle for life and death emerges from two principles; viz., that or self-government by the people and that of a government by a divine ruler, who is not obligated to account for his acts to his people, but to God, by whose grace he governs.</p>
   <p>On one side stand all democratic nations, Republican &amp; Constitutional, where freedom of the people is guaranteed by laws which the people themselves make and where the legislative power and the question of war and peace depend <span class="page-break">2</span>entirely on their will.</p>
   <p>On the other side stand the autocratic powers, under which the people have not as yet won their inalienable right to govern themselves, and where the question of war and peace is not decided by the people, but by their rulers.</p>

Should, however, Poland decide to become a republic, she can't, because of being under Germany's Germany's authority.

She destroyed Serbia, Rumania, Montenegro, Belgium, and the wealthiest provinces of northern France, and all these combined will become one powerful empire which will be in a position to impose its power upon the world, changing the forms of democratic countries, and destroying their democratic institutions.</p>

   <p>Thus, we see that the United States entered the war, not for the sake of fighting, but as an urgent need. America fights for a democratic cause and her own democratic institutions.</p>
