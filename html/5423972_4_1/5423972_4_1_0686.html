   <p>Bells are rung; windows are trimmed in the stores; Christmas trees are carried home. The holiday spirit is felt everywhere.</p>
   <p>Holiday charity - balls are made in order to bay toys for the poor children so they shall also know the meaning of Christmas. The poor are apparently not forgotten. Joy and happiness are brought into their homes.</p>
   <p>Can anything better be expected? But upon observing this closer, there can evidently be no greater contradiction than this sort of Christmas-help for children at the price, which the children themselves, pay back to society.</p>
   
   <p>This does not mean that we condemn every sort of charity. No, when families, whose provider is in the hospital are taken care of; when the needy are given aid; when orphans or the handicapped are not forsaken; that is a great thing. But nothing is so conspicuous as this sort of charity; of giving a dinner to the poor once a year, on Thanksgiving Day, or distributing toys among the poor on Christmas so that the donator is given credit in all newspapers; and those who receive the gifts are humiliated.</p>
   <p>And this is not all, if we should acquaint ourselves with the sacrifices that the children render to society and what they receive in return, - presents.</p>
   <p>From the beloved South, which is known for its intolerance in compelling children to labor, the following is told: The farmers of a certain district have recently held a meeting to discuss the reason why their cotton prices are so low. They came to the conclusion that it is due to child labor producing an over supply of cotton on the market, and, therefore, cotton drastically falls in price.</p>
   
   <p>Now we shall see whats going on in the East: A report from the Federal Children's Bureau in New York informs us that the number of boys and girls that are deprived of school in increasing. Detroit, this great industrial city, shows a constant increase in children, who are driven to work. The report reads that children are tortured by the indoor work. Where they do not get any fresh air and that their physical condition is greatly impaired.</p>
   <p>Therefore it is insufficient to give a toy to a poor child in order to deafen his conscience and quiet his crying, when he is driven to work.</p>
