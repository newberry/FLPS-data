   <p>The office of an Election Commissioner is one of the most important offices in Cook County. The Board of Election Commissioners has full authority over the elections held in Chicago. The Board, which consists of representatives <span class="page-break">\2</span>from the two major political parties, sees to it that the elections are run honestly and that citizens have absolute freedom to voice their opinions on governmental affairs at the ballot box. Only people of sound character are given such an important office. Judge Jarecki appointed Mr. Lipsky upon the merits of his distinguished record as a member of the County Civil Service Commission and also as a member of the Board of Education under Mayor Harrison.</p>
