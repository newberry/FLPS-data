   <p>Chicago is again attracting attention abroad. "Butterflies" is the title of an opera burlesque composed by Mr. Carl Koelling of Chicago. The Carl Schultze Theatre in Hamburg is under contract bound to produce it on April 4th or 11th, or pay a heavy forfeit. August Cranz, the well known publisher in Hamburg, Vienna and Brussels, has bought the music. Mr. Koelling is now in Hamburg superintending the production.</p>
