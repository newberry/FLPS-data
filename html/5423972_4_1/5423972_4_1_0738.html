   <p>Chicago Cloak Makers Make Plans for a Great Organization Campaign.</p>
   <p>The Joint Board held their regular meeting Friday night. This meeting was of a serious character, and due to the presence of President Schlessinger, the reports were given in great detail. The reports of the officials proved that all union activities are carefully attended to and the reports of the various committees revealed that everything was thoroughly considered and transacted.</p>
   <p>The meeting conveyed the impression of the review of a large army by its General. A communication from the Alliance revealed a state of true friendship with Soviet Russia, and a resolution was proposed demanding that the American Government recognize Russia. Schlessinger took the floor on that question and declared that he is in favor of adopting that resolution, but is against the resolution worked out by this so called Alliance.</p>
   <p>This resolution, he declared, builds its demand principally on the fact that in America there is unemployment and that if Russia will be recognized it will <span class="page-break">2</span>bring business to the American factories. This argument would fit an organization of bosses, but not of workers. Supposing there would be prosperity in America, would that mean that there would be no ground to demand Russia's recognition? We must adopt a resolution demanding recognition of Russia, not from the viewpoint of profit for us, but from the viewpoint of justice.</p>
   <p>Delegate Davidson made a motion to accept the ideas brought out by President Schlessinger and to ignore the resolution sent in by the Alliance.</p>
   <p>The Cloakmakers Union demand that Russia shall be recognized by the United States government in the interest of human justice. At the conclusion of the meeting, Schlessinger delivered an address of over an hour, urging the delegates to work for the Cloakmakers Union.</p>
   <p>Yesterday morning, President Schlessinger visited the meeting of the Executive Board of operators of Local 5, and took notice of how the delegates transact the business for the union.</p>

   <p>After the meeting, he declared to a representative of the Forward that the questions transacted at that meeting were very interesting, everything was intelligently handled and in the best brotherly spirit. On the agenda of the Executive was the question of establishing an insurance fund for unemployed members and the delegates invited Schlessinger to give his opinion on that question.</p>
   <p>He spoke on the various plans of insurance for unemployed, pointing out that it is not feasible to make the bosses partners in the insurance plan for unemployed. It is reactionary, and no progressive organization should accept such a plan. He also explained that it cannot be expected that in the near future the government of the country will be able to pay unemployment insurance, because in this country the labor movement is not so strong economically and politically as it is in England and Germany. It therefore remains for the workers to prepare a plan whereby the workers shall each pay a certain <span class="page-break">4</span>sum each week and from that unemployment insurance will be paid, on a scientific basis, which will make it possible for the members of the union to receive at least one fourth part of their wages during the time they are not working, for a period of ten weeks, in cases where members worked less than thirty-two weeks throughout the year. Comrade Schlessinger spoke a good deal on that question and made it clear to the Executive members that this must be done for the entire union and must be under the auspices of the Joint Board. He informed the Executive members, that the biggest experts on the insurance question admitted that his plan was a good one and the chief expert of the Metropolitan Insurance Company, Mr. Leo B. Frankel, is working out all the details of the plan. It will then be explained to the members of the International so that they will understand and realize that it is in their interest to accept this plan, and establish a system of insurance for the unemployed so that they will not have to suffer during the slack season as they suffer now and the unemployed will not help the bosses cut the wages of all the workers in the industry.</p>
   <p>Starting tomorrow night the locals of the International will have special meeting that will be addressed by Comrade Schlessinger.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>Tomorrow night, Local 59 - Finishers, will have a special meeting in the Schoenhofen Hall.</p>
   <p>The Executive Board made that announcement Monday night, but due to the presence of Schlessinger and the important questions that he will speak on, it will be necessary for a special meeting to be held Monday. Every member of Local 59 must be present without fail, to hear Comrade Schlessinger explain the conditions of the trade and the Chicago unions.</p>
   <p>Tuesday night a special meeting of the cutters local at 1819 W. Division St. Wednesday night a special meeting of the operators, Local 5, at Schoenhofen Hall. Thursday night a special meeting of Local 100, dressmakers, right after work, 180 W. Washington St. At 8 o'clock there will be a special meeting of the pressers, in the Union Headquarters on Division St. All the members of the aforementioned locals must be present at the meeting and participate in the discussion of the important questions.</p>
   <p>Comrade Schlessinger will address all of these meetings and he urges every member to be present.</p>
