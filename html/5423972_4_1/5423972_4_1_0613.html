   <p>"Most of the troubles which Europe is now suffering arise from the fact that large nations seek to suppress the spirit of freedom inherent in smaller nations who have lost their independence. Europe, as well as the rest of the world, would be happier if every nation were independent, or, at least, were an autonomy under the protection of an empire. The people of the United States ought to sympathize with small nations who strive to gain their independence."</p>
   <p>These lines were translated from a brief but logical editorial in the Chicago Daily News. The argument contained in them has been advanced by Zionists for more than forty years. These have been the aspirations of small nations for the past century. This is the goal of human progress. The only ones who can, as yet neither see nor recognize this are our "Comrades" [Jewish radicals], and the heretics of the Haskalah [Education] generation [sic], who hope to consolidate all nationalities into one nation.</p>
