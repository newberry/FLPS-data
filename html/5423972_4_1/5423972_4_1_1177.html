   <p>The spring ball of the J. L. Perez Writers' Union, the first undertaking of the Jewish newspapermen of Chicago, was a great success, to judge by the gigantic crowd that gathered at the West Side Masonic Temple on Saturday night. As soon as the hall was opened, it was immediately filled, and the police had to close the doors. Thousands of people, even those who had tickets, but came late, could not get in. As always happens, the ball committee of the Union could not have foreseen that such a huge crowd [would attend], and, therefore, it did not rent a larger hall which could easily have been filled. The hall was too crowded to maintain proper order and the program could not be carried out as was originally planned.</p>
