   <p>"In the present era women has come into her own," said Dr. Emil G. Hirsch yesterday morning in Sinai Temple after he had referred to the meetings of the National Council of Jewish Women. "Those who are so constantly invoking the law to aid women forget that in biblical times women enjoyed many of the advantages which she has recently won. It was only when legality laid its hand on her that she was forced to become a mere plaything."</p>
   <p>Dr. Joseph Stolz, speaking at Isaiah Temple, also took up the abuse of the feminine.</p>
   <p>"The highest aspiration of a Jewish woman was to be the joyful mother of children," said he. "Though Deborah summoned warriors to battle, proclaimed the word of God with prophetic lips, pronounced judgment, she refused to pose as a heroine and coveted not the poet's laurel; she called herself neither judge, poetess nor prophetess, <span class="page-break">2</span>but "mother in Israel," the simplest, the most modest, yet the most beautiful of all titles. Her ambition it was to deserve the love of her husband and win the reverence of her children; to cement the family tie by her untiring service, her boundless selfsacrifice, her loving consecration to duty, her devotion to peace."</p>
