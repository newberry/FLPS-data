   <p>Otto A. Cohen, the well-known Jewish financier and music lover, fainted suddenly yesterday as he addressed a rich gathering at a banquet in the Blackstone Hotel. In another room he was revived by several doctors so that a few minutes later he was again in the large hall.</p>
   <p>The public gave him a hearty ovation as he resumed his place and finished his speech. He strongly lauded Chicago, where in the span of one year so much has been accomplished in the field of opera; wherein opera has been definitely established.</p>
   <p>The banquet was given in honor of the donors of Grand Opera. Mr. Cohen, of the great New York banking firm of Cohen Loeb &amp; Co., is one of the main contributors in supporting Grand Opera in America. He is also a director of the New York Metropolitan Opera House and was invited as the principal speaker at yesterday's banquet.</p>
