   <p>Some swindlers who represent themselves as health officers and license examiners have appeared recently in the Jewish neighborhoods of Chicago. They enter a small store and demand the immediate payment of the license fee from the storekeeper, or else the city will close their stores, [they say]. Many storekeepers become frightened and pay immediately. They receive a receipt for their payments. We came across such a receipt and thus became aware of the swindle. We notified the license department in the City Hall about it.</p>
   <p>Alderman Joseph A. Kostner, chairman of the Revenue committee of the City Council, asks us to notify the public that the city has no employees who are authorized to collect money from any person or business establishment. Licenses can be obtained only at the offices of the city collector, Room 107, City Hall. The license fee is paid there by check or cash.</p>

   <p>Notify the police department at once if anybody demands payment of the license fee from a storekeeper.</p>
