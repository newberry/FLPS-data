   <p>At the last meeting of the board of directors of the Schiff and Company State Bank, it was shown that the competent management of the institution resulted in large profits last year. The directors have, therefore, decided to double the capital stock, making it $400,000, instead of $200,000. The resources of the bank are over $5,000,000. The directors were greatly inspired by the report dealing with the growth of the bank.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, Seymour W. Schiff, youngest son of B. J. Schiff, was elected as a member of the board of directors. The Board of Directors of the bank now consists of B. J. Schiff, Samuel Schuster, Samuel Phillipson, L. I. Cohen, and Seymour Schiff.</p>
