   <p>The celebrated Chicago cantor, Joseph Giblichman, of the Knesses Israel Nusach Sford Synagogue will give his first public recital at Kimball Hall, on Sunday afternoon, February 24. The program will consist of difficult operatic arias and liturgical music. He will be accompanied by the well-known pianist Shenman and by the violin artist, Alfred Goldman.</p>
   <p>Cantor Giblichman received his musical education at the Vienna conservatory. He has surprised the Chicago Jews with his magnificent singing of Jewish liturgical compositions. We have no doubt that he will distinguish himself before and audience of music connoisseurs. He is a dramatic tenor, and has a voice of unusual timbre. He is a great artist in his chosen field. The concert has been arranged by Professors Shikart and Greenwald.</p>
