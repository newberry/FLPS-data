   <p>Chicago rabbis have proclaimed Thursday as a day of fast and prayer. It coincides with the day proclaimed by President Wilson and designated by him for the same purpose. On that day the American nation will assemble in its houses of worship and pray to the Almighty for the success of the American army and navy over the enemy, and for a speedy and just universal peace. This day is also known as Decoration Day, when the graves of the fallen American heroes of the Civil War are decorated with flowers.</p>
   <p>It is appropriate on this day to pray to God for our success over the enemy and, also for peace. Chicago Jews will observe this momentous and holy day in a real traditional Jewish spirit. The local rabbis met yesterday in the office of the Courier and, acting under the authority vested in them by the Torah and the Law, resolved to designate Thursday a day of public fast.They will call upon all Jews to come on this day at 5 P. M. to the synagogues, where the reading of certain prayers and psalms befitting the event will take place.</p>
   <p>Thursday, therefore, is the day of fast and prayer; those unable to fast will give redemptions. Jews have always acted in this manner, and Chicago Jews will do so Thursday; the more robust will fast and the weaker will give redemptions. With the money derived from redemptions a Jewish hospital unit will be set up as a gift of Chicago's Jews to our government. This shows the twofold significance of the day. Besides praying to God for an early peace, we will also extend aid to our sons, our brothers, and our relatives on the battle-fields.</p>
   <p>All Jews of Chicago will, therefore, close their places of business and cease their work at 5 P. M. on Thursday. They will assemble in the synagogues to pray, not only for the success and security of our Army and Navy, but also for our Jewish boys--our own flesh and blood--for our children, our relatives, and our wounded in the present war. Let every Jew, and especially every Jewish mother of a "soldier boy," remember that Thursday has been proclaimed by Chicago rabbis a day of fast and prayer, and that it is their duty to adhere to this resolution which is also in accordance with President Wilson's proclamation.</p>
   <p>The rabbis will tomorrow issue a special appeal to Chicago Jews on the day of fast and prayer, and designating the special portions of psalms and prayers to be read. A large number of prominent rabbis participated in the meeting.</p>
