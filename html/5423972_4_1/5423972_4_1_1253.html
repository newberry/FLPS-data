   <p>A marvelous operation was performed recently by Dr. Boerne Bettman, the oculist of this city. The matter has created much interest in medical circles. The name of the patient is John Knight, who is a machinist employed at Beloit. On the 19th of last month he was adjusting a large screw, and striking it with his hammer, a piece flew off and struck his eye. He rubbed his eye and not feeling inconvenienced, he continued his work, but before night his eye pained him so badly that he had to leave for home.</p>
   <p>He consulted doctors in Beloit and Rockford to no avail. Finally, suffering greatly, he came to Chicago and consulted Dr. Bettman. The doctor detected the bit of steel in the interior of the eye-ball, first applying cocaine. With a powerful magnet he then drew out a piece of steel from 1/10 to 1/8 of an inch in length and 1/10 of an inch wide.</p>
   <p>The patient was then put in a dark room for two days and in four days thereafter was discharged, perfectly cured.</p>
