   <p>Today is election day. The polls are open from six o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the afternoon. All citizens are urged to vote. Six judges of the Superior Court and four judges of the Municipal Court are to be elected. The citizens also have to express their opinion about the proposed bond issues to finish building some bridges and for more and better lighting, as well as on the question of the annexation of Main Township to Chicago.</p>

   <p>The second ballot is for judges to the Municipal Court. The Courier endorses the following: Emanuel Eller, who is running as a Republican; Peter H. Schwab, a Democrat, and John Phillip and Newton Gilmor, Independent Republicans.</p>
   <p>The third ballot is for the bond issues and the Main Township annexation. Vote "Yes" on all propositions.</p>
