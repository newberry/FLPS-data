   <p>The Jewish Colonial Bank, the only Zionist bank in the world, has now, for the first time, an authorized agency in America. The Ashland-12th Street Bank has just opened a division which will represent in America the interests of the Zionist bank.</p>
   <p>Chicago Zionists have welcomed this news, for now everyone sending checks to Palestine and England can feel secure. All deposits for the Jewish Colonial Bank can be made through the Ashland-12th Street Bank. Interest will be paid through shares, and all persons having business to transact with the Colonial Bank can do so through the new bank on 12th Street and Ashland Avenue.</p>
