   <p>Municipal Judge Harry A. Fisher yesterday issued a verdict stating that a doctor must tell the truth regarding the condition of his patient.</p>
   <p>Dr. M. Hoover sued Mrs. Ida Beckman for $153 which he claimed was due him for services rendered when her child was sick. The trial occurred yesterday in Judge Fisher's Court.</p>
   <p>The mother claimed that the doctor did not know what ailed the child and, therefore, it died. The doctor, on the other hand, stated that the child suffered of diphtheria, but, that to avoid placing the mother in a panicky or frightened state he refrained from stating the nature of the disease.</p>
   <p>The Judge, in presenting the verdict, stated that the doctor is not privileged to tell even such a lie and loses thereby any claims to the payment of his bill.</p>
