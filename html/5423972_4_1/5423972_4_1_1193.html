   <p>Corporation Counsel Samuel Ettelson yesterday dismissed his assistant Donald R. Richberg, who had hinted that the Corporation Counsel was not sincere in the action taken against the peoples Gas, Light and Coke Company in the sum of ten million dollars.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ettelson has declined to talk about the incident. He simply said that Richberg has been dismissed and that next Tuesday he will appear before the Gas Litigation Committee to clarify his position.</p>
   <p>Mr. Richberg, who supervised the gas case, claims that Mr. Ettelson has no right to dismiss him, because he was appointed by the City Council as the special gas attorney for the city.</p>
