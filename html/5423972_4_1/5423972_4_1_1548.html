   <p>A recent article in the Herald and Examiner states that eighty-five percent of the great artists in all departments of music are of Jewish origin. It is not surprising to find, therefore, that in the Gunn School of Music, during the twenty-two years of its existence, the great majority of talent presented to the public has been Jewish.</p>
   <p>In the early part of the Twentieth Century, the school then known as the Gleen Dillard Piano School, produced and offered to the pubic such talent as Belle Tannenbaum and Moses Boguslawski, now brilliantly identified with the professional life of the city. In recent years, the most pronounced success is that of Rae Bernstein, who was twice soloist with Frederick Stock and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and who has also appeared with the Minneapolis Symphony.</p>
   <p>Another of the season's brilliant successes is Sara Levee, who was the soloist with the Chicago Symphony in January.</p>
   <p>On the school commencement program of June 3, at the Studebaker Theater, two of the students were Jewish, Marion Miller, who won highest honors inthe junior class, and Anatol Rapaport, winner of the highest honors in the post graduate class.</p>
