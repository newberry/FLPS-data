   <p>Simon B. Eisendrath has been awarded the contract to build the new Jewish hospital in Pittsburgh. The competition included three local architects and is therefore quite a compliment to Mr. Eisendrath who is practically a stranger in that city.</p>
   <p>While still maintaining a branch office in this city, Mr. Eisendrath has become associated with a large firm of architects who have under contract the building of a number of large and important business houses. Mr. Eisendrath spends a great deal of his time in the East where he has met with marked success.</p>
