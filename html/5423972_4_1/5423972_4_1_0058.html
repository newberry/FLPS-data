   <p>Chicago, May 31. - The Republican party of this county has honored the Germans, and more especially those of the Hebrew denomination, by selecting from among twenty-three candidates as one of its standard-bearers in to-morrow's judicial contest, Mr. Julius Rosenthal. With all the vituperation expended by opposing journals on the different Republican candidates there is not a single paper which could in any way find a vulnerable spot in the armor of Mr. Rosenthal. His great judicial learning is conceded by every one, - and as to his record in the official positions held by him as a member of the Library Board, etc., it is simply incomparable. He held for more than ten years the position of Public Adminstrator in this county; millions of property of deceased persons passed through his hands, and there is to this day not a widow, or orphan, or any other heir of the estates administered by him, who ever made the least complaint against the most honest and scrupulous accounting. Let every well-meaning citizen reflect on this record, and vote for Julius Rosenthal.</p>
   <p>My co-religionists especially I would ask to turn out to-morrow, every man, and <span class="page-break">\2</span><span class="gap">[gap]</span></p>
