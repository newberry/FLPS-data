   <p>Chicago, May 31. - The Republican party of this county has honored the Germans, and more especially those of the Hebrew denomination, by selecting from among twenty-three candidates as one of its standard-bearers in to-morrow's judicial contest, Mr. Julius Rosenthal. With all the vituperation expended by opposing journals on the different Republican candidates there is not a single paper which could in any way find a vulnerable spot in the armor of Mr. Rosenthal. His great judicial learning is conceded by every one, - and as to his record in the official positions held by him as a member of the Library Board, etc., it is simply incomparable. He held for more than ten years the position of Public Adminstrator in this county; millions of property of deceased persons passed through his hands, and there is to this day not a widow, or orphan, or any other heir of the estates administered by him, who ever made the least complaint against the most honest and scrupulous accounting. Let every well-meaning citizen reflect on this record, and vote for Julius Rosenthal.</p>
   <p>My co-religionists especially I would ask to turn out to-morrow, every man, and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>vote for the ticket of that party which honored them by placing one of our representative men as a candidate before them for one of the most honorable positions in its gift.</p>
   <p>One of the other candidates who deserves the special support of the Israelites of this city is the Hon. Erastus S. Williams. He, it was, who two years ago while presiding on the bench of the Criminal Court, rebuked a jury and the Prosecuting Attorneys by promptly setting aside an unjust verdict in the case of The People vs. Samuel Strauss. He then stated that as long as he lived, and as long as he presided as Justice, no man could be condemned purely on account of his religion. The defendant was subsequently honorably discharged.</p>
   <p>I am sure the Israelites will never forget such an act of kindness and independence in a Judge.</p>
