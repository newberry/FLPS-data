   <p>Since the saloons have been closed Sundays, the question has been raised, "What is to be done for the young folks who seek a place to spend a few hours when they are free?"</p>
   <p>To answer this question, Mr. Lipsky, a member of the Board of Education and chairman of the Neighboring Centers Committee, suggested to open the school assembly halls for Sundays, and convert them into community centers. Mr. Lipsky, stated that twenty nine schools are now being used as community centers, and that he was convinced that in time more schools will be opened to educate and amuse the public by having entertainments, dramatic performances, concerts, athletic exhibitions, and other forms of education and recreation.for the citizens.</p>

   <p>The people will be able to carry through anything they wish in their own language in the Community Centers, in order to get the people accustomed to use the schools and yet not feel that they are receiving charity. A small fee will be charged, to cover cleaning and lights, so that those making use of the schools, will feel that they have the right as well as the duty to take advantage of the opportunities that the schools offer the public.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lipsky's plan is an excellent one, and he deserves credit for the position he takes in the question of supplying the citizens with a place to spend Sunday. For such a small admission fee, the public will come to concerts and entertainments, which will attract many young men who otherwise spend Sundays in bad places.</p>
   <p>All trade unions, Workmen's Circle branches, and progressive organizations should contact Mr. Lipsky. He will provide the Jewish communities with schools, where all the Jewish activities sponsored by the Jewish organizations, may take place.</p>
