   <p>Our modern Jews no longer call themselves reformed Jews. From now on, the name is Modern Jews. Through their weekly newspapers - religious or social - these Jews put a lot of weight on every news item concerning Jews who have become famous in the political, social, commercial, scientific or artistic field. Should a Jew become a policeman in a small town in any part of the world, the Jewish-American newspapers will give this event a write-up on the front page. Should a Jew receive a medal from any leader, a great fuss will be made about it. Should a Jew become a director of a petty bank in Bagdad, it will be of great importance to our American Jews. If a jew makes an etching or writes a dissertation on any branch of science, there will be no end of praising him.</p>

   <p>This is done, however, contrary to their opions which deny the social relationship between Jew and Jew.</p>
   <p>These writers who try to prove, by all sorts of crafty devices, that the Jews are not a homogenous race, that the Oriental Jew has nothing in common with the Occidental Jew, will be unable to restrain their joy upon learning that some member of the Jewish family is showered with an honorary title. What inspiration prevailed among our Jewish-American patriots when Ernst Nathan became Mayor of Rome! But if you speak to them they will persuade you that, as Americans, being true American patriots, it doesn't make any difference to us whether the candidate running for office attends the synagogue or church.</p>
   <p>This modern problem exists only among us Jews. It suffices to mention that two years ago all Irish state officers were nominated and elected because the Irish masses, as well as their leaders, knew nothing about this modern problem and their natural national inclination was to vote <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>for their own, regardless of someone else's superior ability.</p>
   <p>We mention this fact now because the political campaign is just beginning. On the various tickets there are many Jewish candidates and it is no more than natural that a Jew should vote for a Jew. If the candidate is known to the voter, then the voter knows that he is no worse than the non-Jew, and if he is not known to the voter, there is still no reason why a Jew should not vote for a Jew.</p>
   <p>During the campaign, it is also natural that many committees will organize themselves under the following names:</p>
   <p>"Jewish Democratic Club," "Jewish Republican League," "Jewish Progressive Organization," and other similar organizations. And we shall hear the voices of our American patriots shrieking that "Judaism" should not be mixed with politics!" We therefore repeat that every Jew should encourage and support such Jewish-political organizations.</p>
