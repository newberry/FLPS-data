Jackson Blvd. and feel as much at home as they would in the office of the union." This statement was made by Comrade Sam Levin, manger of the Chicago Joint Board, at the weekly meeting of the deputies of the union. where he announced that the Amalgamated Bank would open soon.</p>
   <p>Comrade Levin stated that the charter for the bank was received by the State Controller of banks and that a building at 371 W. Jackson, in the center of the factory district was rented. The architects are preparing plans for the reconstruction of the building in the best and most modern way, as is becoming to the Amalgamated.</p>
   <p>The charter of the bank allots a capital of $209,000 and $100,000 surplus. The sum of $300,000 will be raised, by the selling of shares to good standing members only. A share will be sold for $150.00, and only 2,000 shares will be offered for sale.</p>

   <p>The bank will accept saving deposits, will have checking accounts, and a foreign exchange department. The interest on deposits will be paid as in all banks, with the exception that the depositors will receive part of the profits besides the usual interest, because the Amalgamated Bank will not divide the total profits among the share-holders, as is done in private banks, but at the end of each year, when it will be evinced that the shareholders received their eight or ten per cent, then the extra will be divided among the depositors, beside the interest on their deposits.</p>
   <p>The general officers of the Amalgamated, Sidney Hillman, Sam Levin, Morris Petro, Frank Rosenblum, Sam Reesman and Skola are in charge of organizing the bank, with W. A. Thompson as director and manager of the bank. Mr. Thompson was the former representative of the Amalgamated Arbitration Board, between the union and Hart, Schaffner and Marx. He was in the banking business in New York and will have charge of the bank in Chicago.</p>

   <p>As soon as Sam Levin announced the news about the bank, many members wanted to purchase shares. Levin told the members that in a few days preparations will be made for a meeting, where the books for share will be open. In the meantime, this announcement must reach the tens of thousands of members to convince them that the Amalgamated Clothing Workers undertake one of the most difficult and largest undertaking to the interest of the members of the Amalgamated and of the entire labor movement of the land.</p>
