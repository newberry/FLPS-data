   <p>Mr. Fred Lubin, the well-known manufacturer and noted Zionist, received a cablegram from London yesterday. In it, his son, Leo, states that he and the other Jewish Legionnaires have arrived safely in London.</p>
   <p>Leo and fifty-five other young Jewish men of Chicago are members of the large Jewish Legion which is on its way to fight for Palestine, under the Jewish and British flags. They left Chicago for Halifax, Nova Scotia, two weeks after Passover. There they were in training until June 8. Then they left for London.</p>
