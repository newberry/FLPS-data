   <p>At the next convening of Congress, the marriage eugenic bill sponsored by Senator Capper will undoubtedly pass and become the law of the United States. In many quarters this law, though it will have to be observed in all legal marriages, will be greeted with a good deal of jesting and good-natured or sarcastic fun. Fundamentally the law is sound and we venture to predict there will be no general opposition to its provisions and little if any attempt at evasion. If one who contemplates marriage is unwilling to prove the soundness of his or her health in all matters, such a person will receive but little of the benefit of doubt that we allow other would-be culprits. The best feature of the bill is that it will save childhood from the stigma of inherited disease and so make the world a better place to live in. Even the most rabid individualist must recognize the justice of this safeguard of the new generation. The crimes committed against children are the worst conceivable and it is suprising that society in the past has acquiesced in the pollution of the race, rather than see to it that the stream of life be kept clean at all costs.</p>
