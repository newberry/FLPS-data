   <p>Jewish music is the only branch of the fine arts which we have neglected. Jewish music has, as yet, no champion, no redeemer. This is a crime against our culture because without music, Jewish literature is without sound, color, or melody, and is robbed of the most beautiful and effective means to express the emotions and aspirations of the soul of the individual Jew and of the Jewish people.</p>
   <p>A musical society called "Renino" has, therefore, been founded which, because of its aims, deserves the support and attention of the Jewish masses in general, and of the Jewish intelligentsia in particular. Renino seeks to publish and circulate among the Jewish masses the best Jewish musical compositions. The society will publish a series of compositions which will be sold at popular prices.</p>

   <p>Renino has already made an auspicious beginning, by issuing two compositions, one to Morris Rosenfeld's celebrated elegy, "The Gray Hair," and the other to Sholom Aleichem's "Sleep, My baby". Good music critics say that both songs are magnificent compositions, which truly reflect all the virtues of Yasinowsky's original talent.</p>
   <p>Renino, which has been organized to fill a great void in our cultural life, deserves the support of everyone who realizes how important the publishing and popularizing of real Jewish music is for the development of our culture.</p>
   <p>Do your daughters and sons play the piano? Then see to it that your musical library contains the publications of Renino.</p>
