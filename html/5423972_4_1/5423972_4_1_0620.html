   <p>All American citizens, who truly love America as the country of the future, as the most beautiful land of freedom, of equality and of opportunity for individual development, are grief-stricken to see how party politics and personal political interests attempt to take advantage of the present crisis to harm the entire country and to endanger peace. "Pinching the President" has become a pleasant pastime among Republican politicians, as well as among the President's opponents in the Democratic party itself, not forgetting the natural adversaries whom the President may have in huge numbers among the German Americans. All sorts of discreditable, and even tactical motives are attributed to his action concerning Germany and Mexico. All sorts of accusations of weakness are hurled at him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Roosevelt, for example, comes out with a statement that whatever the President may do, will amount to nothing, and whatever takes place in regard <span class="page-break">2</span>to the conflict with Germany will still show that the President did not act properly. Should Germany yield, President Wilson will be at fault for having wasted fourteen months. Should Germany not yield will be evidence that the considerate deliberation, which has been prolonged for so long, was unnecessary, and what the President is now doing, should have been done a year ago.</p>
   <p>And yet, when we read the documents which were interchanged in the dispute between Germany and the United States, we can see clearly that President Wilson has acted cautiously, patiently, justifiably, avoiding the danger of war as far as he possibly could. It seems that if Roosevelt were in the White House, he would not act differently if he did not wish to drag the United States into trouble without justification. True, Mr. Roosevelt desires to be president again, but for this reason alone, he should, as a patriot, be more careful with his criticism at the present critical moment, and should not "pinch" the President.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>More vicious is our Chicago Congressman, Mr. Mann." The President," said he, "only seeks to drag us into a war in order that it may help his campaign."</p>
   <p>We know that Mr. Mann is a Republican. But political rivalry should not go so far as to cast slanderous accusations at the Chief Executive in such times as these. What will they say in Germany and in other countries when they learn that a political leader, a member of Congress, accuses the President of being dishonest and insincere and of attempting to drag this country into a bloody war, or at least to isolate America from a great power in Europe, just to better his chances for a second term. And if Germany should believe what Congressman Mann says, she will not take President Wilson's notes seriously, assuming that Congress will not support the President.</p>
   <p>Bryan, confused, hastens to Washington to stave off war. This sounds ridiculous, nevertheless it means "pinching" the President. His [Bryan's] few <span class="page-break">4</span>adherents in Congress want to use this opportunity to popularize Bryan as the man of peace, and to attack President Wilson without justification.</p>
   <p>And who speaks of such a German patriot as Herr Vierek, editor of the Fatherland. He comes out openly accusing the President of collaborating with England. He says, "Wilson is highly in favor of war in order to help England. He called Congress in haste so that the people should have neither time to consider, or to express an opinion."He said he knows from reliable sources that regardless of what Germany may do,the President will sever diplomatic relationships with Germany on the first anniversary of the sinking of the Lusitania in order to make his action dramatic.</p>
   <p>So here it is! Mr. Roosevelt says that the President acts too slowly and Mr. Vierek says that he acted too hastily. Congressman Mann says that the President is a hypocrite. Bryan is dissatisfied with anything the President</p>
