   <p>One of the most vital problems to cope with in American life is the housing question, for nothing jeopardizes the welfare of the underpaid strata so much as unsanitary, obscure, and noxious tenement houses. This reduces the physical and spiritual status of the broad masses to a horrible plight, because the most essential requisite for a man to live normally is a home. The home is the foundation of our entire social life. If the homes of most citizens of America have been laid on poor foundations, it then follows that this will affect our social life.</p>
   <p>That is why the problem of better homes has encompassed all parts of the country, from the largest to the smallest cities and all civic leaders have become active in devising various plans to improve housing conditions.</p>
   <p>There is, however, one obstacle that makes this whole problem rather difficult. <span class="page-break">2</span>Aside from devising plans as how to construct better, more airy and comfortable houses, these houses should be accessible to the poorer classes of the people. This difficulty is not easy to overcome.</p>
   <p>This question therefore invites many diverse opinions. Some contend that every city administration ought to build model houses, which should be rented out at very reasonable rates to tenants. Those who uphold this opinion believe that just as the city has a Health Department, which enforces health regulations for the people, so should it also furnish the people with better dwelling places, because nearly all diseases come from the slum districts.</p>
   <p>The more poverty increases in large cities, the more abundant become the tenement houses. And it is well-known to all that sickness and mortality flourish cruelly in these tenement districts. It is therefore the duty of every city to consider the housing problem to the best advantage of the</p>

   <p>the cities where practical work was given serious thought both opinions were united.</p>
   <p>The chief obstacle the housing question encountered at the conference was that each delegate proposed a different plan as to how the houses should be built.</p>
   <p>Among us, in Chicago, a vigorous movement for better dwelling places has already been going on for past few years. In the beginning the matter was merely investigated and unveiled a sad situation in this city. The tenement houses are poorly constructed. The relationship between the landlords and the tenants is very unsympathetic, and this is why many learned professors and civic leaders the movement.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, however, their work is limited because, as the delegates themselves declared at the Cincinnati Conference, it would be much <span class="page-break">5</span>easier to make laws than to enforce them.</p>
   <p>In order for the housing question to have an intrinsic value, it is necessary that the people themselves demand better housing conditions. And if the people themselves would become conscious of the fact that they need better dwelling places, the reformers would devote less time to devising plans and more time to setting them in motion. The trouble is, however, that others worry over the masses' needs, while the masses themselves are dormant.</p>
