   <p>M. Ginsburg and Son, steamship ticket agents and private bankers on the West Side for the past fifteen years, went bankrupt last night. According to statements made by their friends, the Ginsburgs have, in the past two weeks, paid out about $50,000 to their depositors. This forced them to the wall, and after their futile attempt to raise money in order to make further payments to their depositors and proceed with their business, they locked their doors.</p>
   <p>The building on Twelfth Street near Desplaines Street, in which their bank is located, belongs to them. They are also the owners of a large building on Twelfth and Troy Streets, where the elder Ginsburg lives. An attempt to locate them, in order to get a statement from them, was unsuccessful. No one knows where the father and son are.</p>
   <p>The elder Ginsburg complained to his friends recently. He even told them that as a final move to save himself from financial collapse, he seat a telegram to a relative of his in New York, asking for a loan of $30,000. If this loan had been granted, it would have but him back on his feet, and he would have been able to withstand the crisis. His New York relative evidently refused to grant him this loan, and Ginsburg and his son were forced into bankruptcy.</p>
   <p>The bank was closed last night. Therefore, the extent of indebtedness is still unknown.</p>
   <p>States Attorney Hoyne sent his assistant, Alexander <span class="gap">[gap]</span> to investigate the case.</p>
