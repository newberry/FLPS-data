   <p>We West Side Jews could well follow in the foot-steps of our South Side sisters in the matter of creating beneficial institutions. We refer to the Deborah Club, organized to provide a place of recreation for children who otherwise find it convenient to stray in the streets and get into trouble.</p>
   <p>Today this boys' club is being opened. We hope other institutions of this kind will grow into our midst. We can well utilize them.</p>
