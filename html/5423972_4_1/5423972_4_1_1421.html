   <p>Mr. Sidney Mendel, who after having managed successfully for several decades, one of Chicago's greatest department stores, has decided now, in his advanced years, to retire from business and has placed his entire stock for sale at public auction.</p>
   <p>In quality, quantity and condition of the stock, this is the best and greatest auction sale that we have had the good fortune to attend for some time. Our buyers were present there and with spot cash made large purchases at their own prices.</p>
   <p>In addition to those purchases, we have added many lots of our regular stock which we bought months before when prices were low, and which will <span class="page-break">\2</span>be thrown into this sale with equal reduction.</p>
   <p>To be able to buy new merchandise which we have on hand now, at such astonishingly low prices, especially at the beginning of the season is a money-saving opportunity which no thoughtful person can neglect.</p>
   <p>Read every item which we list below--each one is a big saving for you. Examine the bargains in our window displays--try to come early, for there are many special bargains at this sale which will not last long. No mail, telephone, or C.O.D. orders will be accepted.</p>
   <p>Sale starts Monday, May 6.</p>
