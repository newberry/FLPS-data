   <p>Hermann and Minnie Wetzler, two Chicagoans who, some years ago excited no little interest by the great musical talent they displayed as children, gave a very successful concert in Frankfort-on-the-Main, prior to their departure for this country. The young lady, a pupil of Clara Schumann, has developed into a pianist who promises to make her mark in her chosen vocation, while her brother exhibits creative talent as a composer. One of the numbers on the program was a symphony, by Mr. Wetzler, that was received with expressions of marked approval.</p>
