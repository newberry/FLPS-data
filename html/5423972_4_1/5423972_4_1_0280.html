   <p>The United Committee of representatives of the Board of Education and of the City Council, which is investigating the alleged irregularities in the purchase of sites for the School Board, received yesterday a letter from Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, who offers an explanation on those deals in which certain Chicago newspapers implicated his name.</p>
   <p>In a preface, as it were, to his letter, the Congressman states that in spite of the article, "Sabath will explain the school entanglement," published in the Daily News of Feb. 20, he received no invitation to appear before the committee even though he had especially come from Washington for this purpose.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sabath states further that he has been in the real estate business since 1889, and that despite the many real estate deals that have passed through his hands in the course of these many years, his only real estate transaction <span class="page-break">\2</span>with the Board of Education was the sale of four lots ten years ago. Barring this deal, he has had no business dealings with the Board, neither as a seller nor as a broker.</p>
   <p>"This alone," says Mr. Sabath, "is sufficient to contradict any statement that I was personally interested in selling to the School Board real estate at fraudulent high prices, especially when such statements are based upon the alleged statements of a man who is now dead. And the man who made this charge was a person not only earmarked as a liar by a jury investigation, but also indicted for prejury.</p>
   <p>In connection with the deal made between Weisscopf and Ball and the Board of Education, on account of which his name was given publicity in the newspapers the Congressman made the following statement: "After Weisscopf and Ball had bought some lots on Lawndale Avenue, the School Board, without referring to me personally, began to negotiate with them with a view to purchasing the lots. The proprietors fixed the price at $100 per foot for <span class="page-break">\3</span>the center ground [of the lots], and $125 per foot for the front. The price was very reasonable, which can be seen by the fact that the School Board paid Mr. Cage for the adjourning lot $10 and $15 per foot more than what Weisscopf and Ball received. Upon closing the deal, the Weisscopfs (who are business partners of my brother) and Mr. Ball (who is my brother's brother-in-law), naturally, engaged me as the attorney to handle the legal end of this transaction. This was taken care of, in part, by the clerks in my office. Mr. Hoffman, a young lawyer of my firm, was intrusted with the collection of monies for the County Treasurer's Office. There was a mortage on this property. This, as well as other necessary expenses, had to be paid. I had then advanced my money, for which I was later reimbursed by them upon the acknowledgement of a treasurer's check. I was unformed to cash it and deduct whatever was due me, Such things are customery between lawyers and clients."</p>
   <p>Mr. Sabath also says that a similar ridiculous charge was made against him, before, only that in this earlier charge he appeared as trying to make profits in school lots for people who are his personal and political foes.</p>

   <p>After making it clear that the deal of Weisscopf and Ball was the only one in which he had any personal relations, the Congressman concluded thus:</p>
   <p>"The fact is that after reducing all taxes and other various expenses in connection with this transaction, Weisscopf and Ball made a comparatively small profit. The prices of real estate in that district, due to the car line on 16th Street and the huge construction enterprises there, have mounted incredibly in the past few years, and I am positive that the School Board can not procure any lots now in that district at the low price it bought from my clients. In order to prove the sincerity of my convictions in regard to the value of this property, I will, at any time in the course of one year, buy back the property on Lawndale Avenue from the School Board. But I will pay $90 per foot, which will give the School Board a profit of $2,750 or nearly 10% of the sum it paid.</p>
