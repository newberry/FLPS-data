   <p>Concerts were conducted every Sunday afternoon instead of every other Sunday as the year previous. Mr. Zukovsky was the musical director, assisted by seven members of the Thomas orchestra. 26 concerts were given with a total attendance of 11,561, against 12 concerts with a total attendance of 6,429 last year. The average attendance was 444. It is hardly necessary to say how much these concerts are appreciated by the public and what a great need it fills in our community. People come from practically every part of the city to listen to them.</p>
