   <p>The International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, which is carrying on a campaign to organize the Dressmakers in Chicago, will mark a great victory. Judge Cliff, of the Federal Court, announced, in the presence of the International Officers and Joint Board, that he modified Judge Carpenter's injunction, so that members of the Dressmakers Union will be permitted to speak to the unorganized workers and advise them to step into the Union, and they are permitted to agitate organization in Mitchel Bros. Shop, 367 W. Adams St. They are also permitted to speak to the workers in front of the shop and agitate in a peaceable manner. This designates a great victory in the struggle for free speech and for the right to organize labor.</p>
