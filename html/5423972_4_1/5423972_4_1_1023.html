   <p>No one doubts that the average Jewish woman is as highly developed intellectually and morally as is the average non-Jewish woman. Yet we do not understand why the concept of charity according to the modern fashion.</p>
   <p>When we say the Chicago women, we mean all the West Side women to the credit of our South Side sisters, as we are wont to call the German Jewish women. We must admit that the latter not only have a higher conception of charity than the average man or woman, but also turned it [charity] into a science, doing the most possible good in the best manner.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, this is not the case on the West Side.</p>
   <p>The various organizers and workers in the field of charity do not have in mind those who are in need, but merely have themselves in mind. We do not <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>mean to cast a shadow on the women who betake themselves to charity that they personally desire anything out of it financially; that they are mercenary. No and a thousand times no. We are sure that these good women will not use money designated for charity, not even "anything less than a penny", as the Hebraist expresses himself.</p>
   <p>Still they work for themselves and not for those who need help.</p>
   <p>The old-fashioned women to whom almsgiving is a religious commandment, for which they receive a portion in the future world or for which they are seated on a golden chair in the Garden of Eden, have in mind their future world and golden chair only. They devote themselves to charity in order to provide themselves with room and board after they reach one hundred years of age. The old-fashioned woman who depends upon her husband for her existence in this world does not wish to rely upon his uprightness for her standing in the other world. She fears that the husband's obligations cease <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>with this world and that he will neglect her in the future world and not even seat her at the table where the leviathan, Messianic bull, and Messianic wine [it is superstitiously believed by some Jews that food and a nectar have been preserved from the time of creation, the nectar to become the drink of the pious at the time of the Messianic salvation] will be served; that he will not want to have her near his side when sitting in the Garden of Eden with a crown on his head, enjoying the reflections of the holy spirit. Hence, she wishes to do some good deeds on her own account and therefore organizes charity and works hard to raise money. What is being done with the money is no concern of hers, because that is not her aim.</p>
   <p>To the modern woman, who does not have the future world in mind, the devotion to charity is connected with social pleasure. She makes a feast of the leviathan in this world. Charity is organized for the purpose of association, to become acquainted, have friendly chats, have luncheon <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>together, play games, hold discussions, in short, to spend a pleasant afternoon.</p>
   <p>Both classes of women exploit the solitude and misfortune of the lonely and unfortunate for their own pleasures whether they be in this world or the next. Among both categories of women charity is only a means and not an end. Neither of these classes will affiliate with the other, because such an affiliation would prevent their pleasures, notwithstanding the good it would do for those who need their help.</p>
   <p>As long as the West Side Jews have financed their charitable institutions in the old manner, i. e., every institution for itself regardless of what harm it may bring to other institutions, as long as competition existed between the orphan and the aged, between the sick and the dead, as long as one institution wanted to be built on the ruins of another, there was some sense in the form of woman charity. If clothes had to be made for orphans from the shrouds of the dead who should have been provided with funerals by the Gomlie Chesed Shel Emeth (society that provides the poor with <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>funerals), it was not amiss for having fed the hungry at the expense of a deliciously stuffed milt of the Messianic bull.</p>
   <p>Through the founding of the Federation, this competition was wiped out. Every Jewish Orthodox charitable institution is provided with everything it needs. The orphans, the widows, the aged, the sick, the hungry, and the dead receive everything that they are in need of, not only the most essential things as food and shelter, but also comforts for the aged, education for the youth, and honor for the dead. The Federation finances every institution not as it pleases, but as the respective officers of the respective institutions wish and, under such circumstances, with what right do the best of our women allow themselves to exploit orphans and widows, the aged and the sick so as to provide themselves with a portion of the leviathan in the other world and with entertainment in this world?</p>
   <p>When the idea of uniting the charitable institutions began to develop in the Jewish community of Chicago, the women should have been the first to help <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>the cause. But they did not do it. On the contrary, many auxiliaries of the various institutions, fearing that through the Federation they would lose the pretext of having the right to exist, have done everything possible to obstruct the work of the Federation. Others have gone so far as to employ against the Federation, the same methods they employed with their so-called competitors. They have been unable to obstruct the work of the Federation because no one can hinder the march of progress.</p>
   <p>The women can now see the good work that is being done by the centralization, and everyone ought to realize that what the men have done with the central organization can be done by the women with their auxiliaries. One large central organization of all the auxiliaries, in accordance with the plan and method of the Federation, will perhaps not bring a large portion of leviathan in the future world to all old-fashioned women nor will it make the social functions of modern women so pleasant, but it will do good for those whom the auxiliaries were organized for: those in need of help.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>We understand quite well that there are women who think that it would be an insult to them to join other women. Social limitations are more restricted with women than with men. However, you women must not forget that the auxiliaries were not organized for you, but rather for those who need help, and all the needy belong to one class. There are no boundaries where misfortune prevails.</p>
   <p>The Jewish women should know that, notwithstanding the good work that the Federation is doing, it is no more than mere material aid. The Federation supplies the money. According to its structure, the Federation does not have a heart. It is merely a treasury from which can be bought the necessaries of life for the needy. Apart from money, the orphan and the widow, the sick and the forsaken, are also in need of a word of comfort and no one save you, Jewish women, can utter this word. You can bring sunshine into a dark home. You know how to fondle an orphan so as to make his heart throb with joy; Jewish daughters, you can fill the hearts of the <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>aged with joy by your smiles; your presence amongst the sick can bring them more health than all the doctors and medicines combined, and when an unfortunate person dies the tears you shed on his grave are a more beautiful and better monument than the Federation can buy with money.</p>
   <p>Perhaps money is a big item in the hands of a man; perhaps a man's qualities can shine through dollars and cents. But a woman, a Jewish woman with all her treasures, a Jewish woman with her modesty, compassion, dignity, devotion, sincerity--when this woman clatters with coins, silver, or gold, it is the sound of chains which chills the body and freezes the heart--the heart of the Jewish woman, which is the source of virtue, of light, and of life.</p>
   <p>There is a great deal of work to be done. You Jewish women of Chicago are great enough to carry out that work. There are many unfortunates waiting for you to unite into one large organization.</p>
   <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>
   <p>Will you stop at the boundary line of the so-called social classes and remain there when the hands of the unfortunates, of thousands of unfortunates, are outstretched toward you? No, Jewish women, you will not do that. Duty calls you and we trust no one will shirk her duty.</p>
