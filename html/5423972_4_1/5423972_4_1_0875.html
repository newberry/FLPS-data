   <p>After considerable thought and careful investigation it was found a good plan to open on the grounds of the Institute, the first penny a glass milk station in Chicago, where pure pasteurized milk is and will be sold to mothers and children at the nominal price of one cent a glass during the hot Summer months. There are so many puny children that come on our grounds to whom such milk will no doubt prove a great service. Besides this, the sale of milk will tend to counteract the desire on the part of the children that come to us, to purchase from the filthy wagons that are stationed near the entrance of our grounds. These wagons sell cheap and much adulterated, and therefore very harmful, so-called ice cream and scraped ice balls, generally saturated with chemically colored flavors. This new departure has the warmest endorsement of the Infant Welfare Association and the Chicago Pure Milk Commission. It may be that if our experiment this year proves a success, we may be instrumental in having been responsible for the opening up of similar stations in other parts of the city. An intelligent woman is in charge of the station, who besides selling milk to mothers and children, acts as an adviser and indirectly <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>instructs mothers in the value of the use of pure milk for children at all times, but particularly during the hot season.</p>
   <p>Circulars are published in Yiddish and in English and distributed at the station. These circulars are addressed to the mothers and such information as the fact that one baby of every six dies as a result of dirty milk; that not a single case of tuberculosis has ever been traced to a certified milk farm; that no epidemic of scarlet fever, measles, diptheria, or sore throat has ever been traced to pure milk; that certified pure milk has a different taste from so-called commercial milk; that its taste is pure, and rich, and sweet; that it lacks the cow taste that so many find objectionable; that such milk is never over thirty-six hours old when it reaches the door of the consumer; that it is on ice from the time it leaves the cow until it reaches the consumer, etc., is contained in this circular.</p>
   <p>One need only watch the lack of care given the average infant in the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>congested districts of any large city because of the lack of knowledge that the mother has of the danger of not properly looking after the childrens feeding for the first two years of its life, to see the enormous amount of good (if from no other point of view than this alone) our milk station is bound to do.</p>
   <p>The cost of this milk station will be comparitively very small and so far as the sale of milk is concerned, the penny per glass will pay for the actual cost of the milk. But again, in this instance, we should not be concerned so much about the cost of conducting the work when we realize the enormous amount of good that will be the result of our milk sales.</p>
