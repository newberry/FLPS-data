   <p>The South Town Republican Convention has unanimously nominated Simon W. Straus for assessor. Mr. Straus is very well known, especially in the Jewish community. He is a young man, whose business training as a banker and real-estate dealer, qualifies him to discharge the duties of that office in an able manner. He has pledged himself to so conduct his office, if elected, that his administration will be a credit to himself, the city and especially to the Jewish community.</p>
   <p>Mr. Straus is the eldest son of the late F. W. Straus. He was a member of the banking firm of Cahn and Straus, and of recent years, senior member of the mortgage bankers, S. W. Straus and Co. He is a member of the Sinai Congregation and the Standard Club.</p>
