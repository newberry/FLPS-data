   <p>In the Lawndale District, many societies of property holders have been organized whose purpose is to keep the district clean and in good order. This movement began with the founding of the Millard Avenue Improvement Association by Attorney Samuel Micon, Mr. Samuel Moltz, president of the 16th Street State Bank, and Mr. Louis Spiegel.</p>
   <p>The above-mentioned association has ninety members, and besides property holders from 16th Street to Ogden Avenue, it also includes tenants.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the activity of this Association, Millard Avenue is in an excellent condition, from the standpoint of cleanliness and care. The price of property has, therefore, gone up on Millard Avenue.</p>
