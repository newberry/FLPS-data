   <p>One old friend and honorable rabbi from the Kehilath Anshe Maariv, Dr. Tovih Shoenfarber, is very much pained because certain Republicans founded, before the election, a new Hebrew Republican Club, which sent letters to many Jewish voters, recommending various Republican candidates to the Jewish public. He particularly feels badly, because among the directors of the Republican club there are a State Senator, a Recorder, an Alderman, a Clerk of the Criminal Court, an Assistant State's Attorney, and so forth.</p>
   <p>The doctor had expressed his indignation after the election. Our sympathy is entirely with him. As he has expressed himself inthe last issue of the Chicago Israelite, there is no such thing as a Jewish vote, that a Hebrew Republican or Democratic club is committing a crime against the Kneses Israel.</p>
   <p>We want to say to Dr. Shoenfarber, that denying the existence of any certain thing does not destroy the essence of it. If the rabbi waited until after election to attack the club, he then should have watched the election returns, and would be compelled to admit that there is such a thing as a Jewish vote.</p>

   <p>In the last election, a Jew was placed as Recorder on the Republican ticket. On the Democratic ticket, a Jew ran for judge of the Municipal Court. Both candidates drew a large majority of vote, regardless oftheir party affiliations. The non-Jewish voters were also in favor of these two candidates and this majority held good not only among the orthodox Jews, but the Reformed as well.</p>
   <p>After studying the returns, one must admit that there is such a thing as a Jewish vote, whether one likes it or not, and those who aspire to a public office, must take this into consideration.</p>
   <p>A candidate, who desires to be elected, must watch the election returns, not the Chicago Israelite, or the theoretic philosophy of a rabbi. He should know that a man who was elected or appointed for office, has a definite influence upon those who elected him, and he is, therefore, seeking the endorsement of the State's Attorney, Recorder, Alderman, Clerk of the Criminal Court and the Assistant State's Attorney, in order that they unite in a recommendation.</p>

   <p>This idea is proven by the many offices held by Jewish people. They are rewarded for political activity, and whatever their reward might be in Heaven, we do see their reward on Earth.</p>
