   <p>Famous Rabbi Declares that He is only Against Czarist Russia for Persecuting the Jews; Is in Accord with President Wilson</p>
   <p>A sensation was created yesterday by the news that the members of Sinai Temple are collecting signatures for a petition, demanding the resignation of the celebrated rabbi, Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, as spiritual leader, accusing him of being pro-German before America's entrance into the war, and declaring that he has done hardly anything to support the Government.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch admitted yesterday that he had heard about the petition; at the same time he strongly defended his Americanism, declaring the next Sunday he will give his answer from the pulpit of Sinai Temple to the accusations made against him. He issued the following statement:</p>
   <p>"Many young people of good character, who are also good Americans, do not <span class="page-break">2</span>approve of my limited public activities in behalf of the Government.</p>
   <p>"I am a native of Luxembourg and was reared in Germany. I have nine maternal relatives who are serving in the German Army, three in the British Army and three in the French Army.</p>
   <p>"I was a pacifist, but am now as much of a pacifist as President Wilson. The President's views are the same as mine and I heartily agree with every note which the President has written.</p>
   <p>"The trouble began several weeks ago, when I received a letter from the State Council for Defense which had the following conclusion:</p>
   <p>'It is therefore imperative that all loyal citizens and organizations celebrate the anniversary of America's entrance into the war for the preservation of Christian Civilization.'</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>"I read this letter before the congregation at Sinai Temple, and stated that the members of the State Council for Defense had erred unknowingly in using the word 'Christian' in a letter to a Jewish congregation.</p>
   <p>"Many persons took this opportunity to misinterpret my statement, inferring that I am against America's entrance into the war. But there cannot be the slightest doubt as to my earnest patriotism. Last Sunday I spoke in behalf of the Third Liberty Loan at the Temple, which brought in subscriptions of $31,000 for Liberty Bonds. I personally bought bonds of that loan, and have contributed to various war funds.</p>
   <p>"Sunday from the pulpit I shall make a public statement to the Congregation, without any prejudice or partisanship, and state my views. When I have finished, I am certain there will be no question as to my loyalty.</p>
   <p>"I am a Jew. The Jewish people have suffered terribly at the hands of the Romanovs in Russia, and how could my stand be other than against Russia.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The overthrow of the Romanov dynasty realized my hopes, and since then I have devoted my entire energy against the autocratic power of Germany."</p>
   <p>In conclusion Dr. Hirsch said that in all his prayers he beseeches God for a just and honorable peace. He also gave the blessing of "Hanotan Teshuah" (a prayer for the head of a state) for the President. He further stated that he had a weak heart which has prevented him from speaking lately at patriotic meetings, or in support of the war.</p>
   <p>Moses E. Greenbaum, President of Sinai Temple, declared that a majority of the members have the fullest confidence in Dr. Hirsch, and that he is trying to discover the identity of the persons circulating the petition.</p>
