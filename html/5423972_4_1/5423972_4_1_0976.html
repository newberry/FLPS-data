   <p>Abraham Lincoln was the Moses of the Negroes, whom he liberated from bondage in the American Egypt.</p>
   <p>His struggle for the Unity of the United States is important, only insofar as it helped abolish slavery and to establish a more progressive system.</p>
   <p>He came thousands of years later than the Jewish Moses, and, also, he did not raise the others demands for a sacred life and for social justice. He also appears small in comparison to such a great, spiritual figure as, Karl Marx, who introduced the prophecy of his ancient race and called the entire exploited mankind to freedom.</p>
   
   <p>Yet Abraham Lincoln occupies the most prominent place in the history of the United States. We must not forget that he lived in a country, which stood, and at present, still stands at a low degree of spiritual development in the struggle for freedom. It is a land of crisscrossed branches of foreign-culture trees, that have developed into wild capitalistic thorns.</p>
   <p>In no other country in the world is there such a fresh, arrogant bourgeois type as in America. The American Capitalist does not posses any historical traditions that should cause him to intermingle, at intervals, with the poor and exploited masses, upon whose account he becomes wealthy. To the American trust magnate, or manufactures, there is no difference between slaves.</p>
   
   <p>American, or foreigner, or colored, European, or Asiatic, all are estimated, by him, according to the amount of money that he can expropriate from their work.</p>
   <p>The "Nationalism," that the Chicago Tribune and similar capitalistic organs preach, is only aimed at the wage slave and the working masses so that they should be satisfied with how much their bosses throw to them. They should suffer destitution and want and not protest against their rich brothers.</p>
   <p>In such capitalistic, brutal despotism, such an unusual act as Abraham Lincoln's is unforgettable and he is worthy of the recognition, which he receives from the working class.</p>
   
   <p>The workers, however, must remember that had it not been for Karl Marx and the radical workers of England, Lincoln would have lost the struggle. The English Capitalists would have carried their demand to assist the slave holders of the South, as they have helped the opium-sellers of China.</p>
   <p>The vigorous warnings of Karl Marx, to the radical organized workers of England, was effective. The English working masses raised such a powerful protest against the imperialistic aims of their Capitalist Government, that the latter did not dare to stand openly against Lincoln.</p>
   <p>Abraham Lincoln triumphed, thanks to the appearance of Karl Marx with his philosophy of social justice and international solidarity. Lincoln understood this, and it would have affected his labor laws, had he not fallen a victim of the slave-holders revenge.</p>
   
   <p>Still Lincoln Day will not be celebrated in such a manner of which the emancipator is worthy. The dead Lincoln is unable to speak and the living persons, who represent him, are often the greatest enemies of the philosophy of freedom.</p>
   <p>Abraham Lincoln, loved freedom; he was very sincere in his desire to establish a government of the people, for the people, and by the people. A murderous hand prematurely cut off his life. He did not live to realize his ideals for his American Republic. He did not accomplish his aim. The graves of Gettysburg cannot prevent the great American republic from retreading the bloody road of that time.</p>
   <p>Although his heart was good, and the little that he achieved, enables him to stand among those, great spiritualists, who have sacrificed their lives. Truth and Justice, Freedom and Righteousness.</p>
