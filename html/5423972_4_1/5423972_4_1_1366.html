   <p>In Chicago, the largest Jewish community in the Middle West, a new, modern mazoth factory has been established. It is planned to be the largest and finest mazoth factory in the world. The factory gives the impression of an industrial plant, which is the last word in technical and engineering science, and is certainly an ornament to American Jewry. It is, at the same time, a credit to the industrial development or the American Jews.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the new enterprise have, apparently, spared no work, effort, time, or money to make the new mazoth factory, called the "Redelheim Matzo Company," a model institution in the best sense of the word. The last word in technical science has been applied in the new mazoth factory.</p>
   <p>Not only the Jewish community of Chicago, but also the other Jewish communities of America will have good ground to be proud of the new Orthodox institution.</p>

   <p>The building, where the new Chicago mazoth factory is housed, is located at 2109-2111 West Roosevelt Road, in the very heart of the Jewish district in Chicago. The building is five stories high and makes a very fine impression.</p>
   <p>The first impression received from the factory, when one glances at its interior, is one of cleanliness, system, and liberal management. The oven, which is operated by a gas motor in the factory itself, is an Improved Patent Rolling [Oven], the best to be had in America for this purpose, and, consequently, the best to be had in the world. From the smallest bolt to the largest motor, the construction is the last word in engineering art. The construction of the machine is so artistic that the mazoth that come out from the oven are perfect; it is a pleasure to look at them.</p>
   <p>The entire process of baking the mazoth....is the work of a high quality modern machine. The mazoth are packed by machine, and are not touched by human hands. The machine is exact, and absolutely clean. The sealing machine packs the <span class="page-break">\3</span>mazoth into five- and ten-pound packages.</p>
   <p>The by-products, like mazoth flour, mazoth crumbs, mazoth cakes, etc., are placed in pasteboard boxes of various sizes, and packed in thirty-pound packages in order to protect them from dampness dust, and other elements, and to permit them to reach the purchaser in perfect condition.</p>
   <p>It is understood that the Redelheim Matzo Company also produces extra thin mazoth, which are packed so well that they reach the buyer in excellent condition.</p>
   <p>The whole arrangement of the factory is very modern, and the Redelheim Matzo Company has also established a new method to protect the kashruth of the flour, so that even the most particular Jews need not worry. The task of the Redelheim Matzo Company does not begin merely with baking the mazoth; the company supervises the harvesting of the wheat and its grinding at the mills, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and in this way, the Redelheim Matzo Company is in a position to produce mazoth for even the most particular Jews.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Redelheim, who is a member of the Union of Orthodox Rabbis of America and Canada, and has a national reputation as a scholarly, God-fearing, and intellectual person, a man who has wide experience in the field of mazoth production, is devoting all of his attention to the new mazoth factory. Rabbi Redelheim deserves a lot of credit for enabling the Jewish home in America to observe kashruth during Passover; his accomplishments in this field are historic ones. Since there is no one else manufacturing mazoth, Rabbi Redelheim's name is the best guaranty that the new mazoth factory will produce absolutely kosher, clean, and tasty mazoth, which will satisfy every religious Jew.</p>
   <p>Mr. M. Perlstein, a member of the firm, is a well-known scholar and intellectual in Chicago. He is a well-informed person and a civic leader. All the Orthodox <span class="page-break">\5</span>Jews of Chicago know, respect, and admire Mr. Perlstein, and he enjoys everybody's confidence as a Jew and as a businessman.</p>
   <p>Mr. Meyer Teitlebaum is one of the most distinguished laymen in the city, a God-fearing person, and the head of a home whose doors are open to everyone. Mr. Teitlebaum is a man who is respected by everyone who comes in contact with him. He has a splendid reputation.</p>
   <p>Kashruth in the factory is managed and guarded by inspectors, who are honest and God-fearing Jews, under the direction of the Chicago rabbinate, and under the supervision of Rabbi Redelheim, who is known throughout America as the manufacturer of strictly kosher food for Passover. As a businessman, his connection with the new enterprise is a guaranty that it will be solid and honest in every respect.</p>
   <p>Mr. Max Abel has been in the mazoth business since his early youth, and has <span class="page-break">\6</span>helped the mazoth industry in America to become established and to reach its present position. He is known to the Jews of Chicago as an honest businessman, whose word can be depended upon, as an Orthodox Jew, and as a man of integrity.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gordon, another member of the firm, a quiet and tranquil businessman, enjoys an excellent reputation in the business world, and is known for his honesty and sincerity as a man and as a Jew.</p>
   <p>The new mazoth company of Chicago is made up of a group of Jewish men who are respected and esteemed as men and as Jews, and who enjoy the confidence of the community. They will not spare any effort to provide Chicago and its vicinity with kosher mazoth for Passover. Every purchaser will be satisfied because the mazoth will be strictly kosher, clean, well baked, and tasty.</p>
