   <p>The tens of thousands of members of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of Chicago and the whole organized labor-movement will be happy to hear that July 1st the first Amalgamated Bank will open its doors.</p>
   <p>All preparations are being made, shares are being sold, and the building will soon be ready for the opening as a bank for the Amalgamated.</p>
   <p>Mr. L.R. Radifer, the official banker who will have full charge of the business, can be found in Room 1 of the Amalgamated Headquarters, 402 S. Halsted Street, every day from 3 to 6 PM. He will supply all information concerning the bank.</p>
   <p>Mr. Radifer informs all the members of the Amalgamated who have subscribed for shares, to have one share paid up before June 10th, because many members want to buy shares but cannot receive any until those who purchased will pay for them in full.</p>
