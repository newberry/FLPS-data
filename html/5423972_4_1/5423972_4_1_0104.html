   <p>The City Council of Chicago has adopted a resolution condemning the Turkish atrocities against the Greeks and Armenians in Asia Minor, and asking the American government to take "effective means" to avoid any similar incidents.</p>
   <p>It is always proper to protest against the wild, barbaric cruelties inflicted by one nation upon another, by the followers of one religion upon the followers of another religion. The Chicago City Council has acted nobly when it permitted its voice to be heard in condemnation of such cruel atrocities. However, the resolution is somewhat one-sided. If the Turks have committed atrocities against the Christians in Asia Minor, then the Greeks are guilty of terrible blood baths against the Mohammedan population that fell into their hands, but the resolution does not mention this at all.</p>
   <p>The resolution condemns only the atrocities committed by the Turks, instead of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>condemning atrocities, irregardless of who commits them. Has not the Chicago City Council heard about the atrocities committed by the Greeks in Smyrna, Izmit, and other places in Asia Minor? Should Christian murderers be held less guilty than Mohammedan murderers?</p>
