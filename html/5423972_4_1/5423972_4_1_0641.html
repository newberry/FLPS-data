   <p>The average newspaper reader has no idea what a violent role the press plays in the war.</p>
   <p>It never enters the minds of the people that some of the telegrams and articles that they read in their papers may cause a strategic advance on the battlefield, victory or defeat. Really experienced journalists and the better class of war correspondents have a sense of what is behind an interview, a bulletin or a cable that comes from the war.</p>
   
   <p>It is a well known fact in military circles that every military headquarters has a staff of reporters who take orders and wire the press just such news as the military powers find necessary to submit to the public, and at the same time they analyze every bit of news regarding the enemy, the war, or the finances of the country.</p>
   <p>In many instances we can point out to the readers the remarkable news spread throughout the world. Almost at the beginning of the war, when the Germans were continually advancing towards France, the French army was continually going backwards, and the English were not even prepared for war, an article appeared in the New York Times - a cable from a special correspondent - that an army of Russian soldiers had been shipped through Scotland and England in closed coach cars, and thence by boat to France. The soldiers were brought from Siberia and Archangel in English transport ships. That started a careful deliberation in the newspapers as to whether or not this was true. Hundreds of people claimed they had witnessed the landing of the transport ships with the soldiers, and that no one was permitted to go close to the shore to see them, and that the coaches of the long train moved along with curtains drawn on the windows. These statements were so clear that many people believed them to be true. But it was remarkable that this news first appeared in the American newspapers, written by a special correspondent. In that case the press was employed to make the Germans feel afraid. The Germans very likely did not believe it but the questionable doubt remained - "Maybe it is true." It was said that this news had an effect upon the march of the Pon Klux army on the Paris front.</p>
   
   <p>Here, a short while back, rumors were spread that Germany is offering to make peace with France and Russia; that German representatives were in Russia and in Switzerland, where they met with French representatives. The German newspapers were at that time constantly praising the French saying that they are courageous, heroic, etc. At the same time they claimed that Germany bears no grudge against the French. Russia also was very highly praised by the German press. Suddenly the entire situation changed. The Germans could not find sufficiently vile or profane words, now, in their language, to assail the French and the Russians.</p>
   <p>This sudden change took place immediately after France and Russia answered "no" to the peace proposal. Mr. Fredrik Palmer, a very reliable correspondent, assures us that Germany was prepared to return Alsace Lorraine to France for a separate peace offer. This also substantiates a second rumor that Count Vitte was in Germany to transact peace terms, and was probably murdered when he turned back to Russia, by the main clique that did not want peace.</p>
   <p>It is also worth while to take notice of how such high Generals and Admirals as Von Tirpitz, Hindenburg, and others permitted themselves to be interviewed and speak out their minds to the world. Such are the sources from which messages from the battlefield are anounced by wire to the great public, often to let out rumors in their own country (Germany), but mostly to tell the enemy the things they want them to know.</p>
   <p>With this fact facing them, that the press cannot obtain news from the battlefield unless it is released to them, the readers will have a much different opinion and idea of the war.</p>
