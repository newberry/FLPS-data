   <p>It is a maxim that most of our Jews doubt that a Jew can adapt himself to farming. Yet our society, the Jewish Agricultural Aid Society, in the past twenty-five years, has found that it is not a question of nationality, but of individuality. This means that it depends upon the person who seeks to become a farmer, and not upon the national group to which he belongs.</p>
   <p>The best way to find out definitely whether the Jew can or really wants to become a farmer, is to determine whether he is willing to work as an apprentice on someone else's farm in order to gain the necessary experience.</p>
   <p>For the last eight years our society has maintained a Farm Labor Bureau, and has sent approximately 6,000 men on farms. Most of them have given satisfactory service to their employers. We filled 1,200 positions last year. This proves, without the slightest doubt that the Jewish young men can adapt themselves to farm life if they really want to.</p>

   <p>We have today in our office hundreds of good-paying jobs suitable for experienced as well as inexperienced men. Any young man who wants to settle on a farm, should take advantage of this opportunity and find out whether or not he possesses the necessary qualifications. To buy a farm without having any experience or without being acquainted with the American methods of farming is both a waste of money and a dangerous undertaking.</p>
   <p>"Preparedness" is at present a slogan in America. The Jews should prepare now to become farmers. Agriculture is the foundation of every nation. The Jewish people cannot hope to become an independent nation until they train a good many farmers from among their own people.</p>
