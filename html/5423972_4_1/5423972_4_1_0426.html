   <p>Chicago is responsible for eighty-five million dollars as her quota on the $189,225.000 of the Victory Liberty Loan.</p>
   <p>The failure of the loan would mean that the people of the United States have for the first time in their history cast aside their debts.</p>
   <p>Such a situation would not only lead to National disrepute, but would also hinder all the business of the land.</p>
   <p>This is your land and your country. You must not fail to do your duty in this crisis.</p>
   
   <p>I appeal to you, in the name of our National honor, as well as in the name of our brave men who died for us on the battlefields of France, to make this a 'Plus' subscription. It makes little difference how big your subscriptions were previously. We must have another. A 'Plus' subscription!"</p>
   <p>Tsh. W. Folds, Chairman Chicago Liberty Loan.</p>
