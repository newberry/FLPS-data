   <p>Gentlemen: Please allow me to say a few words in your newspaper to Chicago Jews. I am not a politician. I do not mix in politics, but when a Jew runs for office I work for his election with my heart and soul, if I am convinced that he will be a credit to our people. I don't care what ticket he is running on, or whether he knows me or not.</p>
   <p>I behaved this way when Judge [Harry] Fisher was running for election on the Democratic ticket, although I am a Republican. I spoke in my office to businessmen, Gentile and Jews. I spoke at the lodges where I am a member. Everywhere, I urged everybody to vote for Judge Fisher. I am proud of Jews such as Harry Fisher, Hugo Pam, Julian Mack, Brandeis, and so on.</p>
   <p>At the present time, a young man from the ghetto, one who was born on the West Side, is running for representative from the Nineteenth Senatorial District. I want to tell the Chicago Jews what I know of Harry Weisbrod, a young man of twenty-seven. I have lived with his parents for six years on Douglas Boulevard.</p>
   <p>When Harry Weisbrod graduated from high school, he worked during the day and at night went to college. When he graduated from law school in 1917 he opened a law office. He soon enjoyed a successful practice because he was honest. He enlisted when American entered the war. When I asked him "Harry, why don't you wait until you are drafted?", he replied: "America is my country and the Jews are my people. I would sacrifice my life for either of them. With my body and soul I want to prove that we Jews are not cowards. We can thus repay the country where we are treated the same as everybody else and there is no discrimination."</p>
   <p>He chose the most dangerous branch of service in the army, the branch where one was in danger every moment. The son of our beloved ex-President Roosevelt chose the same branch of service and paid with his life. Harry chose the aviation service. While in the service he was dangerously.</p>
   
   <p>wounded, and up to a few months ago he still suffered from his wounds. He was forced to seek the help of the famous surgeons, the Mayo brothers, in Rochester, Minnesota. They operated on him. When he came back, after the operation, I asked him: "What are you doing?"</p>
   <p>He replied, showing me the big cut on his body: "This is my medal. If somebody says that we Jews are cowards I can prove to him that he is a damned liar."</p>
   <p>It is the duty of every Chicago Jew, man or woman, Republican or Democrat, to vote in the primary election on April eleventh, and to vote for Mr. Weisbrod. I am confident that the young attorney, Harry Weisbrod, will bring honor to us and that he will know how to represent the Jews who send him to Springfield. I ask the members of the Order Brith Sholem to give him their votes, although I do not want the Order to mix into politics. I am convinced that the Jews, in general, and the members of the Order Brith Sholem in particular, will feel gratified to have Mr. Weisbrod in Springfield as a State Representative. Mr. Weisbrod is a member of the Ahauath Achim, Chicago Lodge of the Independent Order Brith Sholem.</p>
