   <p>Ever since our country has entered into the great war struggle for democracy, over 60,000 Jewish young men between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-one are in active service.</p>
   <p>The soldier's life, at best, is a hardship. It has been felt by all who possess a social vision, that in order to safeguard the morale of the future, to assure the homes that the boys come from that when they return they will be able to fall in their proper places in the home, as well as in their business and social environment, with a minimum of effect as a result of their soldier life, proper and wholesome recreational and social facilities must be supplied them.</p>
   <p>With that end in view, the Young Men's Christian Association have made a <span class="page-break">\2</span>call upon the citizenry of this country to contribute funds for the purpose of conducting such work on a large scale, with the result that over $50,000,000 has already been contributed. The Catholics, too, have been making a big drive for funds to look after their boys similarly. The Salvation Army has called upon the citizens at home to contribute liberally for work along the same lines. And last, but not least, in order that 60,000 Jewish boys who are now in service, and when the next draft is called, the possibility of an additional 100,000 - may be given the proper recreational care during their spare hours when off duty, the Young Men's Hebrew and kindred associations of America, and the American Soldier's and Sailor's Welfare League of the Independent Order B'nai B'rith, have called upon the Jews of this country to contribute. Many of the Institute boys from the various departments are now doing active service at the Great Lakes, at Camp Grant, and a few of them in order cantonments. And so, in the spirit <span class="page-break">\3</span>of service, the Chicago Hebrew Institute War Service Club, consisting approximately of one hundred and fifty young women, have banded themselves together with the object of being of service to the soldiers or sailors who before their enlistment or conscription were identified in one form or another with the Institute. In many of the homes that these boys came from, no one in the family reads or writes English. On the other hand, the soldiers or sailors are not able to read or write the Yiddish - with the tragic possibility of both, families hearing very little from the son, and the son having next to no word from his home. The result of this condition might be the creating of a chasm between the parent and child which will make it very hard, ultimately, to overcome. The members of the War Service Club, recognizing this serious condition, contemplate acting as a medium between the boy and his home, corresponding with him, visiting his home, writing to him for his mother and reading the letters to the mother that come from him.</p>

   <p>The Club meets every Tuesday evening during which time the members knit, sew, and are occupied very industriously making such articles as will tend to comfort the soldier or sailor that has been assigned to them. Each member has signed for only one soldier or sailor.</p>
