   <p>The concert by several of Chicago's talented juvenile performers at the Central Music Hall, last Friday evening, was a success. Miss Gussie Cutlow has great talent as a pianist and fully met the expectations of the audience. Her performance of Beethoven's Sonata in C. Major, Op. 53, was greeted with great applause. Master Leon Marx won a recall for his expressive interpretation of Mendelssohn's Concerto in E. Minor. Ernest Wagner, the young flutist, who made his first appearance before a Chicago audience, is a remarkable player.</p>
