   <p>The Bezalel exhibit opens today at eleven o'clock in Sinai Center, where it will remain open until Friday afternoon. The exhibit will be closed Friday night and Saturday. It will be reopened Sunday morning in the Douglas Auditorium, where the Jewish public shall have the opportunity to see until Tuesday evening the Jewish art work of the Bezalel School.</p>
   <p>Professor Borris Shatz, founder of the Bezalel School and director of the exhibit, arrived in Chicago yesterday. He was greeted at the station by a group of prominent persons who directed him to the Sherman Hotel, where he will reside during his stay in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Today for the first time in the history of Chicago Jewry, every Jew, rich or poor, aristocrat or orthodox, will be able to witness a <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>bona fide Jewish art exhibit, in which Jewish art work, created in the Bezalel Art School by Jewish artists, will be displayed.</p>
   <p>Since the historical Bezalel, who created Jewish art in the form of a tabernacle in the times of the Jewish nation, the Jews have not yet produced any specific Jewish art. The Jewish artists of Diaspora produce general art work for the world, but the modern Bazalel, Prof. Borris Shatz, has created, through his great talent and tremedous energy, art along the lines of the historical Bezalel.</p>
   <p>A visit to the exhibit will enlighten every Jew with the progress that the Bezalel School has made in this field. Then artists have contributed their share; it is now up to the Jewish public, to do this in order to preserve, uphold, and develop this field. This can be <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>done if every Jew purchase for his home an article from the Bezalel School.</p>
