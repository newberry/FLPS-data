   <p>There is a tradition in American politics that a Catholic cannot be president of the United States.</p>
   <p>This is an unwritten tradition. In reality it is a tradition which stands in opposition, not only in an unwritten form but also in spirit, to the American Constitution, wherein religious freedom is one of the fundamental principles. Every one interested in American politics knows that the question of religion is a factor of utmost importance when it comes to nominating a candidate for president. Some even believe it more proper to nominate a Jew for president of the United States than a Catholic. Well, we have a right to doubt the justification of this belief, that a Jew would be more favorable for the American Protestants than a Catholic. In other words, they wish to express the feeling that if it is impossible for a Jew to be president of the United States, it is even more so for a Catholic.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Regardless of the discussion, we'd rather sidetrack the question as to the possibility of a Jew's being elected president. This question has, until this day, not been put on the agenda. One thing we do know, that when Woodrow Wilson appointed Louis D. Brandeis a member of the highest court in the country, the Supreme Court, he was the first Jew in America to attain such high honor and to triumph over an opponent in a strong combat. The Jewish descent of Brandeis played a very important role. And, if in America there exists the tradition that a Catholic cannot become president of the United States, the possibility of a Jew's ever becoming president is not even thought of.</p>
   <p>The question of the possibility of a Catholic to become president is now prominently appearing in the forefront of American politics. It is chiefly concerned with Al Smith, the present Governor of New York.</p>
   <p>Immediately after Al Smith was elected Governor of New York for the last time, discussions were started in reference to the possibility of his being a presidential candidate of the Democratic party. Smith, at his last election, received an overwhelming majority which exceeded the <span class="page-break">\3</span>highest optimistic expectations of his friends. The New York elections evinced that Smith is very popular and that he can win the city of New York in the presidential election, and a Democratic presidential candidate who can win New York has a chance to be elected. It is therefore natural that his friends began to talk about the future president of the United States, but the moment Smith's name was mentioned as a candidate for the presidency, it immediately brought to light the fact that he is a Catholic and that it is against American tradition for a Catholic to be president.</p>
   <p>The presidential election was approaching and there was not much time left for the leaders of the Democratic party to decide who the Democratic candidate should be. Many prominent names the Democratic party did not have on their list. A few months ago the Democrats had a prominent name, McAdoo, who stood the best chance to be nominated. But due to the oil scandal his name was also polluted and his candidacy became very doubtful, thus giving Al Smith's friends a better opportunity to spread his candidacy. They even went so far as to enter Smith's name in the primary election in Wisconsin.</p>
   <p>The results of the Wisconsin primary election brought great joy to Smith's <span class="page-break">\4</span>friends. On the Democratic ballot, both, McAdoo and Smith opposed each other, and Smith came out the victor, This proves that Smith is popular not only among the Democrats in New York but also in Wisconsin and throughout the middle-west. Smith's friends, therefore, assert that there is no better nor more popular candidate for president than he for the Democratic party. Here the question arises, what can be done about Smith's Catholicism?</p>
   <p>Smith's friends say that once and for all the tradition that a Catholic cannot be president of the United States must be broken, and they believe that Al Smith, with his great popularity, can break this tradition.</p>
   <p>But this assurance was had only by Smith's friends, who wanted to see him elected under any circumstances. But there are many in the Democratic party who are not so enthused about Smith, not only because he is too progressive for them, but also because he is a Catholic.</p>
   <p>And even those Democratic leaders not opposed in general to his candidacy are much in doubt if Smith really is the candidate through whom they can win the election.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The Democratic party believes that political conditions at present are very much in their favor. The oil scandal created a possibility for the Democratic party to beat the Republican party in the presidential election, but to accomplish this the Democratic party must have the best suited candidate. And the question is whether Smith, the Catholic, is the suitable candidate.</p>
   <p>The main fortress of the Democratic party is the "solid South," but the "solid South" is also the main fortress of the Ku-Klux-Klan.</p>
   <p>The Klan is an enemy of the Jews, Negros, and Catholics, and how great the hatred of the Klan is toward the Catholics is easily seen. In the Atlantic City election the Klan has determined to support a Jewish candidate rather than a Catholic.</p>
   <p>Smith's friends claim the power of the Klan is far from being as great and strong as it is believed. The harm that the Klan may cause to Smith, will be more than compensated by the advantage which can be gained among the Catholics in America.</p>
   <p>To date there are over 18 million Catholics in America, of which number <span class="page-break">\6</span>you can figure four million grownups that are eligible to vote. Those Catholics will surely vote for Smith if the Klan should oppose him.</p>
   <p>It is not our aim to figure out the chances Al Smith stands to be nominated candidate for president by the Democratic party. Our intention here is only to show the role the question of religion plays in American politics. You should think that, according to the Constitution, all religions have equal rights.</p>
   <p>America has a free Constitution but it lacks men willing to accept its principles in their entirety.</p>
