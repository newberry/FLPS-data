   <p>After eight days of arduous work, the Democratic National Convention finally nominated Prof. Woodrow Wilson as the Democratic candidate for president of the United States.</p>
   <p>Woodrow Wilson is an old candidate for the presidential office, since he was elected as Governor by the Republican state, New Jersey. He was considered as "Presidential Timber", but he was never looked upon as the highest sort of candidate. He was always one of the sort that could do in time of need.</p>

He could neither be exposed by the conservatives nor the progressives, and it is therefore, very easy to unite with him.</p>

   <p>From the Jewish standpoint Woodrow Wilson is a relentless chauvinist, a strong opponent of immigration, believes that America was created for the nobility whose great, great grandparents came to America hundreds of years ago, hates the "foreigners" who come here to confiscate the country from the "people", and is the opposite of the noble, calm, good hearted, true Democratic William Howard Taft. Wilson will not be able to contend with the problems of, at least, the Jews and other nationalities.</p>
