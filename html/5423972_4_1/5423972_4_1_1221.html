   <p>Next Tuesday, April 13th, Judicial Primaries will be held. Among the aspirants who run for nomination on the Democratic ticket, for the Circuit Court are Judge Julian Mack, candidate for re-nomination, who is being supported by the Democratic leaders, and Attorney Joseph Sabbath, a brother of Congressman Sabbath, of the 5th District of Illinois.</p>
   <p>Judge Mack, for nearly six years on the bench, has an enviable record as being one of the best Judges in the county. Besides that, he has made himself renowned as a big philanthropist and public leader.</p>
   <p>He certainly deserves that all Jews who are going to vote in the Democratic primaries, should vote for him next Tuesday.</p>
   <p>Joseph Sabbath is now one of the most famous lawyers in the county. He would certainly make a good Judge, if he is elected to that office. Jewish citizens who have learned to appreciate the value of Congressman Sabbath in his loyalty and devotion to his brethren, should see to it that Joseph Sabbath, who will follow in the direction of his brother, should get the nomination for Judge of the Circuit Court.</p>
