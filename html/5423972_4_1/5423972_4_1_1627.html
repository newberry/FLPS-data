   <p>Every nation produces musicians. And in the compositions of these musicians there must always be expressed, intentionally or unintentionally, the sentiment and the soul of the nation from which the particular musician is descended. The same is true, of course, of the Jewish musicians. There is a great difference, however, between the musicians of the rest of the nations of the world and the Jewish musicians.</p>
   <p>To understand Jewish music is a difficult matter because the Jewish soul is peculiar; it yearns, it mourns, it rejoices, all at the same time. The Jew is brought up so; there is heard in his weeping and his mourning his rejoicing at the coming redemption [from the Diaspora]. And to express such sentiments in <span class="page-break">\2</span>music, one must be more than an ordinary artist. A great deal of this rests upon the rearing [of the musician]. It depends upon the sphere in which the musician has lived and upon the circumstances under which he has spent most of his years. And therefore we find that many Jewish musicians, despite the fact that they were great artists, still could not express in their compositions the aforementioned dual emotion. They lacked the great Jewish soul, which mourns Galuth Hashchinah (Banishment of the Divine Presence) and Galuth Ha-Umah (Banishment of the Nation).</p>
   <p>And that is what we can see in Zadel Rovner's music. And therefore we are justified in saying that he is the only Jewish musical genius--Zadel Rovner, the Jew who has lived through the varied experiences that the Jewish people have met; Rovner, the Talmudist, the pious Jew, the "synagogue-attending" Jew, the savant. Zadel Rovner encompasses within himself the spirit of mourning, and at the same time the Jewish spirit of freedom. He, and only he, is in a position to create compositions. Everyone should come to hear him and to enjoy <span class="page-break">\3</span>what we call original Jewish compositions, even though they were composed in the Diaspora [hence under some or even considerable foreign influence]. Take for example his Kedushah [Sanctification, name of a daily public prayer] or his Attah Zocher [a portion of the High Holiday services]; you can sense in them the Diaspora with all its woe; through them you can visualize the auto-da-fe [act of faith--a public hanging of infidels in Medieval Spain], the Inquisition, and all the other persecutions of the Jew; yet at the same time you hear in the Hurrah! the joyous, lusty cry of a free people, a Jewish people, within its own boundaries, in Palestine.</p>
   <p>Zadel Rovner's soul can respond in no other way but one; [he is] purely Jewish, completely Jewish. In all his compositions, he is the complete Jew--the Jew, of four thousand years ago as well as of the present time. In his music, he lives through every period in the history of the Jew--from his origin until today. You can see in it the personification of a nation in all its varied aspects. In his prayers you hear the supplications of the aristocrat, the <span class="page-break">\4</span>common man, the radical, the conservative. The emotion of the Jew of every class is expressed in Rovner's compositions. And for this reason we must pride ourselves in him. He is the true Jewish national genius. He belongs not to one class of Jew, he is everyone's. We should enjoy going to hear him for in his music he represents all of us.</p>
   <p>Now we shall have an opportunity to hear Rovner's new compositions, composed here in America. We shall hear his interpretation of American-Jewish life in musical terms. He will give a concert on the Northwest Side in the Tiphereth Zion Synagogue, Sunday evening, June 16. And on Saturday, "Parshah Korah" [Saturdays are named by the portion of the Pentateuch read on that day], he will also conduct services in that synagogue as he has promised. There he will play his new compositions. Everyone must come to hear him for two reasons--first [in order to] become acquainted with this great genius, and second to support the Hebrew kindergarten, for whose benefit he is conducting services and giving the concert.</p>
