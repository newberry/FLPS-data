   <p>At the last joint board meeting, Samuel Levin, manager of the Joint Board of the Amalgamated, took up the question of unemployment insurance raised by those unemployed during the slack season.</p>
   <p>This important question concerns all the Amalgamated members and it is up to them to make the unemployment insurance plan a success.</p>
   <p>Both, the workers and the bosses are paying to that fund. We need such a fund and we must see to it that we are able to continue paying unemployment insurance after it is started. From this fund, forty percent of the wages earned while working, will be paid for five weeks during the year. Had we been working overtime, there would have been plenty of money in the fund; but as it is during the slack season, neither the workers, nor the bosses contributed to that fund, and we were unable to pay unemployment insurance.</p>
