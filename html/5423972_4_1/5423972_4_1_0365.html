   <p>Again rumors are being circulated, that Dr. Theodore B. Sacks will have to resign as a member of the Board of Trustees of the city's tuberculosis institute, and again all the newspapers are shouting their indignation at the injustice against Dr. Sacks, and a greater injustice against Chicago.</p>
   <p>The post, which Dr. Sacks holds, does not pay any salary. It is an honor post. Dr. Sacks in his indefatigable work and through his knowledge in the research of tuberculosis, deserves the recognition of Chicago, for it is he, who has elevated the institution to one of the best in the country.</p>

   <p>The best doctors in America give him due credit for it. The press of Chicago, almost without exception demands the reappointment of Dr. Sacks. This should be reason enough to return Dr. Sacks to his post, yet rumors have it, that his removal is imminent. What a powerful influence there must be on Mayor Thompson's side against Dr. Sacks!</p>
   <p>It appears to us, that it is not necessary to be a big politician in order to guess, who this influence is. Dr. Robertson, former president of Bennett College, is now in Mayor Thompson's cabinet. The Bennett College never enjoyed a good reputation among the medical colleges, especially the more reputable medical schools, like Rush Medical. Physicians and surgeons always turned their noses away, whenever the name of Bennett College was mentioned.</p>

   <p>And Dr. Sacks is keeping company with the more reputable medical schools, than the Bennett College with its scientific authorities, and this Dr. Robertson does not like.</p>
   <p>It seems to us, that we have guessed, who the influence is.</p>
