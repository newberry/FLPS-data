   <p>Tomorrow is Registration Day and all voters, men, and women should register in order to be able to vote in the coming November election for president, governor, congressman, and others. The old registrations are void and therefore each voter must take his time and register tomorrow, so his name can be entered in the election books.</p>
   <p>The great mass of Jewish voters will be able to register on Yom Kippur night, right after the prayer. All voting places will be open till 9 o'clock in the evening and no one should fail to perform his citizen's duty. Women voters, especially, should register, for this is the first time in history when women will have the right to vote in a presidential election.</p>
