   <p>The United States is now living through a transition period; changes are being made in our conceptions of life; the political, social, and moral concepts are acquiring other forms; the masses are dissatisfied; the public thinks that it is entitled to a larger proportion of land-ownership, everybody is of the opinion that it is high-time the citizens take another stride forward.</p>
   
   <p>When the United States last underwent such transition, a half-century ago, we were forced to resort to the sword and the gun; for four years blood was shed, thousands of lives were sacrificed; hundreds of thousands were crippled until we were enabled to make the necessary forward step. Today, when we go forward, we should avoid bloodshed, we should not find it necessary to march over head bodies, to go through fire and smoke.</p>
   <p>From the great Civil War, the United States emerged with a new morale, with new conceptions of political, social, and commercial life. People who have not lived through the period when slavery was a legal institution in America, people who do not know the morale and the conception of life which prevailed in this country when the slave-trade was carried on, can state ignorantly, whenever a riot or lynching occurs, that this country is still on the same level as it was fifty years ago. Students of evolution know that such a thing as riots or lynching could not have happened a half-century ago.</p>
   
   <p>Now, that we have lived with the new morale and concepts of life which have existed for the post fifty years as a result of the Civil War, it is only natural that we should attempt to advance another step, and for the last few years we have been attempting to do so. It stands to reason that we are using other tactics. We do not wish to attain our goal through the sword and the gun, but the ideas of John Brown will endure forever. The Wendell Phillips never die, although today they use different arguments and agitate in a different language.</p>
   <p>Woodrow Wilson, the president who enters the White House today, will have to be the modern Abraham Lincoln. The eyes of millions of citizens are now centered upon the former professor of Princeton University, and the entire populace trusts that the unheard of governor from New Jersey will add four years of history to the United States with love, big-heartedness, knowledge, and patriotism.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that Woodrow Wilson is the right man for the time and may every citizen cooperate with him so that he may succeed.</p>
