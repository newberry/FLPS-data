   <p>The first Jewish auction store was kept by Edward A. Jessel under the firm's name of Jessel &amp; Co. His son-in-law, I. Jones, was his partner. He came to Chicago in 1855, and opened his business in 1856, and continued it until 1874. Mr. Jessel is 89 years of age, and he is an inmate of the Old People's Home of Chicago.</p>
