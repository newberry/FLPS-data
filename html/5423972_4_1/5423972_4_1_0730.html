   <p>If there is one thing that the Jews have proved, in their age-long wandering over the face of the earth, it is that they lack the power of cooperation. They occupy their present isolated position, not because they have been persecuted by the Christians, but because they lack the aptitude for coherence and organization whose ultimate expression is nationality. This nomadic tendency of Israel is nothing new. It is not even modern. It does not date from the fall in Jerusalem in 70 A. D., as most people suppose; the Jewish proclivity for circulating among other unfriendly peoples was as much a feature of the ancient world as it is of the present one.</p>
   <p>The difficulty of making their people co-operate for Jewish ends, even in so <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>inspiring a cause as Zionism, is the perpetual dispair (sic) of the leaders of their race. The disregard with which the mass of American Jews treat their own religion is the unending complaint of the rabbis. The problem of the unchurched is the problem of Protestantism, and, to a lesser degree, of Catholicism, but even more acute is the Jewish problem of the unsynagogued. The synagogue itself is perhaps the most outstanding illustration of Jewish individualism. There are 700 or 800 synagogues in Greater New York, but each one is a separate entity, having absolutely no relation with the others. The Jewish religion is the only one in the United States which exists without an organization; there are no Jewish bishops, or presbyters, or conferences, or convocations; all attempts to create a Grand Rabbi, a functionary who would have (sic) a kind of Pope--like supervision over all the Jewish congregations, have failed.</p>
   <p>In politics, the same condition prevails. There is no such thing as the "Jewish vote"; Jews notoriously vote independently--be it said to their discredit; a Jewish district that goes Republican this year may go Democratic <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the next. If the Jews of New York acted as a political unit, they could easily control the city and capture all the elective offices; yet that trait which the politicians regard as their "instability", all but robs them of political influence.</p>
   <p>In business, as in politics, in religion and in social activities, the Jew is primarily an individualist. It is the one clear and unfailing quality of an otherwise complex character. Perhaps the Jew's constitutional restlessness under restraint, his determination to strike out for himself, his willingness to accept the station in which circumstances have placed him, explains this independence; at any rate, the quality is an active one and is of the utmost importance in considering the place which the Jew occupies in American life. In itself it shows that the idea that the Jew is organized in a mighty, secret plot having ramifications in all parts of the world for the undermining of Christian civilization is about the most grotesque manifestation of that hysteria which is one of the psychoses we owe to the World War.</p>

   <p>It is really not surprising that the Jew has made no astonishing economic progress in this country. Probably this statement itself will at once cause a general demurer (sic). The success of the Jew has become almost a fixed idea. That he turns to gold whatever he touches; that he rapidly gains possession of financial power; that he "dominates" business and finance; that he practices a kind of competition which other races cannot meet; that for these reasons his presence is a standing "menace" to American life--these beliefs have gained so firm a foothold in the popular mind that it is perhaps useless to subject them to examination. Yet the so-called "dominance" of the Jew is perhaps the strongest illusion abroad at the present time. It is difficult to see how it ever originated. Mr. Henry Ford has spent a fortune in his recent investigation of the Jewish problem; his theme has been this "Jewish control" of America's wealth. Yet the most hasty survey of the American scene demonstrates the absurdity of this idea. The actual wonder is not that the Jew has accomplished so much in the United States but that he has really accomplished so little.</p>
   <p>The one aptitude which is unanimously attributed to the Jews is a genius for <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>banking and finance. He has always been a money lender; the idea that this is an occupation to which he was forced by Christian persecution is not well founded (sic); from his earliest appearance in history the Jew has shown great talents as a banker. What, then, is his position in American finance? The great financial power of the United States rests with the national banks, the trust companies, the saving banks, the life insurance companies, and other mighty fiduciary institutions of like character. Into these huge receptacles the liquid capital of the American people steadily pours in an unending stream. Any man, or any group of men, or any racial unit, which could control this reservoir would "dominate" American finance; unless such a group did control these resources, any suggestion of "domination" would be childish folly. Do the Jews exercise any such control? Everyone can apply the test for himself. Run over a list of directors and officers of the National bank or the savings bank in your region; how many Jews do you find occupying such places? Reading the list of the great financial and fudiciary (sic) institutions of New York or elsewhere brings out no(sic) more astonishing fact than the infrequency with which Jewish names are encountered.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>Those who believe in the ability of the "Anglo-Saxson" (sic) element will have their vanity tickled; for the one fact this investigation proves is that the brains and energies of the nation are still found in largest proportion in the racial stock that founded it.</p>
   <p>Why does the Jew, supposedly the keenest financial mind, have so little influence in these great fortresses of liquid capital? The Jew himself would probably answer that a prejudice exists against him; that there is a conscious effort to exclude him. But this is an unsatisfactory explanation. The fact that there is an occasional Jew occupying a position of importance in these institutions shows that there is no bar to his success, provided he possesses the essential qualifications. The real solution lies deeper; it will be found in what has already been said about the Jew as an individualist; and American banking and finance are rapidly losing their old individualistic character. The business is now being done by great corporations, even by great "trusts". Financial power is controlled by large aggregations of stockholders, who exercise their power through the</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>agency of boards of directors, presidents, vice-presidents and the like. The prime quality that is needed for success is that of co-operation, of team work (sic), ability to lead great forces of subordinates, to work as a unit in a great organization. The present day (sic) banker does not operate with his own capital, but that of thousands of depositors; he does not necessarily labor to build up a great institution which he owns himself; he is daily constructing an edifice in which his proprietor's (sic) right is frequently quite small. These qualities are not Jewish qualities.</p>
   <p>There is no complaint that rests on so slight a foundation, therefore, as the so-called Jewish "Dominance" of American finance. There is no peril quite so illusory as that of the "International banker". Compared with the financial power wielded by certain American financiers, the greatest "international banker" is a pygmy. John D. Rockefeller could buy up all the Rothschilds and have a tremendous fortune left after doing it. The annual income of this famous family is very much smaller than that of Henry Ford. That there are many Jewish brokers; that a smaller number belong to the New York Stock Exchange; that Paul Warburg was partly responsible for the Federal <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>Reserve Law--thereby rendering a very great public service; that the same gentleman, at the earnest solicitation of the Government, became the first governor of the Federal Reserve Bank; that Mr. Eugene Meyer is the head of the War Finance Corporation--in this case also rendering an efficient public service; that there are certain minor private banking houses in New York and other cities--these facts are true; but, in view of the overwhelming importance of native Americans in the control of the financial resources and banking operations of the country, they form an exceedingly flimsy basis on which to erect a huge myth.</p>
   <p>The theory that the Jews are the all powerful (sic) forces in American trade and finance can be disposed of by one single consideration: who are the great American millionaires? Do their names invariably end in "stein" and "sky"? Here again is a test which each one can make for himself. Just think of the extremely rich men in your neighborhood. That some of them are Jews is not improbable, but the overwhelming majority are undoubtedly Gentiles.</p>
