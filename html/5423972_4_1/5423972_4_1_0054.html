   <p>The respectable Hebrews are divided in their preferences between Carter H. Harrison and Hempstead Washburne. Charles H. Schwab, the boot and shoe man, is strongly for Harrison. His partner, Morris Selx, is for Hempstead Washburne. The Hebrew bankers, Kozminski, Felsenthal, Lowenthal, and Lezarus Silverman, are all for Washburne. Cregier has not the support of a prominent Hebrew in the city. Max Dembrowsky, a well-known Hebrew, who has been making a canvass of the wholesale clothing houses, said yesterday:</p>
   <p>"I bet $50 a few days ago that Harrison would not get 35,000 votes. I'll bet now that Harrison will get more than that number. The fight, in my judgment, lies between Harrison and Hampstead Washburne."</p>
   <p>Washington Hesing of the Staats-Zeitung says:</p>
   <p>"Cregier's case is hopeless. The fight is between Hempstead Washburne and Carter H. Harrison. I think Harrison will win. He ought to win. Who is supporting Cregier? Nobody but members of the 'family trust,' office holders, and paid men.</p>

   <p>Harrison will get eighty per cent of the German-Democratic votes. He would get ninety-five per cent of it, but that some German-Democrats fearing the success of Hempstead Washburne will vote for Hempstead. I may say, too, that the German-Americans as a rule will shed no tears if Hempstead Washburne is elected."</p>
