   <p>The Jewish Welfare Board, founded for the purpose of assisting in every way possible the Jewish soldiers in the American Army and in the camps, needs 200 additional idealistic young men for welfare work.</p>
   <p>There are at present around 60,000 Jewish boys in the American Army and Navy, who need encouragement and moral support in their transition from a civilian to a military life. This is the aim of the Board, and it needs suitable young men as representatives of the Board in the various camps.</p>
   <p>Of course the Board would like to have young men experienced in social work. Nevertheless, those who feel capable of doing such work should apply to Rabbi Saul Silber, 729 No. Ashland Blvd., Chicago.</p>
