   <p>On July 3, the children in the vicinity of E. 37th street and Cottage Grove avenue, became the proud possessors of Arcade Park, one of the newest and most unique of the city's small parks.</p>
   <p>M. Abrahams, owner of a livery company at 3725 Cottage Grove avenue, recently noticed the need of a breathing place in the neighborhood as well as a playground for children. He had the park made attractive with shrubs, flowers, and trees and threw it open to the public. It is hoped that the park will become a social as well as a recreation center.</p>
