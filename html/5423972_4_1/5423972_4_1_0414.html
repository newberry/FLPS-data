   <p>PEACE</p>
   <p>Eighteen hundred and forty-nine times has the sun risen and set on a world submerged in fire and blood. Almost five years after the first signal for world conflagration, Peace has been declared. The World should burst with joy at the word of Peace, but it shows no enthusiasm. The masses are not demonstrative, the people do not celebrate. Has the War destroyed our ability to laugh--has the five years of fighting filled human hearts with such sorrow that they no longer can be happy?</p>
   
   <p>In the greatest heat of battle, the heart of man has not ceased to draw strength from the hope of a future better world. After the horror of war, there should have come the light of freedom--national freedom, national justice and brotherhood. This conflict should have outlawed War and paved the way for an enduring and just Peace. A large part of mankind does not wish to acknowledge the Peace, which has just been signed, as the result of catastrophe, but rather as the opening of a brighter future.</p>
   <p>But there is no stagnant moment in world history, just as there is no emptiness in nature. Mankind is still in motion, moving ever onward, and if this Peace is not a true one, then a more just generation will conclude a more just Peace. To hope and strive for that "Just Peace" is now the task of mankind.</p>
