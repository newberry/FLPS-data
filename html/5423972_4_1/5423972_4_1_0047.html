   <p>Much in the way of political news is being discussed on the West Side in the 9th Ward. Preparations are being made for the coming Aldermanic nomination.</p>
   <p>Naturally, the Jews in this section are greatly interested in nominating a Jewish candidate. Among the many candidates running for Alderman, Mr. Morris Eller seems to be the choice, for he is the one most talked of for that office. The Jewish element expect to raise heaven and earth to nominate a Jewish candidate in the 9th Ward.</p>
