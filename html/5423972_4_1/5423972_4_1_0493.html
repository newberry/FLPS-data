   <p>The second large group of Jewish Legionnaires consisting of about fifty men will leave Chicago on June 3. Great preparations are being made to give the heroes of Zion an impressive farewell with a public parade and banquet.</p>
   <p>After the first group of the Legionnaires left, enlistments of young men continued daily. They were sent at once without any sort of publicity to Canada. Since,however, the number of those enlisting has greatly increased, the Legionnaires' Committee decided to give them a public good-by before they leave Chicago, and preparations for this occasion are now being made.</p>
