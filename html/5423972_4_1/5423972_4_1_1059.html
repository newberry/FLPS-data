   <p>A movement, to establish schools (Jewish) for girls, commenced recently, and representatives of several national units held a meeting last Sunday and determined to raise a fund of $500 in order to open a Beth Sefar Labonas (a school for girls). One hundred dollars was immediately raised and it is expected that the requisite sum will be raised in a short time.</p>
