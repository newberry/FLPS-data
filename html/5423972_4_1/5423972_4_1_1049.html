   <p>Tomorrow the women will participate in the political life of Chicago for the first time. They will have the opportunity to prove that all condemnations against them were unfounded; that they understand the role of political life better than men; that they stand closer than men to the intimate needs of domestic life and that consequently, they know better how necessary certain political reforms are in the city, state, and nation.</p>
   <p>But in order to manifest this, the female citizens must exercise their first duty; viz., to register tomorrow for the primaries and for the regular elections.</p>
   
   <p>If the women don't fail to register, they will show, from the very inception, that they stand high politically, while the men, who have always enjoyed suffrage, have so far failed to learn that if they want to share the privilege of voting in a campaign, the first thing they must do is register themselves.</p>
   <p>The entire process of registration has been brought into being with a view to making limitations for those who do not understand their duties as citizens, and those who do not want to devote any time to this privilege, for which revolutionary struggles occur. To be a citizen means to have not only a privilege, but also a responsibility. Thus, every citizen who does not perform his duty by registering, is excluded from the right to vote.</p>
   <p>The women on registration day will show that the hard struggles which they carried on in Illinois, were not purported to carry out a certain caprice. They know how sacred it is to keep, and how high it is to estimate, suffrage. They will see to it that all polling places are filled.</p>
   <p>And, in this aspect, Jewish women should not be an exception. At any rate, it is high time for the Jewish woman to step out from the confines of her house, so that she may look freely upon the world and be her own in social life. Because the Jewish woman is such a good and devoted housekeeper, such a loyal and fond wife and mother, she is obligated to do everything within her means to help her husband improve the condition of the home, including participation in political life.</p>
   <p>It is therefore the duty of every Jewish female citizen, to register tomorrow, and also see that her husband should in no wise, neglect it.</p>
