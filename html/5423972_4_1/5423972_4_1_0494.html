   <p>Mr. Samuel Phillipson, the well-known West Side philanthropist, sent the following note yesterday to the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities; no comment is needed.</p>
   <p>"I have decided this year, that the sum pledged by me to your institution should be given through government channels. Because the interests of the United States Government must be foremost in the minds of everyone, I therefore bought Liberty Bonds for the amount which I intend to give to charity.</p>
   <p>"According to this plan, I am enclosing herewith the United States Third Liberty Bond #105920, for the sum of one thousand dollars, which together with the thousand dollars of October 24, 1917 constitute the full amount of my dues for 1917. You can use this Bond to pay up debts, sell it on <span class="page-break">2</span>the market or use it in any way you see fit.</p>
   <p>"You will agree with me that the enclosed Bond is as good as cash and using it in such a manner will be a help to the Government and a benefit to your institution exactly as though it were cash."</p>
   <p>Similar letters were addressed by Mr. Phillipson to the Associated Jewish Charities and the Joint Relief Commission for the Jewish war sufferers, with a five-hundred dollar Liberty Bond for each institution.</p>
