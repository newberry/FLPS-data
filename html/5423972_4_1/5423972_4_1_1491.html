   <p>The sweat shop is a place where, separate from the tailor-shop or clothing-ware house, a "sweater" (middleman) assembles journey-men tailors and needle-women, to work under his supervision. He takes a cheap room, outside the expensive and crowded business center, and within the neighborhood where the working people live. Thus, rent is saved to the employer, and time and travel to the employed. The men can work more hours than was possible under the centralized system, and their wives and children can help, especially when, as is often done, the garments are taken home to "finish,"</p>
   <p>The entire number of persons employed in these vocations may be stated at 5,000 men, of whom 800 are Jews. The wages are regulated by "piece-work," and run about as follows: Girls, hand sewers earn nothing for the first month, then, as unskilled workers, they get $1 to $1.50 a week, $3.00 a week, and (as skilled workers) $6.00 a week. The first class constitute 50%, the second,30%, and the last, 20%. In the general work, men are only employed to do button-holing and pressing, and their earnings are as follows; Pressers, $8 to $12 a week, under-pressers , $4 to $7. Cloak operators earn $8 to $12a week. Four-fifths of the sewing machines are furnished by the "sweaters," also needles, thread, and wax.-- "From Among the Poor of Chicago," by Major Joseph Kirkland, in July Scribner.</p>
