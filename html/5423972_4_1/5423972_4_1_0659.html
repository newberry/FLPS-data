   <p>The Second National Peace Congress, whose purpose is to outlaw war and to bring permanent peace on earth, amongst all peoples and nations, called a mass meeting last night.</p>
   <p>The official meetings of the Peace Congress will begin today, but the mass meeting last night was sponsored by the Sunday Evening Club of Chicago, and was given in honor of the Peace Congress. The speeches given by the different speakers were heard with great interest, and were enthusiatically applauded. All speakers emphasized that the time has come that peace amongst nations can successfully be accomplished if the different nations cooperate.</p>
   <p>The large Orchestral Hall, where the meeting was held, was crowded to the rafters, and a large throng had to be turned away because there was no more room for them.</p>

   <p>When the chairman introduced Dr. Emil Hirsch as the next speaker, a thundering and prolonged applause broke out in the audience lasting several minutes. Dr. Hirsch's speech was the longest and the warmest, as well as the most eloquent of all speeches delivered. He was interrupted at regular intervals, with thundering applause.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch enumerated a number of disasters and misfortunes brought about as a direct and indirect result of war. Sole supporters of families are being torn away from their loved ones; countries lose the best workers in their possession. The productive power is being sapped at its roots, when a nation is preparing for war. The best and most capable citizens are forced into military service; the number of widows and orphans increase to enormous proportions as a result of war, and they all become charges of the governments. Taxes are sky-rocketing to such heights that the people are grunting under the yoke. Dissatisfaction soon manifests itself and thus and danger of a revolution becomes imminent.</p>

   <p>One good point in favor of war is, that through it, people learn to understand each other. One nation begins to know the other nation, and thus they mutually benefit the progress and improvement resulting from wars.</p>
   <p>"But," continued Dr. Hirsch, "that is not necessary for progress. Civilization has progressed so much that people of one nation are able to see or communicate with people of another nation very quickly, through our marvelous inventions that war is absolutely unnecessary."</p>
   <p>"In war," said Dr. Hirsch, "we are accustomed to naming the victorious nation as the stranger one, but this is not true. Physical strength, as represented by more armament, and a better equipped army, does not constitute strength. There is a stronger force yet, and that is moral strength, and nobody can say that a smaller nation is morally weaker than a stronger one. The nation which I represent may be physically weak, but it is morally just as strong as any great nation."</p>

   <p>Turning his head to the first speaker, who pointed out that there has been a perpetual struggle amongst men, Dr. Hirsch cried out: "Human strife cannot be compared to animal strife. Humans struggle, and then forgive and make up. We can learn to reason the right way rather than the wrong way. We may be strong enough to defeat the weaker ones, yet the sense of pity and tolerance may overwhelm our feelings of revenge and bloodshed. That sense is sometimes stronger, and is more powerful at times than brute force. When God saw that the children of Israel rejoiced and celebrated the sinking of the Egyptians while crossing the Red Sea, He exclaimed in anguish: 'They are drowning in agony, and you are singing and rejoicing.' We are also permeated by such feelings when we see how the victorious nation is gloating over the defeat of her weaker rival in war. Such indiscreet actions immediately creates a feeling of contempt among other nations and reacts unfavorably towards the victorious nation."</p>

   <p>Dr. Hirsch, then, shifted his speech, exposing the dangers of preparations for war in order to preserve peace, which has been the slogan in Europe and is being advocated in America by ex-President Roosevelt, President Taft, and many others. He proved that such a game is like playing with dynamite, by saying:</p>
   <p>"When you give your child a gun to play with, you may be assured that he is going to use it, and the consequences will be disastrous. The same thing can be said about nations. When nations are preparing themselves for war, having a huge army at their command, building numerous battle ships, and other modern war equipment, youmay be certain that when an opportunity will present itself, they will take advantage of it.</p>
   <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>
   <p>"No good can come out of such a dangerous game, whether it be the victors or the vanquished, because it has been proved quite conclusively through past experience, that the victorious nations have suffered after the war, just as much, and sometimes more so, than their vanquished rivals."</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch concluded his brilliant address with the declaration, that what is taboo for an individual, should also be a crime for a nation. When it is considered a crime against society, for an individual to murder and to rob, why should war, which is wholesale killing and robbing, and is much more horrible, than a murder committed by an individual, not be regarded as an atrocious crime against mankind? He then warmly appealed to the audience, that they should be the torch bearers of peace. That they must cooperate in changing the conceptions of the coming generations by implanting in the hearts of their children a love for peace. They should teach their children that real heroes are not those that fight on the battle field, but those who are fighting against everything that is bad and rotten in society.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>They have to learn and teach others to suppress the bad and criminal instincts in men. In this way, a truly bright future would be in store for humanity, and peace on earth may be an everlasting reality.</p>
