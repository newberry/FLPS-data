   <p>The Mayor has re-appointed Dr. Hirsch a member of the Library Board, and has appointed Mr. Rosenthal, of the law firm of Page, Eliel and Rosenthal, as a member of the Board of Education. Mr. Rosenthal is a young man, highly educated and cultured, and will prove himself a valuable member of the board. The Herald says of Hirsch's re-appointment: "The Mayor's nominations to the Library Board are excellent, especially that of Dr. Hirsch, who brings to that institution a scholar's knowledge of books." Mr. Bernard Moos is already a member of the Library Board, and Mr. Edward Rose of the Board of Education.</p>
