   <p>Mr. Jacob Levy, President of the Jewish Orphans Home, in his annual message, next Sunday, will give his endorsement of Orphans Home to the Jewish public. The place of meeting is at the fraternity hall 70, Adams St.</p>
   <p>There are several different problems worth consideration for the good of the Chicago Jewish Orphans Home. We make endorsement known to Chicago Jews through the columns of the Daily Jewish Courier, that the Jewish public, which is urgently invited to this annual meeting, will realize the necessity of the endorsement and cooperate with us in carrying out our plans.</p>
   <p>Mr. Levy has shown by his last year's work, what has been accomplished through his conscientious activity and energy, for the problems and conditions of the Jewish orphans are very close to his heart. His endorsement shall receive consideration and must be carried out, if the Jews of Chicago expect the Home to be a success.</p>

   <p>Mr. Levy, in his message, declares as follows:</p>
   <p>"The necessity of enlarging the Orphans Home and providing a hospital is very great. When we came to the decision of building this Orphans Home, we did not realize that, in such a short time, we would be able to accommodate all the Jewish orphans of Chicago. In rebuilding this Home, the architects assured us that we would have enough room to accommodate one-hundred and twenty children. But since the completion of the building, we have discovered that we only have room for eighty-five children, and in addition to that, we were forced to appropriate the largest room in the Home, which was big enough for twenty-five children, for a hospital. That being the case, we have room for only sixty children instead of the one-hundred and twenty."</p>

   <p>Home, have this as a slogan, "Down with the mortgage."</p>
   <p>The Daily Jewish Courier is hopeful that by next Monday morning it will be in a position to publish to the world that the mortgage on the Jewish Orphans Home is cancelled.</p>
