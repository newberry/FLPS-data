   <p>The depositors of the Ashland and Twelfth Street Bank will soon receive a second dividend of twenty per cent, which will make a total of forty per cent of their deposits. Mr. Gurwitz, receiver of the bank that crashed, yesterday declared to a reporter from the Courier that he had already appealed to Judge Lindes of the Circuit Court, seeking permission to pay back twenty per cent in dividends, and as soon as this permission is granted, the depositors will immediately receive twenty per cent of their deposits.</p>
   <p>It is very interesting to note, in passing, to what extent, Mr. Gurwicz, as receiver, tried all possible means to minimize the expense of collecting the money. The La Salle Street Bank collected a sum of $700,000, paying from that sum $125,000 to lawyers and for other expenses, which amounted to approximately eighteen per cent of the principal, whereas the Ashland Bank collected $150,000 and had a total expense of three per cent.</p>
