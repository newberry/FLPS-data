   <p>The name of Solomon Golub is not unknown to our Jewish masses; during the past few years we have had the opportunity of hearing him sing Jewish folk and other songs at many recitals. His performance [always] impressed the audiences, and promised, at the same time, that something more interesting might be expected from this talented young man, who often sang his own compositions. It has never happened before [however] that Golub should appear in a program of his own compositions exclusively, and that is why last Monday evening's recital at the Central Music Hall differed from all his previous appearances.</p>
   <p>Golub's program consisted of fourteen songs of his own composition, of which four were of his own text as well. The performance was presented by the composer himself, assisted by Madame Rose Blumenthal-Mendelson of Isaiah Temple, who also sang several songs.</p>

   <p>While the audience wasn't as large as such an original all-Jewish undertaking deserves, yet it did not minimize the beautiful impression created by the recital, which was the first of its kind in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is hardly an accident that Golub in some of his program notes, including the last one, reprinted the following quotation from J. L. Peretz:</p>
   <p>"And the soul of a melody is the emotion of man: love, anguish, graciousness, revenge, desire, regret, sorrow - everything that man feels, can be expressed in melody--and the melody lingers on."</p>
   <p>For surely it isn't hard to understand that the stirring and profound emotions and experiences of Solomon Golub are expressed beautifully in his melodies.</p>
   <p>His song poem "Tanchum" (consolation), his "Weg Lied" (road song), and Peretz's "Becher" (beaker)--all three compositions, just off the press, are beautiful and inspiring. His music touches every fiber of that genuine and true Jewish feeling.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>When you hear these and other melodies of Golub, blending with the tones of the piano accompaniment, you feel that the young composer has found himself, and continues to find himself in the field of Jewish music.</p>
   <p>Golub has developed considerably since his last appearance at Sinai Temple. There is a more comprehensive and intensive understanding of Jewish music in his melodies, and this he naturally acquired through constant study.</p>
   <p>A turbulent, always seeking and longing soul--a soul which vibrates unceasingly--this is Solomon Golub, and this is what is reflected in his compositions.</p>
   <p>Golub also is energetic enough not to stop composing, although the local Jewish intelligent class (we beg your pardon)--the "intelligentsia", which should have encouraged him in every respect, still remains a little cold to his valuable contributions to our Jewish national music. His perseverance is another of the remarkable qualities of Solomon Golub.</p>
   <p>"The smaller the crowd--the greater the celebration" is a Jewish saying. This is also true of Golub's last recital. The soprano, Madame Blumenthal-Mendelson, <span class="page-break">\4</span>could have been omitted without the program's suffering in the least. Singing Jewish songs in a small soprano voice, as Madame Blumenthal-Mendelson sang, is certainly no tribute to the composer.</p>
   <p>However the pianist, Miss Miriam Firshtenberg, accompanied with taste, and really helped to create the splendid impression made by the Golub program.</p>
