   <p>The State Central Committee of the Democratic Party announced yesterday that Henry Horner, Jewish judge of the Probate Court, has been nominated as its candidate for governor of Illinois.</p>
   <p>A bitter struggle raged before the Central Committee could agree upon Horner.</p>
   <p>Michael L. Igoe, a State Representative, wanted the nomination and therefore was in opposition to Horner. As backers, he had almost all the Irish leaders of the Democratic Party in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mayor Cernak backed Horner for the nomination and the latter won. Rumors have it that the Central Committee is badly split, and that the Democrats are far from being united as they should be in time of an election campaign.</p>

   <p>Horner is the second Jew in the history of Illinois to be a candidate for governor. The first was Samuel Altschuller, who was defeated in the election. Altschuller now is a Federal judge in Chicago.</p>
