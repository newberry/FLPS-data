   <p>Today at 5 p.m. a Fourth of July celebration with a children's peace parade will take place under the auspices of the Institute Peace Club. The children's peace parade will be brilliantly staged in four acts.</p>
   <p>The first act will show the world at large, where peace and security reign supreme; where the Angel of Peace is being honored by all, and children are strewing flowers in His path.</p>
   <p>The second act will show the approach of war. Happiness disappears. Fear and misery take its place. Witches and vile elements rejoice in the world's catastrophe.</p>

   <p>The third act shows youth and life pleading with the Angel of Peace to return, so that the world may be happy. The Angel of Peace returns and with Him come truth, hope, justice and world peace. War vanishes, and Columbia with all its peaceful elements, sings praises of victory over war and witches.</p>
   <p>The fourth act shows the world at peace and children singing joyfully. The spirit of America, places peace on its rightful throne. The march will follow.</p>
   <p>After the parade a baseball drill, a wrestling match and dancing will be provided for members of the Gymnasium Class.</p>
