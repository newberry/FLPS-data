   <p>Ten years ago, to light a cigarette placed a woman under suspicion as to her morality. Now everybody is doing it. It is a sign of degeneration.</p>
   <p>What is it? Is it Paris before the revolution? Time way back women used to appear in sensuous and daring dances, smoking cigarettes whenever they could. The men sitting in the balcony of old cafes used to shake their heads with concern over the fact that women were going straight to blazes.</p>
   <p>That was ten years ago at the time when women who smoked were only "daring," not "immoral." Quite a few women who had been abroad smoked cigarettes in long amber holders, the fad being then considered as a foreign affectation. No American girl would smoke; it was unthinkable.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>That was only ten years ago, and what a change has taken place!</p>
   <p>Smoking by women has been taken as a matter of course.</p>
   <p>The president of a college attended by several hundreds of the daughters of our best families said the other day that fifty per cent of the girls under his charge smoke. The Dean of Barnard College announced that she didn't know how many of her girls smoke because she didn't care whether they did or not, and so she didn't ask them.</p>
   <p>In public restaurants, except of course the places where busy shop and office workers take their noon meals, it is the exception rather than the rule to find women smoking. Most of the better theatres maintain smoking rooms for women. In social gatherings, public dinners, anywhere and everywhere at any <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>time, the fact is taken for granted that some of the women will smoke.</p>
   <p>It is no longer a matter of surprise; no one is shocked; no one thinks the world is coming to an end if women and even young girls take ready-mades from gold cases, from nickle cases, or from the package straight from the cigar store. Nearly every girl seems to carry a package in her purse. It is not a rich girl's, working girl's, business woman's, actress', or radical's fad; it is universal.</p>
   <p>It is no longer a Greenwich Village basement where women meet men nor the privacy of the home; it is all over, in the office, in the rest-rooms, in the theatre, in restaurants, in the parlor or study, in summer hotels and boarding houses and camps, and even in smoking cars on trains.</p>
   <p>In the recent holiday season, the gift shop and department store windows displayed <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>as gift suggestions for girls and women gold, silver, amber, and enameled cigarette holders and ash trays; and such display ran a close race with pink silk underwear as the principal suggested gifts for men to buy for their women folks.</p>
   <p>Indeed, a young man, who was recently asked why he didn't smoke, said, "I don't like such effeminate habits!"</p>
   <p>Figures made public not long ago of the consumption of cigarettes showed that thirty times as many "coffin nails" were consumed last year as ten years ago. The figures run into tens of millions a year. the increase was attributed largely to women and the fact that many men in the past who did not smoke are taking up the habit to keep up with their women folks.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>An amusing incident is that of a young college girl, daughter of one of the earliest of the New York Women Socialists and feminists. She came home with the cigarette habit fully developed, prepared to shock her mother. But her mother only laughed. Long before the girl had been born, she used to "roll her own" and smoke with her husband, not because she liked it, but because that was her way of showing her equality with the men.</p>
   <p>The reason for this astonishing new development is plain. The war will have to accept full responsibility for it and it will have to bear the onus of prohibition, and one-hundred-per-centism and a lot of European revolutions, and the wearing of knickers by women, and lots of other things.</p>
   <p>With the war many of our girls went abroad to do canteen work. There they got the smoking habit, both from seeing its prevalence among European women <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>and as a relief and relaxation from the terrible things they were compelled to see everyday. They came back as confirmed smokers, enough of them anyway to be a leaven among their sisters to suggest the habit to them, and to take women smokers out of the "queer class."</p>
   <p>Also during the war, girls entertained soldiers before they went to the front. They gave them chocolate and cigarettes. They got into the habit of handling cigarettes, and it no longer gave them a feeling of distaste.</p>
   <p>The war was over and a new deal began.</p>
   <p>Future historians will view with interest, if not amazement, the development among women of post war years. It was a time of new freedom. En-franchised, tossed into public life, given a place that women had never in all history held-or maybe they took that place - the revolt was on.</p>
   <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>
   <p>Women began to see that it did not matter very much what they did. The books written by old fogies suggested that they wear tight stays and faint every other hour and be "modest," - man's idea of modesty, you understand, - and they did it until they saw that even if they did what they pleased, it did not hurt them with the men.</p>
   <p>To digress for a moment. You remember the story of Paul and Virginia, or don't you? In that story Virginia was drowned because she was too modest to pull off her clothing and save herself from a sinking ship. That book was written by a man! Are women "modest," in the sense of being ashamed of their bodies? Are they ashamed to have men know they have legs? Are they "timid"? We used to think so, men writers said so, and the women did what they thought they had to do to maintain their reputations along man-made standards.</p>
   <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>
   <p>But in this amazing post-war period women have discovered that they can set their own standards and do as they please and still not lose their womanhood, their girlish charm, and their chances of marriage with decent and worthwhile men.</p>
   <p>That is the reason why women no longer keep it a deep and desperate mystery that they are bipeds. Men wanted women to hide their legs so they could get a kick out of seeing them. That is why women used to think they were ashamed to show their legs. Now women show their legs on the beaches, when they wear knickers on their hikes, and when the styles dictate knee-length skirts. Are they immoral or immodest? No. They are comfortable and human, sensible and supremely decent, and they won all that by daring to set their own standards, not accepting man's standards set for them.</p>
   <p>That is the reason why women frankly and openly discuss matters that used to <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>be considered "unmaidenly" for women even to think about. That's the reason why women go in for athletics and wear the clothes they want to wear; why corsets are rapidly becoming atrophied for lack of use; why men realize when they dance that women have bodies, and are not constructed of structural steel. That is why women read what they want, eat what they want, drink what they want, wear what they want, cut their hair and use rouge if they want, and smoke.</p>
   <p>Maybe you don't like it. Every day some minister of the Gospel thinks that God has given him a revelation to denounce the shameless unclothed, painted, bobbed hair, drinking, smoking Amazons. A lot of the girls are beginning not only to question the moralities that have been handed down to them, but even the relations of the sexes and are living up to the question that arises in their minds.</p>
   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>More and more are women declaring their independence.</p>
   <p>Do you like it? All right! But if you don't like it, it doesn't matter, anyway, because the girls will do as they please, whether you like it or not.</p>
   <p>Smoking by women is part of the emancipation of the sex; you have got to discuss it now, but as women's smoking. No one will stand by the sex line anymore. If you object to women's smoking, you have got to object to men's smoking. If you don't object to the morality of men's smoking, that ends the argument.</p>
   <p>The new emancipation includes freedom of thought, freedom of action, freedom to wear knickers on hikes and short skirts in the city. To wear negligible bathing suits and to discard corsets and most of the voluminous underwear <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>women used to wear; to enter any and all professions and trades. To have the same standard of sexual conduct as men, and to take the consequences of whatever they do. To smoke if they want to, and most of them do.</p>
   <p>At least this is what a mere man thinks; one who tries to be enlightened and up to date and liberal and understanding. A lot of the girls may think that he is an old fogy, a flat tire, a has-been, and a fossil. And if they do, their denunciations and protestations will be gladly received and eagerly read.</p>
   <p>And that's that!</p>
