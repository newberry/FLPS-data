   <p>For the last seven weeks, Chicago has had a most enjoyable time hearing some of our greatest opera stars. The most talented dramatic soprano of the Chicago Grand Opera, Miss Rosa Raisa, who is at present ill, at the Michael Reese Hospital, was heard in the operas, La Gioconda, La Tosca, and Cavalleria Rusticana.</p>
   <p>A second Jewish opera singer, well known here in the U. S. A. and in European countries, is the baritone, Bakalanov. His voice is powerful and clear. The public gave him a warm reception, beyond description.</p>
   <p>Miss Raisa was to sing the first time in opera, La Relei, but could not participate because of illness. Miss Iafchiz sang the role in her place.</p>
