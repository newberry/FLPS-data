   <p>Again, the member of the Illinois Branch of the American Union of Rumanian Jews are in the fore for their good work for the Third American Liberty Loan. Last Sunday they were the first to start the campaign in the local Jewish communities. At their massmeeting yesterday at the West Side Coliseum they advanced a step further.</p>
   <p>The Rumanian Jews subscribed $8,100 for Liberty Bonds. Mr. Henry Friend, the well-known State Street merchant, promised to buy Liberty Bonds for the same amount, which means that the total sum will reach $16,200.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bronstein, president of the Illinois Branch, declared that the campaign among the local Rumanian Jews has not ended yet. He hopes to be able shortly to raise the sum to $10,000, and to get Mr. Friend to subscribe a like amount.</p>
