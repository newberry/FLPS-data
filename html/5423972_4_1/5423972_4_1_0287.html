   <p>Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, who is a member of the Committee on Immigration, today won a victory at the committee meeting. The Immigration Committee is at present working on the well-known Barnett-Dillingham Immigration Bill.</p>
   <p>The Jewish congressman has waged a battle during the last three meeting days. He demanded that the committee be open-minded and permit, before the bill goes to Congress, the defenders of the open door policy to a hearing on this important question.</p>
   <p>Finally, the committee complied with Mr. Sabath's demands. They set aside the 11th or 112th day of December to receive a Chicago committee and hear its arguments against the bill, which aims to close the doors of America.</p>
   <p>As soon as the news reached Chicago, activities began among prominent citizens <span class="page-break">\2</span>to select and send a committee to the Immigration Committee in Congress. Election Commissioner Zarnetsky, and a member of the Board of Education, Mr. H. A. Lipsky, assumed the responsibility of organizing a suitable committee which will, if possible, be sent to Washington to argue for free entrance to this country.</p>
