   <p>Chicago Jews will bury today, with a big parade, Sergeant B. Lheit, who died in the service of Uncle Sam at his post at Fort Mason, California.</p>
   <p>Sergeant Lheit descends from a noted family. He was a graduate of Medill High School and, as a devoted patriot, was one of the first to answer the call of President Wilson to volunteer for the defense of American liberty against the bloodthirsty German Junkerdom, which compelled America to draw the sword.</p>
   <p>His body was brought to Chicago for burial and a committee was organized to give him an impressive military funeral to which he is entitled.</p>
   <p>The funeral will start at 1 P.M. sharp from the residence of his mother, 1415 Millard Avenue, where the big gathering will assemble and from where it will march to the Marks Nathan Orphanage Synagogue, where the following program will be carried out.</p>

   <p>As sergeant, he is entitled to a military escort of twenty-two soldiers. Captain Bell selected yesterday twenty-two soldiers and placed them under the command of Corporal Green.
