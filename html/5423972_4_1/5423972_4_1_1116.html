   <p>On November 8, Dr. W. R. P. Emerson held clinic in our Home. Many prominent social workers and dietitians of the city were present. In the course of his talk he emphasized repeatedly the fact that he had never seen so well-nourished a group of children. He found our Home to have the lowest percentage of underweight children of any institution he had visited.</p>
   <p>Dr. Emerson expressed himself quite freely in saying that he had always dreaded a visit to an Orphan Home with its gloomy, depressing atmosphere, but declared himself amazed, astonished, and overwhelmingly surprised at the radiant and happy faces of the children, and at the cheerful and homelike spirit which prevails.</p>
   <p>In every lecture in Chicago throughout the week following his visit with us, Dr. Emerson referred again and again to our Home and its wonderful accomplishments. Since that time social workers and state officials have besieged our Home and our Dr. May Michael for information as to our methods and our diet.</p>
   <p>On November 26, a re-examination of the height and weight of all the children was made by Dr. Emerson's assistant, Miss Rose Michael, and it was found that only three per cent of our children were under normal weight, a record which no institution in this country can match.</p>
