   <p>Many national and international conferences were held recently. At these conferences plans and proposals were vehemently discussed concerning man's destination.</p>
   <p>In order that you should not think that we are concocting infamy upon the good and noble men who devote themselves to the matters of improving the world we shall bring forth a few examples.</p>
   <p>We shall take the first international conference on the white slave trade which was held in London. How much beautiful phraesology and scientific verbiage was uttered about the abominable trade in human bodies. Even our chief rabbi of England spoke at this occasion. And the trade goes on as before, and the victims suffer as much as before; and if they would encounter a delegate of this noble body, who worries for the down-trodden, they could say to this delegate, "your oratory is excellent".</p>
   <p>A peace congress was held simultaneously in which all pacifists of the world participated. Again beautify words were reiterated as to how fine, how good, how refined, and how human peace is; and how brutal and common blood-shed is, and the only thing to do about this is merely talk. And they weren't ashamed to face each other, knowing that the participation in such congresses is meaningless because nothing that is proposed by this congress is carried out. If the hundred of <span class="page-break">2</span>thousands of victims of the last war would meet the delegates of the peace conference, or even meet Carnegie who built this peace palace for his money they would say: "All of you can only use beautiful words, but you can do nothin and therefore it would be better for you to remain silent and not deceive the world, whom you make believe that you accomplish only, God knows what."</p>
   <p>And the same can be said about the International Physicians' Congress which spoke of the horrors of drunkeness. All the flowery speeches against white slavery, against war, against drinking and many other evils that surround us will not bring about any solution so long as the conditions which create, nurture, and uphold these evils exist. The foundations which uphold the evil construction should be changed.</p>
   <p>When, however, the preachers, against evil, act as apologists for Kaiser Wilheim, the czars, and kings of other countries, we are still far from real salvation in our sinful world. It is only scientific verbiage and rhetorical expressions.</p>
