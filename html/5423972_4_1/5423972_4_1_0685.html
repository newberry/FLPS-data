   <p>Chicago League For Hebrew Deaf Begins Large Program of Development.</p>
   <p>For a good many years there has been existing in Chicago a group composed of Jewish men and women who are deaf. Up to the present time, this group has served its purpose of providing a common basis of meeting for the various deaf mutes of Chicago. Its scope,however, has been a very small one, and up to now, its membership is merely 60.</p>
   <p>In the past month, mainly through the efforts of Mr. George Davis, there has begun a movement that should have far-reaching effects on these people. In Chicago there are approximately 500 Jewish mutes who have no means of maintaining their contacts withtheir people. It is the ambitious purpose of Mr. Davis and the people he has interested in this project to unite all of these into one group with a definite purpose. This purpose will entail the economic and spiritual betterment of these people and will also serve as their means of contact with the Jewish community at large.</p>
   <p>Meetings will be held at the Institute and all mutes are invited to attend. People who are acquainted with these persons should make known their names and locations to the Institute so that the league maycome in contact with them and give them the advantage that it has to offer.</p>
