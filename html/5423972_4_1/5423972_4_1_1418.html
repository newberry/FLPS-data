   <p>The Jewish people of the Northwest Side, who are true lovers of the movies and have shown a desire to hear artistic music at these performances, are attending the magnificent Crystal Theater, North Avenue near California Avenue. This theater was built by Schaffer Brothers at a cost of over three hundred and fifty thousand dollars. No expense was spared to make this theater pleasant and comfortable for its patrons. The costliest and most complete ventilating system that could be provided,constantly supplies the theater with clean, freshly washed air. The two thousand seats are very roomy and permit of a direct unobstructed view of the stage. A twelve-piece orchestra provides a magnificent symphony program as well as the appropriate music for the pictures.</p>
   <p>To spend an evening or an afternoon in the beautiful Crystal Theater is indeed a treat and a holiday occasion for all.</p>
