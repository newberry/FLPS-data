   <p>The fifth loan, or the Victory Loan, will not be followed by a sixth one. It is the last of the great loans. The Secretary of the Treasury made that very clear. He stated that the finances necessary for government will, in the future, be covered from other sources. It is, therefore, quite natural, that every loyal and true-hearted American, who can at all afford to buy a bond, do so, since he shall not be called upon again. If only these same people who had under-written previous loans were as interested in the present one, there would be no doubt that this last issue will be a success, a success that would inspire everyone. The last call of the Nation brought forth the cry of victory, so let no one delay or hesitate.</p>
