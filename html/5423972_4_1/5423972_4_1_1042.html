   <p>Women are now voting in ten states and in one territory. In several states they already have had women suffrage for a period of three or more years. Yet, in no city has this question been given so much attention as in Chicago. All eyes of America are focused on this city.</p>
   <p>In no city of all the states where women are permitted to vote, has there been so large a number of registered women voters as in Chicago. No other city can turn out 218,643 women voters at one time, as has Chicago. Including the men voters, Chicago has a total of 693,627 registered voters.</p>
   <p>The politicians who looked over the registration books have declared that in the forthcoming aldermanic elections, April 7, the women will control the balance of votes in every ward. This means that the women's votes will be the equilibrium to sway the weight in one way or the other.</p>

   <p>The person on whom women shall be bent to vote, will certainly triumph.</p>
   <p>In the first ward, for example, where Miss Marion Drake is running for alderman against John Coughlin, there are 4,717 women voters and 13,514 men.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Coughlin, who is known as "Bath-House John," has been alderman in the first ward for more than twenty years, and no one ever risks the chance to run against him. Yet, it is a fact that the men voters are split up into different political parties. So if all the women voters would vote one straight ticket, i. e., one way, let us say for Miss Drake, she will positively be elected.</p>
   <p>In the twenty-fifth ward, known as the "Banner Suffrage Ward" or the "Fortress of the Suffragettes," there are 13,431 registered women as against 20,250 men.</p>
   <p>Therefore, if all women should determine to vote for a certain person or a specific issue in each ward, they will win.</p>

   <p>The women need not segregate themselves from men, nor need they oppose men in politics.</p>
   <p>Their interests are identical to those of their husbands, brothers, friends, sons, and fathers.</p>
   <p>We trust they will vote for the general welfare of the city, for the best man and for the things which are important to all of us.</p>
   <p>The fear of women gaining the upper hand in politics is a fallacious fear.</p>
