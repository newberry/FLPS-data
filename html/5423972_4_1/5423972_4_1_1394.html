   <p>Today Twelfth Street becomes Roosevelt Road. A huge parade will take place along the entire length of the street. All businessmen and residents of Roosevelt Road are requested to hang out the American Flag, to close their stores at four in the afternoon, and to participate in the celebration.</p>
   <p>About six P. M. a parade of automobiles will follow in a long procession from Twelfth Street north to Madison Street, east on Madison to Ashland Avenue, south on Ashland to Twelfth Street, and west on Twelfth to Independence Boulevard where marchers will assemble around a grandstand especially constructed there. Many speakers and representatives from the Mayor's office, and probably the Mayor himself will address the assemblage.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Roosevelt Road runs through the heart of the West Side Jewish section and is its main shopping street.]</p>
