   <p>Through the interest of several prominent Jewish families, Francis Paperte, a young mezzo-soprano, was brought to the attention of Herbert Johnson, business director of the Chicago Opera Association. After an audition, he recognized at once her great talent as an operatic artist and engaged her for the coming season.</p>
   <p>Miss Paperte was born in Coloma, Wisconsin, of humble French and Russian Jewish parents. She was brought to Chicago for her musical studies. At the age of fifteen, she had already become an accomplished pianist. Miss Paperta is twenty-four, and will be one of the youngest members of the opera company.</p>
