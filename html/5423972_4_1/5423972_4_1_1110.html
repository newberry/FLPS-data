   <p>A group of Northwest Side Jews have organized an association under the name Von Humboldt Sanitary Improvement Association, for the purpose of keeping the neighborhood, which has lately been so inexcusably neglected, clean. Tenants as well as landlords are members of this association. The officers of the association are: Mr. Gutnik, president, J. Weinberg, vice-president, M. Miller, treasurer, and H. Rosenthal, secretary.</p>
   <p>"It is not only a question of cleanliness, but also of health", declared Mr. Gutnik, president of the association to a representative of the Courier.</p>
   <p>"Our streets are full of garbage, the alleys are dirty, and such a condition affects the health of the population. If our city fathers do not pay sufficient attention to the cleanliness of our neighborhood, we will have to force them to do so through our organization, or else do it ourselves by our joint effort."</p>

   <p>The meetings of the association are held every second and fourth Wednesday of the month at the Talmud Torah Hall, corner Rockwell and Hirsch Boulevard.</p>
