   <p>Professor Albert A. Michelson recently read a technical and scientific paper entitled, "The Application of Interference Methods to Astronomical Measurements," which will have a remarkable bearing on future investigations in the field of astronomy. He has demonstrated that it is possible to determine the actual diametrical size of a star. Previous discoveries had tested the star for distance, but Professor Michelson aids us to learn the size.</p>
   <p>In 1907, he was awarded the Royal Society's Copley Prize, the highest scientific award in the British Empire.</p>
