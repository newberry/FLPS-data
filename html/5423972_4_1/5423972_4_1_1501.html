   <p>The Bank of Commerce, 108 La Salle Street is one of those local German financial institutions, whose reputation is so well established that advertisements seems unnecessary. However, it is perhaps in order at the beginning of a new year to inform the public that the Bank of Commerce succeeded exceedingly well during the past year, which was the first year of its existence. Only three months after its organization, on July 1st, the bank was able to pay a dividend of 2%. In a few days another 2 1/2 % divided will be paid. The institution is under the proficient management of H. Felsenthal, Jacob Gross, and Fred. Miller. It has a savings department; it issues bills of exchange and letters of credit and also makes loans upon real estate.</p>
