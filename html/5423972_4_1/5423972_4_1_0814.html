   <p>Remembering by what superhuman effort the Immigration Bill and the "Literacy Test" were twice defeated, and seeing now that despite the work of Congressman Sabath and all friends of unrestricted immigration, the bill in its third introduction has passed the House of Representatives by a large number of votes, we must admit that the chances to kill the Immigration Bill for the third time are rather slim. We cannot expect President Wilson in light of the present situation to provoke Congress by again vetoing the bill. Even if he should do this, it is doubtful whether it would help; his previous veto was almost defeated.</p>
   <p>Thus we can assume that the bill will become a law. The war is partly responsible. The cry raised against "hyphenated citizenship" and the questionable conduct of several Germans in America made it possible for the bill to receive strong support in Congress. It would be of no avail to protest.</p>
   
   <p>Such is the sentiment of the country. The only hope is that after the world is at peace and the rumors of American participation in the war have ceased and the country has experienced the effects of the law, it will not remain a law for long. Its dangers and harmful character will then be clearly exposed, for it is not an open and direct law, but a law with a "trick" and the "trick" is the "literacy test".</p>
   <p>Let us assume that our representatives in Washington have decided that it is advisable to close America's gates for awhile to the stream of immigration. Perhaps they think that America cannot absorb the immigrants quickly enough, or that the foreigner lowers the living standard of the American workers, or whatever their grounds may be--then they should say, "Close the door! Do not let people possessing vast sums of money enter. Do not let merchants buy and sell merchandise". Or a proposal of similar nature. That would at least be direct and honest. The object would be clear even though it overthrew a great American principle. But what sort of test is the "Literacy Test"? And what effects can we expect from such a test?</p>
   
   <p>There is hardly any immigration now to America. The war made immigration impossible. On the contrary tens of thousands of Italian, Serbian, Bulgarian, German, French and English workers have returned to Europe in order to serve in the armies of their fatherlands. Thus we read in the newspapers that in Chicago for instance, the negroes are engaged in the business of street cleaning because of the shortage of Italian labor. A shortage of "hands" for common labor is already being felt. And these "hands" are not fine penmen nor are they connoisseurs of good literature.</p>
   <p>There are perhaps many members in Congress, particularly in the Senate who realize this fact, but reacting to the anti-foreign sentiment bred by the war, they will support the bill without too close examination. However when times become normal again, it wont take long for the noxious effects of the bill to reveal themselves. And a protest will be raised by employers of the large number of uneducated workers. The American mechanics and the educated workers, the members of the American Federation of Labor who demanded restrictions on immigration, will see that restrictions will have little or no effect on their wages. Instead of foreign workers, foreign-made goods will come to our shores and compete with American products more drastically than ever before. Then this law will be either completely altered or entirely abrogated.</p>
   <p>In the meantime we must be aware that the Barnet Bill becomes "a law with a trick".</p>
