   <p>The police, the detective agencies, and the Department of Justice have resumed their work. As in the time of the World War they are making false accusations and arresting workers in order to deprive the workers of their rights and of their freedom, and, at the same time, create class hatred and stir up turmoil in the ranks of organized labor.</p>
   <p>A mass meeting will be held this evening in Labor Lyceum arranged by the central committee of the Jewish branches of the Socialist Alliance to protest against the raids, arrests, and prosecutions carried on against the radicals of this country. It is the duty of every right-thinking worker to attend this protest meeting, and, as free and courageous citizens, let their voices ring out with protest against the czarist methods which the Burns and the Crows wish to establish in this country. The noted lecturers, Mr. Saint John Tucker, Mr. Barnes, and Dr. Green will speak in English, and Mr. Morris Sisskind will speak in Yiddish. Comrade L. Schaffer will act as chairman.</p>
