   <p>Each of the political parties, as well as each candidate, will draw its, and his own conclusions about the primary elections which were held in our city and state last Wednesday. It is worth while to stress the fact that, with the exception of Congressman Sabath and a couple of candidates for the Legislature who had practically no opposition, all Jewish candidates on the tickets of the two major parties were defeated. And we have the courage to say that this failure must be ascribed to the negligence of the Jewish voters.</p>
   <p>This failure must be condemned because these primary elections are particularly apt to keep Jews from being elected to office. We should not deceive ourselves. Our Christian enemies are deeply prejudiced against us. But the law of the country makes us equal with them in political life. Thus the parties must reckon with our voices and our numerical strength.</p>
   
   <p>Under the old primary law, when candidates were nominated by conventions controlled by political bosses, Jews would often have to be placed on the tickets, and by effective lobbying, a Jewish candidate would occasionally be dragged into office. Thus the Jews would be represented in the government of the country, state, county or city, although not in proportion to their numbers.</p>
   <p>Now, however, when the nomination of candidates is controlled by the people as a whole, the above-mentioned prejudice against Jews has an opportunity to exercise its influence, and the result is not very pleasant.</p>
   <p>Here it is not a question of this or that Jew not receiving the political distinction which he seeks. Here the question concerns the difficulties that Jews in general are having in order to get their portion of representation in the political life of the country.</p>
   <p>This is an important matter. It is not advisable to permit a condition which would prevent Jews from being nominated, to continue. The loss of Jewish prestige is more painful than the fact that a few Jews were defeated.</p>
   <p>Other nationalities understand better the significance of exhibiting their [national] prestige in the political life of the country. For this reason, their candidates are more succesful than the Jewish candidates.</p>
   <p>It is true that the number of votes, in general, was not large in the primaries last Wednesday, but the Jewish voters neglected the primaries entirely. Consequently, the whole election was carried through by the political machines that decided who should be nominated. And these machines haven't any respect for a citizenry which is too lazy to vote. In the course of years, the Jews may deeply regret this. For this reason, the outcome of Wednesday's election is important to the Jews of Chicago, and it should be remembered by them in the future.</p>
