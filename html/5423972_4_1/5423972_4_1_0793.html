   <p>In co-operation with the Social Service League, 160 girls were sent to Sunset Lodge. Here, too, we registered the girls, arranged for their medical examination, and had them assembled prior to their leaving for camp. While the Social Service League paid all of the expences of conducting the camp and managing it from their end, 160 girls were registered for the camp and distributed throughout the camping period in five groups beginning June 28, and the last group leaving August 24.</p>
   <p>This camp was primarily organized for girls who came under the direction of several dependent agencies, such as the Relief Society, the Bureau of Personal Service, the Home Finding Society, and the Dispensary and so forth.</p>
   <p>In fact, no girl was permitted to register for camp unless she came recommended by one of these agencies. The age limit here was fourteen years.</p>
