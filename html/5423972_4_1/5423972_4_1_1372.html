   <p>When the Jewish bakery owners, Wasnafsky, Jacobs, Masberg, and Kaplan, erected their modern and sanitary bakery at 4224-4226 West 12th Street and named it the "White Palace", they gave it a very appropriate name. They built and founded an establishment which is clean, light, airy, and sanitary--where bread and pastry goods can be baked under conditions which absolutely ensure their cleanliness, tastiness, and complete satisfactoriness. The bread and other bakery goods are baked by healthy workmen, under improved conditions which guarantee that the bread will be free from foreign matter. This often happens in old, unsanitary bakeries that lack modern equipment and, naturally, are not able to produce wholesome bread.</p>
   <p>The founders of the White Palace do not regret the fact that they have built the finest Jewish bakery in Chicago. In order to give every man and woman an opportunity to obtain wholesome, sanitary bread, they have labeled it <span class="page-break">\2</span>under the name "Golden Zizel Rye Bread". This label will appear exclusively upon bread baked in the White Palace and will be found in all stores and bakeries which sell White Palace products.</p>
   <p>The various labels formerly used will be discarded and from now on only one label, Golden Zizel Rye Bread, will be used on the bread of the White Palace.</p>
   <p>Besides being able to purchase this tasty, fresh, pure, and appetizing bread in the stores owned by the White Palace, it is also important, that everybody who wants to use this pure and wholesome bread should tell their grocer to phone Garfield 446 and place an order for the White Palace bread with the Golden Zizel Rye Bread label. It will be promptly delivered to all parts of the city.</p>
   <p>Every grocer who wants to satisfy his customers and is anxious for them to use the finest bread obtainable, baked under the most sanitary conditions, will immediately order bread and bakery goods from the White Palace, <span class="page-break">\3</span>4224-26 West 12th Street, telephone, Garfield 446.</p>
   <p>Remember the label: "Golden Zizel Rye Bread" is a sign of pure, wholesome bread. Be sure to demand it; watch for the label. Try it once and you will always buy this bread.</p>
