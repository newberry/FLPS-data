   <p>The old question of teaching sexual hygiene in the schools was reopened by health commissioner, Dr. Bundesen. As is known, an experiment in teaching sexual hygiene in the Chicago high schools was tried. After a short time this experiment was given up because of the protests of hypocritical reformers and ignorant, superstitious parents who were afraid that such instruction would spoil the morals of their children.</p>
   <p>Dr. Bundesen has now come out courageously with the demand that [a course in] sexual hygiene be given as part of the school curriculum and that the youth become acquainted with the dangers of "social diseases" which destroy modern society and cause generations of cripples and imbeciles. This demand should be supported by all intelligent, thinking citizens.</p>

   <p>Ignorance is the greatest danger to the morals and health of the youth. The false notion that modesty implies ignorance has probably cost humanity more lives than the last World War. Parents who keep their adolescent children in sexual ignorance commit, unknowingly, a crime against them, just as parents who do not teach their little children to look out for streetcars and automobiles commit a crime against them. If all the parents would take upon themselves this grave duty, then, of course, it would not be necessary to turn over the responsibility to the schools. Unfortunately, it will take some time yet until the masses are sufficiently intelligent. Meanwhile, it is the duty of the public school to take the place of the parents and to teach the youth the elementary rules of sexual hygiene.</p>
