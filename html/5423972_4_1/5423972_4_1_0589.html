   <p>The Chicago Jewry was bitterly provoked by a report published in the Chicago Daily News which throws doubt upon the patriotism of the Chicago Jews.</p>
   <p>According to reports, it was revealed that the local office of the Justice Department summoned Election Commissioner Arthur Luders to appear before a hearing for having uttered unpatriotic expressions about the question of inviting the French Commission to Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Luder is said to to have rebuked Alderman McNuckles, of the 10th Ward, for signing a petition which aimed to call a special meeting of the City Council about inviting the French Commission and Marshall Joffre.</p>
   <p>Luders does not deny this, but when asked why he said it, he answered:
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> "Because McNuckles will soon be a candidate for re-election, and the Jews of his ward disapprove of the whole matter." As soon as the news scattered throughout the city, a great number of Jews called the Courier, asking the editor to express his sharpest protest against Luder's assertion.</p>
   <p>The Jews are patriotic and devoted, body and soul, to the United States Government and are supporting it, in all possible ways in the present war for Democracy against Autocracy.</p>
