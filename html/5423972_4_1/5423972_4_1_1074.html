   <p>There will be a big fair in Maywood--the Cook County and Chicago fair--from Saturday, August 26, to Monday, September 4. Five thousand farmers who live in Cook County will exhibit their products at the fair. You are citizens and residents of this county, as well as Jews. You enjoy the many products produced on the farms near Chicago; you should know more about them. Jewish public affairs should not demand your exclusive interest. It would be news not only to the Jews, but also the the non-Jews, if they were told that Cook County is the greatest and most varied agricultural district in America. The residents of Chicago very rarely think about that part of the county which provides them with a considerable amount of food, and which ships various farm products to other parts of the country.</p>
   <p>You should certainly want to know the role that Cook County plays in providing you with comforts, and with the food you eat. You can find out all about it if <span class="page-break">2</span>you attend the Chicago-Cook County fair. Let as many Jews as possible go and see the fair; let them buy whatever they need and whatever they like. We will thus gain favor in the eyes of the farmer. In order to stimulate your desire to visit the fair, we will tell you a few facts about farming in Cook County so that you can be proud of your neighbors of the field.</p>

These farms annually produce two million bushels of oats, one and one-half million bushels of corn, and one-half million bushels of wheat. Many Cook County wheat fields produced an average of fifty bushels per acre this year.</p>
   <p>The residents of Cook County should know each other. The problems of the farmers are our problems.
