   <p>Unemployment has become a burning question in this city.</p>
   <p>The police, who made an investigation in 27 of the 45 police precincts of Chicago, at the request of the Federal Commission on Industrial Matters, have found 28,231 unemployed persons in these 27 precincts. The unemployed consist of 9,600 tradesmen and 21,377 local residents.</p>
   <p>It is a fact worthy of notice that the city police have undertaken to investigate such a problem. It is quite natural for their facts and figures to be somewhat imperfect, because the police are not amply prepared to understand such a fundamental social problem. It is needless to say that in order to investigate a condition such as this, the city should at least engage people possessing the ability requisite for such an investigation.</p>
   <p>It is not enough to enter a home just to find out if anyone is unemployed.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>It is very important to know what effect unemployment has upon the family, upon the small children, and upon the wife of the unemployed. And if unemployment were investigated in such a fashion, we would be able to see for ourselves the dreadful results that emanate from it. There are thousands of families who have been for many months dependent on relief. Last winter 50,000 persons depended on charities, but this year the condition is far worse.</p>
   <p>The report, nevertheless, proves that all rumors, indicating that most of the unemployed are not local residents, are not true, though the police investigation was made with this intention. Instead of sending out many idlers, they have consolidated the fact that more than 20,000 of the unemployed are local residents.</p>
   <p>This alone is enough to indicate that we are responsible for thousands of lives; that everyone having ample means to live on must remember that, in <span class="page-break">3</span>our midst, human lives are lying about without any work in view; that thousands abandon all hopes for better times. They become so disgusted that even when a ray of hope shines forth, they are unable to make a comeback.</p>
   <p>It is also pointed out that a few thousand unemployed could procure work, but they don't want it. When a bit more serious thought is directed to this matter, one can readily see how unemployment is crippling one's desire to work. We must certainly agree with those who assert that these people, who would rather want charity than work, are a menace, but we must also face the question of what made these people a menace.</p>
   <p>We know that they were all good and useful workers; that they have had, like all of us, human pride and were admirable until unemployment striped them of their work and drove them into the ranks where people depend on the compassion of others; where helplessness becomes so augmented that the former <span class="page-break">4</span>hero, the worker, sinks to the abyss of mendicancy. Habit is second nature. They become so accustomed to this abnormal beggarly life that they become immune to any humiliation. The ugliest platitude about human nature then comes to the man who no longer retains his pride. And the worst phenomenon in city life is unemployment, which brings a person to such a condition. Therefore, everybody ought to feel indebted to those who cannot work. There are adequate penaceas to bring this abasement into a normal state.</p>
   <p>At the same time, however, we must remember that by sending many out of town, or other such enactments, the wrong remedies are applied to this disease of inertness and indolence. Even criminals are now being treated humanely. And the Chief of Police, Gleason, declared that all the cases of crime that have lately occurred have no relationship with unemployment; that of all who have been recently arrested, not one said he was unemployed.</p>
   <p>It is more sensible that these people, if they are lazy, be given light <span class="page-break">5</span>work until they regain their former patience to work, for if they are entirely forsaken, it follows that they are forever destined to lead the same life.</p>
   <p>There is, however, one thing in the police report of unemployment that should be given a great deal of attention, and that is that more than 20,000 unemployed are "foreigners." Particularly, it is important for the Jewish population to understand that, as immigrants, we must cope with this problem rather seriously. Aside from the great number of unemployed within our race, we have also such people as have recently arrived here, and who seek work for the first time. We can easily understand that it is much more difficult for them to find work than it is for some others. That is why unemployment is more widespread among the Jews than among any other group.</p>
   <p>Let us for the moment picture one who encurred a debt for the purpose of coming to this country. In the country he came from he left behind a wife, children, parents, or relatives whom he must support, due to the infinite poverty prevailing abroad. Among other things, he has no command of the <span class="page-break">6</span>language, which renders it difficult for him to find a job.</p>
   <p>Relief for the unemployed in the Jewish community should therefore be more extensive and more effective, because the tribulations are too lamentable to be ignored.</p>
   <p>We hope, however, that conditions will soon brighten up. Work will soon set in the trades in which Jewish workers are engaged. Then the plight of the unemployed will also take a turn for the better.</p>
