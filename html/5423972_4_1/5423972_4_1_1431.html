   <p>Mr. B. Horwich receiver of the Ashland and Twelfth Street Bank, yesterday received a court order to pay a second dividend to the depositors . Mr. Horwich asked the court for permission to pay the depositors who have not filed any clams in accordance with a court decision prior to the payment of the first dividend. The court granted him this request and now all depositors will receive money.</p>
   <p>The exact date when Mr. Horwich will send out a few thousand checks has not yet been decided. The depositors will possibly receive the second dividend before the High Holidays.</p>
   <p>Mr. Horwich will pay out, at this time, $80,000 and this sum will be divided among 4,224 depositors. The first payment of dividends amounted to twenty per cent of their (depositors') deposits. The depositors who failed to file their claims at the [time of the] first disbursement, will now receive forty per cent of their deposits.</p>
