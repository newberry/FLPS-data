   <p>Some twenty nations are charter members of the new born-League. Several others are invited to join, while eight more are not at present permitted to be members. These are the nations that the Allies still consider "The enemy". Mexico and Porto Rico have sinned for various other reasons, but will sooner or later be admitted if they pay the penalty and if their behavior is good.</p>
   <p>One nation was completely forgotten, the Jews. The existence of twelve million Jews was ignored by a group which is going to lay the cornerstone of brotherhood among nations. Nations whose numbers are one-tenth that of the Jews, were invited to be among the first in the League; nations that have no "yesterday," and whose contribution to world's culture is nil, are the favored members, while the one whom the world has to thank for all the ideals of justice, whose prophets have for thousands of years advocated international morals and peace, is excluded from this gathering of nations, which hoists the flag of international justice.</p>
   <p>"Excluded" is not the word for it. At least, had they placed us on the present list of the not-to-be-included group, there would have been some consolation. It would have meant that we, too, are reckoned with. Worse than merely being excluded, above all else, is being actually ignored. We were not privileged to be placed in the ranks of a nation, as Castoria, not to mention such "mighty" nations as Serbia, Czechoslovakia, Siam, etc., which are some of the charter members.</p>
   <p>Naturally, to us they may say that we couldn't expect to be represented in the League, because in sending the invitations only independent nations were considered. The Jewish State exists only on paper, while its independence has not even reached that stage. But in that case, why call it a League of Nations when it should be called a League of States?</p>
   <p>Then again, couldn't an exception to the rule be made and an invitation extended to us, even if we would be placed near the door? Without a doubt, had they so desired, a method could have been found to remove diplomatic objections for inviting the Jewish nation, as has occurred in many other disputes. But this desire was lacking. That's what is so offending, so exceedingly vexing.</p>
   <p>Our provocations increase when we stop to think how much "right" we have to be a member of a league for abolition of war--not to mention our great moral rights--since the basic ideal that gave birth to the League is of Jewish origin. Besides, we have also earned our place in the League by the horrible sacrifices we offered during these terrible war times. Has not the Jewish nation, which was less to blame in the causes of the World War, suffered proportionally more than others? Have not tens of thousands of Jewish soldiers forgotten their own blood in all the battlefields on all fronts? Haven't many Jewish cities been destroyed by fire, bayonets, and pogroms?</p>
   <p>All nations demand reparations for their participation in the war. Jews, too, could have presented a bill of many millions for their losses at the hands of fiends or "friends". They could have demanded the punishment of murderous pogromists in the various eastern countries, just as is being done by the others, although the crimes committed have not been any greater. But Jews have not demanded their due; we seek no revenge and are satisfied with only the permission to permit Jewish war wounds to heal. For this the Jewish nation had a legitimate right to expect an invitation in accordance with promises made us for a national home. This invitation would be the best indication that the League is not built on old diplomatic principles, but entirely upon new ones of actual international justice. It would give unprecedented prestige to the new-born League. But this was not done. When the history of the failures made at the birth of the League of Nations is written, the fact that the Jewish nation was ignored will certainly be recorded among the greatest of them.</p>
