   <p>From all indications, Chicago's quota of $126,000,000 will be oversubscribed.</p>
   <p>At a meeting yesterday evening of Rabbis and synagogue presidents at the home of Judge Fisher, it was resolved that next Saturday, speeches shall be made by all Rabbis, pointing out the importance of Jews buying Liberty Bonds, thereby fulfilling part of their patriotic duty to the country of their adoption.</p>
   <p>All synagogue presidents are called upon to hold meetings of their respective congregations next Sunday to work out plans whereby each synagogue shall receive credit for the Liberty Bonds bought by its members, and thus show what the synagogue is doing for America's Third Liberty Loan.</p>
   <p>On Saturday evening a big automobile parade for the Liberty Loan will be held in the Lawndale neighborhood.</p>
