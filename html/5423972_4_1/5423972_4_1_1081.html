   <p>Mr. Hyman Karalein, the manager of the Farm Finding Bureau of the Jewish Agricultural Society, writes in the Jewish Farmer that most Jewish farm buyers "are in love with farming and like lovers, they are blind." They fail to see its faults and are led astray by quack agents, who are interested primarily in securing their commission.</p>
   <p>Do not be one of the blind ones.</p>
   <p>Before you buy a farm, read Mr. Karalein's advice to future farmers, and secure his personal services free. Save yourself money and worries.</p>
