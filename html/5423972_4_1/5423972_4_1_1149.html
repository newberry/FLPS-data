   <p>A new treatment for the prevention and cure of rabies has been developed by Dr. Maurice L. Blatt, professor of children's diseases at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, and Dr. Samuel J. Hoffman, chief resident physician at the Children's Hospita.</p>
   <p>After more than a year's research, the physicians have developed a serum, which it is hoped, will successfully combat hydrophobia. The principle is the same as that used in the treatment of scarlet fever and diphtheria cases.</p>
   <p>The serum of an immunized animal is used to combat the disease in another animal or human. It is hoped that the Blatt-Hoffman serum will save lives, even after the development of the disease.</p>
