   <p>Here are a few words in the first issue of the Forward, by the President, Mr. Jacob Penkin.</p>
   <p>Up to now we sent our Forward publication from New York, but recently we decided that Chicago was also very much in need of a newspaper which was in sympathy with all labor movements and problems. We can assure our great City of Chicago that the Forward publication will always serve the working classes of this great city in a true and loyal manner.</p>
