   <p>The majority of Jewish young men who volunteer in the Jewish Battalion do so with the feeling that they are helping to win back the ancient Jewish land for the Jewish people. A different feeling, however, governs the native Palestinian Jewish young man. Even now he puts it this way: "I am going to fight for my motherland." He stresses the my. It is his. He was born and raised there. And the alien Turk, who has ruled over that land for such a long time, expelled him from his own home at the very outset of the war.</p>
   <p>And now the young men are returning, as free sons of Palestine, to fight for their homeland. In America they may be few in number, but every able-bodied one of them is going.</p>
   <p>Two such Palestinian youths, natives of Zfath, who recently arrived in America, have already enlisted in the Jewish Battalion and are leaving for Canada on Monday. They are cousins. Two weeks ago we wrote about one of them in the <span class="page-break">\2</span>Courier. He is Harry Cohen, who was banished from his homeland, came to Egypt, enlisted and fought in the English army. The second one is Louis Goldzweig. His father has been a resident of Chicago for almost three years and awaits the first favorable opportunity to return to Zfath.</p>
