   <p>The A. J. Sabbath Campaign Committee has arranged a meeting to be held on the 8th day of the high holidays, for the purpose of having Congressman Sabbath address the Jewish public. He will speak on what he has accomplished since his election to the United States Congress, four years ago.</p>
   <p>Many of our Jewish citizens in Chicago understand and are convinced that our Jewish Congressman, A. J. Sabbath, did wonderful work in the House of Congress. He is most interested and has worked without any let up on the anti-immigration bill, which of course is called the free immigration law, in which all our Jewish countrymen are interested. In addition to this bill in Congress, he is constantly busy with other laws regarding the welfare of our Jewish citizens in the U. S. A.</p>
