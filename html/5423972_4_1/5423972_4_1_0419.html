   <p>The attitude of American Jews at the time of the great crisis, the World War, in which America joined the forces of those powers that fought for freedom and democracy, was such, that none can refute their share of sacrifices on the altar of true patriotism, which is on par with any other foreign group in America. When we speak of Jewish patriotism in America during the war, our purpose is not to defend this statement because American Jews have definitely established their reputation in patriotism. In view of this it would be an insult to present arguments on antiquated accusations of our people. The following is written rather as a memorandum for ourselves. For this purpose we present several facts regarding the attitude of American Jews during war time.</p>
   <p>At an annual meeting of the American Joint Committee, immediately after America had entered the war, the executive committee decided to gather <span class="page-break">\2</span>as much material as possible pertaining to Jewish patriotism in America both military and civil. They rightly foresaw that information of such a character would be of great value to the Jewish people. In accordance with this motion they established a bureau to accumulate this war data, making it accessible to American Jews and to the public in general.</p>
   <p>At the beginning of the year the first reports, from the office of Jewish War Records, were made public. Mr. Levitt is the director of the bureau. Restricted time and limited money made it impossible for the people engaged in this work to complete their survey, and yet this report, a compilation of many worthy facts, can serve as a foundation of a monument to patriotism of American Jews.</p>
   <p>According to the information dated December 31, 1918, in the service of the American Army there was from 150,000 to 200,000 Jews, amounting to four or <span class="page-break">\3</span>five per cent of the total United States Army, which at that time consisted of approximately four million soldiers. When we consider the fact that the Jewish population in America is but three per cent, then we may point with pride to the number of Jewish youths in the Army as a definite proof of our loyalty and devotion to this land. The discharge list of the American Army brings us the fact that Jewish soldiers comprised 3.8% of all the wounded. It shows best that the Jewish soldier never sought to shirk his military duties on the battlefield. In closing this statistical report, director Levitt states the following:</p>
   <p>"It has now become clear, thanks to this worthy information, that the record of Jews in this war, when entirely completed, will establish the fact that American Jews have given their full quota and more to help win this war. The record will show that Jews have willingly enlisted in the army, have fought and died and thus have proven the quality of Jewish loyalty. Jewish soldiers did not need the proof we present. They knew <span class="page-break">\4</span>of the Jewish qualities that have enabled us to survive these hundreds of years, the ability to suffer and endure, the initial ability and elasticity of mind, the ability to organize, and, greatest of all, the idealism of the Jewish people, all of which have made it possible for them to be adjusted in a democratic army that fights for World Democracy. In this they were not mistaken."</p>
   <p>The history of the Seventy-Seventh Division which was trained in Camp Upton, consisted mostly of East Side Jews. This is more than enough to justify the meaning of the previous paragraph concerning the report of the Jewish War Records. Speaking of the heroism of the Lost Battalion on the battlefield, the New York Globe says in its editorial of October 11:</p>
   <p>"If it were said a year ago that these shirt tailors, factory workers, push-cart peddlers, clerks, and others, who at that time flooded the East <span class="page-break">\5</span>Side streets, were capable of withstanding such warfare, an unbelievable smile would cover many faces. But they have proven it! Mockers are asked to stand aside. Yes, there was Jewish patriotism in the war. In less than one generation the Russian Jew displayed his will to uproot every trace of tyranny and oppression under which he lived. He entered the seething pot timorously but emerged a full-grown adult who lost the look of fear and downcast eyes before the insolent German. Democracy does not merely seek to develop the physical strength of a person, but rather his courage. We need no better example of the strong influence of American politics and social institutions than that that it exerted on the East Side Battalion."</p>
   <p>The above refers, of course, to the participation of Jews on the battlefield. Regarding the Jewish populous that remained at home in America, especially the immigrated Jewish populous, we can now say that they too have fully done their duty.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>We do not ask for more attention for the immigrant mother than for the American mother who sent her son to serve her country. We know that the love of the immigrant mother is no more than that of the American. But, the difference lies in this. The American mother knew why her country was fighting and this comforted her to some extent in the loss of her son. She had sacrificed her son on the altar of a great ideal. The immigrant mother, not knowing the language, being a stranger to the entire situation of American ideals, being burdened with heavy daily worries, knew little and understood less of the entire matter. Her sacrifice was therefore greater since she lacked the comforting ideal of the American mother. We have the opinion of such an authority as Major Krauder that the native Americans had twice as many deserters in the army than the foreign-born.</p>
   <p>In all other war activities Jews have done their part together with other immigrants. The success of the sale of the Liberty Bonds among the workers <span class="page-break">\7</span>of the garment industries and the numerous subscriptions from Jewish businessmen is very well known and needs no special mention. . . . .</p>
   <p>Jews have contributed generously with their lives and money at all times they were called upon to do so in the interests of the country and in the defense of their ideals. They were ready at every call. In the last Victory Loan, when the entire population of the land was called upon to help end the "job," it can be recorded with certainty that the Jews of America did not shirk and contributed their share.</p>
