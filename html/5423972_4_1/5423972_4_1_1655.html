   <p>On March 2, the American Symphony Orchestra will play two unique compositions by Mr. Isador Berger, local violinist and composer, inspired by paintings of two Chicago artists, John E. Phillips and John H. Carlsen.</p>
   <p>Mr. Berger's compositions are said to contain the link that joins music and painting. They are musical reproductions of the two paintings worked out artistically and scientifically.</p>
