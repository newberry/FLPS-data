   <p>If you take your citizenship duties seriously (I am convinced that you do), you should not fail to vote tomorrow in the primary elections. You have to express tomorrow your decision as to whom you want and whom you do not want as candidates. If every citizen were interested in political questions and would go to the polls, such scandals as happen now would never happen because people who do not deserve to be elected to high offices would not have been elected. All talk about wiping out corruption is bunk as long as every citizen does not exercise his citizenship rights and does not use the ballot. So tomorrow to the polls and give your votes to the candidates that you like and who you think are the right people for the offices to which they will be elected. If you will do that, you will have no cause to complain later about corruption and graft in our political life.</p>
