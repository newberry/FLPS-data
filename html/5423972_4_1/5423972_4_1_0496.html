   <p>The purchase of a Liberty Bonds does not entail particularly great sacrifice by the buyer for the country which gives him protection, security and liberty; yet the purchase of a Liberty Bond is a sign that the buyer thinks at least about America.</p>
   <p>When he buys a Liberty Bonds he does not give anything away. He merely exchanges money for money, for in time of stress, or when there is a need for funds, the possessor of Liberty Bonds can always obtain money at any bank, using the Liberty Bonds as security. Nevertheless, the fact that he takes the trouble to buy Liberty Bonds has a powerful influence upon his standing in the community. He proves by it not only his loyalty to America, but also his confidence in her promises, his hope and conviction that she will emerge victorious from the heavy war which she is waging for the liberation of mankind from the brutal heritage of the Dark Ages.</p>
