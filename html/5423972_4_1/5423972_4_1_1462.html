   <p>A few days ago we witnessed a parade of thirty-five milk wagons with thirty-five Jewish drivers of the well known Jewish milk firm, the Western Dairy Company, 1443-1445 Edgemont Avenue. The object of this demonstration was to show the Jewish public the growth of the Western Dairy in the past five years. Five years, of course, is not such a long time for a business of this kind, but it has made a wonderful success in this short time. This success is due to the confidence of the Jewish public in the Western Dairy Company.</p>
   <p>This dairy plant has the very latest machinery which turns out perfectly sanitary and pasteurized milk.</p>
