   <p>When the rabbis of Chicago stepped out publicly against the cheap politics of the Jewish Courier, who wanted to deliver the entire community into the hands of a group of politicians, the Courier threatened to take revenge on these rabbis and drive them from the city.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Saul Silber of the Anshe Sholom Congregation is one of the rabbis, whom the Courier wanted to drive out.</p>
   <p>The congregation has just renewed his contract for three years and has raised his salary from one thousand dollars to four thousand and five-hundred dollars annually.</p>
   <p>This illustrates how the Courier is driving out the rabbis from Chicago!</p>
