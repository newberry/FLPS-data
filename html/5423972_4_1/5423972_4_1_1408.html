   <p>Jewish fish dealers have formed a fraudulent organization to monopolize the retail fish trade--and are making use of a boycott to compel the wholesale fish dealers to sell fish only to members of their association. They call this organization the Jewish Fish Dealers Association; and they themselves assume the right to accept or reject as members whomever they please. Thus through their organization, these dealers would be able to squeeze the highest possible prices from the Jewish housewives.</p>
   <p>The following fish dealers refused to join this fish dealers association. They are satisfied to make a reasonable profit in their business, and do not wish to exact exorbitant prices from the Jewish public:, Louis Sugar, 3617 West Twelfth Street, Joe Silberg, 2016 West Division Street, F. Gordon, 2220 Potomac Avenue, <span class="page-break">2</span>I. Albert, 3405 West Sixteenth Street, Esther Whitfield, 1420 South Turner Avenue, Kozinsky, 551 Maxwell Street, R. Weiner, 713 Maxwell Street, Joe Zavetta, 721 Maxwell Street, Max Shapiro, the well known dealer on Maxwell Street.</p>
   <p>Because we do not wish to refuse these retail fish dealers the right to buy from us, at any time, at wholesale prices, the Association is boycotting us, Lakeside Fish Company.</p>
   <p>The Association sought to compel the Lakeside Fish Company to aid in creating exorbitant prices for fish. And because we refused they started a boycott against us among their members.</p>
   <p>The Lakeside Fish Company, however will not use their reputation of fifteen years standing, to help oppress the consumer. We will continue to sell the best fish, at reasonable prices, to any and every dealer in Chicago.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>We invite every fish dealer to come to our wholesale house, where you can buy reasonably enough to permit your to sell at prices that will bring you the patronage and confidence of the retail trade.</p>
