   <p>Benjamin J. Rosenthal is one of our Chicagoans who frequently takes the initiative in various tasks that benefit the community. Six years ago, Mr. Rosenthal drew a great deal of attention to himself when he undertook to secure jobs for persons unable to get any work because of their advanced age. Many persons in this community who had been reduced to begging bread, or to asking charity, were thus, through his efforts, again made self-supporting.</p>
   <p>Now he has a new plan. He has organized a "Chicago Housing Association" to provide homes for working people at cost price. Anyone desiring a home can pay for it in monthly installments. This will eliminate the necessity of moving because there are children in the home, or because the landlord dislikes the tenant. This association will also eliminate the real-estate and loan sharks.</p>
