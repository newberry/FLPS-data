   <p>City Sealer Morris Eller, known to West Side Jewry as the friend of Jewish peddlers, successfully petitioned Mayor Thompson to free in time for the Passover holiday, Jewish prisoners who are in Bridewell. In response to Mr. Eller's request, Mayor Thompson sent him the following:</p>
   <p>Mr. Morris Eller,</p>
   <p>City Sealer.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>Your request that the Jewish prisoners serving in the House of Correction for minor violations of City laws, be acquitted, has been granted.</p>
   <p>Very sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>William H. Thompson, Mayor</p>
