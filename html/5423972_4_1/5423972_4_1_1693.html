   <p>Miss Augusta Cottlow, the young pianist who made such a favorable impression before a large London audience last week, really began her musical career in this city. Not many years ago, Miss Cottlow created a sensation among the musical circles of Chicago. Since that time, strenuous study has vindicated all the early predictions that were made for her future.</p>
   <p>Miss Cottlow was born in 1878 and made her first public appearance when only six years old. She came to Chicago at the age of eight and soon gained a reputation as a musical prodigy. While studying in Chicago, Miss Cottlow appeared in a number of concerts with the Thomas Orchestra.</p>
   <p>She left this country in 1895 to continue her studies abroad. She has been under the direction of many of the most celebrated musical instructors of Europe. She has made a special study of the theory and composition of music under the tutelage of O. W. Boise of Berlin.</p>
   <p>Miss Cottlow will return to America in the fall and will tour the country in concert.</p>
