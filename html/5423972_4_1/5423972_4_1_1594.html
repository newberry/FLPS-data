   <p>At last, Odessa Female Cantor comes to Chicago, in a grand concert, Sunday afternoon, April 24th, the second day of Pessach, at the Ashland Auditorium.</p>
   <p>Mme Sophia Kurtzer.</p>
   <p>the great sacred singer and the only female Cantor in the world, took New York by storm. At all her concerts in New York thousands were turned away because of the rush for seats and the great anxiety to hear her sacred hymn.</p>
   <p>All who want the pleasure of hearing the Odessa Female Cantor should be prepared with tickets on time.</p>
   <p>In the same concert, the great violinist and composer, J. Piastra Borisoff, will be heard.</p>
   <p>Tickets for reserved seats are priced at 75Â¢, $1.00, $1.50, and $2.00. This is the biggest concert of the season, and the female cantor's only concert in Chicago.</p>
