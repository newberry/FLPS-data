   <p>Captain Milton J. Foreman, the regular Republican candidate for Alderman of the Fourth Ward, was born in Chicago, January 26, 1863. He attended the public schools of this city until his thirteenth year, and then set out to earn his livelihood. His first position was with Keith Bros., wholesale hat and cap merchants, with whom he remained twenty-five years. At the end of this period, he engaged in the practice of law. He is now a member of the firm of Felsenthal, D'Ancona, and Foreman.</p>
   <p>Captain Foreman has for many years been an officer in the Illinois National Guard, belonging to the Cavalry unit. At the beginning of the war with Spain, he offered his services to the government, and was appointed quarter master of the First Illinois Volunteer Cavalry, with the rank of a captain.</p>
   <p>As soon as he was mustered out of service, Capt. Foreman organized the Independent Anti-Boodle League and was appointed chairman of that body. Capt. Foreman did his work so well that he received the thanks and praises of our <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>leading citizens. The defeat of the Railway Corporations' plans can be attributed as much to his energetic action and his wisdom as to any other cause.</p>
