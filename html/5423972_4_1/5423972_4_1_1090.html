  <p>A heart-rendering tragedy happened last Sunday in Chicago.</p>
  <p>There lived at 1868 Orchard Street a family of three persons--a machinist by the name of Edward Snyder, his wife, and his two-year-old son. The landlord had told them to move on the first of May and the family began to look for a new dwelling. Mr. Snyder searched for a flat on Sundays, on weekdays after work, whenever he had some free time. He could not think of anything else. The problem of a new dwelling weighed upon him as a heavy yoke.</p>
  <p>Last Sunday, Mr. Snyder, instead of resting, looked again for a dwelling, as he usually did on Sundays. He came home in the evening dead tired. He looked at his wife with a glance full of despair. "It is a waste of effort," he said to his wife, with a gesture of despair; "they do not want our child.
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> Most of the time they ask a price which is far above our means. Whenever it happens that the price is suitable, they ask me if we have any children, and when they learn that we have a little boy they shut the door in front of me."</p>
   <p>Mrs. Snyder realized that a flat must be found, no matter what. She comforted her husband, told him not to despair, stay at home and rest, and watch over the baby while she went out to search for an apartment.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Snyder returned home late at night, empty-handed, dead tired. She saw her neighbors gathered around her house. They smelled gas coming out from her house. They knocked at the door. The door was locked, Police broke the locked doors and found the house full of gas. Mr. Snyder was sitting on a chair with his son on his lap. Both were dead. The embittered neighbors told the police that Mr. Snyder did not have to worry any more about a place for himself and his baby. Mrs. Snyder sat in a corner and was quietly weeping.</p>

   <p>This is the tragedy that happened last Sunday. It is a story that is known to thousands of people. Thousands of people undergo the same torture every Sunday of looking for a flat and coming home dead tired, empty-handed. The high price of flats is the obstacle most often encountered. Small children are another obstacle. It sometimes happens that the apartment which can be had is located in a dirty neighborhood or in a run-down old building.</p>
   <p>Thousands of people, I have said, undergo the same torture of looking for a dwelling. It is their had luck if their search does not end in the same way as that of Mr. Snyder. He, at least, will not have to worry any more about a home.</p>
   <p>It happens quite often that whenever a tragic event occurs people begin to think, to seek a cause, to investigate. Maybe people will begin now to think about the causes of last Sunday's tragedy, maybe. And maybe the event will pass by unnoticed as many other tragic events that happen daily in a big city. Because, after all, what is there to investigate? Don't we know <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the situation? Was it not sufficiently investigated as yet?</p>
   <p>A number of societies in Chicago investigated the housing problem during the last few years and even during the last few months. What they found out is a terrible indictment against our society, against our entire system. The various investigating committees, basing themselves upon the facts they found out, have already foretold what will happen if we let things remain as they are. Maybe the people listened to this, maybe they did not--but the situation remains the same.</p>
   <p>The City Home Association, an organization that is supported by social workers and college professors, foretold twenty-four years ago, in 1900, what will happen if we let everything remain unchanged. No attention has been paid to it.</p>
   <p>The City Home Association has made a wide, all-embracing investigation, with the full support of all the persons who are behind it. The Association has not <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>discovered anything new, but it can back up its findings with facts and it has everything marked down in black and white.</p>
   <p>The Association has confirmed the fact that more than one half of the residents of Chicago live in a small area which is full of the worst kind of houses. The overcrowded condition in that area is not to be found in any other city in America, not even in New York. This means that, even if we take into consideration that in Chicago the tenements are not as tall as in New York, Chicago is as crowded as the latter.</p>
   <p>The committee has noted: The conditions of the tenements on Union Street are terrible; it is dark and terribly dirty on Maxwell Street; on 13th Street are to be found bad, cheap tenements with bad, cheap, narrow, and dirty entrances; on Ashland Avenue the garbage is to be found on the sidewalks, and so on.</p>
   <p>The houses are dark, dirty, and foul-smelling. The windows are obstructed by the walls of other houses, so that no air comes in. People live in cellars, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>in holes. Houses are not being repaired. People live in dilapidated buildings where it is even dangerous to keep animals. It is overcrowded. Were the entire city of Chicago as densely populated as the tenement districts, says the committee, the entire population of the United States, one hundred and fifteen million, could find a home there.</p>
   <p>Children must be kept on the streets, as a result of this overcrowded condition. They stay on the streets till bedtime. Even if a tenant wants to keep clean, he cannot do so. The very air is poisoned. Everybody is nervous. There is no privacy because everybody knows what is going on in his neighbor's house. Is there any wonder that criminals grow up in such an atmosphere?</p>
   <p>The same Association says that there are in Chicago about three hundred thousand women who work in offices and factories. Most of them live alone in a room. The earnings of the women are very small but for a furnished room they have to pay the same price as anybody else. A decent room cannot be had for less than six or eight dollars a week. The rental amounts often to one <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>half of the earnings. Is there any wonder that under such conditions vice is blooming?</p>
   <p>The Board of Health, in its annual reports, confirms these facts and says that something should be done. But nothing is being done.</p>
   <p>Chicago is a city of ill repute in the world. Housing experts have given out a report in England about the conditions in Chicago. The report says that houses in the crowded districts of Chicago are being built without any supervision. Nobody ever thinks about the health of the tenant, about his need of cleanliness, about creating for him an atmosphere where he should be able to bring up his children in the proper moral spirit. The experts of Europe take Chicago as an example of how a city should not be run. Nowhere in Europe, even in the poorest cities, in cities which do not possess even a small part of Chicago's riches, prevail such conditions as in Chicago. Nowhere in the world are there such terrible alleys as in Chicago. Many European cities build themselves cheap and sanitary houses whenever there is a big <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>housing shortage. Nearly every big city in Europe is doing it.</p>
   <p>The situation in Chicago has been known for a long time but nothing is being done and the situation keeps on getting worse and worse.</p>
   <p>A tragedy like the one that happened last Sunday to the Snyder family should not be let by without anything being done about it. However, let me ask you this: Of what importance is one suicide among the great many murders and suicides that happen day in and day out?</p>
