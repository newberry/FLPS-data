   <p>Years ago, Jewish citizens did not want to vote, and gave the bother of casting a ballot over to the political jobholders. If an individual did vote, he did not do so because he felt it his duty as a citizen, to voice his opinion in governmental affairs, but because his precinct captain had asked him to do so. How can one turn down a fellow Jew when it is a question of his "bread and butter"? And when a precinct captain asks a Jew to vote, he always has his own bread and butter in mind.</p>
   <p>Things have changed quite a bit recently. Jews have begun to understand the significance of their vote and know what they can do to raise the prestige of the Jewish population nationally as well as locally. Nowadays, we see respectable Jews come to the polling places of their own free will and accord. But under what circumstances do they do this? They appear at <span class="page-break">\2</span>a regular election, when it is a question of electing a president, a governor or a city mayor, i. e., when the voters have to elect the party; at such a time, the Jewish voters manifest an intense interest. However, when it is a matter of a primary election, i. e., when the cardinal issue is the election of persons to represent the party, then Jews are still as indifferent and as apathetic about casting their votes as they were in the good old times.</p>
   <p>The intelligent citizen knows that the primary election is, in many respects, far more important than the regular election, particularly in local elections. The question as to which party shall rule the country affects the interests and the policies of all of America. In each community and in each state, this question is not quite as significant. Here it is mostly a matter of which crowd shall be in office and which, out of office. In local affairs, the party plays a very minor role. The character of the candidate is of greater importance in local elections. The city or county administration is just as qualified and just as honest as the persons who administer those offices--no more and no less. And the primary election is actually the <span class="page-break">\3</span>election to nominate the persons rather than the party which shall rule.</p>
   <p>Besides this, it is necessary to know that whereas the high officers of the state and of the United States, the leaders of the parties, place more emphasis on the party elections, the minor officers who hold jobs and positions, lay greater stress on the primaries, because one who fails to be nominated in the primaries, cannot run for office. The nominees must, necessarily, look respectfully at the citizens who have used their power and right, through their vote in the primary election, to say who shall run for office and who shall not. And in the same measure, they will disregard the citizens who ask, why primaries?, and who leave the work of deciding who shall run for public office, up to others.</p>
   <p>There is more prestige in the nominating power than in the power of electing a person to office, because the nomination is the first step toward the election to office.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>When citizens do not vote in the primary elections, they are giving over the power of nominating candidates to a few political bosses who control the political organization. This action negates the liberal primary laws which various states have adopted in order to give the people the opportunity to decide who shall govern them, instead of leaving it up to a few bosses.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we say to our Jewish citizens, "Vote today in the primaries!" Your state, your county, your city will determine today who shall be the candidates for the important offices. Go and indicate which candidates you think are eligible to run for governor, for assessor, for judge, and for representative. Your opinion is important. If you are not familiar with all the candidates, ask questions about them. Vote for anyone you please, but do not stand aloof from the primary election. It is an important election.</p>
