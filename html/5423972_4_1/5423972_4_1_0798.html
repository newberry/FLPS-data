   <p>The planned strike of the butchers was avoided yesterday, when the employers became frightened and signed a contract with the Union, granting the exposed conditions.</p>
   <p>The Butchers' Union, Local 598, has therefore celebrated a victory over the Hebrew Butchers' Association, which closed an agreement in which the workers have, among other clauses, won the following:</p>
   <p>A raise of three dollars a week for all workers; pay for all Jewish holidays; the complete recognition of the Union; Union signs in all stores; the working hours shall be from two to six on legal holidays and the working hours on regular working days are: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, from 6 until 6; Thursday from 6 to 11; Friday from 6 to 2; Saturday evening until 11; Sunday from 6 until 2 P.M.</p>
   <p>At present there remains a few small butchers who do not belong to the Butchers' Association and have, as yet, not settled. However, the Union is certain that they will follow the examples of the majority.</p>
