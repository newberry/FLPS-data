   <p>The nearer we get to Friday, March 13,--the last day on which independent candidates for aldermen can enter the race,--the more glutted becomes the political market with independent candidates, just as if Chicago has become strongly impartial in municipal government.</p>
   <p>It is certainly the most ardent wish of the better class of citizens in Chicago that the role of national party programs should not play an important part in the election of aldermen. Everyone to whom the city interests are dear, eagerly awaits the time when the city leaders will divert more attention to their duties and to the interests of the city than to the party with which they are connected.</p>
   <p>This is why various independent candidates for aldermen receive support from the best citizens of their respective wards. But not always are the independent candidates independent. Unfortunately, many declare themselves as <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>independent candidates, when in reality they are bound by a tether to some fraction of a party. These candidates are still worse than party candidates. After a certain fraction is defeated in the Primaries, it seeks redress on election day through a candidate who runs as an independent. Such a candidate should not get the support from good citizens. Such a candidate manifests irresponsibility and is not true to the citizens. On election day may the citizens prove that they can not be duped.</p>
