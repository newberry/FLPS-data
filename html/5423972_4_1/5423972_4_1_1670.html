   <p>This coming Sunday evening November 12th, the Hebrew Institute will present one of the most interesting concerts of the season. Mr. Morris Tortinsky is the instigator of this program. The readers of the Jewish Courier, no doubt are well acquainted with this talented young man. He is a great singer classed with a rich baritone voice. We hope that our Jewish public will extend him a helping hand in his undertaking.</p>
   <p>Together with him, we expect to present the well known violinist, Alexander Zshookowsky and also the Miss Mandelbaum, who is a well known Chicago pianist and Miss Gertrude Samuelson, who has a beautiful soprano voice. These two artists need no introduction to the Jewish people of Chicago. They are known here, for they have been heard on different concerts before.</p>
