   <p>That, which was said, a year or two ago, about the Jewish activities in war, can not be repeated now in order to avoid error against the reality which has radically and completely changed.</p>
   <p>Thanks to the two Russian revolutions (especially to the second) the character and object of war have completely changed. That, which was, at the beginning of the war, wrapped in and covered with fogs of secret diplomacy and immortalized by the patriotic song "Holy Alliance," has recently shown its true form. The World War, which at the beginning was carried on mainly against "barbarism" has recently proven its true class and business character and due to this discovery, which was inevitable, the purpose of the war also changed. The enemy is entirely different now and is not only found on "the other side of the trenches" but also at home.</p>
   <p>A "new" war is now being carried on by all liberal sides in all countries against the "new enemy," who has, until now, been disguised in various ways. Today there is a discovery of a new goal for humanity. It is also clear, due to the above <span class="page-break">2</span> mentioned fact, that the Jewish activities in the World War ought to adopt a different character.</p>
   <p>New movements, fresh currents are in motion now, and move on noisily in the lives of the nations. It is also readily understood that the Jews, as a touchy and nervous element, shall take an active and enthusiastic part in every movement which is created by and on account of ideal motives.</p>
   <p>It must be pointed out here, that when speaking of the Jewish activities in war, the Jewish race as a whole, with entirely different national policies, is not meant. The Jewish race, as a whole, had only played a mournful, unthankful role of an innocent victim in war. The Jewish race was not in favor of war and yet unwillingly it has suffered terribly from the war.</p>
   <p>Essentially, when speaking of an active Jewish part and influence upon war, it is only the individual Jews, who have - thanks to their ability and capital - influenced, to a certain degree, the tragic happening of the present time. It suffices to say such names as Rufus Isaac, Lord Reading, Folin, Joseph Rheiniech, in order to form an idea about the "Jewish" cooperation in the war.</p>

   <p>These above mentioned prominent Jews belong to the "cream" of our assimilated great bourgeoisie. It must be added, also, that many of our assimilants have taken a much milder and liberal part in war. The position was a loyal one, so to speak, and our loyal patriots often cast a merciful veil upon us. How hypocritical this loyalism may not be, it still contains a pure and naive form.</p>
   <p>With the young Frederick Adler's shot, the second and new chapter of the Jewish activities in war begins. This shot is the first manifestation of the young, revolutionary Jewish generation. The first "word" of the modern, as well as the assimilated revolutionary Jews. Now we understand that this was the first reflection of bolshevism in which the assimilated Russian-Jewish youth takes such as prominent part. Together with Russian bolshevism, a new portion of Jewish activities begin...... a new list of Jewish names is now being uttered by everybody.</p>
   <p>The Jewish individual did not refrain from saying his word in the revolutionary epoch of the war. In the new period of Jewish leadership in Russia, Trotsky's name is, without doubt, the most brilliant and popular. The young Russian-Jewish journalist, together with his extreme ideals, proves to the world that his <span class="page-break">4</span>political abilities are typically Jewish. In his ultimatum to all democracies, can be seen a sharp analytical Jewish mind.</p>
   <p>In our Jewish history, Trotsky's name may be placed on the same file with the names of Beaconfield, La Salle, etc. In one word - Trotsky's name will be included on the list of our great world renowned Jewish politicians.</p>
