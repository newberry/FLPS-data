   <p>The city ordinance, that the street peddlers be prohibited from calling out their wares and goods on the streets, will have quite an effect on the Chicago street peddlers and on their livelihood. It will hinder thousands of peddlers from their regular routine of making an honest living. Therefore, we, the Chicago Peddlers Protective Association, must protest most vigorously against such unfair treatment by our City Council and we immediately make this announcement for a mass meeting for all the street peddlers, to be held at the West Side Auditorium, Sunday, December 28, at 2 P. M. We expect to have some very prominent people at the mass meeting, who will explain as to how to go about in the making of the protest against the unfair law of the City Council. No peddler who has his family's welfare at heart, should fail to come to this mass meeting.</p>
   <p>Respectfully</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
