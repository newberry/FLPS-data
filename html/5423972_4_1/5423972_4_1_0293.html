   <p>The Political Work for Hugo Pam.</p>
   <p>It is certainly gratifying to notice enthusiastic groups of Jews gathered on the different streets of the West Side discussing the importance of the coming election. The choice for the office of Superior Judge of Cook County seems to be Mr. Hugo Pam. Meetings are arranged to be held in Synagogues, Lodges and at other different Societies and Organizations, with the main object in view of having Mr. Pam address the Jewish public at the various meetings.</p>
   <p>It is also gratifying to know that the best class of Jews on the West Side are participating in the various Jewish activities, socially, politically, and other wise. They are concentrating all their efforts, not only to elect Mr. Pam, but also to give him the biggest majority of any candidate on the ticket. There is no doubt that Mr. Pam is a suitable candidate for the Judgeship. His energy is tremendous. The Chicago Bar is recommending him most highly for the position. There is hardly his equal in the knowledge of Law, his honor, his temperament and his natural feeling of justice to all. There is no doubt that he will make the most talented Judge In Cook County. Since his nomination, everybody one speaks with, admits that he is the right man for the job.</p>
