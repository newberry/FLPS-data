   <p>At a conference of Methodist ministers, held at Springfield, Ill., resolutions were adopted against war. Representatives from the entire state, elected at local conferences in every city and village, participated. A large majority of the ministers were against war in any form. The resolutions adopted at this state conference, by a large majority, is keener and more trenchant than the anti-war resolutions adopted at their local conferences.</p>
   <p>The fanatical patriots cannot conceive the idea that representatives of a church should speak in the same manner as do the socialists and radicals.</p>
   <p>These patriotic ministers know that it is not suitable to state publicly that they are in favor of war. Fearing to oppose war openly, they try at least to make a little concession, proposing that the conference adopt a resolution in favor of war as a defensive measure. This resolution was immediately tabled by a majority of the delegates.</p>

   <p>The action of the clergy becomes more interesting as we read the individual clauses of the anti-war resolution which they adopted. One of the clauses, for instance, reads thus: "We are in favor of starting a wide spread educational campaign among our members to acquaint them with the causes and effects of war. We also agree to abolish the causes of war."</p>
   <p>Perhaps you think that the pious clergy, who do not attend socialist meetings nor read socialist literature, do not know the actual causes of war. If so, listen and judge for yourself.</p>
   <p>"We are in favor of abolishing the three main factors that lead to war; greediness in Chauvinistic nationalism, economic imperialism, and militarism."</p>
   <p>One of the patriotic ministers said, how can we preach against war when the American Constitution distinctly reads that Congress shall have the right and power to declare war? Wouldn't it be against the Constitution? We the clergy, who are for prohibition and look upon all against it as "bootleggers," will be <span class="page-break">3</span>in the same position of "bootleggers" if Congress declare war and they are against it.</p>
   <p>This argument had not the slightest influence on the clergy, and the antiwar resolution was adopted by a large majority. The same action was recommended to the coming national convention of all representatives of this church.</p>
