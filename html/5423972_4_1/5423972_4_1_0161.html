   <p>After eight years of Republican rule in the city, it looks as if we are going to have a Democratic mayor after the election on April 3.</p>
   <p>Jewish leaders and the Jewish public will pay an important part in the election of April 3, and the trend of the Jewish vote is unmistakably towards Dever and the other Democrats. The prestige and power connected with the office of the Sanitary District Trustee, to which Michael Rosenberg was recently elected, and the Alderman of the largest Jewish ward in the city, to which office Jacob Arvey has just been chosen. Alderman Kostner, always a force with Jewish voters, and the other Democratic leaders, will all be concentrated for the election of the Democratic candidates.</p>
   <p>We should like to see Dever and his fellow candidates elected, if only to put an end to the Republican scandals, plots, and counterplots, with which the city has been afflicted and which have passed the point of endurance.</p>
