   <p>This is the name of a Jewish young man, who is a candidate for County Commissioner, on the Independent ticket, November the 3rd. Mr. Lobel was born in Romany, Roumania 30 years ago, of parents who are known far and wide as great scholars and religionists.</p>
   <p>His father, Mr. Berl Leile Lobel, was one of the Jews to whom the Alliance Israelite of Paris had appealed immediately after the Russian-Turkish war, at the time of the Berlin Treaty to collect all material power possible, in order to have the expenses necessary to obtain political and civil rights for all Jews in Roumania.</p>
   <p>He was also a civic leader and was respected, for his honesty by everyone.</p>
   <p>Mr. Lobel was one of the young men, whose souls rebelled against the hatred and intolerance of Roumanians toward Jews. He organized a group of young emigres, who had forsaked the cursed country and emigrated to America-the land of Freedom.</p>
