   <p>Congressman Sabbath talks on immigration and Candidate Judge Hugo Pam speaks on the future of Jewish youth. About 1000 young men and women gathered last evening to listen to the able address of Congressman Sabath and Judge Hugo Pam. This was the first of a series of meetings sponsored by the Homeword Club of the order Knights of Zion this winter.</p>
   <p>The best orators were invited to speak after the lecture. The young folks will participate in music and dancing. However, at this first meeting there was no dancing, but the public is assured of music and dancing at the next gathering.</p>
   <p>After sizing up the crowd according to the way they showed their interest, by setting spellbound for 3 hours listening to the speakers, one must conclude that this is the cream of the Jewish youth. They applauded the speakers stormily for explaining the future needs of the Jewish youth.</p>
   
   <p>The program started with a vocal solo by Miss Clara Bookhalter. She was applauded repeatedly, and had to re-appear on the platform more than once. After that solo the superintendent of the Institute spoke on the Jewish immigration question, his opinion being that this is a question of distribution, and he recommended the formulation of a plan to distribute the immigrants in territories where they will be most needed.</p>
   <p>Congressman Sabbath was then introduced. He spoke for over an hour and the audience was very much interested in his address. He explained the question of immigration by stating that it is not anything new. The origin of this question dates back to the time of Adam and Eve. In closing his address he spoke on the immigration laws in America of the last hundred years.</p>
   <p>Congressman Sabbath, with the consent of Chairman Mr. Wolff, introduced Hon.Hugo Pam. In the introduction he stated that he knew Mr. Pam when he first came here as a young immigrant, poor and alone in this great free America, and from this humble beginning young Pam became a Congressman. He befriended me, said Mr. Sabbath, not as a democrat, but as a Jew. Therefore it is my double pleasure to introduce this poor immigrant boy who became congressman and now is a candidate for Judge of the Superior Court. We now, both of us stand here before this intelligent Jewish audience, with the assurance that you will forget our being a Democrat or a Republican. for all I know is that we are both Jews, and when the election comes you will cast your vote for Hugo Pam and recommend your friends to do the same.</p>
