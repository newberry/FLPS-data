   <p>One year after July 28, 1914, a day that will always be remembered as the day when the greatest war in the history of humanity began a children's peace society, consisting of boys and girls of the Sabbath and Sunday school, was organized in the Hebrew Institute. This children's organization took an oath to strive for everlasting peace. Each member of the society took the following vow: "I take it upon myself to abide by the peace call, to establish peace at home, in school, at work, at play or any place where life may lead me; to influence other children to go on peacefully, and ever to strive for peace, and earnestly believe that it will materialize. We will beat our swords into plowshares, and one will never raise a hand against another, and will never learn of war."</p>
   
   <p>The children of this peace society are students from the various classes in the Institute, principally from the Sabbath and Sunday schools. The main purpose is to instill in their hearts hatred for war and love for universal peace. At a meeting of the Sabbath school teachers it was made clear that when children are being taught Biblical history it is advisable to underestimate the Jewish war heroes that are so highly spoken of in the Sabbath school, and instead, to evoke a sentiment for peace. Instead of encouraging the children to follow the example of the Maccabees, they should be led to hope for the prophecy of Elijah to materialize.</p>
   <p>This peace society is not only against war, but against disharmony and quarrels among friends, neighbors, etc. They have also taken it upon themselves not to quarrel with anyone, and to root out enmity, not only against their own race, but among humanity in general, to be friendly to live creatures, to love nature and to live with the thought of peace.</p>
   
   <p>We, the leaders of the Institute, realize that peace throughout the world can be accomplished only when all the children throughout the world will be taught, how to bring about peace in the world. They should be taught to understand that wars and all other military controversies must be abolished. We feel it is our duty, and the duty of all teachers and social leaders to prepare the children to play their role in this life drama to repel everything that is not good and to strive only for everything that is good for the world.</p>
   <p>Among the facts against war, which the children of the Hebrew Institute had explained to them, was that published by the New York Peace Society: "Military experts have figured out that a modern battleship costs about $12,000,000; the upkeep of this ship costs $800,000 a year; a battleship lasts about twenty years. This amounts to $28,000,000 for just one battleship."</p>
   
   <p>This money, being used to put human beings to death could be used to a much better advantage. It could, for example, build and maintain fifty manual training schools for 75,000 children a year; or build a straight highway from Chicago to New York, or establish 7,000 farms at $4,000 each, on which 35,000 people could live; or 14,000 men and women could get college educations at $500 a year each, for four years.</p>
   <p>The Library of Congress at Washington, perhaps the finest in the world, cost less than half as much as a battleship, and maintaining it costs only three-quarters the amount of that of maintenance of the battleship.</p>
   <p>The money that a few battleships cost if it were used in a campaign against tuberculosis in a large city like Chicago or New York, would almost stamp out this horrible disease.</p>
   
   <p>In the last few years we have read a good deal about widening the Mississippi River from St. Paul to New Orleans which would cost only a million dollars less than two battleships. This improvement would create wonderful opportunities for business and industry for the entire country.</p>
   <p>If these facts were explained to American children and in course of time to all the children in the world, we would in twenty or thirty years realize that the time had come, when our wealth, used for productive, humane and educational purposes instead of for destructive war preparations, would bring better results.</p>
   <p>For the time being the children of all the peace clubs throughout the United States are donating their pennies for Jewish war sufferers.</p>
