   <p>It seems as though America is a man's country. We do not see any women in American politics, but when it comes to a question of women and courts, America is a veritable matriarchy, a woman's kingdom. A woman murdered her husband in a brutal manner and was acquitted. Another woman murdered her lady friend with a hammer, was sentenced to ten years in prison, and escaped. Had the murderer been a man, he could not have escaped. In the State of Illinois, no jury will convict a woman murderer. A woman seems to have the privilege of killing.</p>
   <p>Congress is now busy with an anti-lynch bill. A bill to give men equal rights with women in America is more urgent. In America, men do not have as many rights as women. This is not only contrary to the spirit of the Declaration of Independence--it is a loathsome situation.</p>
