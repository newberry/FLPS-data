   <p>A list of candidates who are running for city offices, and for whom the Jewish Courier is recommending to vote for at the April 6 election.</p>
   <p>Tuesday, April 6, is election day in Chicago. There is going to be election of aldermen, city clerk, and city treasurer. Chicago citizens must vote for the candidates who are capable men, and are able to fulfill the duties and obligations demanded from them as city servants. Along with the ballot which the citizen will receive at the polling place, he will also get a "Small Ballot" in which the citizen will be called upon to vote whether or not the city of Chicago should build a tuberculosis sanitarium, where those who are afflicted with tuberculosis, and are poor, should be admitted free of charge for an indefinite period, whether for a cure or confinement.</p>

   <p>On the Republican ticket for city clerk, we find Mr. Jacob Marks, The Daily Jewish Courier, takes pleasure to recommend him to all Jewish voters. Mr. Marks is a Jew deserving respect and attention from all citizens of the city through his decent and honest behavier. And for that reason he was selected by all Republican factions as their candidate, and fought to have him on their ticket. There is, therefore, no doubt that every Jewish voter is going to vote for him next Tuesday, whether they are Republicans or Democrats.</p>
   <p>Jewish citizens who are democrats and voted democratic in the last Primaries, will have a chance now to vote for Mr. Marks. He must get all Jewish votes, inorder to show the local Republicans that the Jewish citizen knows how to appreciate their gesture by letting a Jewish citizen run on their ticket, for such an important office as city clerk. And when you vote for Mr. Jacob H. Marks, for city clerk, don't forget also to vote for Mr. Isaac Paul, the Republican candidate for city treasurer.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Mr. Paul has been connected for the last fifteen years with the Election Commission, and through his earnest work as election commissioner, he made numerous friends all over the city. Everybody ought to see that he shall be elected to the responsible and important office of city treasurer.</p>
   <p>Since Mr. Paul has been connected with the Election Commission, he did a lot of favors to many Jews, and made many friends amongst them by doing so. They must not forget to vote for him a day after tomorrow. Those that had no occasion to know Mr. Paul personally, should also vote for him. He is a man who appreciates and never forgets when somebody does him a favor.</p>
   <p>In some wards of the city, there are quite a number of candidates running for aldermen, especially in those wards that are populated by Jews. Although they have no opponents, and would surely be elected, even without Jewish votes, yet it is advisable for the Jewish voter not to forget them and vote for them, too. Almost all of these men have been serving the city for many years, and have done much to beautify the densely populated districts of the city, as will as to satisfy those people living in them.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>In the Ninth Ward, Mr. Denis Egan is the Democratic candidate for the alderman. He is running for re-election, and has no opponent from the Republican party. Where as Mr. Egan has proven to be a good alderman, and has done much for his ward, it is more than right that all Jewish citizens living in that ward should vote for him.</p>
   <p>In the Tenth Ward, Mr. Thomas P. Scully is running for re-election for alderman on the Democratic ticket. Jewish citizens of that ward voted for him last time, and should vote for him again this time. He has shown that he respects Jewish citizens who live in his ward.</p>
   <p>In the Eleventh Ward, a Jewish young man is running for alderman on the Republican ticket. His name is Abraham R. Feifer, who is a successful real estate man, and has his office at 455 W. 12th Street. Mr. Feifer came here years ago as a Rumanian Jewish immigrant.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>He worked himself up, and became a successful business man through hard work, and honest undertakings. His election to the City Council would show that Jews know how to reward one of their brethren, and if all Jewish citizens in the Eleventh Ward would vote for Mr. Feifer, he would have a good chance to defeat his Democratic opponent.</p>
   <p>In the Twelfth Ward, we find Mr. Michael Zimmer, running for re-election on the Democratic ticket. Mr. Zimmer lives at 1042 21st Place. He is in the real estate and insurance business. He is forty five years of age, and is finishing his fourth term as member of the City Council. His record as alderman is splendid. It is necessary, therefore, that Jewish citizens in that ward should help him to be re-elected as alderman.</p>
   <p>In the same ward, Mr. Anton Cermak, is running for alderman on the Democratic ticket. He is running for a short term only. Mr. Cermak has been a member of the Legislature for four terms, and did some significant work there for the population of this state. If you vote for him as alderman, you would know that you did your duty as citizens. Don't forget to vote for Mr. Zimmer and Mr. Cermak.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>In the Fifteenth Ward, Mr. Henry Utpotel is running for alderman on the Republican ticket. Mr. Utpotel lives at 604 N. Sacramento Avenue. He is a well known lawyer, born in Chicago, and made a name for himself far and wide in the North side through his honesty. Mr. Utpotel was indorsed by his party and by the Municipal Voter's League. It would be mere than right that Jewish citizens in that ward should vote for him, because he is a friend of the Jews. If he is elected to the City Council, he would do a lot of good and necessary work.</p>
   <p>In the Nineteenth Ward, John Powers, the well known alderman is running for re-election. His opponent is a certain Mr. Bonelli, who has no chance to be elected. But the Jewish citizens of that ward should not forget to vote for Mr. Powers, because he does a lot of good for the welfare of the Jews living there.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>In the Third Ward, we find Alderman Milton J. Foreman running for re-election. Mr. Milton Foreman has been one of those men who helped in the work of putting Chicago in an enviable position, as an industrial center. The Jewish citizens in that ward should support him by voting for him; thus to show him that they are proud of him.</p>
   <p>And now, no Jewish citizen must not forget to vote "Yes," in the Small Ballot, for a city sanatorium for tubercular people. Jews in particular have a reason for voting "Yes" in the Small Ballot, because the majority of Jewish citizens live in densely populated districts where the dangers of tuberculosis are lurking on all sides. They ought to see that permission should be granted, to the city to build such a sanatorium. It must get the vote of everybody.</p>
   <p>As the election day would take place on Tuesday, April 6, the first day of Passover, and whereas many Jewish voters wouldn't care to write on a holiday, they should go into the Polling places and request the Election Judge, or Clerk to mark the ballot for them. In voting this way, everybody would know that he did his duty as a conscientious and true citizen.</p>
