   <p>Email Liebling's "Kensignton Waltzes" have just been published by Oliver Ditson &amp; Co. This is the composition which received favorable mention in the New York Herald music contest last year.</p>
   <p>"Butterflies," an operetta by the Chicago composer, Carl Koelling, was produced for the first time on any stage at the Carl Schultze Theater in Hamburg, April 11. The work met with immediate success, the Hamburg critics praising both music and libretto in high terms. The plot deals with both fairyland and earth, and the music is said to possess a melodic beauty, a life and sparkle worthy of a Johann Strauss.</p>
