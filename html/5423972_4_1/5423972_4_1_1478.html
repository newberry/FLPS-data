   <p>We take this method in letting our Jewish public in Chicago know of our matzoh factory located at 512 S. Halsted street and offices at 250 Maxwell street.</p>
   <p>We manufacture our matzohs for the Passover holidays, under the strict supervision of Chicago's most pious Rabbis. The flour is of the very finest and best that could be procured. We have the finest matzoh baking machinery of the most modern make, with a capacity of over ten-thousand pounds per day.</p>
   <p>We invite the public to visit our factory as it is always open to the public for inspection and you can assure yourselves of its cleanliness and how tasty the matzohs come out of the ovens. Each package of matzohs bears the union label and we are now accepting deposits on matzoh orders, with the assurance of fresh and crisp matzohs at the time of delivery. To out of town dealers we furnish a special kind, made suitable for that trade, at a special wholesale price. - - - - - - -</p>
