   <p>In Victor Berger's "Milwaukee Songs," there was a strong attack on William Bross Lloyd, the local millionaire Socialist, and leader of the Communist Propaganda League.</p>
   <p>The League was founded immediately following the close of the World's War. Many of the most prominent Socialists were among its members.</p>
   <p>Bross Lloyd is an extreme radical, who was impatient with the Conservative Socialists of Berger's group. Suddenly, the League ousted the following members: Victor L. Berger, J. Lewis Engdahl, <span class="page-break">\2</span>Andrew Laflin, and Robert H. How. The excuse given for the ouster was that they were "too much to the right" for the League.</p>
   <p>Robert How, one of those ousted, retorted with an attack on Bross Lloyd's "Left Wing" in this fashion:</p>
   <p>"They are a 'bunch of lunatics,' without the slightest idea concerning the doctrines of the Socialist Party, claiming that the time has come to work for a political revolution. With arms in hand, they wish to bring on the Socialistic changes.</p>
