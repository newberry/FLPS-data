   <p>Among the banks of the city established by Germans, that of H. Schaffner &amp; Co. (A. G. Becker, a part-owner) takes a position in the front rank. It was founded in 1878, and is now located at Dearborn and Madison streets. The brisk business activities occurring daily in the attractively arranged financial institution give convincing evidence of the fact that the clientele of the bank is large and extensive. Particularly outstanding success is achieved by the bank in the sale of commercial paper. The turnover in these securities amounted to between $20,000,000 and $30,000,000.</p>
   
   <p>Of course, H. Schaffner &amp; Co. combine with their extensive and profitable trade in commercial paper a general banking business. They also have achieved remarkable success along this line.</p>
   <p>The financial institution of H. Schaffner &amp; Co. is, like all other German banks in Chicago, one of the most solid and safest pillars upon which the whole financial structure of this metropolitan city rests, and is able to defy all approaching storms.</p>
