   <p>Miss Newberger's letter on the subject of the educated Jews in Chicago makes interesting reading. She states her case intelligently and formulates a problem the solution of which is difficult. The semi-educated Jewish girls, whose only business in life is clothes, cosmetics, and good times, have no right to complain about the peculiarities of the Jewish young man. Since they have no ideals, they deserve their lot. It is quite different, however, with the educated, serious-minded, and modest Jewish girl who has to spend her youth in loneliness because she cannot find decent Jewish male companionship. The fact is that there are more educated Jewish girls than there are cultured Jewish men. Jewish parents in Chicago are often more anxious to send their daughters to college than their sons, and are more interested in the intellectual careers of their daughters than their sons because the sons are supposed to embark upon a business career and to make money as soon as possible, while the daughters are allowed to continue their studies. What is more, the Jewish intellectual sets a value upon himself even before he leaves the University, and is <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>anxious to be a success financially as well, while the cultured Jewish girl is more idealistic and her attitude toward men and life is more refined. She is not obsessed with the idea of making money, as the Jewish professional man is--and if she has not been blessed with rich parents, she is, as a rule, ignored by her male colleague.</p>
   <p>This may seam to be an exaggerated statement, but it is true, nevertheless. The materialism of the young Jewish professional is too well known to require any further discussion. It may be that this is an unpleasant passing phenomenon, but the reality of the phenomenon cannot be denied, and the cultured Jewish girl suffers most from it.</p>
   <p>It is, of course, true that in many cases the parents of the girls are to blame for the tragic lot of their daughters because they frighten young men away from their homes by attempting to "brand" them at once as Chosons [bridegrooms]. They do not permit a friendship to grow, to develop, to mature. No Jewish boy wants to be "captured". However, this hastiness on the part of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the Jewish parents is only partly responsible for the plight of the cultured and refined Jewish girl. The main causes are: one, she outnumbers the cultured Jewish male youth; two, the young Jewish man is overly conscious of his own worth and is eager to become well-to-do as soon as he graduates by marrying a girl of means; three, there is no refined intellectual Jewish center in Chicago where both can meet on equal terms and become friends.</p>
   <p>Can the situation--a very unpleasant situation--be remedied? We think that it can be remedied to a certain extent only. It would be difficult, if not impossible, to break the materialism of the young Jewish professional who differs in no way from his Gentile colleague; it would also be difficult to break the bad habit of Jewish parents of greeting their daughter's boy friend as the future son-in-law It should not be difficult, however, to give both the boy and the girl an opportunity to meet and to make friends by establishing a Jewish intellectual center. This is our opinion on the matter.</p>
   <p>It may be that there are other ways and means of improving the condition of <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the cultured Jewish girl. We confess that we are not experts in the field. This is the second time that the problem has been brought to our attention. We are convinced that there are many more things to be said on the subject and that a more exhaustive discussion would be of benefit to all concerned. Let the educated Jewish girl come forward and not only explain her case more fully, but also make suggestions and proposals as to how to remedy the situation.</p>
