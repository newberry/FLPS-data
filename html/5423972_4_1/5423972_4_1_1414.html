   <p>You are invited to visit us on our first anniversary, Tuesday, June 18, 1918. This day is a holiday for the West Side. On this day it will be exactly one year since this great national bank was opened. And this day will be an historic one for the Jewish inhabitants of Chicago. Congratulations are due this successful and growing bank on the eighteenth of June.</p>
   <p>Open new accounts, and transfer other accounts to this sound and strong bank; rent boxes, open savings or checking accounts, bring your bankbooks and we will transfer your accounts with the interest.</p>
   <p>The West Side National Bank</p>
