   <p>The primary elections are over, thank God. The citizens will now be able to rest from the campaign noise and tumult and get ready for the next campaign, which will be noisier.</p>
   <p>When one observes the unbelievably long ballot and the army of paid "watchers" at the polls, one can only wonder why the Fathers of the Republic, who created the greatest Constitution in the world, did not invent an effective election machinery. No country in the world has such a colossal number of elective offices, many of them so insignificant as court clerks or bailiffs. The public must be surely bewildered by the extraordinary large number of names of the candidates, the great majority of whom are unknown. A great number <span class="page-break">2</span>of citizens vote blindly, not knowing for whom they vote.</p>
   <p>The army of paid watchers, canvassers, and so on, whose numbers increase with every election, is a still worse phenomenon. Not less than one hundred thousand men and women citizens were acting as watchers and canvassers at the polls on last Tuesday's election. This means that nearly ten per cent of the voters were hired to work and, naturally, to vote for certain candidates. The time maybe will come, if things go on like this, when every voter will be hired to work for a certain candidate and an election will become a farce.</p>
   <p>America took over a great deal from the English parliamentary institutions. It would not be amiss to take a cue from the English election system that works so efficiently and is incomparably cheaper than the American election machinery.</p>
