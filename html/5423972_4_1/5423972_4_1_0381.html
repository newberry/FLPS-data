   <p>Mr. Abraham J. Harris, clerk of the criminal court, who was indicted Friday evening by a special Grand Jury, on a charge of violating the primary election law, has declared that he is a victim of political maneuvers against him. A month ago an intrigue was begun to bring suit against him in order to defeat him politically. In a signed statement to the Daily Courier, Mr. Harris states the following:</p>
   <p>Through the facilities of the Daily Jewish Courier, I am bringing to the attention of the Chicago Jewish public, and particularly to those who supported me in my political career, that the indictments brought against me are merely a political trick, in order to discredit me and ruin my career. I am not shocked by these indictments, for most of the politicians have, before this, attempted to instill fear into me.</p>

   <p>During the primaries I have done all within the law, in order to obtain votes for my friends - for the candidates I thought would work for the welfare of our population. I have committed nothing unlawful during the primaries.</p>
   <p>I sincerely hope that through these facts, which I hope to bring before the court, I will prove my innocence and will change the opinion of the Jewish public in my favor.</p>
   <p>A. J. Harris.</p>
   <p>Mr. Harris was indicted on eight points, four for bearing false witness and four for aiding in obtaining illegal votes. The charge of bearing false witness is for signing affidavits in order to enable some people who were not registered to vote at the last primaries. When the Grand Jury brought the indictments Friday evening, into the court of Judge Freeman, Mr. Harris asked the Jury to wait for the arrival of persons who will bail him. Mr. Max and David Weber, the owner of the Columbia Theater, have paid $11,000 bail. Mr. Clarence Darrow and Attorneys Adler and Lederer will defend Mr. Harris.</p>
