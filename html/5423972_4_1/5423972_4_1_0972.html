   <p>Exactly one hundred years ago last Thursday, the first formal steps were taken to make Illinois a state, when Congress passed the bill which was signed then by President Monroe.</p>
   <p>The untiring work of Nathaniel Pope, delegate to the Congress from the Illinois Territory was crowned with success only after he was able to prove beyond doubt, that there were 35,000 inhabitants in the territory which had applied for admission as a state--[the number] which the law at that time required, and naturally this was no easy job.</p>
   <p>The bill was passed, without any opposition, by the Senate on the 14th day of April, and on the 18th of April, 1818 the President signed it. The new constitution, which was adopted according to the bill, was passed on the 26th of August and the Legislature with its officers were sworn in on October 6th.</p>

   <p>The new constitution was accepted and the new state government began to function after the constitution was accepted by Congress on December third, when Illinois formally became a state and its history as a member of the great family of Uncle Sam begins officially from that day.</p>
   <p>The growth of the State of Illinois for the last hundred years surpassed even the greatest fantasies of its dreamers. The development from a small abandoned nook, inhabited by wild Indians and French "tracers" to a productive state of seven million souls in a period of only 100 years, is not equalled in history, and Illinois can with pride celebrate its century jubilee as an independent state.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately the general public knows little about the remarkable history of the State and City in which they chose to make their home. The terrible war drew away the country's entire attention and this historical moment was obscured. Nevertheless, the pioneers, who helped to build Illinois, who by their energy, courage and resoluteness brought the Western State to the position which it occupies now, could justly and proudly look upon their work and joyfully show <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the world what strong will power can accomplish. These pioneers, their children and grandchildren are the chief celebrants at this joyous event.</p>
   <p>The Jews played a big part in the development of the State; in industry and commerce, as well as other fields of endeavor, but there is nowhere to be found a detailed appraisal as to what extent they helped in this development, how much aid they rendered and how much energy and spiritual enterprise they contributed to bring the State to its present brilliant position. And this situation is deplorable. The Jew is always and everywhere looked upon as a foreigner, as a guest. If there were a possibility--and there is one now--to show the world, even ourselves and our children, that we Jews have contributed much, very much to the remarkable growth and development of the State of Illinois, to neglect that opportunity would be a crime against ourselves and the future generations.</p>
   <p>To very few Jews, for instance, is known the fact that a considerable part, more than half of the area which Illinois now occupies, including Chicago, once belonged to a Jewish company of which Simon Levy of Lancaster, Pennsylvania was <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the owner; he had paid,for the entire area, the sum of $37,328.17 which is much less than the worth of a present day steam-heated building. And yet this is an historical fact!</p>
   <p>Hundreds of such historical facts and data of great value have been lost, because there was no one interested enough to assemble them. Not so however is the case with the non-Jews. They have an historical society made up of distinguished citizens, whose duty it is to uncover and guard all historical data, preserving it for posterity. It is a source of pride to them when they are able to prove that their grandpa was one of the first settlers of this region.</p>
   <p>The century-old history of Illinois will undoubtedly occupy a prominent chapter in general American history. Many nationalities contributed to this history and our Jewish people gave their share.</p>
   <p>The history of the Jews of Illinois must be written now. Now is the favorable moment.</p>
