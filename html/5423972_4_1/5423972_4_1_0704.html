   <p>In the Municipal Court, where cases between landlords and tenants are tried daily, the judge criticized the conduct of some landlords who make it a habit to victimize their poor tenants. The judge's opinion deserves attention even if he is not the first one to express it, in that it comes from one whose duty is to administer justice to all, and because it evinces something a bit too radical for those naive enough to believe in capitalist justice. Here is what he said:</p>
   <p>"In nine out of every ten cases where landlords sued their tenants in order to evict them, the landlords had purchased their buildings for the purpose of raising rents. These sort of landlords expect the court to help them in their speculations. They do not make any effort to find out whether or not the tenants have any rights, but rush to evict them in order to gain more on their investments. The court is not a "collection agency" for landlords."</p>
   <p>These words were uttered when his court was filled with families threatened with eviction.</p>

   <p>In connection with the rent situation in our city, there is another question that deserves very serious consideration. The many trials that have taken place since the first of May in the Municipal Court disclosed that the colored population of our city has been hit the hardest by this rent epidemic. This, observers believe, may result in a dangerous epidemic, spreading among them.</p>
   <p>In the negro neighborhoods rents have been raised so high that eight, or ten persons have to live in one room. If this is continued it will result in an epidemic. Should this be the case, there is danger that it will spread to other quarters of the city. Only a few months ago the city had an experience of this kind when typhoid fever cases in the South Side, caused by contamination of the water supply, threatened to spread over the entire city. It is necessary that our city officials look into this situation. Even they are not capable of elevating themselves to a higher degree of humanity by taking up the grievances of the colored population, at least they should realize the grave danger of this unsanitary condition to other sections of the city.</p>

   <p>Sooner or later our lawmakers will be compelled to look into this matter and do something, as in other large centers of this country. Landlords are not better than railroad magnates. If the Federal government has the power to regulate the rates that the railroad companies charge to passengers and freight, why cannot a state government regulate rents on dwellings?</p>
   <p>In New York and a few other states such regulations have already been made by the state government. It is now up to the citizens of this state to see that their voices are heard by those who serve as our law makers.</p>
