   <p>The West Side music lovers will heartily greet the renewal of the Sunday Concerts at the Hebrew Institute, under the direction of the great Alexander Tchaikowsky. The first concert of the new series will take place Sunday, October 29th, at 2.30 P. M. Mr. Tchaikowsky, with his last year's concerts, has proven that he is, not only one of the best violin geniuses, but also a talented director. Through the medium of his concerts he has taught a large mass of Jews to love music, and this makes the renewal of his concerts an important event in the Jewish Ghetto.</p>
