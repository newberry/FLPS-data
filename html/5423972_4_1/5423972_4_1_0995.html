   <p>It was read not only understandingly but emphatically by Mrs. Alfred Hamburger. It was an excellent paper excellently presented; it gave much food for thought to the listener as it does to the reader who has it before her in the printed volume of proceedings of the Council just issued from the office of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the National Federations of Temple Sisterhoods and Temple Brotherhoods. Yet there is a decided difference when a paper is read by its author or by some one else, as has been proven in innumerable instances with no blame to anyone. There is a definite personal element involved when a paper on so vital a subject is written by a woman of intense personal feeling and in so stirring a manner, and as we listened on Monday, we waited for the applause, after certain paragraphs that we had previously read and that seemed particularly striking and which - as we had heard - aroused mounting approval in Philadelphia. Nor did the discussion that followed, intelligent as it was, seem adequately to approve the loftiness of the ideal held out by Mrs. Ruth Cohn Frish, whose very wide horizon displayed the fact that she, as daughter and as wife, lives in rabbinic atmosphere and has a thorough acquaintance and love of Judaism, its history and philosophical and ethical implications.</p>

   <p>Perhaps the best comment that we can do is to reprint certain paragraphs containing the elemental ideas of the paper and though fragmentary quotations rarely do justice to an address we believe that the inspirational character of the entire paper and its concrete value can well be found in these quotations and offer enlightenment as well as applicable suggestions:</p>
   <p>"It is the frank and honest declaration of the modern, universal-minded Jew that Israel is not the only chosen people; that all peoples are chosen to play some special instrument in the world symphony; but it is his inner conviction that maybe he is first violin at least; or to change the figure, he is the pries people by right of primogeniture, his inheritance of the knowledge of the one God who is at the same time the righteous Father of all mankind being the oldest and surest. Well and good! The way to prove it is to act it, and I take it that the purpose of this assembly is to rechart once more the plan by which Israel can justify his existence and his program both to himself and to his age-old spectators.".....</p>
   <p>Well, the congregations who sit patiently to hear the rabbi, do deserve a meaty talk and a felicitous delivery; they do deserve a patient <span class="gap">[gap]</span>astor and an <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>engaging personality; they should find in their rabbis a thoughtful friend and, if possible, a comrade, but far and away these attributes - agreeable and even necessary as they are - the American Jewish congregations should seek in their ministers truth and courage, honor and sincerity, absolute fearlessness in and out of the pulpit, enthusiastic zeal and - oh, most unappreciated of qualities in this otherwise delightful land of ours - scholarship. How little time to study is given these men who have to be teachers, preachers, pastors, organizers, charity collectors and social workers. How little understanding is there by so large a part of the laity that our wonderful tradition will dry up if the springs are never tapped! What a great, new departure it would be if we could raise up in our communities lay workers who, through proper education could relieve the minister of some of the staggering burden of details, who could take over a class here and there, help plan a Sunday School curriculum, gather in some of the philanthropic funds, occupy the pulpit on occasion (a rest for the congregation and for the rabbi, I'm thinking)!.....</p>
   <p>Her criticism of individualistic behaviour in the synagogue must not overlooked though it need not be quoted at length. Inattention, gum, even the <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>lipstick receive her attention and, we think well deserve it; but ho, how she can thunder on the fundamentals of our social structure: What has become of the first born of the Lord? Where is he who is little lower than the angels and has been crowned with glory and honor? Like the stone image of Canaanitish days, he has eyes that see not and hands that feel not. The onward march of progress passes him by - remains in the tents of the idle, nursing his position to temporary safety, hugging to his breast his small material gains and achievements....Ask him to study the problems of the poor, the maladjusted, the under-privileged, the immigrant, the Negro - any group not his own - ask him to come to some conclusion from his investigation which might prejudice his own financial or social status, ask him to take a stand a little out of the common, - slightly non-comformist, - and hear his excuses and evasions. Ask him to come out boldly against militarism, to lift his voice against imperialism, to do actual battle against the forces that threaten permanent world peace, and see him run to cover.</p>
   <p>Was it for this that Elijah risked his life by flouting royalty; that Jeremiah suffered exile for speaking unwelcome truth; that Jochanan Ben Zakkai braved the Roman terror; that Akilia was flayed; that Chanina perished in the flames; <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>that Nachmanides was banished? Was it only in order to cry out, "There is one God," or was it not to prove by their lives and their deaths that there is also one humanity?</p>
   <p>"Organized religion is on trial and Judaism is again confronted with the age-old choice, but since the whole of civilization seems to be at the cross-roads and all the influences which go to shape it are under more severe scrutiny than ever before, this time the challenge to Judaism assumes an importance perhaps of the greatest magnitude in its history. Choose you, this day, whom you will serve, whether the gods of the Amorites, whether the blind gods of complacency whose service leads to destruction, or the God in Whose light we see light. The choice is of growth or decay, of kernel or shell; the choice is a Judaism of technique and ceremonial and creed, lovable, beautiful, and satisfying, emotionally and intellectually, but to anemic for action; or a Judaism girt with armor to do battle for the Lord of Hosts, which will cry aloud and spare not nor cease until it has brought righteousness and peace to the farthermost isles of the sea."</p>
   <p>One wishes the entire paper could be printed but then it is in the proceedings of the Philadelphia convention; these proceedings are in the hands of <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>rabbis and other leaders of our community and he who runs may also read.</p>
   <p>At the noon sessions the lovely singing of Doris Birk Waterstone, giving the soprano solo from Elijah, "Hear ye, Israel" seemed a most appropriate summing up of that message. Then were also heard the greetings from the National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods, by Mrs. Joseph Stolz; from the Women's League of the United Synagogues, by Mrs. Benjamin Davis; by Mrs. G. George Fox, from the Illinois State Federation of Temple Sisterhoods; from the Chicago Conference of Jewish Women's Organizations, by Mrs. Harry J. Myerson; and from an unexpected guest, Mrs. Edgar Littman of St. Louis, the President of the St. Louis Conference. There was indeed, food well prepared and consumed with delight for soul as well as for body.</p>
   <p>At the afternoon sessions two thoughtful and well informed Chicago women read two papers whose contents will long remain in the memory of the fortunate delegates. Mrs. William A. Morrison discussed "The Religious School," and left no phase of it untouched, from kindergarten to the post confirmation classes. Attendance, curriculum, behavior, cooperation on the part of the parents - all - and the latter item mostly, were stressed - would that the speakers criticisms and plans were headed.</p>

   <p>It has been hinted that this paper and the last one are to be presented at meetings of individual constituent organizations and it, therefore, does not seem fair to quote or reprint from them too liberally. Only, Chicago Jewry is to be congratulated that among its young women there are such as can give thoughtful consideration to the questions of our opportunities and obligations as Jewish parents in this day and place, such as Mrs. Morrison and Mrs. Abraham Levinson who as the last speaker talked on "Judaizing the Home." In character this paper, too, was scholarly and comprehensive, beautifully constructed and most earnestly given. For the present we content ourselves with quotations from the summary because as we read this excellent paper before us no brief reprint could convey the inclusiveness and fine discriminatory qualities of the address. We give but the last page of the paper:</p>
   <p>"I should like to summarize what I have been trying to emphasize as concrete ways of Judaizing the home: 1. Put into your library books on Jewish subjects. Have a Jewish-English periodical in your home to keep you in touch with Jewish current events. Make your slogan for Bar Mizvahs and Confirmations, for birthdays and graduations 'less ties and more books, less underwear</p>

   <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>
   <p>Indeed how well can we say of our daughter, in Chicago Jewry, "A woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised." Would that the community would not only recognize the ability of these women to lead us in thought but that we might honor their teaching by following them and translating their learning into the living conditions of our children's lives.</p>
   <p>Then would every holy day, yes every day in our homes be what we wish our readers for festive season for each and every home: "A Happy Holiday."</p>
