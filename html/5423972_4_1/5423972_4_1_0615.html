   <p>We have always been under the impression that if the Jews in biblical times had not been divided into two separate kingdoms--Judah an Ephraim--we would have become a great ruling nation. Whether or not this is true we don't know because the political conditions of those times are not known to us exactly. But if the Jews of today would unite, they would undoubtedly represent a great national power.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it is regrettable that the present World War has restored the old tribal feuds among the Jews and has renewed the old disputes between Judah and Ephraim.</p>
   <p>In the last issue of the American Jewish Chronicle an editorial is devoted <span class="page-break">\2</span>to this mournful period [1914-1916]; this article reads in part:</p>
   <p>"The period from 1914 to 1916 will enter into Jewish history as a period of civil war among Jews. It was a period in which Jews fought against Jews with doubtful heroism. Their fight did not help the aims of the Jews, but often stifled every Jewish interest.</p>
   <p>"The War divided mankind and also disrupted the unity that existed among Jews. Even in neutral countries this split in Judaism has been felt strongly during the War. Prominent Jews have not infrequently overlooked the interests of their own people because of their interest in other nationalities, and have very often neglected their people because of nurturing bogus concepts and erroneous opinions.</p>
   <p>"This is very tragic, but much more tragic is the fact that the great masses of the Jewish people are now caught between two fires and have been overwhelmed <span class="page-break">\3</span>by a catastrophe which is unparalleled in the history of Jews. The largest portion of our people live under both the Slavic and Teutonic rule. Because they lived in countries whose civilizations were different the Jews of Eastern Europe developed their own culture, thereby succeeding in maintaining their individuality as a nation.</p>
   <p>"The growth of nationalism among the various nationalities in Eastern Europe gradually fomented hatred for the Jews who lived among them, and when war was declared three enemies took their stand against them [Jews] : their traditional enemy, the Russians, the German armies that invaded those countries, and the Poles. Even if the Russians had not been anti-Semites, they would still have done much harm by bringing the war into peaceful Jewish areas. But because of the horrors of war in the heart of the Ghetto, because of the criminal injustice of the Poles who fabricated such lies as that Jews were spying on both the German and Russian governments, and because of the Russians who <span class="page-break">\4</span>made Jews the scapegoat after each defeat, the misfortunes that befell our people doubled, and perhaps tripled. The Jews of Eastern Europe have always been poor materially. According to detailed statistics, the war cost the Jews of Eastern Europe a billion dollars in both legal tender and property--a sum which equals the damages paid out by France at the end of the Franco-Prussian War. Generations will pass before the Jews of Eastern Europe recover their economic losses. But how long it will take them to recover from the physical and moral sufferings, no one knows."</p>
   <p>The writer of this editorial contends that this catastrophe [the War] has had a general effect upon the Jewish groups in the neutral countries; that it has served as an expedient movement for the revival of Jewish nationalism; that it has awakened the Jewish masses to a conscious aim. It has purified the political atmosphere so thoroughly that all secret and destructive elements, which have fought for many years against the individuality of the Jewish people, have again reappeared. Three things have become clear as a result of the war: first, the power of the assimilators; second, their aims, and third <span class="page-break">\5</span>the necessity of choosing between the masses and the assimilators.</p>
   <p>The article goes on to say: "This situation has not only affected the American Jewry alone, but has affected the smaller Jewish communities in other neutral countries as well. In Holland, Switzerland, and all Scandinavian countries, Jewish nationalism crept into new circles where it had never previously existed, thereby forcing the groups of the assimilators to co-operate with the majority."</p>
   <p>From this [statement] the writer intimated that Jewish nationalism will gain considerably at the present time; that upon the debris of the destitute Jewish communities and [from the] many graves of the martyrs, a new Jewish spirit will arise.</p>
