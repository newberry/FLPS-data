   <p>Sidney Hillman Urges a Tailor Corporation for Russia.</p>
   <p>A million dollar fund is being raised by the Amalgamated to organize tailoring establishments in the Soviet Government, said Sidney Hillman in a speech before the convention of the Amalgamated.</p>
   <p>"Brother Chairman, and Convention Delegates - I hope that you will find the time to give your whole hearted attention to this matter which deserves careful consideration.</p>
   <p>"I do not intend to fill your time by telling you of my experiences in Europe, as that has already been done. I had the pleasure of meeting you, and other members of our organization in various cities, when I returned from my trip abroad. Neither did I come here to read you a theory or to suggest something appealing to a certain group of people. What I want to present here, I believe should be under the consideration of, not only the convention, but of every man and woman of our organization.</p>

   <p>people of the world would refuse to permit only a few to lead the world, and that if the people, themselves, should take an interest in their own affairs, such peace would be impossible.</p>
   <p>"A terrible price the world has paid for its independence from these great world problems. We cannot correct the mistakes any longer, that caused the World War, and those that were made since the Peace Treaty was signed, cannot be changed any more, but there is one opportunity for the world to save civilization, and that is to adopt the real policy of Reconstruction.</p>
   <p>"I appeal to you not to be indifferent to the problems of Reconstruction. We dare not, further permit, the few people who have persistently determined the fate of the world, to determine the policies of Reconstruction, just as they have determined the policies of War and Peace. I am convinced that if it is left to them, the whole of civilization will be destroyed.</p>
   <p>"I am convinced that we must serve the interests of the people of every country, and we must say to the diplomats and politicians in Geneva, that they will not be permitted to do the same thing they have done in Paris, Berlin, or elsewhere, when War was declared - or when Peace was signed.</p>
   <p>"It is time for the people, themselves, to take part in the Reconstruction of Europe, and at the same time to plan the fate of this country. There is but one country that stands financially secure, and that country is England. The other countries are either bankrupt or on the threshold of bankruptcy, and it is noticeable that as yet nothing has been done regarding the problem of starting something to put the people back in a position where they can again work and enjoy life. When I went to Russia, I considered my trip a privilege, as I had the opportunity to come in contact with Russia, not with the theories of Bolshevism, nor with the arguments of Menshevism, nor with small wrangles or quarrels here and there, that interest only a few small groups, but with the great masses of people. The trip to Russia offered me the opportunity to find out what is going on in the country of over 100,000,000,000 population, the country that suffered before the war a tyrannical suppression that never was understood by any country outside Russia.</p>
   <p>"As it seems, nobody figured that Russia's loss of lives throughout the War exceeded that of all the Allied Nations put together. No one ever figured that the Russians lost their lives, not just because of War, but due to the corruption and deterioration of their government, no one gives it a thought, that in the War the economical life of Russia was altogether destroyed, and after the War there was declared a horrible policy against Russia by the very ones that were the partners, and best friends of Russia, during the War. They declared the blockade, which caused millions of men, women, and children to starve, and prohibited them from working that they might have something to eat. It is true, we are feeding a great many of the hungry in Russia. The hard work and great efforts of the American Relief Administration will be marked down, in the history of our country, as something of which every one can be proud. When I was in Europe, at the time of hunger, I found out that the countries against Russia took the following stand: No bread for the hungry children unless we can dictate the kind of government Russia shall have.</p>
   <p>"My friends, such tactics do not prove very good principles. The tactics mean to make a colony of Russia, to take away the Russian oils and minerals, to turn 100,000,000,000 people into slaves for groups of financiers and bankers in other countries.</p>
   <p>"My friends, I must tell you, my heart was troubled. I am proud of the work that this country has done for the hungry in Russia regardless of how small it has been.</p>
   
   <p>"Let me also tell you that no government has a right to regulate the living conditions of another country. (Applause). Every country has a right to reject the interference of another nation.</p>
   <p>"We in this country - do not want any one from abroad to dictate to us how to conduct ourselves, and we do not even think that we have the moral right to dictate to any country how to conduct its business in its own land.</p>
   <p>"There are countries in Europe that fool themselves, that think they can triumph over the destructions of other countries in Europe.</p>
   <p>"If Europe will collapse, every nation of Europe will fall, victor and vanquished alike.</p>
   <p>"It is fortunate that there are yet a few nations in Europe, who understand that it is time to stop the destructive powers, and that now is the time to think of Reconstruction. But the people are indifferent. The issue is that we will again receive a new portion of high sounding phrases, and a new prescription, and it will again end where one part of the world will be bent on war, and when this occurs, there will be left very little in this world to live for.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, it is in the interests of the masses of this country, as well as of all other countries, to awake and say that the Reconstruction of the world is a matter for the officials of the state department but that the lives of millions of men, women, and children, is the interest of all humanity.</p>
   <p>"I tell you frankly, I would be ready to come to you and declare that if Russia's future is condemned, if nothing can be done to rebuild, then no one of us has the right to spend any money as long as men, women, and children are going hungry. I want to draw your attention to the innocent children. You who do not interest yourselves in any group of children, that have come into this world through the laws of nature, and are being slaughtered by those who do not take an interest in helping them, should realize that you are committing a murder, when you make it impossible for other people to live. You are committing a crime when you are not doing all in your power to make it possible for other people to live.</p>
   <p>"You may want to do all in your power, your aim may be the best, but when people do not want to help themselves and will not accept your help, then your aim is worthless. I know that before we can start on constructive work for Russia, we must first be satisfied that the people in whose hands lies the fate of Russia, are whole-heartedly interested whether they have the right to be the leaders or not. Those, are the ones with whom we can do constructive work for Russia, feeling that it is not for this or that individual group, but for Russia as a whole."</p>
