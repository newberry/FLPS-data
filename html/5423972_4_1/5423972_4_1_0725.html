   <p>Last Sunday was Mothers' Day, Florists made some money on it. Idle gossip aplenty was showered upon the glory of motherhood, its mission to the race, its significance to everything that is human. Yes, and at the same time representatives and senators in the United States Congress opposed the passage of a maternity bill, whose aims were to relieve dire conditions such as poverty and illness of mothers in travail; future mothers work at a pittance in many factories where their health is impaired and the peril to motherhood substantially increased, and mothers are forced to watch their children go to school or to work without sufficient nourishment and other provisions that can make their lives less drab than the lives they have known. There are many happy mothers, of course, but an idle celebration of a great fact is a repudiation of sincerity. We hope [that] in the future mothers' day will be celebrated every day, even as mothers do their duties every day and maintain their responsibilities to themselves least, to their children and to society at large, most.</p>
