   <p>At the Art Institute the painting by Nathan P. Steinberg, "Vaction Days" is attracting considerable notice. The picture portrays a barefoot boy sitting in a boat, fishing.</p>
   <p>Mr. Steinberg is perhaps the youngest artist to have his work hung at the Art Institute. His "Portrait of Sylvia" which was exhibited at the Institute some time ago evinced favorable comment from some of the leading artists of the city who saw it.</p>
   <p>He was born in palestine and was brought over to this country when a youngster. He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Sol Steinberg of Chicago.</p>
