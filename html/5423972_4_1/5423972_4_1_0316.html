   <p>Who is the young Jewish candidate, Mr. Morris Eller, who is running for alderman of the ninth ward? The answer is as follows: On September 22, 1883, the seventeen year old Morris Eller, landed in Chicago. He was poor and was lost in this great Metropolis without money and without knowledge of the English language, but he came here as a Jew with Jewish patience. He immediately began to attend night school to study the English language, and by day, he peddled for a living. As soon as he acquired a working knowledge of English, he discarded peddling and obtained a position as bookkeeper for Jacob Lasker. And before long he married into the Lasker's family. From then on, he became one of the most outstanding citizens of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Finally he entered politics. In 1895, he was elected Deputy Assessor; in 1896, he became Deputy Collector and 1897, he was appointed Deputy Recorder, which office he now holds under Abel Davis. Now he is nominated for alderman of the ninth ward in place of Abe Harris, who was appointed clerk of the criminal court. Mr. Eller is assured of election if the Jews of the ninth ward will do their duty.</p>
   <p>In Jewish politics, Mr. Eller, is a power. He was grand secretary of the Order Western Star for nine and one-half years. He is at present, president of the Independent Order Brith Abraham of the West. He is also a member of other lodges and organizations, and has the assured co-operation of its members in this campaign.</p>
