   <p>The movement in the United States to abolish capital punishment is a new phenomenon in the social life of America and deserves therefore the reader's attention.</p>
   <p>The movement is already significant in the fact, alone, that it started in a country whose people are quite tolerant toward lynchings. In some states one is in danger of being lynched at even the slightest suspicion. And in spite of all this, the movement is gaining headway and can proudly point to the achievement of much success in the short time of its activity.</p>

   <p>This Anti-Capital Punishment Society, by the way, was founded through the special efforts of two Jews, Morris B. Covnat and Norman A. Sarrov, who devoted much time and energy to the realization of their ideal - to found an organization, which should include all the right thinking elements of the entire country. These two Jews are also at present the guiding figures of this movement. Mr. Covnat is secretary of the organization and Mr. Sarrov is a member of the executive board. The work of the organization is almost exclusively in the hands of these two Jews, who are very enthusiastic about the movement.</p>
   <p>In 1911 Mr. Covnat issued a circular, signed by prominent persons of Chicago and other cities, which he mailed throughout the country, requesting the citizens of the United States to affiliate themselves with the movement for the abolition of capital punishment in the United States, and in 1914 the organization was founded with headquarters in Chicago.</p>

   <p>The most prominent citizens of the United States affiliated themselves with the organization, among whom we can find the names of United States senators, as well as governors of many states. The officials of the organization are as follows:</p>
   <p>Governor George, W. P. Hunt of Arizona, President; McKenzie Cleland, Louis K. Phillips and M. Catherine Lyons, Vice Presidents; Morris B. Covnat, Secretary; Fae Louis, Treasurer. The following are honorary vice presidents: Governor Francis E. McGovern of Wisconsin, United States Senator Moses E. Clap of Minnesota, Governor Woodbridge N. Ferris of Michigan, Governor Ernest Lister of Washington, and Governor Oswald West of Oregon. Executive Board:- Norman A. Sarrov, Dr. Rudolph B. Von Lieblich, Governor George W. P. Hunt, J. L. McLean and Morris B. Covnat.</p>

   <p>Advisory Board:- Judge Ben P. Lindsey, Edward Markham, Hellen Keller, Rose Pastor Stokes, David Belasco, Raymond Robins, Jack London, and Clarence Darrow.</p>
   <p>The movement is gaining followers every day and many of those who were open advocates of capital punishment have been won over to the movement. Governor Dunn of Illinois is also one of the former pronounced advocates of capital punishment, whose, name now is among the supporters of the new movement. Soon after the organization was founded, it undertook a crusade against capital punishment and in a short time commemorated a big victory, due to the influence of propaganda of this organization. Thanks to its efforts, the legislatures of the states of Tennessee, and North and South Dakota abolished capital punishment.</p>

   <p>In the state of Indiana the organization lost its battle against capital punishment by only one vote. This alone shows, that the cause is not a lost one. In time this single vote will be added to those, who voted for the abolition of capital punishment in Indiana. In the Illinois legislature the organization lost its crusade by six votes. In the meantime, let us mention those states, where capital punishment has been abolished, prior to the founding of the Anti-Capital Punishment Society. Those states are: Wisconsin, Michigan, Rhode Island, Maine, Kansas, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. It is interesting to note, that the majority of these states is in the West, from which one concludes, that the people of the West are more radically inclined, than the people of the East.</p>

   <p>The Anti-Capital Punishment Society published a brochure in which it explained why capital punishment should be abolished. The main argument is, that in many cases, innocent people have been executed, that murderers do not fear capital punishment and that crime has not abated. The brochure also points out, that criminality is not a judicial question, but a social one and that the present cure for crime is a failure.</p>
   <p>The society claims, that to rid society of the criminal plague, it is necessary to have our state institutions serve not as prisons, but as reform institutions, and not under care of politicians, but under the sole guidance of specialists of psychology, who know human character.</p>
   <p>This is the duty of the state, just as it is its duty to support schools for children and hospitals for the sick.</p>

   <p>Besides propaganda to abolish capital punishment, the society extends a helping hand to those, sentenced to death. In the movement to free Frank from the gallows, the society deserves much credit for being instrumental in obtaining the commutation of his death sentence. The society organized Frank committees in many cities, agitating in his behalf and thereby creating a pro-Frank sentiment throughout the country, which finally induced Governor Slayton to commute Frank's death sentence to life imprisonment.</p>
   <p>The society also saved the lives of five Mexicans, who were sentenced to death in the state of Arizona. The indefatigable and noble work of this organization deserves the support of every citizen in the country. Only through the help and support of all sincere and right thinking people will the society eventually be able to attain its humanitarian aim.</p>
