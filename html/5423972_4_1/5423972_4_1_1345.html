   <p>Remember--it is less than two weeks until Passover. Money sent to your relatives by mail, cannot reach them in time for Passover. We do not mail our cable orders to other banks in New York, which then send them [these orders] to their European representatives. We send our cable orders, daily, from our office in Chicago, directly to our manager, Mr. R. Ukelson, in Europe, and there it is immediately paid out [to the consignees].</p>
   <p>We shall gladly prove to you that we pay out cable orders in two or three days time, and we pay everywhere in American dollars. Send help to your relatives quickly, in time for Passover.</p>
