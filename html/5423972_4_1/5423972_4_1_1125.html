   <p>Fanny Bard, a Jewish girl, 8, daughter of Abraham Bard, died recently after being ill for a period of three weeks. Confined to the Isolation Hospital for two weeks, the child was sent home after this period as cured, when in reality she was deathly sick and far from being recovered from diphtheria.</p>
   <p>The parents of little Fanny are poor and could not even afford to buy medicines, let alone engage the services of a doctor. Her mother contacted the nearest pharmacist, who did not have the requisite amount of anti-toxin. So the pharmacist called the Board of Health twice. The first call was ignored, but finally they sent an ambulance accompanied by a doctor who said that the girl could not be taken to the Isolation Hospital, because in the same house another girl of 3 years contracted measles. Afterwards, a second doctor came, who innoculated anti-toxin and left her life depending entirely upon fate.</p>
   <p>The condition of the little girl had again become very critical, and once again her mother ran off to the pharmacist for anti-toxin. Again the Board of Health neglected to send the medicine. In order to acquire anti-toxin, they <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a> were referred to the State Medical Board, which upon discovering that it was the case of a child of poor parents refused to give the proper amount of antitoxin.</p>
   <p>The negligence of the Isolation Hospital and the inhuman treatment of the Board of Health doctors resulted in the death of little Fannie Bard.</p>
   <p>The Isolation Hospital is a city institution. It was built and is being maintained for the purpose of serving the interests of the people, particularly the poor who cannot afford private hospitals.</p>
   <p>The fact that the Isolation Hospital sent Fannie home while being in a critical condition, proves that it does not fulfill its duty; that it does not carry through the mission for which it was established; that the sick have no chance of getting medical attention there, and that it actually fails in making available to the public the latest advances in medical science.</p>
   <p>Not only is the Isolation Hospital guilty of maltreatment and negligence, but also the Board of Health. This city department should see that the health <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>condition of the entire city is in best order. When a case calls for utmost ability and care, as in the case of the 8-year-old Jewish girl, their doctors deliberately ignore the entire matter.</p>
   <p>This shows how cheap a human life is to them and how little attention they give the sick who are poor. If a private doctor were to do the same, he would be branded as dishonest and unethical. Yet, we can expect that of private doctors, because they are solely interested in money. The poor people who are unable to pay cannot expect private doctors to take care of their health, and it was just on the truth of this assertion that the city built a hospital and established a health department, where the doctor being paid by the city, may be only interested in curing the sick. From what we see, this is not true. As long as the ethics of medicine rest on a profit motive, the sick will not receive proper attention. This is why the sick are treated so poorly in the Isolation Hospital, and this is why the Health Department is so negligent in serious cases. The blame, however, does not only fall upon the Isolation Hospital and the Health Department, but also upon the City's administration, which has the official control over them. Nevertheless, the doctors do as <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>they please, not having any fear of nor receiving any commands from their superiors. Such chaos and anarchy would probably not exist if the doctors were aware that they are working under certain orders.</p>
   <p>But the death of Fanny is an irretrievable loss to her parents, whose child died so young. She could have probably been saved if her parents had the means. This proves that society has little concern for the life of a poor little child.</p>
