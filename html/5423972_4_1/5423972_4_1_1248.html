   <p>Severe accusations against the president of the "Original Vienna Bakery and Natatorium Co."</p>
   <p>Jacob Heissler and August Junge of the bakery company of Heissler and Junge, proposed yesterday the appointment of an administrator over the fortune of the "Original Vienna Bakery Coffee and Natatorium Co." at the Midway Plaisance. The complainants rest their proposal upon certain accusations, which were brought against Wm. Loeb, the president of the company, in a pending suit at the Circuit Court.</p>
   <p>According to statements in this writ, the company was organized in March 1892 by L. J. Kadisch, Henry A. Fleischmann and Wilhelm Loeb, with a stated capital of $200,000. There were 2,000 shares of $100.each issued. Of these, Phillip Lanth, a clerk in Loeb's office shall have bought 1,980 shares, although he knew, that he never would be able to pay the signed amount of $198,000.</p>

   <p>The complainants further declare, that they have been induced by the accused company to buy 50 of their shares under the condition, that all the bread used in their cafe will be bought from them. The signed up $5,000 should have been paid in, on the other hand the company committed a breach of contract, by not buying all the bread used, of their bakery. Besides this, President Loeb has made false statements in the books, and embezzled considerable amounts of money.</p>
   <p>The complainants fear, that the entire enterprise of the company might be closed as soon as the board of directors of the World's Fair learns about these alleged frauds. To prevent such an act, the complainants ask for a judicial appointment of an administrator.</p>
