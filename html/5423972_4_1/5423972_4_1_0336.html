   <p>Julius Rosenthal, Esq., has been nominated on the Republican Ticket for the judicial election which is to take place next Monday. Here is what the Tribune says of him: "Mr. Julius Rosenthal is remarkably well known. The only public position which he has held, apart from being a member of the Library Board, has been that of Public Administrator, whose duties he has performed for a long time without any person ever lifting up his voice to make a complaint against him. He has perhaps a broader knowledge of the science of law than any of the other candidates on either the Republican or the Democratic Ticket.</p>
   <p>Thanks in part to the better training which one receives at the German law schools, he is about as much at home in civil and canonical as in common law.....Connected for a long time with the Chicago Law Institute (President) he has the acquaintance and friendship of all the lawyers, and will secure their united support......Two years ago he was a candidate before the Convention for Judge of the Probate Court, but was defeated."</p>
