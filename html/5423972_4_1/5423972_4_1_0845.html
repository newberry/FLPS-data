   <p>The present session of Congress should, among other things, take into consideration the proposal by Postmaster-General A. S. Burleson that the government should take into its hands the telegraph and telephone systems of the country.</p>
   <p>If this step is taken, the government would introduce into this country what has already been in existence in all European countries for a long time. Throughout the entire world, it has long been established that government can serve the interests of the people much better than private enterprise.</p>
   <p>The fact alone that such an important matter has been brought before Congress shows that we are on the road to progress, especially because the United States is always cautions in matters relating to government ownership.</p>
   <p>Because of the supreme control that private enterprise has on all fields <span class="page-break">\2</span>of political life, pressure is brought to bear against any government attempt to interfere with it.</p>
   <p>Years ago no one would even dare to raise such an issue. Now, however, the Postmaster-General himself promulgated this plan, which met with the approval of the President. This matter had, for some time, been viewed in all its phases by a committee of experts who have prepared an impartial report on the whole thing.</p>
   <p>The Senatorial Committee will soon make public a report on the practical side of the question. As to us, the fact alone that this issue was raised by a government official who is well posted in Post Office affairs, is sufficient to make us feel confident that the plan is practical.</p>
   <p>As regards this proposal, the mere sympathy for it expressed by the President is hardly sufficient, since before it can become law it requires the approval of representatives and senators, which is the great obstacle to legislation of this kind. That this is the case has been shown by the fact that the <span class="page-break">\3</span>leaders of the Democratic Part have decided not to debate on the subject in this session of Congress. And we all know that President Wilson has stated that he always acts in accordance with the opinion of the party. So he concurs that the matter be postponed.</p>
   <p>This shows that the problem of having the government take over the telegraph and telephone systems will not be solved at once, because it is a step too progressive for the reactionary elements in this country.</p>
