   <p>M. Ph. Ginsberg's organ (Courier) of Sunday informs us, that Alderman Thorman, of the 34th Ward, was indorsed for renomination by many "prominent Jews." The publisher does not reveal the many "prominent Jews" that are so intensely interested in the reelection of that loyal servant to the wealthy companies. But we can readily understand, when we recall who M. Ph's organ is accustomed to call "prominent Jews".</p>
   <p>The many "prominent Jews" that indorse the renomination of Alderman Thorman are probably those "fifty dollar Jews" whose prominence consists of paying fifty dollars or one hundred dollars to see their "pictures" and "praises" printed in a paper or in a "Who's Who" of the wealthy.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>These "prominent Jews" are of little pride to the masses. These "prominent Jews" belong to the noted H. H. Democrats, who consider the Jews as horses upon which every politician may ride.</p>
   <p>Truly Prominent Jews are those who struggle for truth and justice.</p>
