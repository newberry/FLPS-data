   <p>Last week we spoke about the Jewish candidates for judge of the Municipal Court, namely, Philip P. Bregstone and Jacob H. Marx on the Democratic ticket and Julius H. Quasser on the Republican ticket, to fill a vacancy. Besides these three main candidates, other Jewish young men have their hats in the political ring. Mr. Julius Jaffe and Mr. Abraham E. Edelman seek the nomination for judges of the Municipal Court on the Democratic ticket and S. Friedlander seeks the same nomination on the Republican ticket.</p>
   <p>Mr. Julius Jaffe is well known on the West Side. The masses consider him one of them, and he will draw a large Jewish vote. Julius Jaffe is a person who relies on his own strength. The last time he was a candidate for the nomination for judge of the Municipal Court, he drew more than eight <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>thousand votes, notwithstanding the fact that he received no help from any political or social campaign committee. In this primary, Julius Jaffe is supported by the Harrison faction of the Democratic party, and many Jewish lodges have appointed members for a Jaffe Campaign Committee. This, plus his own unremitting work and the individual work of his numerous friends, give him hope of being one of those fortunate enough to be nominated.</p>
   <p>Julius Jaffe comes from one of the finest Jewish families. He is proud of his descent from Rabbi Mordecai Jaffe, the noted scholar. He received a good Jewish education; he is very interested in Jewish fraternal orders and is always ready to do a favor if he can. He has also had court experience, having acted for a few terms as Assistant City Prosecutor, Assistant City Attorney, and Assistant States Attorney.</p>
   <p>Mr. Abraham E. Edelman, another young Jewish man seeking the nomination for judge of the Municipal Court, was born in Smargon, Province of Wilna.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>He is thirty-four years old. When he was two years old, his father immigrated to America as a result of an outburst of pogroms. Four years later he sent for his wife and child.</p>
   <p>The young Edelman received his education in the Chicago public schools. He graduated from the Walsh Grammar School in 1890 and the Medill High School, four years later. He then went to work on the Chicago American, and in the evening he took a course at the John Marshall Law School. He attended the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor for a short time, and then the Northwestern University from which he graduated with an L L.B. degree in 1904. He immediately obtained permission to practice, and since then has been practicing in all the courts in every division of civil law.</p>
   <p>As a young Jewish man, Mr. Edelman took an active part in building and managing the Hebrew Institute, when it was first organized. For a short time he was a teacher there. He is also very active in the B'nai Brith and the Order Brith Abraham.</p>

   <p>Mr. Edelman is a member of the American Bar Association. He has written a good deal in law journals on methods of improving the law system. His articles in the American Journal of Criminal Law drew the attention of the most famous lawyers, and as a result he was appointed to the Council of the American Judiciary Society of Illinois, the important national body of which Mr. Taft was president for a long time.</p>
   <p>The other Jewish candidate, Mr. S. Friedlander, is a native American. He was born in 1886, in Danville, Illinois and has been a resident of Chicago since he was eight years old. He received a good education. He graduated from the Chicago College of Law and received a degree from the University of Michigan. He has been practicing in Chicago for the past eighteen years and has the reputation of being one of the finest lawyers [in the city]. He is a Progressive in politics, and as a result of the present unity between the Republican and Progressive parties, he is on the ticket of the Deneen faction of the Republican party.</p>

   <p>Julius Jaffe is number three on the Democratic ticket; Abraham Edelman is number fifteen on the Democratic ticket; S. Friedlander is number eight on the Republican ballot.</p>
