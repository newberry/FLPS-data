   <p>The West Side Democratic Club, a Jewish Democratic organization, opened up the campaign for the Democratic candidate, Mr. Sullivan, for United States senator in the Jewish community, by giving a large banquet at the Douglas Park Auditorium.</p>
   <p>Dr. George Sultan, a good old friend of the candidate, and one of his campaign managers, acted as toastmaster, and the following gentlemen assisted him on this occasion: (Eight names given). Candidate Sullivan was the last speaker, and after thanking the audience for the reception given in his honor, he spoke on Jewish problems, as follows:</p>
   
   <p>"Jews in foreign countries, especially in Russia, speak of America as the land of hope and promise. Under the yoke of oppression and persecution, alwaysbeing pursued and excommunicated from society, the Jew is constantly in distress in many parts of Europe. It is due to this sad plight that his main and only wish is, to have a home in America.</p>
   <p>"The old man and the old woman, due to their age have given up all hope of ever coming to this country, but they hope that their children will go to the land of promise. These parents, who are the oppressed and persecuted Jews of different countries in Europe have exhausted all their means and energies and have spared no expense, in making it possible for them, to send their children to America. These sons and daughters of the oppressed Jews in Europe come here to us full of enthusiasm and hope, that in America, they will have the right to work and to accomplish something that is worth while. They will, as soon as possible, through energy, enthusiasm and hard work, be in a position financially to bring their parents over to this country so that they all can live together in peace.</p>
   <p>"With this spirit and belief on their minds, in the neighborhood of 2,500,000 Jews of the 10 or 12 million scattered all over the world came here to the United States. Of this 2,500,000 you will find about 285,000 of them live in Chicago. Most of them came here as pioneers. They have made wonderful progress, and all who came here later and those who are coming now, find that their dreams have materialized.</p>
   
   <p>"The Jew has the same opportunities in America as any other men, and that is all any one may expect. That is all that a Jew wishes. All he has to do is to show the world that he is on equality with any other individual. The Jews of Chicago have proved it and are showing it every day.</p>
   <p>"Knowing the Jews, as we know them in Chicago, and especially as we know them on the West Side, it is very hard for us to understand why they are persecuted, oppressed and excluded in the lands which they left. Here in Chicago, we all know that the Jews are good citizens. We have seen them coming here not knowing our customs and language.</p>
   
   <p>Persecuted by murderous officials and hoodlums in the country where they came from, they left their dear loved ones behind, but after a few months, sometimes only a few weeks, they become useful, loyal and honorable men and women.</p>
   <p>"The Jews do not come to this country to take something away from us. As a matter of fact they come here to give as well as take. They give America their labor, their economic ideas, and they stand firm in their convictions as a nation and as individuals.</p>
   <p>"The Jew comes to America and takes advantage of the privileged opportunities which are offered, the right to work, to educate his children, and to become a citizen of our republic. He receives these rights and grasps at the opportunities afforded him by our Constitution and in return he shows his appreciation and worthiness of these rights. You Jews on the West Side, consider your children's education passionately. We, the Irish, were under the impression that we were first in that respect. But after observing what you are doing in the line of education, I must admit that we are in error. I was reliably informed, and I honestly believe it, that it matters not how poor the Jewish family is, the children will not leave school, until at least, they finish grammar school, and a large percentage of them graduate from high school. We find Jews in many different professions, such as doctors, lawyers, great musicians, teachers, etc.</p>
   
   <p>"Another thing that shows, how the Jews understand the value of their citizenship and its possibilities is the Jewish charity that I am referring to. It was proven that Chicago Jews are constantly looking after their own poor. Dr. Shulman tells me, and I believe it to be true, that 98 per cent of your charitable institutions come from Jews. Not only from the rich Jews, but also comes from the poor ones, the women who work in sweatshops and contribute a nickel a week and the boys who work as clerks in stores and contribute a dime. Dr. Shulman further said, that over $40,000 is collected annually from these nickels, dimes and quarters, mostly on the West Side. And all of it is spent for charity. That is something that your Jewish nation can be proud of!"</p>
   <p>In concluding his address, Mr. Sullivan said: "To a nation which gives to a land what the Jews have given America, that government is very much in debted. But on the other hand, you Jews must not forget that you also are greatly in debt to the government. I saw Jews in my travels in foreign lands. I saw them in Warsaw, where 285,000 of them reside. I also saw many Jews in Russia and in other European countries. I know how they are persecuted and driven out. So I know how successful you are in this land. There is a debt of gratitude that you owe to this country, by doing all within your power in holding up the honor of our country as a land of opportunity. This land of ours shall continue to be great, not only for Jews, but for all nations. This I hope you can do, and I earnestly believe that you will."</p>
