   <p>Rabbis in all synagogues of Chicago will speak next Saturday on the question why every Jew in the city should buy war stamps in order to help the Jewish war victims in Europe.</p>
   <p>The rabbis are canvassing every"Matzos"bakery and wine dealer, urging them to paste war stamps on all packages of "Matzos" and on bottles of wine.</p>
   <p>The war stamps committee collected $800 in February, not including the amount still to be collected from other firms.</p>
