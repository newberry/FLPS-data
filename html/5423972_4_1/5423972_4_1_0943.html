   <p>While engaged in work of charity for our poor, we noticed the large number of indigent, old, helpless, and almost homeless men and women in their midst, who are sorely in need of an asylum in which they could spend their declining years in rest and peace. To our great regret, there is yet no such institution in our Jewish community. The number of our needy aged and infirm is steadily increasing and the necessity of establishing a "Home" for those of our most deserving poor, is daily becoming more imperative. In order to bring about the speedy erection of this most needed "Home" for the aged and infirm of Chicago and vicinity, and the proper maintenance of such an institution, there was recently organized an incorporated an association under the name Israelitischer Altenheim Verein, with an active membership of nearly 300, and about 100 contributors. The members of this association have succeeded in interesting a number of benevolent ladies and gentlemen in their charitable project, and are anxious to accomplish their undertaking as soon as possible. But we find that the present means of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>our association are insufficient for the great work which is before us, and we therefore, earnestly appeal to the kind citizens of Chicago, and to benevolent people of other cities, to lend us a helping hand.</p>
