   <p>Leonard I. Wissman, well known Chicago attorney, has been appointed Assistant State's Attorney of Cook Country.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wissman has practiced law here since 1917. He first attracted public notice in the notorious "Parlor Banker" case in which a number of Lawn-dale residents had been mulcted of sums aggregating $100,000. Due to Wissman's able prosecution of the case, all the culprits were brought to light, and approximately 60 per cent of the loot was recovered.</p>
   <p>In 1918, he again attracted wide attention by his suit against Swift &amp; Company, in which he charged the packers with illegal methods and illegal combination. The charges were later sustained by the Federal Government, and the packers combination ordered dissolved.</p>

This was the last case tried before Judge Landis, and the local press carried accounts of praise accorded Wissman by that noted jurist.</p>
