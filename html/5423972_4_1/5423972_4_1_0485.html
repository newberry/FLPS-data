   <p>For this splendid deed it would be difficult to utter a more suitable word than the appeal which appeared yesterday in the Courier, requesting that today be made a day of fasting and prayer. All other nationalities of America also will pray in their houses of worship for the preservation of our armies and the victory of the American ideal of liberty and democracy over the evil power of autocracy and caprice.</p>
   <p>A word was spoken at the proper time and the plan to establish a hospital unit with the redemption money of those unable to fast is a deed worthy of serving as an example.</p>
   <p>A prayer is a beautiful gesture which costs nothing and requires no special effort. The act of praying, therefore, does not serve as evidence of uprightness.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Many a falsehood, and much flattery and hypocrisy are often concealed behind fervent prayers.. If there are any persons disloyal to America in the present crisis, they will probably be among the first who, though carrying treason in their hearts, will come pretending to pray for American success.</p>
   <p>But a prayer which is followed by an action resulting from that prayer makes the character of it a positive one. A hospital unit as a result of the ceremonial will signify best the patriotic mood of those who came to pray. Let the Jewish spirit be glorified by prayer, and let the hospital unit be established by means of redemptions. A splendid word! A noble deed! They complement each other.</p>
