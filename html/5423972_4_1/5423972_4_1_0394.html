   <p>Woodrow Wilson's name will go down on the annals of history as one of the great presidents of the United States. The list of great presidents is rather short. From among the thirty we have had, only five or six have left marks of their personality in the history of their times. To this small list now will be added forever the name of President Woodrow Wilson.</p>
   <p>His career as diplomat, statesman, and ruler was relatively short. His rise was sudden: from college professor to Governor of New Jersey. Once in this position, Wilson became a sensation throughout America, and before he had had an opportunity to do anything substantial as governor, he was placed in the White House. Shortly after he became president war broke out in Europe, and Wilson found himself suddenly as the most prominent man in the world, the man in whose <span class="page-break">\2</span>hands lay the faith of nations and peoples, yea, the faith of all civilized humanity.</p>
   <p>However we will not discuss now Wilson's leadership during the war, nor his diplomacy at the peace conference in Versailles. Wilson's intention during the war period and during the years of peace negotiations was to materialize that which he believed to be true. Being well aware of the world's intrigues, he applied all his strength and energy to lead his nation, and later the entire world, in the direction dictated by his convictions and principles. He took upon himself all responsibilities, not seeking to wiggle out of any task or duty regardless of how difficult they might be. A prodigious and energetic person, he devoted all his energy to the struggle against the gigantic problems that confronted him, and as long as his strength permitted him, and not until he was exhausted and broken up did he cease in his tiresome task. He broke down while speaking before the League of Nations; also at the Paris peace conference where he whole- <span class="page-break">\3</span>heartedly believed peace would be brought into the world. This break down started him in his sad course towards the grave, where he now rests.</p>
   <p>Wilson was a tragic figure; his tragedy was due to his inability to fathom the great chasm existing between the theoretical and the practical.</p>
   <p>He began his political career as a liberal, a radical. In 1910 and 1912 he introduced a new spirit to the American people. "True democracy" he called it. He had come to save the country from capitalism's power, to rid politics of the corruption brought about by the power of money.</p>
   <p>He spoke so highly of his dreams, with such a sublimity, that the masses were inspired to trust him with the destiny of the country. Thus it was that he was elected president to carry through the sublime ideals he had expressed in his campaign literature and speeches.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>But he never materialized these ideals; not once did he make an effective move towards their materialization. The reason was that he could not see the obstacles that blockaded him; he could not understand the powers that pushed the country in the opposite direction. After being elected he applied the same principles he used before election, that is nice phrases, reading of morals, in fact, words instead of action. When he spoke about the dangers of the big trusts or about freeing the nation from the powers of capital, he favored ignorantly and unwillingly the dictates of capital.</p>
   <p>The same occurred during the war and during the peace negotiations. He led this country into war on the sublime motives that he preached at the time, i. e, to give peace to the world, to save civilization, to bring justice to the oppressed. He was not aware of the great powers, which at that time had the nations hypnotized and drove them to slaughter, and which had no connections with his sublime principles.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>By dragging this nation into the World War, Wilson added to the power of selfish elements whose idea is to eradicate all great principles and to destroy all ideals that are beautiful.</p>
   <p>Innocently believing in the impossible, he used to deceive himself, as well as millions of others, by just closing his eyes and dreaming. But the time came when he could dream no longer and he had to open his eyes. When he did, he saw the horrible abyss that lay between his nice phraseology and ugly reality.</p>
   <p>Whether deep down in his heart he ever realized his great mistake will never be known. He fell the minute he saw reality in the face. Never again since that breakdown, was he able to judge or weigh the occurrence of the world, in the role that he played during the time these occurences took place. From the statements that he made from time to time, it was plainly seen that he was a changed man. He understood that the <span class="page-break">\6</span>great world drama ended in a tragedy, but never let it be known that he realized how much responsibility his role added to the tragedy.</p>
