   <p>Every Jewish citizen should fulfill his obligation by going to the primaries tomorrow. The primaries are very important. They determine which of the various candidates shall be nominated for this year's campaign. Anybody who knows and understands the importance of electing efficient and capable candidates, knows that the primaries should not be neglected.</p>
   <p>The primaries are particularly important this year, because many incapable and unqualified men appear on the ballot and if the citizens make no attempt to nominate the capable candidates, we face the danger of admitting as candidates those who are undesirable.</p>

   <p>Jewish citizens should, at this primary, show that they understand the significance of the primaries, and come in vast numbers to the polling places to nominate suitable candidates.</p>
   <p>It is true that many candidates who will be nominated tomorrow will be defeated at the main election. However, at the same time, it is very important that the candidates running for city, state and national offices get a large support in order that they may carry on their campaign for election with more encouragement and determination.</p>
   <p>Jewish women should, for the second time, show the political consciousness and civil responsibility developed among them. Not only should they go to the polling places, but they should also influence their husbands to go.</p>
