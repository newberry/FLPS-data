   <p>It is nothing unusual for Chicago to be visited by a cantor invited to officiate at the Sabbath services or to give a concert in some synagogue. We have already had all sorts of cantors, even those who drag the prayer shawls, the holy ark, and the prayers into theaters. [Some cantors rent theaters for the high holidays. Tr.] Those who have remained within the confines of the synagogue are mostly cantors who display beautiful voices and melodies and other such requisites as are essential to a singer, but as are of secondary importance to a leader in services.</p>
   <p>Whenever a synagogue advertices that it has invited, as a guest, a "famous" cantor, a picture is posted of a man who looks more like an actor than a cantor. He is attired in garments fashioned after the Catholic spirituals, and his qualifications are written in such a manner as to shatter the nerves of every decent and sensible Jew. And it is still worse when we witness how the holy ark is being transformed into an auction block, the synagogue into a meeting hall, and the cantor into an auctioneer.</p>
   <p>This condition becomes more mournful when we realize that the majority of the Chicago synagogues have good, respectable cantors who are invaluable to the synagogue as well as to the entire Chicago Jewry. To station a guest cantor at the altar is not only blasphemy but also an insult to the synagogue's cantor and the congregation. It is therefore a pleasure to note that, - when it so happens, - a guest cantor deviates from the regular, abhorent tradition and approaches the altar according to Hoyle.</p>
   <p>The guest cantor with us now is Mr. Zadel Rovner. Aside from being an authority on music, a composer, and a director, he is a cantor who should not only be heard but also seen. It is typically Jewish enjoyment to watch this patriarchal cantor as he stands enwrapped in his prayer shawl like a messenger of the Jewish people.</p>
   
   <p>From what we are told, his manager, i.e., the finance minister of Mr. Zadel Rovner, is very displeased with the manner in which Mr. Rovner upholds his Jewish traditions. Great credit is due Cantor Rovner for overcoming this blasphemy and not sacrificing his Jewish stateliness for American dollars.</p>
   <p>The Jewish public welcomes such guest cantors. Besides having an opportunity to hear an outstanding personality in the musical world, we can see a great leader of services, which is rather rare in America. Rovner's conduct will have a good effect upon the young cantors in Chicago. They will follow in the steps of Rovner because it is an honor to do so.</p>
