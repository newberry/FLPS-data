   <p>They know, as well as we, that, in America, there are thousands of young Jewish workers, small businessmen, professional men, who would like to be independent, who would like to have a secure future, living a purely natural and healthy life on a farm. Besides the difficulties connected with farm life for a Jew, they know, as well as we, that he [the Jew] does not enjoy solitude. He feels the lack of a social environment and that is why the city attracts him. Therefore it is no wonder that after having lived for a long time on a farm and having made quite a fortune, and with a view of increasing that fortune, the Jew leaves the farm and returns to the city, because of the lack of companionship.</p>
   <p>"Dorf Aufbau Gesellschaft" contends that there is a cure for this malady; the solution would be a Jewish colony in which the city and farm would be <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>combined--a natural and secure farm life, plus the modern provisions and conveniences of the city.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the "Dorf Aufbau Gesellschaft" has undertaken to unite and organize "all earnest and ambitious young Jewish men, who have such a mode of living in mind, into one organization".</p>
   <p>Their plan is that each member who wishes to settle in a colony and who wishes to own his own independent establishment in a rural district near a large city, should have at least one thousand dollars. He invests the thousand dollars in the society and, in return, receives shares. Then it [the society], as a unit, makes the necessary loans that he requires; as a result, he will receive a plot of land, a modern dwelling place, domestic animals, machinery, and feed. In accordance with a certain agreement with the society, several of the members may "work out" a portion of the thousand dollars, because the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>society will try, in every way possible, to see that the labor, trade, and any other services are rendered exclusively by its members. The society aims to introduce the co-operative system only in buying and selling. Other wise, each farmer, or colonist, may be his own boss in his own establishment, and his success or failure will be his personal gain or loss.</p>
   <p>The society further intends to: 1. Employ skilled workers in order to teach the members how to go about their work and to see that everything is raised according to the latest methods.</p>
   <p>2. Establish certain industries in the colony such as fruit and vegetable canning, textile enterprises, etc., thus enabling its members to become more independent and successful.</p>
   <p>3. Provide its members with loans and credit, either through its own members <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>or through outside financial sources.</p>
   <p>We must also say that under no circumstances is the colony to have any specific political, religious, or ideological character. Everyone should be absolutely free to conduct himself according to his own convictions, without any interference.</p>
   <p>I would like to see more American Jews on farms. In this way alone can we attain real significance [as a people], not to mention the physical and economic benefits to be derived. I sympathize with this undertaking and wish the "Dorf Aufbau Gesellschaft" success. Those who are interested in this enterprise should contact the officers of the society, whose headquarters are at 1120 South Albany Avenue.</p>
