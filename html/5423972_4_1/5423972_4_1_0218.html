   <p>Congressman A. J. Sabath has done more service to the Jews of America than many other great Jews whose names are mentioned daily. A. J.

He fought like a lion against the proposed anti-immigration laws. He wrote the minority report of the House Committee on Immigration, a report that is a masterpiece, against the arguments advanced by the enemies of immigration. This document is answers fully all the arguments of the enemies of immigration.

   <p>Congressman Sabath is always on the watch whenever anything affecting Jews comes up before Congress. He is always the first to defend Jewish interests. The American Jewry has not many such defenders and it is, therefore, the duty of the Chicago Jews to see to it that Congressman Sabath should also continue in the future his productive work in Washington. All his colleagues respect him. He is a man of great influence in Washington's political circles. He has the confidence of his Republican opponents; they, too, respect and esteem him. Chicago Jews must do everything in their power for his reelection with a big majority, because he has served well the Jews in general and the American Jews in particular and because he has such a great influence as a member of Congress.</p>
