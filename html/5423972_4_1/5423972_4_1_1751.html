   <p>The musical activity and interest in Chicago has always been more or less pronounced, and it is interesting to note the development which has taken place within a short time. One does not invite criticism in claiming for Chicago a leading place among the few musical cities of America.</p>
   <p>Even in the ante-fire days there were already large singing societies, and operas sung every season with exclusively local talent. Orchestral and chamber concerts also flourished.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Carl Wolfsohn came from Philadelphia and founded the Beethoven Society, a new impetus was given to musical matters. Mr. Wolfsohn's remarkable ability also manifested itself in a performance of the complete Beethoven Sonatas, and the rendering of very successful and important chamber concerts.</p>

   <p>Meanwhile the Apollo Club was started under the leadership of Mr. S. G. Pratt. But it was not until its present leader, Mr. Wm. Tomlins, assumed the baton, that it took rank among the musical societies of the country.</p>
   <p>The most successful organization has given Sunday concerts at Turner Hall, directed by Mr. Adolf Rosenbecker. Some of the artists are Mrs. Fannie Bloomfield-Zeisler, Mr. Jacobson, eminent master of the violin, Mr. Marum, who excels on the same instrument, and Mr. Fredercik Hess, violincello virtuoso; the latter two gentlemen are associated with Mr. Wolfsohn in giving chamber concerts.</p>
