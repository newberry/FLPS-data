   <p>Many persons who held safe-deposit boxes in the banking firm of Adolph Silver and Company, found their money and jewelry intact yesterday. This led to the belief that all other boxes are safe. One box was found broken, but it has not, as yet, been established who is directly responsible for this act.</p>
   <p>After the vaults of the bank at 1229 South Jefferson Street were opened yesterday, Mr. Samuel Powler, the head of the Receivership Department of the Central Trust Company, declared that the resources of the bankrupt banking firm now amount to $5,500. Of this sum $2,500 was found in the vaults of the firm on Jefferson Street, $38 in the officers at 848 Maxwell Street, and about $3,000 deposited in various banks of Chicago.</p>
   <p>While employees of the Babold Safe and Lock Company were drilling into the floor in order to open the vaults and remove the money , a few hundred depositors <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>gathered around Jefferson Street where they were waiting with throbbing hearts to hear whether the safe-deposit boxes remained safe. When it was announced that the boxes remained intact the news evoked great joy among the assembled bank depositors.</p>
   <p>In the meantime an investigation has already begun and various witnesses, whose names were not revealed by the authorities, were summoned to tell everything they knew about Mr. Silver's business. Judge Landis told District Attorney Klein last evening that he may have a Grand Jury investigation if he wishes. This shows that it is very likely that the Federal Government may intervene in the investigation and indict those found guilty.</p>
