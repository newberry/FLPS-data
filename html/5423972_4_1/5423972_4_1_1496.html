   <p>The banking institution of the firm A. Loeb &amp; Bros., which was established in 1854 in Chicago, has made considerable progress during the last years. It also has been very successful in dealing with real estate. Their success is due chiefly to the fact that they have managed their business according to strict business principles, and that they have attempted to conscientiously meet the just claims of their customers. The fair dealings of this institution assures all who have to transact business with it, that they will not be defrauded. Previous experience in this connection have caused customers to patronize it again and again. This banking home is an honor to the German business world, and we trust it will succeed even more during the present year.</p>
