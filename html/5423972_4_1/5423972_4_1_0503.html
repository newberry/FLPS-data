   <p>From Camp Logan, Texas comes the announcement that Major Abel Davis was promoted yesterday to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and in a day or two will be appointed as a full colonel. Had it not been for the "red tape," Major Davis would have received at once the rank of a full colonel.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Colonel Davis is well known in Chicago, as one of the outstanding lawyers, successful bankers and prominent civic leaders. He has been, since the Spanish-American War, a major in the First Illinois Regiment, which bears the name "Dandy First" because this regiment has always been one of the best of the National Guard of America. Colonel Garrity, the commander of this regiment, resigned, and it is expected that Lieutenant Colonel Davis will be appointed in his place.</p>
   <p>Colonel Davis, until now, has been in command of the Provisional Regiment of three thousand troops who were on the verge of being sent home because of <span class="page-break">2</span>unfitness for service. The three thousand troops were taken out from the division and put under the command of Major Davis. It did not take long for this regiment to become one of the best in the camp, thanks to the remarkable work of Colonel Davis.</p>
   <p>Colonel Davis has established a wonderful record since he came to Camp Logan. He has distinguished himself in every office he has held and has received the recognition of General Bell, the commander of Camp Logan.</p>
   <p>Colonel Davis is a brother of James Davis, president of the Orthodox Jewish Charities.</p>
   <p>The First Illinois National Guard Regiment is now known as the 130th Infantry Regiment of the regular army. Davis is now the commander of that regiment.</p>
