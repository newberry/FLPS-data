   <p>Regardless to which political party you belong you are, as a citizen of the State of Illinois, interested in the question of a new State constitution, which will have to be decided on the ballot next Tuesday.</p>
   <p>The necessity for a new State constitution which should be in harmony with up-to-date conditions and problems cannot be stressed too strongly. Our State constitution is almost fifty years old, and that which was reasonable and purposeful fifty years ago, is now decrepit, superflous, and even injurious for the further progress of the State of Illinois and the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is true that the American Constitution is still much older, but the great difference between the Federal and State constitutions is that the first is limited to general principles of government and leaves it to the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Federal courts to interpret the details according to the altered circumstances. The State constitution, though, regulates the government of the State in all details, and is not so flexible as the Federal Constitution. Therefore, it is necessary to revise the State constitution at certain periods.</p>
   <p>The first constitution of the State of Illinois was adopted in 1818, and thirty years later, in 1848, a second constitution was adopted, which became important through the development of the State. Twenty-two years later, in 1870, a third constitution was adopted, which is still in existence. Throughout the entire forty-eight years, during which the State of Illinois made wonderful progress in industrial, economic, and cultural development and the growth of the population, the constitution remained practically the same. During this time, entire new industries and institutions grew up, of which the authors of the constitution did not have the slightest idea as, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>for instance, telephones, electric lighting, etc. There appeared new labor problems, new government problems, etc., which require a broader interpretation, but the narrow frame of our old State constitution does not permit the free movement of our State machinery. The old suit became too small for our political body. It is almost a disgrace to appear in it before people--before the other states which have adopted up-to-date constitutions.</p>
   <p>Will Illinois be in the line of progressive states, or remain in the small circle of backward states?</p>
   <p>This question will have to be answered by every voter at the polls next Tuesday. He will have to vote on a constitutional convention, a convention of delegates elected by the people to formulate a new constitution for the State. There is no question that every thinking voter, regardless of his party affiliation, should vote "Yes" for the constitutional convention, and <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>thereby help our State along the road of progress and democracy.</p>
   <p>Remember! if you don't mark "Yes" to the question on the ballot about the constitutional convention your vote will be counted for "No". You must vote "Yes" in order to make sure that your vote, next Tuesday, will be for the necessary reforms.</p>
