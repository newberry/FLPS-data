   <p>The history of how the West become colonized by Americans is full of interesting events. Aside from its economic significance to America, the story of the settling of the West contains many dramatic details, -enough to take your breath away. A well-known American historian, Charles Beard, states that the history of the settling of the West is much more interesting than the history of the Exodus from Egypt, which describes how the Jews wandered through the deserts for a long time before they reached the promised land.</p>
   <p>Many of those who traveled to settle in the West, lost their lives; many were killed by Indians or died in the desert from thirst; many died from sickness while on their way; other starved, but most of them reached their destination. They opened large tracts of wild land for civilization. The first ones who left seeking for new untrodden paths, the pioneers, were people of extraordinary strong character, of restless souls, who stopped at nothing, - fear or danger. After them come the usual sort that reap the fruit of others that planted it on the face of great hardships.</p>

   <p>The first pioneers of the West were called "backwood" people, choppers of the woods, builders of roads, and fighters of hardships, animals, and wild Indians. These pioneers even had to kill the aborigines of America, the Indians, but it couldn't be helped if they were to open the great West for the nations of the world.</p>
   <p>The "back-wood" people came from many nations and races. Among them were to be found the Irish, English, French, German, Hollanders, and Swedes; all immigrants who had given up all connection which the Old World to come here and settle down for good. They did not stop at the old colonies, but kept on and on, becoming an independent group of colonies long before the first arrivals. They took orders from no one, living a sort of Anarchistic life.</p>
   <p>Jefferson got a real bargain when he bought from Napoleon from 15 million dollars, the big space of land that now constitutes Missouri and other states. President Jefferson, who could foresee the future, was criticised and abused, by his political opponents for paying such a gigantic sum for wild lands. From this land <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>were born the states of Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and large parts of the States of Louisiana, Minnesota, North Dakota, Colorado, Montana, and Wyoming.This land alone is now worth more than a thousand times as much as Jefferson paid for it. The extraordinary expansion of America began with this transaction long before the deal between Jefferson and Napoleon was closed, the first pioneers, the "backwood" people colonized large tracts of land in the states of Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, and Wisconsin, in the Northwest; and in the state of Tennessee, in the Southwest which were still wild regions when the American Revolution ended. The "backwood" people worked this land for America. Were it not for the first pioneers who pushed their way on to the Mississippi River, this deal with Louisiana would have never materialized.</p>
   <p>Of the first pioneers to start the movement Westward, the most distinguished one is Daniel Boone. The story of this pioneer is like the stories of thousands of others whose lives were in constant danger in their march to the Wild West.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Boone started his exploration from Kentucky, in the year 1769. The year before the Declaration of Independence was signed, he organized the town of Boones-borough. After a quarter century Boone said that the region was too civilized for him and that he must travel further. The time was past when where were trees to chop down for a real good fire, so Boone crossed the Mississippi in search of new adventures.</p>
   <p>Boone's life was written by President Theodore Roosevelt, who was a great admirer of this heroic pioneer of the West. Before being elected president, he spent much of his time in the West, where he took a liking to cowboys and farmers.</p>
   <p>Born in Pennsylvania Boone went to North Carolina, where he married and lived in a log cabin of his own. As the other colonists, he cultivated the soil and hunted for wild animals. Just across on the hills near the settlement, there were thick forests through which no white man ever dared trespass, full of wild Indians who made their livelihood by robbing the wild animal hunters that dared enter them.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>In the year 1773 Boone was made chief of a group of new colonists coming to settle in the new land. Once, while they sat down to rest after a long ride, a group of Indians suddenly approached and killed most of them, including Boone's two sons. The survivors turned back and thus the first trial to colonize the region was in vain. After, when Boone wanted to organize a second group he met with many difficulties, as there were not enough men willing to take a fling at sacrificing their lives.</p>
   <p>A few years later he succeeded in organizing many of his friends in a second attempt. They took the same road, but this time they were prepared against attacks by Indians. The new colonists in this territory started to build villages. That is how the settlement started in Kentucky.</p>
   <p>Boone was the leader of the colonists both in times of war with the Indians and in times of peace. He was the representative of the colonists in the Virginia Parliament, until finally they established their own little parliament. Boone made his livelihood by surveying. Being thoroughly acquainted with the region <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>he would survey fields for new colonists who bed to chop down the trees and cultivate the soil. Boone was chief of the hunters. Without him they would not make a move, even if the Indians were preparing to attack them. Every colonist had to be armed with a gun. The Indians were more anxious to trap Boone than any of the others. Being that Boone had to absent himself so often, to parliament or on long trips to survey fields for new colonists, his life was in danger every minute. His ears were forever listening. Any little sound, the stealthy movement of living creatures, made him look around, and be cautious, lest the Indians might be approaching.</p>
   <p>Once, on coming home, he learned that his own daughter and two other girls had been captured by the Indians. There was great alarm and sorrow among the colonists, but Boone did not get excited. He immediately picked some of his friends and followed the tracks left by the Indians. In two days Boone found where the Indians were. At their camp, the Indians sat in a circle, in the center of which there were many deer they had just killed. They sat content, singing their wild <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>songs. Boone and his friends attacked the camp, and after a hand-to hand fight, in which both sides fought desperately, he and his companions succeeded in rescuing the girls.</p>
   <p>Such was the life the first colonists had to put up with. In spite of the constant dangers on all sides, the first pioneers fought their way through to the West and it was through their fearlessness that America expanded from the Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>
   <p>The first pioneers were poor, but there was plenty of land. There was no need of working for a salary, and each one was his own boss. The first pioneers wanted to be independent. The Southwest attracted many colonists. In the Southern states, Virginia and the Carolines, there were large plantations where manual labor was done by negro slaves. There was no room for small farmers, as the territory was already controlled by large tobacco and cotton plantations.</p>

   <p>The first pioneers lived on friendly terms with themselves. When anything was to be done, everyone worked together until the task was finished. If a farmer wanted a house built, all the farmers in the neighborhood would get together, chop down the trees, build the foundation, and in a short time the house was completed.</p>
   <p>In general, the life of the first pioneers was very lonely. The closest neighbors were many miles apart.</p>
   <p>The cultural life of the first pioneers, naturally, was also very poor. There were no schools, not even a church, for miles. For the children they had to hire a teacher, who knew nothing himself, and who, after teaching the children what little he knew, was left without occupation and had to help milk the cows.</p>
   <p>Kentucky and Tennessee in the Southwest led to the purchase of Louisiana, a purchase which started a new epoch in the colonization of the West.</p>
