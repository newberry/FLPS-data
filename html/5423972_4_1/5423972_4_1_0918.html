   <p>A letter to the editor. Warm words when cold and gloom are manifest. Moral is sought. For when a woman and children starve, what there is to do to help?? The editor of the Workers' Ghetto has received the following communication which speaks for itself:</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>November 1, 1908.</p>
   <p>Dear Editor of the Jewish Courier:</p>
   <p>Your are requested by our union, The Progressive Cigar Maker's Union, to remember us with a few "warm words," Tuesday, November 3, to point out to our workers, the cigar makers the necessity of organization. Their wages are so pitifully low, that seventy five per cent of the cigar makers earn only six or seven dollars a week. On these low wages, a married man is obliged to support his family. To speak of the morale and hygienic conditions, the picture is more sad.</p>

   <p>Our union expects cigar workers, not yet organized, all bunch makers and rollers at our meeting, Tuesday evening, November 3, at the Shapiro Hall, corner 12th and Waller Street. R. Yukelson.</p>
   <p>We are printing this letter, although, it is too late, as the date of the meeting of the cigar makers is now past. We are fulfilling half of Mr. Yukelson's request. We are not in a position to fulfill the other half.</p>
   <p>His request is that we write some warm words. Only a thought of seventy five percent of workers of a certain trade are earning as little as six and seven dollars a week, and have to support their families on this miserable pittance makes one's body cold. The writer of this article also has a family and he imagines what a tragedy it would be were he to earn only six or seven dollars a week.</p>
   <p>Each time he sees a child of his, well nourished and clothed, with an opportunity for a good education and happy, he pictures a cigar maker's child, starving or under fed, naked and unhappy. Each time I see my wife, who is busy as a bee, trying to make our children more satisfied, I think of a wife of a cigar maker, who is also busy, but what with? She is busy talking to her children, in order to cause them to forget their terrible hunger.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Personally, I am afraid to look at myself in the mirror, for that compels me to think of the faces of cigar makers, pale from the effect of tobacco and starvation wages. And Mr. Yukelson requests me to write warm words!</p>
   <p>Warm words, when my body is shaking from anger! Be a wizard and write such a thing! Mr. Yukelson, perhaps, can write it, for he is, as a worm in a jar of horse-radish, he is in the "trade," to live with a family on six or seven dollars a week. But, I brother, brother......it makes me shiver to think of this situation. It seems to me that no warmer words than six and seven dollars a week need to be mentioned. This alone should be so hot and burning that it will ignite the heart of every worker, it must ignite with a fire which would spread and convert into ashes, the hearts of the, so called, philanthropic bosses, who pay their workers such miserably low wages.</p>
   <p>And the tragedy is still greater, when the naive Mr. Yukelson says: "The morale and hygienic conditions." Mr. Yukelson is seeking hygiene where hunger and misery are reigning supreme, where six dollars a week must maintain a family, it would be a matter of laughter if it were not as tragic as it is!</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>One can about picture a family living on six and seven dollars, what rent they can pay, what rooms they can live in, what furniture they can have and what food they can eat? Mr. Yukelson speaks about morale and hygienic conditions, when the thing to speak about is bread. One can hardly expect a worker to come to meetings, when after a day's labor he finds no food in his home, and has the task of trying to make his children fall asleep, so that they will not realize how much they are starving!</p>
   <p>No friend Yukelson, if you want to help your co-workers you must appeal to the organized workers, who have struggled and have won. Those who already have sufficient bread, they must help you, who are hungry and weak and unable to help themselves! We will at all times be glad to open the columns of the Workers' Ghetto for you the minute you give us a signal. And if there is still blood running in Jewish hearts, I say Jewish-workers or no workers, we will warm it up, so that it will give courage to the workers, to at least win for themselves, food, shelter and clothes.</p>
