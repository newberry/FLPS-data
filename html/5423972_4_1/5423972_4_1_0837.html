   <p>A bill was recently introduced in the United States Congress to the effect that the government should pay a pension to widows, and from the representatives' attitude toward this bill, it is inferred that they deem it unimportant. At the same time, however, a pension was instituted in several states, such as Colorado, Kansas, and Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>Truthfully speaking, this bill is of utmost importance, because the question of assisting widows actually means that young, innocent orphans shall not be deprived of their mothers and robbed of their homes. We know that when the head of a family passes away, not only does a father and husband die, but also the provider, the vanguard of the <span class="page-break">2</span>entire family. The widow cannot work in order to earn a livelihood and take care of her children at the same time. She is, therefore, either compelled to surrender her children to an orphanage or go to work and thereby neglect them.</p>
   <p>If a law were enacted granting a pension to widows, and such as to enable them to keep up the morale of their homes, raise and educate their children without sending them to an orphanage, then many a young orphan would not be torn away from their mothers.</p>
   <p>This does not imply that we need not have any orphanages. Orphans whose mothers die must be raised in institutions. Also there are children whose mothers are afflicted with sickness or troubles which render them incapable of raising a family.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The plight of widows was not improved in states where pensions were to a certain extent carried through, due to inadequate funds and to improper methods of supporting widows. A federal law can establish order and can be more advantageous than the action of individual states. In reality, all orphans will be our future citizens, who will voice an opinion in government affairs. This is why the debt to provide them with homes in their early youth rests upon the Federal Government.</p>
   <p>At this point, however, we are confronted with something else which demands rather serious deliberation, viz. What widows shall be eligible for pension? Actually the country is replete with widows and orphans whose husbands and fathers have not died, but have abandoned their families through either divorce or desertion.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>As soon as a man abandons his home, his wife and children remain in the same dreadful condition as if he would have died. But there are those who think that such widows need not get a pension. Such unfortunate families, they contend, should be investigated and supported by private charitable institutions. Others reason that pensions will act as inducement for men to forsake their families, knowing that the government will provide their wives and children with the necessaries of life.</p>
   <p>There are, however, those who nurture the belief that government should not, in general, concern itself with the question of supporting widows. They think that this should be left entirely in the hands of private institutions.</p>
   <p>It would be worthy of notice for such people to look through a report <span class="page-break">5</span>on widows in Kansas City, in which Judge E. E. Potterfield, of the Juvenile Court, declared that the primary thing which led to improve the lot of the widows was the fact that the majority of children charged with crime were orphans whose mothers were working. This alone will suffice to convince them that private charitable institutions are unable to support the number of widows in each state. And the state, itself, cannot do much more in this respect. Even the majority of reformers in the states that have already attempted to do so, will admit this. This is why it is up to the Federal Government to undertake this task.</p>
