   <p>Rosa Raisa is not the only Jewish singer in the Chicago Civic Opera this season. There are two additional singers of rare ability on the opera stage. They are Alexander Kepnis, basso, and Kathrine Meisle, contralto.</p>
   <p>These two singers appeared last Sunday in Wagner's"Siegfried", and made a great hit in their debut. The music critics were greatly inspired by the two new opera singers.</p>
   <p>They proclaim Kepnis one of the most outstanding stars in the operatic world and they cannot imagine how the opera "Siegfried" could be presented without him.</p>
