   <p>Two days ago, in this column, we pointed out briefly to the military alternative that now confronts us. We find it necessary to reaffirm our position, because it involves matters that are worthy of attention.</p>
   <p>Our alternative, briefly stated, is this: Should war be declared against Germany, and should Uncle Sam be in need of a large army, he will be forced to resort to military conscription, and nobody will be able to escape it. So, why wait until we are forced to enlist? Why not show more love and respect to Uncle Sam by offering him our services voluntarily?</p>
   <p>And if, on the other hand, we do not enter the war, then there will certainly be no grounds to be afraid.</p>
   
   <p>We know of many young Jews who have already enlisted, and of many who are about to enlist. However, we admit that we would like to see a larger number of Jews offer their services to Uncle Sam at this crucial moment.</p>
   <p>We would also like to see another thing in connection with this; namely, that the enlistment of young Jews outshine all others. By this we do not intend to be haughty in expressing our patriotism, nor do we take this position for fear that we will be accused of cowardice, but because we believe that a short time of disciplinary training with Uncle Sam, and the experience thereof, is worth the trouble, even in time of peace, when it is done voluntarily.</p>
   <p>In the English-Yiddish newspapers, all sorts of protests were published against the organization of Jewish military companies. We cannot share the views of such papers. They spring from those Jewish circles that support the maxim that "the less the Jew is mentioned, the better it is for him; and we should try to slip through life without stressing Judaism too often."</p>
   <p>There are Jews who fear that the Jews will be too widely discussed if separate Jewish companies are apparent. And should a Jewish company stumble, it will reflect on other Jews. If, on the contrary, a Jewish company should distinguish itself, it would then be an honor, and anyone protesting now against a Jewish company, would then proudly claim his portion of that honor.</p>
   <p>These very persons speak from the viewpoint of their own personal gains. They do not take into consideration whether it would be better for the enlisted young Jews themselves.</p>
   <p>The very same Jews who protest and who are afraid to demonstrate Judaism to the world, get more pleasure out of playing cards with "their own kind."</p>
   
   <p>Incidentally, they will also play poker or pinochle with a Gentile. They, nevertheless, feel better and act more freely when playing "among their own kind" in the Standard club, or even in the Lawndale club, where, it is said, the stakes are higher than in Gentile clubs.</p>
   <p>Why don't they gamble with Gentiles?</p>
   <p>There are many pretexts to the question. One pretext is enough to satisfy us; viz., they feel more contented, more at ease.</p>
   <p>Why can't this also be applied to a Jewish company in a regiment?</p>
   <p>We can fully realize just why a Jewish company would feel happier among themselves, and each one would be satisfied to be with "his own kind" rather than be with an overbalancing majority of Gentiles.</p>
   <p>The Jews have not experienced any shame in the Zion Corps, under English officers in the Dardanelles.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that, with "their own kind," Jewish soldiers would bring to light more moral courage, and the feeling of unity, of mutal responsibility, would actually be a source of comfort and encouragement to higher acts.</p>
   <p>It is remarkable that these thoughts have been expressed in our presence by young Jews who have already enlisted. They sense their patriotism for America. At the same time they also feel that it would please them, as Jews, to be together in one company, for the simple reason of being more outstanding and being with "their own kind."</p>
   <p>The instinct is the same as among the Jewish poker players in the Standard club, except that this is for a noble cause.</p>
   <p>Why should there not be Jewish companies in American Regiments?</p>
