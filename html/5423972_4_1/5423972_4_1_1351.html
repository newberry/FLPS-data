All the stores on Halsted Street, between Fourteenth Street and Gilpin Place, and from Union Avenue to Peoria Street, are overloaded with various kinds of merchandise, which is being sold at low prices. The whole neighborhood has been magnificently decorated, music is being played, and big crowds from the West Side and from other districts are being attracted.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, when the carnival opened, the stores were full of customers.

Klein and Twelfth Street Department Stores, and also at cloak stores, clothing stores, millinery stores, shoe stores, woolen stores and restaurants, and particularly at Golds' Restaurant.
