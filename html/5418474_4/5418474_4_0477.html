   <p>Rear-Admiral Charles Badger spoke yesterday before the Committee on Naval Affairs, comparing shipbuilding plans during the period of 1903 - 1919. Our original aim was to build a fleet greater than Germany's.</p>
   <p>The United States has at present nineteen dreadnoughts in active service and under construction, while Germany has, if the available information is reliable, twenty-two first-class battleships and eight cruisers. The United States would reach the same naval power, so far as large craft is concerned, by building three battleships and eight cruisers. At present our navy is the third largest in the world; France holding fourth place.</p>

   <p>This year the Advisory Board of the Navy has revised its figures of 1903 considerably and has decided to build by 1925 a fleet second to none.</p>
   <p>The committee not being insistent, failed to ask the Admiral, who is also a member of the Advisory Board, the reason for this change in policy. The discussion, which in the main centered on how strong the fleet should be, elicited the information that the Advisory Board favors a fleet ten per cent stronger than any force which might dare attack the United States. To the question of how many warships should be built within two years to be on a parity with Great Britain by 1918, the Admiral said that we would require forty battleships, fifteen battle-cruisers, twenty-five fast reconnoitering cruisers, two hundred submarines and two hundred and fifty destroyers. Such a fleet cannot be built in less than four years.</p>
   <p>In 1903 we wanted a fleet equal to Germany's. In 1916 we desire a navy like Britain's, which is the strongest in the world.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>This is a mighty step; a colossal change from one program to the other. During 1903 our strength was similar to Germany's, whereas England's was considered twice as powerful as either of them. England still maintains this supremacy. Much more significant than this huge armament project is the new attitude connected with it. No one, not even the most irresponsible war whooper of 1905,shows any inclination to demand a fleet on a parity with Great Britain's.</p>
   <p>In that period England's navy was considered unapproachable and no one saw the necessity of formulating any plans to cope with it because of the sublime friendship and eternal peace that prevailed between Britain and the United States. As a consequence of this pro-British attitude, this condition still obtains, save that to-day our Navy demands to be on a parity with the Kingdom. The committee declined to inquire about the change in sentiment of our Navy and refused to investigate the motive <span class="page-break">\4</span>that prompts this increase in defense expenditures.</p>
   <p>It was prudent, for further discussion would have been superfluous, since everybody knows the answer. All Americans know, must know, even if they do not admit it publicly, that England is not only a possible danger but in the last analysis the only peril which confronts us, and we must be protected. Common discretion precluded an official acknowledgment of the matter, since it is always detrimental to say or do something which is not absolutely necessary, for after all, we have not reached the status we should have and the 1916 program of the Navy Advisory Board is still on paper.</p>
   <p>America will show good judgment if it completes its contemplated enlargement of the Navy. If England's rule of the waves is broken by Germany in the meantime, so that we need not continue our naval improvement policy, so much the better. We shall then save considerable <span class="page-break">\5</span>money and blood. The financial sacrifice made so far can readily be forgotten.</p>
