   <p>Like wildfire, the news spread through the city yesterday afternoon that A. C. Hesing had been pardoned. The news is to be attributed to the following telegrams from the Evening Journal, the Evening Post, and the Daily News:</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C., Sept. 14, Federal Attorney General Taft, after a thorough study of the case, has decided to prepare documents for the pardon of A. C. Hesing and to submit them to the president. In his report to Washington, Federal Attorney Bangs writes in such a manner, that Taft considers it as a recommendation for a pardon. Taft says, he has gained the conviction that there was an understanding between the federal attorneys and A. C. Hesing that should the latter plead guilty he would get off with a nominal punishment. This understanding has not been kept and Hesing has received a severe punishment, perhaps because Judge Blodgett did not know about this understanding.</p>
