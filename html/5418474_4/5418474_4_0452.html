   <p>Yesterday the City Council Committee on Local Transportation decided to resume negotiations with the officials of the Streetcar Company so that a plan for combining the streetcar lines, the elevated lines, and a subway system may be devised. It was resolved to petition the legislature to enact laws giving the city the authority to carry out these plans. Alderman H. D. Capitain, the Chairman of the Committee, was commissioned to submit to the legislature three bills giving the city the following powers:</p>
   <p>(1) To unite the streetcar lines with the elevated, the former to be operated under the present Surface Line Ordinances, the latter under state laws; (2) to build a subway system throughout the city; and (3) to lease and operate a combined streetcar line, elevated line, and subway system.</p>
   
   <p>Alderman Capitain sent the bills to Springfield yesterday, and requested Corporation Counsel Ettelson, who is a member of the Senate, to introduce them. The sanction of the aldermen is to be obtained in a meeting on May 19, since a special session of the Council could not be called, owing to the absence of the Mayor.</p>
   <p>The Committee further ordered that two bills, which make it possible to carry out the plan of Alderman Schwartz, be framed. One of the bills provides for the election of a special board, similar to the Bureau of Sewers, and gives this board authority to issue bonds for transportation purposes, while the other bill permits the board to issue debentures.</p>
   <p>Alderman Toman and Alderman [Joseph] Kostner complained about the streetcar service on the 16th Street line. It was resolved to bring suit against the Company.</p>
   
   <p>The City Council Committee on Depots decided to begin negotiations with the Federal Government to avoid unnecessary delay in introducing before a subcommittee the subject of erecting railroad stations. Alderman Kostner complained that railroad stations are not being erected within the specified time.</p>
