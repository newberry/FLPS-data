   <p>Alderman Arthur Albert, candidate for mayor of the Deneen group of the Republican party, will make his program speech Friday. Jan. 2nd, 1931. Immediately after that, the Campaign will begin. Together with other candidates, among whom are Mayor William Hale Thompson, Charles <span class="gap">[gap]</span> Barrett, and Judge John A. Lyle, Albert will file his petition with the City Clerks' office as candidate for Mayor. For the office of City treasurer, the Deneen group nominated James <span class="gap">[gap]</span>earns</p>
   <p>In the opinion of Deneen, Albert will pull a great part of German-American votes, which consequently will be of decisive importance in regard to Mayor Thompson's position. The Irish votes will surely go to Barrett, and Thompson cannot rely on the votes of the colored people, either, therefore, the possibility remains that with the help of the other groups, Thompson's nomination will be prevented.</p>
