   <p>The disclosures of graft and corruption in the Civil Works Administration are hardly surprising. However, it is surprising, even dumbfounding, that the originator of the Civil Works Administration, President Roosevelt, and the leader of this government agency, Harry Hopkins, so frankly admit the existence of graft and corruption. This frankness is something new. Formerly, most scandals of this kind (which have existed in every are of American history) were carefully concealed, and became public and were officially admitted only when they could no longer remain concealed.</p>
   <p>People recall that the colossal vil swindle during the administration of Harding and Coolidge was revealed only after more or less clear hints of its existence had been made in the press and on the floor of Congress. One can easily understand that attempts were made in Washington to suppress the <span class="page-break">2</span>scandal when it developed that the two chief criminals, Sinclair and Doheny, had made large contributions to the Republican campaign:</p>
   <p>President Roosevelt knows no consideration in this respect. He spares neither his party nor himself, and that is the only pleasant feature of this awkward affair. The people at least know that grafters are being called to account, as far as this is possible. However, the President is in a precarious situation, inasmuch as he cannot suddenly abolish the Civil Works Administration. Such a procedure would create great hardships for many individuals and communities. At best, he can only choose between two evils, and very likely he will be obliged to decide to continue the enterprise, despite the danger that more millions in graft will be involved.</p>
   <p>He and his advisers could have foreseen this. The intentions and plans of the Administration were undoubtedly good and honest. However, he had to make use of local political organizations to carry out these plans, and it <span class="page-break">3</span>was inevitable that graft and corruption should have full sway under existing conditions. It is also inevitable that graft, corruption, and favoritism rule in local organizations. Even the best-governed cities are not exempt from it. That is a result of our political system.</p>
   <p>This system necessitates a host of professional politicians, and it is absolutely unavoidable that unscrupulous persons who play politics for what there is in it gain admission to their ranks. It has always been so, and it will always be so. The officials in Washington should have known that, and should either have prescribed a different method for distributing the fund of the Civil Works Administration, or have given up the idea as such.</p>
