   <p>Alderman Christian Meier, may well he proud of his re-election. Mr. Meier succeeded, despite Grottkau and his miserable newspaper, which declared that only those Socialists suffering from softening of the brain could vote in favor of Meier. This same paper so unlike the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, never said a word in favor of Meier's re-election. This gentleman owes his re-election In the first place to the anti-Grottkau Socialists who were responsible for his nomination. In the second place, he has had the support of all the right thinking non-Socialists, who also a reciate a man of his caliber in the city council.</p>
   <p>We have faith in him and know that he will prove himself worthy of his re-election to the city council.</p>
   <p>The citizens of the sixteenth ward.</p>
