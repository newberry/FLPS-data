   <p>The German-American La Follette Campaign Committee will hold its second meeting tonight at the Northside Turnhalle. As it was impossible to notify all German clubs promptly, these organizations could not elect delegates for the occasion, and therefore, the second meeting has been announced.</p>
   <p>More than sixty Club delegates belong to the Finance committee. The chairman of the National finance committee of the La Follette campaign, Hermann R. Ekern, Attorney-General of Wisconsin, will be present this evening to consider plans for a successful campaign.</p>
