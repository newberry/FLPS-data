   <p>The last meeting of delegates of the German-American Citizens' Bund contained so much unintentional humor that it would be unfair to withhold it from our people in these times which are so devoid of humor.</p>
   <p>At the chairman's table sat the president, a man of giant stature. There is something about his physical make-up that makes him appear as if molded of iron--and his determination seems as firm.</p>
   <p>According to the report of the last meeting, our beloved vice-president resigned before elections because, being a Republican, he could not approve of all endorsements made by the German-American Bund. This honorable attitude was acknowledged with loud and sincere applause. The same gentleman also happens to be the president of the German Day celebration. On the other hand, it was necessary to warn a director who, without consideration for the others, was <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>propagandizing against the candidate endorsed by the Bund, that according to the bylaws he would have to be "fired," unless he resigned of his free will. He did that, in the end, but not until after the election. He sent a letter written in longhand and in moving words, but it was received with silence. And now he compares his actions to those of the vice-president. The man has a sense of humor--hasn't he?</p>
   <p>We intend to mention no names here, and shall call him merely the "candidate," because he, not unlike the late William Jennings, is going to carry this title for quite some time.</p>
   <p>Today he was in a pinkish mood, and distributed propaganda leaflets along with the reprint of a letter from the newly elected Democratic Governor. In this letter he is praised for his protest against a Republican speaker who attacked the Governor for his religion. Undoubtedly a noble action which, as some might see it, deserves a little job. But less noble was the publication of a statement given before the elections that he, if seated in Congress, would break with his <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>adversaries.</p>
   <p>This is why he was so soulful and democratic today. He, together with other delegates, gave his support to the candidacy of a well-recommended Democrat for the position of director of education and registration; he suggested as postmaster the Democratic leader, Ernst Kruetgen, whom he had previously so bitterly attacked, and he regretted being a day too late with this suggestion, since it had been made three weeks ago by the German daily press. Finally he nominated the president of the Bund for the cabinet of his friend, the Democratic Governor; i.e., he mentioned his name for such a position. It is amazing how some politicians are always skillful in their adjustment to conditions and are forever seeking to curry favor with the victorious party.</p>
   <p>Later he announced that he had already opened his campaign for the elections two years hence. This provoked the "giant" at the chairman's table to ask innocently whether he would then run on the Democratic ticket. It brought an understanding smile to many a face.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>One gentleman attempted to sound off, but his remarks proved merely a dud. Being rather bellicose, he was getting considerable pleasure out of his own "original" joke about "a man with long hair and short brains....." but he got no further than that, because he was interrupted, being called "out of order". All the same, the incident was treated by the "candidate" as a good joke--an insult to the intelligence of the delegates, who find no delight in antiquated jokes. But there was real laughter when the "man with long hair" imparted the news to the no less hairy attacker that tomorrow he was going to have a hair cut, and that he hoped that his brains would then begin to grow and enable him to make such wonderfully intelligent speeches as the great sounder-off.</p>
   <p>The next topic concerned German Day, 1933. It was unanimously agreed that all affiliated organizations should participate in the celebration in large numbers. The "adjutant"--we intend to name no names and find no better appellation for the delegate--leaped to his feet and proposed the "candidate" as delegate for <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>German Day; but--oh misery--the president nominated two others!</p>
   <p>Then someone else sounded off. A delegate was boasting that he had been working against the endorsements of the Bund and would have been proud to speak over the radio at the request of the Republican National Committee with other friends of the "candidate" in behalf of Small. But he was dealing with the clever, eloquent, and faithful Ekkehart of the Bund, who with untiring devotion and the eyes of Argus watches over its principles. He received a rebuke such as he had never experienced before. To consent tacitly to an endorsement and then to combat it is dishonest. Had he declared his position from the beginning no one would have had any reason to reproach him.</p>
   <p>Then a satirically minded delegate took the floor for a long speech which was beautifully styled and interesting for context and which brought bitter accusations against those persons who sowed discontent, lack of discipline <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>and moral dissolution in the organization. This takes us back to the time when a certain candidate sought to further his personal interests through the medium of the Bund. He harmed the city organization, the state and national Bund.</p>
   <p>According to the candidate's adherents the result of the meeting is said to have been successful for him and his few cronies--and this is the joke of it.</p>
