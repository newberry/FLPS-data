   <p>The Legislature adjourned today, but it was not a rest period of ten days only as the Governor hoped. It is a predicament.</p>
   <p>He is confronted with the commands of his boss and master Lorimeb, who demands the nulification of the Mueller Municipal proposition by veto proceedings and, if he follows this mandate then he faces political suicide, so he went from Peter to Paul and finally, just as a drowning person will grab a piece of straw, he took recourse and consulted his most embittered political enemy, Attorney General H. J. Hamlin to give an opinion regarding the objections of Gus Nohe and lawyer Hamline. All told, six objections, but the Attorney general considered the Mueller law constitutional, in all its phases.</p>
