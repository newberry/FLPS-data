   <p>German fighters have won German victories, and German blows have shattered the Know-Nothing system into dust!</p>
   <p>Cook county has acted magnificently, and has achieved victory for the German cause, and made the election of Cleveland and Altgeld possible.... The election of Altgeld is definitely certain. His majority in Cook county alone will be almost 30,000 votes, and the reports coming in from the state are just as favorable.</p>
   <p>The German wards have done exceedingly well. We can not praise too highly the manly and concerted action of the Germans in defending liberty and equality. A similar recognition is deserved by all foreign-born voters, such as the Irish Poles, and Bohemians, who put up a united front against the Know-Nothings.... The Republicans have suffered such a terrible defeat in Cook county that it will be difficult for them to recover....</p>
