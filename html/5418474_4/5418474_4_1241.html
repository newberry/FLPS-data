   <p>The directors of the Chicago Bar Association have just published a report on their investigation of forced sales and bankruptcy sales, and the revelation will serve to rekindle public indignation over the theft of assets that is usually connected with these sales. Of course a majority of the public has known of this deplorable practice for some time, and the report contains no news In this respect. The only news contained in the report is the evidence that the Association claims to have gathered in the course of the investigation, and the announcement that the organization intends to take drastic measures against these thieves, without respect to person, unless they desist from their evil practices. The directors of the Bar Association, which has thoroughly investigated this dirty business for two years, openly charges that even several Judges are involved. People have suspected this, also, and it is <span class="page-break">2</span>regrettable that the Bar Association spared these jurists who were chosen to be guardians of the law, and did not immediately brand them by publishing their names. The citizens elect judges to administer justice, not to make the citizens the victims of political exploitation.</p>
   <p>The exploitation takes place when the judges have no time to devote to the details of each case because of the great number of bankruptcy and forced sales cases assigned to them, and appoint masters to do the investigating. As soon as the master in chancery has ascertained all the facts, he reports to the judge, who renders a verdict. Some judges are said to have appointed masters in chancery at the direction of politicians who intended thus to secure well-paying positions for certain members of their party. The report of the Bar Association lists a number of masters who received from eighteen to ninety-five thousand dollars in fees during the period from June to November, 1932. These fees, of course, are deducted from the proceeds of the forced sales or bankruptcy sales, before the parties bringing suit, that is, the creditors, receive anything. In many instances the fees are unduly large; and, in addition, <span class="page-break">3</span>some masters in chancery have dozens of cases in process at the same time. Large sums are realized in this manner, as is evident from the public lists.</p>
   <p>The directors of the Bar Association have threatened to institute impeachment proceedings against the judges who participated in this exploitation of the public, and have declared their intention of bringing disbarment proceedings against all lawyers who are guilty of misconduct, It is very desirable that the Bar Association carry out its threat, and thus rid the public of some of these profiteers, who think they are protected by obsolete laws. The Association intends to ask the Legislature to change the respective provisions of the law that governs the appointment and the fees of masters in chancery, by abolishing fees and prescribing a regular salary for masters.</p>
   <p>The proposed action of the Bar Association is commendable; but the organization should also take immediate steps to prosecute the Judges against whom they have evidence and the lawyers who have shown that they are not worthy of the honor and respect of the public. The judges themselves should insist that the <span class="page-break">4</span>Bar Association publish the names of their colleagues who have displayed so little firmness over and against politicians; otherwise all the judges who deal with such cases will be under suspicion.</p>
