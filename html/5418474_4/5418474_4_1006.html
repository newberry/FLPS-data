   <p>The democrats of Cook County intend to put up a list of candidates which probably will contain the following names: County Board, Michael Zimmer; County Treasurer, P. A. Nash; Sheriff, John E, Traeger, Jr: Clerk of Municipal Court, Joseph Gill; County Commissioners, Mrs.G. E. Plumb Oscar Mayer, Ernest Kruetgen, and Peter Augsten.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cermak, president of the County Board, so we have been informed, has invited Mr. Ernest Kruetgen to become a candidate for the office of County Commissioner. Mr. Kruetgen, however, declined this offer because he does not wish to hold a public office, according to our report.</p>
   <p>Mr. Oscar Mayer likewise refused to run as a candidate for the office of County Commissioner.</p>

   <p>Mr. Cermak admitted that the Democratic party of Cook County would like to have these two prominent representatives of the German-American citizens of Chicago as candidates on their ticket. As these two gentlemen have refused, the party must seek two other prospective candidates of the same caliber.</p>
   <p>The Rodenberg Candidacy</p>
   <p>A meeting of prominent German-Americans and the delegates of various societies was held yesterday at the Steuben building. Possibilities were discussed of inducing William A. Rodenberg, former Congressman of E St. Louis, I11., a pronounced "wet" and a German-American, to accept the candidacy for United States Senator on the Republican ticket. Rodenberg has not yet given a definite answer, nevertheless it was resolved at yesterday's meeting to establish a Rodenberg headquarters at the Steuben building.</p>
   <p>William Rodenberg who was Congressman of his district for twenty years, retired voluntarily in 1923.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>In case Rodenberg should accept the candidacy, four candidates will oppose each other on the Republican ticket: United States Senator Deneen, Congresswoman Hanna McCormick, Newton Jenkins, and Rodenberg.</p>
