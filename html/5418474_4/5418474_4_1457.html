   <p>During the last campaign the Illinois Staats-Zeitung constantly reminded the proponents of personal liberty that the lax enforcement of the saloon license ordinance gave the temperance people an excuse to justify their incessant attacks on freedom. We showed at the time how Mayor Harrison, regardless of his promises to help the Wirthsverein (Tavernkeepers' Association) in its efforts to place the saloon business on a higher level, injured the interests of the saloonkeepers instead by issuing licenses indiscriminately to owners of disreputable places.</p>
   <p>Even saloonkeepers who favored Harrison's re-election criticized severely the indifferent issuing of licenses, and the writer distinctly remembers a case in which a former president of the Wirthsverein called attention to the bond humbug <span class="page-break">\2</span>connected with the licenses and demanded in the interests of his association that the stipulations of the statute should be properly enforced.</p>
   <p>In his campaign speeches at the time Carter Harrison promised repeatedly to protect respectable tavernkeepers against the competition of the riffraff by strictly enforcing the law, and the majority of the people believed him.</p>
   <p>On July 1 all saloon licenses expired, and since that day the city treasurer and the city clerk have been busy issuing renewals.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Tribune published a lengthy article yesterday about the humbug involving licenses. The State law on licenses contains the following paragraph:</p>
   <p>"Provided that no license shall be issued for the sale of intoxicating beverages unless the applicant therefor first present a State bond of $3,000, vouched for by not less than two property owners whose land holdings are unencumbered, to the municipality or district issuing said license." (Paragraph one of the law of January 13, 1872.)</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>According to the above every applicant for a saloon license must furnish $3,000 bond, to be given by two property owners. The city ordinance on licenses has repeatedly delegated the issuance thereof to the mayor. Paragraph 499 of the revised city ordinance provides that "the mayor shall issue all licenses authorized by city ordinances," etc. Paragraph 1859 of the same ordinance states further:</p>
   <p>"The mayor of Chicago shall issue licenses for the sale of intoxicating beverages from time to time to such persons making a written request therefor, and they shall submit proof to the mayor that the applicants are persons of good reputation, and furthermore the applicants shall, in each individual case, give a bond of $500, attested by two bondsmen, and this security shall be investigated and accepted by the mayor upon proper finding," etc.</p>
   <p>Paragraphs 1565 and 1566 of the same ordinance provide:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"All licenses shall be issued by the mayor from time to time to such persons whom he considers qualified, and who are residents of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Every license authorized by city ordinance shall, after being granted by the mayor, be issued by the city clerk as soon as the city treasurer informs the city clerk that the fees have been paid, and only then shall the respective license be issued."</p>
   <p>From all these stipulations it is plainly evident that it is the Mayor's duty to know who receives the licenses, and it is exclusively his obligation to investigate all bonds offered by tavernkeepers.</p>
   <p>But nevertheless the Mayor lets the matter rest with the city treasurer and the city clerk and does not care in the least whether the proper precautions prescribed by law are heeded or not. Consequently in many instances the bonds are absolutely worthless and meaningless.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>As the Tribune reported yesterday, applicants for saloon licenses see so-called notaries, and Mr. Rummel, to whom City Clerk Howard intrusts the filling out of saloon licenses, provides the necessary bonds, duly made out and supposedly signed by bona fide bondsmen, for the sum of one dollar, and everything is shipshape. Although no one but the Mayor shall approve of the bonds offered for saloon licenses, he never sees the so-called bonds, and the whole license affair amounts to this: Any one can obtain a license if he has $52 to pay the tax and $1 for the bond, regardless of how unsuitable the applicant may be to conduct a business of so public a character, or how shady his reputation may be. The object of having bondsmen was to have assurances that the applicant would abide by the law and to provide protection for those who were injured by a saloonkeeper's disregard of existing ordinances. Both purposes are defeated by these ready-made bonds at the city clerk's office, since the signers can never be found.</p>
   <p>It is obvious that no one suffers more by this utter disregard of the law than the conscientious German saloonkeeper. He spends time and uses honest efforts in obtaining the required bond and can pass an examination at any time about <span class="page-break">\6</span>matters appertaining to his reputation or on any other questions which the Mayor may consider expedient under the circumstances. Nevertheless the lawabiding tavernkeeper loses the protection to which he is entitled because others, who cannot procure bona fide bondsmen, become competitors and tend to bring all saloons into disrepute.</p>
   <p>If Mayor Harrison would not waste so much time at picnics and would attend to his duties, in so far as saloonkeepers and licenses are concerned, then no one would be more grateful than the respectable German tavernkeepers and the proponents of personal liberty, who regard an impartial application of the license law as the greatest defense against the dubious schemes of the prohibitionists.</p>
