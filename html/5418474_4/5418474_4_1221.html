   <p>Repeatedly Republican campaign speakers and party papers have bitterly complained that the present administration is buying votes on a large scale. They argue that the Administration supports the unemployed and their families, as well as other needy persons, in order to obtain their votes in the coming election. It is also asserted that the Democratic Administration had the same purpose when it pushed through large appropriations for other measures.</p>
   <p>One might reply to these assertions with the question: "What is the Government to do with the needy? Should it simply let them starve?" This would naturally not be feasible. On the other hand, the support of the unemployed is not the affair of the Federal Government. According to our whole political philosophy, practice, and tradition, this matter should be left entirely to the local authorities. But, in the last analysis, this is worthless theorizing, for it is well known that neither the local nor, in many cases, the state administrations, <span class="page-break">2</span>are in a position to do this. Therefore, the Great White Father has to help out if the unemployed are not to perish.</p>
   <p>Whether the allotment of relief money influences the recipients to vote for the party which is in power at that time, is a question which cannot be answered without further consideration. No evidence on the subject is available, and one would have just as much reason to answer the question in the negative as in the affirmative. But even if the answer had to be an unqualified yes, it still would not affect the situation very much. It would still remain true that the Administration could not let these people starve.</p>
   <p>In an address over the radio John D. M. Hamilton, member of the Republican National Committee for Kansas, made particularly serious charges of this sort against the present Administration. He declares that the Democratic party has no monopoly upon the alleviation of human misery, because the last Republican Administration set aside three hundred million dollars for this purpose. The man from Kansas has obviously not thought the matter over very well, or he would have perceived that, at that time, one could have accused the Republican <span class="page-break">3</span>Administration of using the taxpayers' money to buy votes exactly as he now accuses the Democratic party. Hamilton also asserted that the Administration is building a huge political machine from the employees of the Relief organization, and for this reason is wasting the money which is at its disposal. That the management and distribution of this money leaves much to be desired must be freely admitted. This situation is completely unavoidable in a country where no organization for this purpose existed previously. But when the politician from the model state of Kansas declares that the present Administration is making fraudulent use of the money, spending it for party politics, he is making a strong statement, for which he still lacks proof.</p>
   <p>In this connection, it should never be forgotten that the buying of votes in this country for political purposes has been carried on openly for many years. The president of Veterans of Foreign Wars, in a public speech in Baltimore, told how he and his comrades put the thumbscrew on the members of Congress, and forced them to vote for the bonus bill. They threatened to start a sharp campaign, in his district, against every Representative who failed to vote for <span class="page-break">4</span>the bill.</p>
   <p>For this reason the overwhelming majority of the members voted for the bill, against their better judgment. They knew that their political future was at stake and, in order to assure themselves the favor of the veterans, they voted for a bill which would have cost the taxpayers two billion dollars if it had become a law. That was buying votes in the greatest measure conceivable. Giving support to bills for reasons like this has repeatedly occurred, and it is unavoidable in our system of parliamentary government. The Republican speakers show a startling lack of logic in fighting passionately for retention of a system one of the features of which is the legalized buying of votes.</p>
