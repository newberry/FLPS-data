   <p>The English newspapers of this City' have been fooled lately with long reports about a "movement" that is to be introduced by the Germans of Chicago in behalf of the abolition of the Juul-Law. As its driving force and commissioned leader is a Mr. Leopold Saltiel, an almost unknown lawyer.</p>
   <p>With refreshing boldness, Mr. Saltiel, himself, dares to speak in the name of...exactly...500,000 Germans who all shall have selected him as their chosen leader in the coming judicial battle...</p>
   <p>In fact nobody has the right to state that the Germans of Chicago have a hostile attitide against the mentioned Tax Regulation Law...</p>
