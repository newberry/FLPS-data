   <p>Illinois' next governor, John P. Altgeld, started his second campaign tour this evening, (Spetember 13,) at Joliet, Illinois... His speech, of nearly two hours' duration, gave a complete picture of the important state and national questions. His address was a masterpiece and reaffirmed the assertions he made on Labor Day in Elgin and during his acceptance speech at the Springfield nomination; it only proves that Altgeld is not only a past master in the art of organization but also one of the state's greatest stump-speakers, although, in the ordinary sense of the word, it would be a misnomer to use such a term.</p>
   <p>The hackneyed phrases in raucous tones, the campaign blabbering which degenerates into libel in its personal attacks, that saccharine flattery for the voter, with its hollow quotations, that inane party talk where the speaker reverts to the revolutionary days and assuredly to the transpired events of 30 years ago, - we did not perceive much of that. It is one of Altgeld's distinctions, when compared with Fifer, his adversary.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>While the latter's speeches betray him as the true politician in all his superficiality, who flits from one subject to another without pursuing any problem long enough to be convincing, Altgeld proves himself to be the very antithesis; he treats each problem with such fundamental thoroughness, that we exclaim with pride: "True German judgment," and with still greater satisfaction we add, "with genuine German courage."</p>
   <p>His elucidation of the present perplexing situation proves him to be a thinker, a man who has listened, seen and perceived what his people require. Altgeld's success at Joliet was so encompassing, because he opened new horizons and definitely proved wherein the Republicans failed during the recent years, so that the multitude assembled before the court house felt that Altgeld is a man to whom the state's leadership may safely be entrusted. A parade with music and torches preceded his appearance on the ourt house steps.</p>
   <p>The Republicans have spoken for a long time, with considerable contempt, about that "orator Altgeld" who is proficient only in shaking hands. They will be <span class="page-break">3</span>convinced now, after having seen a sample of the batteries this "Dutchman" (verbatim) commands.</p>
   <p>Altgeld immediately touched the main theme of his subject, the questions which are specifically concerned with matters appertaining to the state. He showed how the great institutions built with the money of the citizens, insane asylums, penitentiaries, homes for the blind, the deaf and dumb, etc., had to become subservient to political ambitions.</p>
   <p>In order to give backing and support to the present governor, these establishments were changed into a political bulwark in the most disgraceful manner. Thus the very capable superintendent of the reformatory at Pontiac was discharged because he refused to work in behalf of the Governor' s political interests; the same procedures were repeated at the insane asylum at Anna. The Joliet penitentiary, one of the largest institutions of its kind, became the pawn of a politician who was absolutely not conversant with the administration of such an important post, but was well versed as a machine politician.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The citizens of will County have become the pray of a small, political alliance which rules as it chooses, the "Bloomington Ring"..... These officials show little interest in their assignments, most of their time being spent in political activities, even in distant counties. This ring now controls the entire state machinery; railroad and warehouse commissioners, and their subservients, the jail commission, canal commission, grain inspectors, etc., with the entire army of their underlings, are working for Fifer's re-election.</p>
   <p>All these state offices during the last quarter century of Republican management, have become havens of refuge for political beggars and human flotsam.</p>
   <p>The so-called convict labor became one of the turbulent questions of issue in most of the Northern states. Prisoners work in direct competition with free labor, at 40 to 60 cents per day. Inmates of prisons were organized by outside contractors, with state officials and politicians participating. This convict union proved a real threat to American Labor but a boom for a profitable racket. A society within a society is being exploited, with decent <span class="page-break">5</span>citizens left so foot the bill both ways.</p>
   <p>Many Northern states therefore prohibited the hiring of convict labor in competition with free workers. Illinois even went further: In the year 1886 it adopted an amendment to the constitution, which prohibits contract prison labor. But the convict-labor booty clique circumvented the law in every conceivable manner and this as readily accomplished with the acquiescence of the commissioners and the secret consent of the Governor.</p>
   <p>Although six years have elapsed since these amendments were passed, convict labor still flourishes and competes with free producers, as heretofore... The commissioners simply gave the products to the contractors at the official "piece-price rate," which, even if it are applied honestly, is nevertheless an infraction of the law. As a matter of fact, the old system remains, unchanged; the modus operandi is not only a direct violation, but a deliberate fraud.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>Some traders, the coopers for instance, have been absolutely ruined by this cut throat rivalry. Barrels, which free workingmen cannot produce for less than 25 cents each, are delivered to the contractor for 5 cents by the prison authorities. The latter therefore, is fully able to underbid outsiders and still pocket a stupendous profit. More than a thousand Chicago coopers earned $3.00 per day; now they work on the road for $1.50, while many cooperage firms went into bankruptcy.</p>
   <p>But the prison contractors acquire fortunes. An investigation made the startling discovery, that the commissioners leased the powerfully built prisoners to a Mr. Winterbottom for 571/2 cents per day. This man also took care of the current expenses, such as: all taxes, insurance, etc., provided the complete equipment, including buildings and warehouse facilities, so that he could store several hundred thousand barrels for a year, without any outlay whatever. This contractor is now able to employ 100 convicts, after the commissioners installed new machinery for him, to the time of $25,000.</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>He has now an output of 1,100 to 1,200 barrels per day, costing exactly five cents each. In Michigan City, Ind., he produces another 200 barrels daily, with prison labor of course, and so he rules the market which also enables him to get cut rates for raw Material.</p>
   <p>Thus the commissioners built up a monopoly at state expense and ruined free labor. The convicts could have been employed in the quarries, which are adjacent to the prison; it would have provided paving stones. The question of good roads is highly important to the farmer and it is about time that the state do something about it.</p>
   <p>It would have been Governor Fifer's duty to dismiss the commissioners who deliberately flaunted the law; but he is deaf to such recommendations and the appeals of the bankrupted Chicago citizenry. The ring just dominates the trade and no maybe! The administration of the prison is only additional proof, that the state impoverishes the multitude in order to enrich a few....</p>

   <p>During the last few years several secret "Know-nothing" clans have been organized, such as the United Order of Deputies, the Patriotic Sons of America, etc. All are of the same calibre and differ only in trivialities but all are unanimous in their hatred towards the foreign born, which they justify with their shout "America for Americans, that's our motto!" etc.... They disregard the development of those states entirely which have progressed solely on account of ambitious immigrants.... Maine, and some southern states, entirely inhabited by traditional Americans are still a hundred years behind the times, in spite of pure American stock....</p>
   <p>Those who defended our flag in bygone years - nearly half of them were foreign-born or had European parents. These "Know-nothing" orders have no consideration for the sacrifices of our fellow citizens who fought for the land of their adoption. They prostitute the sacred word patriotism by using it in such an unholy cause and if their nefarious work succeeds, then the seeds of class hate, <span class="page-break">9</span>dissension, religious intolerance, and national disintegration will germinate.</p>
   <p>These organizations are the battalions of today's Republican party; they favor the continuation of the Edwards law, as proven by the manifesto of the Patriotic Sons of America, Washington Camp #16, April 19th, and later endorsed by the Illinois State Camp....</p>
   <p>The Tariff was also minutely analyzed by the speaker. He showed that a high protective duty enriches the few, to the detriment of many; that experience in England has shown that the abolition of import taxes increase wages considerably, that foreign commerce showed a tremendous upward trend, that it created many new industries, etc. The high tariff protects only the wealthy class, also the employer; workers and consumers just hold the bag...</p>
   <p>The Walker Tariff of 1846, the last free trade year in the United States resulted in splendid development for our nation, as Secretary Blaine proved <span class="page-break">10</span>in his work, "Twenty Years in Congress".... Fundamentally, the "High Duty" theory is a protection for American labor; but during the last 20 years, hundreds of thousands of pauper-workers were brought in who work for one half of the salary, which Americans consider a living wage.</p>
   <p>Where labor organizations could not enforce higher rewards, salaries were simply reduced. During the McKinley tariff wall, 473 of the largest protectionist establishments cut wages within two months. The most sanguinary strikes, etc., flared up in the Homestead Works, their owner Carnegie pocketed $50,000, since the government actually enabled him to tax the entire American people.</p>
   <p>Now the Tariff affects incomes of the workers is best shown by quoting facts from the clothing industry: while the importation of cheap clothing is well nigh impossible, we find men, women, and children working in sweatshops for starvation wages. A Chicago investigation unearthed these facts. The laborer <span class="page-break">11</span>has to pay twice as much since there is no competition, while his pay has become an abominable pittance.</p>
   <p>When sugar was put on the "free list," the price dropped from 8 to 5 cents. The Tariff does not increase the price of commodities, since everywhere new inventions tend to cheapen production costs, but duty prevents workers and farmers from enjoying and profiting by the newly invented improvements, thus they pay more than before.... The public would save the millions which it now pays to duty-protected monopolies.....</p>
