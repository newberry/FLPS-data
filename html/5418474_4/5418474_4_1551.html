   <p>No news has come from the whiskey war. The excitement caused by last Friday's events is beginning to fade. The calm of Mr. Hesing, Rehm, and Miller leads people to believe that these gentlemen will be able to refute all the accusations made against them at the proper time and place. Of course this event gave plenty of writing material for a press eager for scandals. How facts were distorted, can be seen in the ridiculous reports concerning Hesing's arrest.</p>
   <p>We read of how he was sitting at his desk in his private office, how the sheriff read a law paragraph to him, and how Hesing became deathly pale, etc., etc. As a matter of fact, Mr. Hesing was just in the business office, talking with the secretary of the Staats Zeitung, Mr. Pietschand Mr. Raster concerning a business proposition. When the sheriff entered, he motioned Mr. Hesing towards the window and whispered a few words to him. Thereupon Hesing told Raster that he had to go to Hoyne's office and asked him to accompany him. Both then left, followed by the sheriff. At Mr. Hoyne's office Mr. Hesing signed a bond and returned to his office.</p>
   <p>The arrest of Mr. J. Rehm is also mere fiction. He was not arrested at all.</p>

   <p>When he heard at the Staats Zeitung that the same fate was awaiting him, he went at once to Hoyne's office, accompanied by A. Loeb, who served as his bondsman.</p>
