   <p>The City Council finally has decided to levy on tavern-and saloon-keepers a uniform tax of five hundred ($500) dollars on beer, wine and liquors, to be paid in three installments-May 1, $125, August 1, $166.67, and December 1,$208.33.</p>
   <p>The 3,300 tavern-keepers of Chicago will welcome the new ordinance, which not only reduced the original tax of $650, but also by the installment payments is harmonizing with the current expenses of the saloon business.</p>
