   <p>The City Council will meet tonight in an extraordinary session to continue the debate on the fire limit ordinance. The first paragraph of it was passed Wednesday night, but will certainly never be accepted in this form. The citizens of the 7th, 8th, and 9th Wards of the West Side, and of the 18th, and 20th Wards on the North Side, are not satisfied.</p>
   <p>REPORT ON THE SESSION OF THE CITY COUNCIL ON JANUARY 17.</p>
   <p>In the session of the City Council last Wednesday, the American aldermen saw themselves forced to present to the Germans and Irish a fire limit ordinance that excludes a very large part of the North and West Side. At the final voting 33 aldermen were present, of whom 17 voted for, 16 against Batcham's 31. Among the 17 were 15 Americans and 2 Irishmen; the 16 on the other hand consist of Germans and Irish and only one American. If all aldermen had been present, Batheham's amendment would have been defeated, and a paragraph move forable to the people would have been adopted.</p>
