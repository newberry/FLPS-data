   <p>Ten days ago Washington Hesing stood upon the platform in the Central Hall of Music, explaining his program; he solemnly promised to carry it out. At that time he solicited the votes of the Democrats, knowing what power the professional politicians have in conventions. Although he was a candidate at that time, he had the courage to raise his voice against the "gang," and against its corrupt methods and practises.</p>
   <p>Eight days ago, W. Hesing stood again on the same platform during the Democratic convention here. Hesing voluntarily renounced his candidacy before the convention. He then declared war against the "gang," challenging the ring leaders frankly and openly...</p>
   <p>For the third time Hesing stood upon the same platform within two weeks. Although the weather was unfavorable, a large crowd had gathered in the Central Hall of Music to hear him.... The speaker attacked the ring leaders and exposed their methods fearlessly, regardless of political consequences.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>"Ten days ago I spoke in this hall on certain subjects of interest to the public then, and still of interest now.I had an opportunity to express my opinions of certain problems, of real importance at the coming mayoral election. Frankly and openly I advocated reform of the local administration, and expressed my viewpoint on how to remedy existing evils... I have been repeatedly informed that the people were on my side, and this is the reason I speak here today.</p>
   <p>"About a week ago, the people of the city expected a candidate for mayor who was worthy of the confidence and respect of the people, and who could be trusted with reform measures. A convention was held in this hall; and what a convention it was! ... You know what happened. The whole country expressed its disappointment and regrets.</p>
   <p>"Persons I never knew before, came to me daily, expressing their indignation. The press also, the Democratic as well as the Republican, condemned the methods used which preceded the nomination.</p>
   <p>"I am not here today because somebody else was nominated. Being aware of the <span class="page-break">3</span>great responsibilities of the office, and what the people expect of the next mayor, it rather has been a relief for me that this great sacrifice has not been requested of me. Besides, I am quite certain that nobody can be elected upon whom the stigma of that convention remains.</p>
   <p>"Do not believe that I wish to complain about it for personal reasons; not at all. I am simply one of the thousands who rebel against the actions of the so-called Democratic convention of February 28th. I stand here, not as a disappointed job hunter, but as an honest and sincere citizen, who has the courage to express his conviction in public.</p>
   <p>"I am willing to risk everything if it helps to clean up the city, and to obtain a decent administration. I repeat what I said ten days ago, and I shall keep on repeating it until something is done, irrespective of who is mayor.</p>
   <p>"My intention tonight is to explain to you the political situation, and to give you a few facts which perhaps are not known to you. Then I shall leave it up to you to decide if you are willing to tolerate such conduct merely because you call yourselves Democrats, and voted for Cleveland last fall..."</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>The speaker continued: "The question now is, will you as citizens fold your hands and by your indelence aid this man to become the next mayor? The situation is very critical. You all know that the present administration is a deplorable failure. City Hall is overrun by thieves and idlers, and is controlled by the most contemptible and unscrupulous elements.</p>
   <p>"This same gang, the same combination of aldermen, the same group of contractors who now control City Hall, know no party, but are solely interected in spoils and plunder. They work with all their might for the election of C. Harrison in order to promote their own selfish interests. As the Germans have been reviled in an unheard of manner, and, as law-abiding citizens have been insulted as never before since the bloody days of the Seventh Ward, I appeal to them in particular.</p>
   <p>"Let them defend their honor, exercise their independence, and prove that they are true citizens of Chicago and of the Republic - citizens who can put aside party politics and personal prejudices and who will do everything in their power to defeat this dangerous setup.</p>
   <p>"Germans, your nationality has been vilified, your honesty has been attacked, <span class="page-break">5</span>and your intentions have been defamed. I appeal to you, Germans, to whom personal freedom is something sacred, as long as it does not conflict with the institutions of this country, nor disturb public peace, nor encroach upon the liberty of others.</p>
   <p>"If the various nationalities represented by our population are taken into consideration, then this country is cosmopolitan in its character. One thing, however, must be conceded to the Germans; namely, the sane impulse to mind their own affairs and not to interfere with the customs and habits of other people.</p>
   <p>"The Germans are an industrious, thrifty, and economical people. They do not indulge in great excesses and debaucheries, which lead to national bankruptcy; nor do they contaminate society, nor undermine the foundation of the state. The Germans are grateful for the individual liberty this country offers them, and though they adhere to customs of their motherland and are devoted to the same, yet their patriotism is not inferior to that of any American and they will gladly defend their adopted fatherland at any time.</p>
   <p>"One fourth of the total number of votes is in your hands, Germans. Your ballots gave Grover Cleveland a majority of 33,000 votes in this city. If <span class="page-break">6</span>you think of him as the standard bearer of an honest and efficient administration in national affairs, then you certainly can not recognize C. Harrison as the representative of your local administration, or support him in this mayoral election battle.</p>
   <p>"You must organize yourselves and act in concert, as you did last fall, if you wish to be fair to yourselves and manifest your disapproval of political despotism. Think what you were able to do in 1873, in 1890, and in 1892! Now we have another, and just as important issue before us, and we must act as a unit.</p>
   <p>"The whole civilized world looks toward Chicago. Exhibitors as well as visitors are on their way to participate in the largest exhibit of products of human ingenuity and progress, which the world has ever seen. Many of your countrymen will come to Chicago, to whom you wish to show a clean, honest and well-governed city, and whose mayor you wish to present as a respectable, capable man, and not as a political henchman.</p>
   <p>"How can you afford not to do all in your power to bring about Harrison's defeat, and to expose as a lie his boasting assertions, that all Germans are on his side!...</p>
   <span class="page-break">7</span>
   <p>"However, I still have confidence in the public-spirited men of our city, in their courage, their personal pride, and their self-respect. I am convinced that our mutual and united efforts will effect the defeat of the man whose election would be a disgrace to our city.</p>
   <p>"Although Chicago gave G. Cleveland a majority of 33,000 votes last fall, we must not conclude that therefore every Democratic candidate will be elected. The situation last fall was exceedingly favorable to the Democrats. Mistakes were carefully avoided. But the Republicans, on the contrary, made many of them. The campaign united the different factions of the Democrats, and many of the opposing party joined their ranks.</p>
   <p>"At least 15,000 of the 33,000 majority votes were from Germans, who were not Democrats, but simply aided the Democrats, because their platform was agreeable to them. These 15,000 Germans are law-abiding and liberty-loving people. They never voted for Harrison during his four terms, nor will they do it now.</p>
   <p>"Fellow-citizens, let us dig a political grave for Carter Harrison, and remove him and his gang forever! Take a lively interest in the mass-meetings, which will be called soon, and support the man who will be nominated, provided, of course, he is the right one. Elect a man who will be an honor to the city, <span class="page-break">8</span>and who will carry out the necessary reforms. It must be a man who will keep the Columbian Exposition open on Sundays and who will be in favor of paying back to the government the two and one-half million dollars which it loaned to us.</p>
   <p>"It must be a man who will see to it that neither the people of this city, nor the visitors from all parts of the world are denied the right to visit the World's Fair on Sundays, nor to enjoy certain forms of recreation on that day.</p>
   <p>"With such a man you will be safe, and he will be an honor to you and your city."</p>
