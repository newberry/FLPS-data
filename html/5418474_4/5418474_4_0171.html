   <p>The Milwaukee paper, Germania, printed the following editorial paragraph: "It would perhaps be much wiser of Mr. David S. Rose, not to bring the Chicago Marcher's Club to Milwaukee. Any clear thinking person can reason it out for himself, that when a candidate resorts to calling in advisors from other cities, he can not have any confidence in the voters. And there is another thing which has to be borne in mind, that Chicago has a reputation of being a most miserably managed city, a fact known the world over. What a farce it would be, to have the mayor of that ill-managed city, with his co-workers and body guard, tell us how to manage our public affairs."</p>

   <p>As a matter of fact, Chicago is a very badly managed city. What right do our "tax-eaters" have, to show another city government, how to run its affairs. It is quite a mystery to us, how the gentlemen from the Democratic Marcher's Club, procure money and time, to be everlastingly on the traveler's list. They have taken trips to New York and Kentucky and, only recently have returned from New Orleans, the city at which the carnival was held. Now these gentlemen contemplate a trip to Milwaukee to pay a visit to Mr. Rose, the Democratic mayor of that city, who proved himself a warm friend of the surface lines companies. Who are these gentlemen? No men, engaged in any other line of business, can afford to take more than one week's vacation annually, and even then not many of us are fortunate enough to take a short pleasure trip during that time. But these gentlemen of the Marcher's Club of Cook County, are well able to take several trips during the year, always equipped with new top hats, Prince Albert suits, white gloves and highly polished boots. They travel <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>in special trains, which also carry musicians, to be at hand for the amusement of these gentlemen. They are also in the habit of throw away money as fast as they possibly can.</p>
   <p>Who are these gentlemen? How do they make their living? Who supplies them with the money? They all live, with hardly any exceptions, on the taxpayers money. They are professional politicians, "workers" in the vineyard of the party. They are tale bearers, these close-mouthed "walking delegates" of the Democratic Party, for which they do the dirty work. Every one of this clique, is opposed to civil service reform. Each one is an admirer of Tammany in New York, and each one is an advocate of the plunder policy. They are well clothed and not in want of anything, because the citizens supply them with all their comfort. But is there anything clean about them? Hardly so, except perhaps the white shirts and the white gloves they wear.</p>
