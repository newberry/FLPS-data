   <p>The Conference of German-Lutheran Pastors, which was held here last week, wisely refused to voice a resolution against the so-called flag-law. Of course, the Conference instructed the Pastors to fight the said law as un-American and not constitutional - but without making the opposition a political issue.</p>
   <p>As we all know, the flag-law is forcing all public and private schools, to raise an American flag at the school-building from 9 AM to 5 P.M. With the same right, the legislature might expect, every citizen to hang permanently a flag out the window or wear continuously a flag-ribbon in the button-hole.</p>
   <p>The "Patriotic Sons of America", which is an organization of loud-mouthed Hurrah-patriots and has the sponsoring protection of some Republican newspapers, are attacking viciously the opposition mentioned and even suspect the German elements of our population as un-American and not patriotic.</p>
   <p>We believe, that a flag or any piece of cloth, is not alone the symbol of ones Patriotism, which has to be taught its meaning, to the children inside of the schoolhouse.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The flag itself is an external manifestation of one Patriotism at certain occasions at the right time. The constant swinging of flags and hurrah-yelling always has been used by evil-minded political agitators to mislead and divert public opinion from larger political problems.</p>
   <p>The flag-patriots are the mouth-patriots. The real patriots in honesty and trust, live up to the laws of the constitution. Patriotism as an ideal is inspired by the many duties and obligations of one family - life and community-life.</p>
   <p>Only this way, by doing right and respecting the laws from a broad-minded standpoint, have we been proud and patriotic citizens of this country.</p>
