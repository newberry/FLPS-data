   <p>Sedan! The election is over and the enemy is beaten. His strongest fortifications have fallen into our hands. The people's party has won. It is still impossible for the moment to say how great our victory is. All our friends have stood by us; the Irish in the entire city; the Bohemians in the 8th ward; the Scandinavians in the 11th and 16th wards; the French and the Poles in the 7th and 9th wards.</p>
   <p>The campaign committee of the People's Party, rented in the afternoon, when victory was certain, the lower hall in the Kingsbury Block. By 7 P. M. an immense crowd had assembled there, A description of the jubilation is impossible. At 8:30 o'clock A. C. Hesing went to the meeting. He received a thunderous reception. In his speech A. C. Hesing told the audience that the following telegram had been sent to Mayor Medill:</p>
   <p>Joseph Medill,</p>
   <p>Fer address of the American Embassy,</p>
   <p>Paris.</p>
   
   <p>"Your policy has been defeated by ten thousand majority."</p>
   <p>Rehm and Hesing.</p>
