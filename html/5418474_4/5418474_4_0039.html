   <p>At last one of the "liberal" German papers in Illinois has found the courage to strongly endorse our candidate for the next gubernatorial election. It is the Illinois Freie Presse in Springfield.</p>
   <p>Those German "liberals" who are not bound to the temperance-man, Palmer, should follow the example of the old, splendid, Fritz Hecker, who calls Korner in his latest letter to the Illinois Staats Zeitung, the "strongest and best candidate," an "honest, incorruptible man" and an "able jurist and statesman." We only add that, Korner is a dependable opponent of the Temperance Law.</p>
