   <p>First speaker at the Republican mass-meeting last night was Washington Hesing. In his opinion the election battle so close at hand is a fight between honesty and shameless swindle. He spoke of the importance of the election, and the absolute necessity to burst the now existing county-ring. The Democrats have nominated a Scandinavian for one of the most important offices of the county, but soon removed his name from the ticket. The Republicans did not to such a thing, but it is certain, that if they had done so, they would not have regretted the step.</p>
   <p>General Lieb aspires again for the County Clerk's office. Why not, as long as the taxpayers money pays for his campaign. If he were asked to give an account of the money in his care, many a thing would undoubtedly be aired, which he would prefer not to expose to the sunlight. Mr. Hesing warned especially the young people, not to be caught by General Lieb's schemes--but vote the Republican ticket.</p>
