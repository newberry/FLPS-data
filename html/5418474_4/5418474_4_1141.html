   <p>Allow an old citizen to say a few words in regard to the impending election. The Staats-Zeitung always advocates equal representation of Germans in public offices. Why does it not insist that a German should become mayor? We have a few Germans who could fill the office very well. Why is Mr. Louis Wahl not nominated? He has been a resident of Chicago for 25 years and has not only proven that he can manage an immense business very well but also that he is able to handle public affairs. Having been a member of the building commission for two years he has acquired an intimate knowledge of city affairs. He is liked and respected by the Americans as well as by the Germans. It is true that Mr. Wahl is not a candidate, but we know that should he be nominated, he would accept and as a good citizen he would have no right to refuse. Should neither of the two parties have the majority at the convention, or should the animosity between the two be too great, they should compromise on Louis Wahl.</p>
