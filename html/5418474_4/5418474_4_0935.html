   <p>The members of the Democratic State Central committee assembled yesterday in the club room of the Sherman house. Mr. Cyrus H. McCormick opened the meeting.</p>
   <p>The committee drew up an appeal to the Democrats, Liberals, and all the other adversaries of the Democratic Party. The appeal advocates the return to gold and silver as basis of the money circulation, free trade, personal liberty and opposition against the sumptuary laws. Mr. A. C. Hesing wanted to know by whom the appeal would be signed. The chairman replied that it would be signed by the members of the Democratic Central committee and then by the citizens. A. C. Hesing wanted to drop the name "Democracy". He has no objection against the name if it helps to secure victory but many people up north, he said, do not like this name. He reminded of the Republican Party which for two years fought in different states under different names. After having been voted upon the motion of A. C. Hesing was accepted.</p>
