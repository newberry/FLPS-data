   <p>All local Germans will be gratified to hear that Mr. Edmund Jussen has been appointed Federal Revenue Collector for the First District of Illinois; for it would have been difficult to find a more capable and worthy German representative for this important office. Mr. Jussen is a well-educated man and is highly respected by all who know him. A gentleman in the full sense of the word, his political attitude, too, has been weighed and not found wanting. During his long residence in Chicago he acquired all the technical and commercial knowledge necessary to perform the duties of his new office, and his work will be a credit to the friends who sponsored his appointment.</p>
   <p>Originally Mr. Jussen sought a European consulate in the hope of recovering his health which had been impaired by his strenuous activity during the War.</p>
   <p>While on the way to Washington, he took sick in New York, and he was in that city when Mr. Jacob Rehm, the only other German aspirant to the office of Revenue Collector, voluntarily withdrew his application. Some close friends of Mr. Jussen then decided to persuade him to apply for the appointment, and so notified him by telegraph. When they received his consent, Mr. Judd took charge of the matter with the zeal which he is wont to display when acting in behalf of his German friends. He and some German Republicans of Chicago succeeded in persuading the President to disregard his (the President's) brother's business partner and appoint Mr. Jussen.</p>
   <p>The fact that Mr. Jussen is related to Carl Schurz caused some of the latter's jealous opponents to accuse him of nepotism. However, we can assure them that Mr. Schurz is not guilty of any underhanded act. Just because he is related to Mr. Jussen, and any intervention on his part in behalf of Mr. Jussen would be ascribed to motives other than a desire to promote public interest, he refrained from using his influence in the matter. In fact, he had absolutely nothing to do with the appointment. Mr. Jussen owes his appointment solely to his position among his fellow citizens and political associates in Chicago who succeeded in convincing the President that he could chose no better man for the work. As to the claims of Mr. Schurz' political friends in Missouri--that he should use his influence in their behalf--they may rest assured that none of that influence was exercised for the benefit of Chicago.</p>
