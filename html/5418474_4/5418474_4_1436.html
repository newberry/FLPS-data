   <p>In spite of dangerously rotten conditions of our public safety the Republican political machinery is still trying to render our police force worse by giving jobs and promoting its own creatures.</p>
   <p>We are informed that Captain Simon O'Donnel from the 12th Street station, who, better than any other captain kept his district clean of robbers and burglars, is being put on the pension list, not because he is too old or weak but because he gave preference to his job as Police Captain to that as political bulldoger.</p>
