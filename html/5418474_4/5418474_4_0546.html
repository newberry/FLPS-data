   <p>Just as important as the day of election is October 18, the first day to register. No one can vote on Election Day without being registered. No one can vote without being registered, whether born here, or immigrated, or in the same precinct for decades. The law demands an entire new registration for Chicago and the town of Cicero. October 18th is the day to register. The opponents make enormous efforts to gather their forces at the places of registration, knowing that the election battle in Chicago will be won or lost on the day of registration. Do likewise! Register today!</p>
