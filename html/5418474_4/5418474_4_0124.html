   <p>A German-American organization sponsoring the candidacy of Robert M. Sweitzer for the office of Mayor, was founded last night in the Sherman Hotel. Significant indication of a change of sentiment on the part of the Chicago German element is the fact that among the founders of the new organization are a number of prominent Germans who four years ago were pulling strongly for Carter H. Harrison, helping him to get the nomination and later on to win the election. Among these men are Mr. Charles H. Kellermann, president of the new organization; Mr. Henry W. Huttmann, first vice-president, and former member of the Board of Education; Mr. William Rothmann, present member of the Board of Education, and Alderman John H. Bauler of the Twenty-second Ward.</p>
   <p>The new organization intends to establish branch associations in all the wards of the city. It is also planned to establish a women's organization to sponsor Robert M. Sweitzer. A request by well-known German ladies of this city regarding this matter was submitted at yesterday's initial session.</p>
