   <p>It has been generally noticed how bitter a fight Jos. Medill's Tribune has waged against A. C. Hesing in the last election. This was so much more surprising, as at the beginning the Tribune considered the nomination of Hesing as one among the good ones, and although it would not recommend him on account of party reasons, it would not oppose his election.</p>
   <p>Why, then, the sudden subsequent bitterness of the Tribune against A. C. Hesing? among people who are more on the inside than the general public and who are better informed of the situation of Jos. Medill and the Tribune, it is no secret that purely financial conditions motivated the conduct of the Tribune. It is said that when Medill bought a number of shares from Horace White, sufficient to give him the control of the political views of the newspaper, he paid too much for them.</p>
   <p>He paid $500 for a share which had a nominal value of $200 and thus gave one million dollars for a newspaper which had a capital of $200,000. He discovered that the income of the newspaper did not correspond to his outlay of money. He also bought a great part of the Tribune building and is now hard pressed to meet <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the interest on the mortgage. The shares of the Tribune are now worth at the most $450 instead of $500 and Medill is reported to be anxious to sell his shares at this price, by which transaction he would stand to lose fifty thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>In order to alleviate his financial burden, Medill has endeavored to gain control of the County treasury. At the beginning he was not hostile to Hesing's candidacy, because he expected that the latter would be willing to deposit part of the money in the banks, from which he, Medill, had borrowed money to buy the newspaper. This would enable Medill to secure better treatment from the banks, in other words that instead of ten percent he would have to pay only four or five percent. When Hesing refused to enter such a bargain, Huck seemed more willing, he decided to fight Hesing to the bitter end.</p>
