   <p>An examination of the books of former Townclerk Byrne of Lake showed that the honorable man embezzled during 2 years at least $10,648.50. This man's crime is not so much the theft-like so many believe- but the unpardonable modesty of the boy! If he had stolen ten or twenty times that amount then he would have had an excellent chance to become Governor or a Congressman, but as things stand he forfeited through his foolish modesty this golden opportunity.</p>
