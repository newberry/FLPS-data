   <p>With unwavering consistency the English newspapers try to put the activity of the United Societies into a false light, and to create an impression that its members, as a whole, are directly interested in the brewing industry.</p>
   <p>The name, "Wet," with which the United Societies is continually designated, raises in the American citizen the impression that the main task of the United Societies consists of being "Wet".</p>
   <p>In our opinion a protest should be made against this in the interest of the societies. The English papers should be advised that these are not the beer-brewers that have taken upon themselves the fight against the always broadening bigotry in our city. The English newspapers should learn that it is neither just nor wise to Christen more than 200,000 inhabitants with a collective name, and make them appear, a certain degree ridiculous.</p>
   
   <p>Stress should be laid on the shocking partiality of the English press. But the English papers should also become enlightened about the true and manifold endeavors of the United Societies.</p>
   <p>The designation "Wet" undermines the importance of the United Societies, and against such an undermining of earnest efforts there cannot be taken too energetic a stand. And because we are at it, we believe it also necessary to submit that, in our opinion, the United Societies exceeded their sphere of activity at their last executive meeting. As far as we know, it was not only a custom, but also a resolution, that the United Societies do not step into the public light during the primary elections, so that it may be able to develop a greater political activity during the regular elections.</p>
   
   <p>Why now this sudden departure from the resolution? And why the indorsement of certain candidates as, "Friends of our Affair"? Why not say then, clearly and straight forwardly, "our affair" is, and in what the glorious activity of those candidates consists, that they can count upon the votes of the naturalized citizens of this city? "Friends of our Affairs" creates the belief that the indorsed candidates have no other merit other than that they march along with the Germans in the drinking question. And the political endeavors certainly do not gain, when their Sphinx-like expressions give room for the perception that they were led inclusively by the drinking question when they selected their candidates.</p>
   <p>It is indeed not necessary for the United Societies to hide, but they should on the other hand not be placed in a false light.</p>
