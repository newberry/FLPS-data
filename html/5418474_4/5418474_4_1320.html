   <p>Only a few people know that there is an ordinance of the City of Chicago according to which the salaries of civil service employees cannot be attached or garnisheed to collect payment of a debt. A few days ago a landlord asked a legal adviser whether it was true, as his attorney had previously told him, that he could not attach the salary of a city employee who owed him money. The reply was that that was indeed the case; that there was such an ordinance, for the existence of which no plausible reasons could be advanced.</p>
   <p>We must give our city employees due credit, however, and admit that there are only a few among them from whom a debt would have to be collected rather forcibly, but this is all the more reason for the majority of these employees to seize the opportunity and ask for a repeal of the measure. In the estimation of their fellow citizens, who are taxed to pay for their salaries, they are honor-bound to do this. They themselves would not want a favored officialdom with special privileges and, therefore, should not wait for the citizens to demand the repeal of the ordinance but rather should take action themselves against this offensive preference. If the few among them who intend to borrow and cheat by evading payment are removed, it will be rather a blessing for the city administration as well as for the citizenry.</p>
