   <p>If the exercise of the pardon power of the President has ever been in agreement with public opinion, it was the case on September 23rd, when the President shortened the prison sentences of A. C. Hesing, H. B. Miller, Powell and Burroughs. He, who considers the petitions signed in favor of these men, will gain the conviction that the majority of the people consider the sentences imposed by Judge Blodgett as a grave injustice.</p>
   <p>There is sufficient evidence to prove that Judge Blodgett used A. C. Hesing as a scapegoat and was the tool of a mob out for revenge, to which belonged the assisting prosecuting attorneys Ayer, Bontelle, and Wirt Dexter. This mob wished to punish Mr. Jasper D. Ward for having become Federal Attorney in place of Glover, and had hoped to induce Hesing to give damaging testimony against Ward.</p>
   <p>Because Hesing refused to perjure himself, the promise that should he plead guilty, he would get off with a light sentence, was ignominiously broken. That A. C. Hesing did not deserve any greater punishment than the other distillers is so. evident, that neither the President nor the Attorney General, Taft, had a moment's hesitancy. They realized that this was an <span class="page-break">\2</span>outrage upon justice and acted accordingly. The President's action was inspired by no political consideration and A. C. Hesing has not been asked to show his gratitude by his future political attitude.</p>
