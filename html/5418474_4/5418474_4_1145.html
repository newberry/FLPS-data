Should I deny that with natural feeling I am attached to the old fatherland, while at the same time I belong with heart and soul to America? I am standing before you not as a German, but as an American citizen (Applause) <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Mr. Brentano then came to speak of the civil service reform.
