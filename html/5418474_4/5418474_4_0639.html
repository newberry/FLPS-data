   <p>The elections that took place on October 8th in the states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and Nebraska, mark the end of the most impudent attempt ever made in the political history of this country to sell, stitched together, old rags as a new dress, and a used-up and discarded party as a young and alive reform party.</p>
   <p>The outcome of these state elections make it most probable that in all the states where before the War against the Rebellion, Negro slavery did not exist, Grant will receive the majority of votes.</p>
