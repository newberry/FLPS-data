   <p>The persistent rumor that the great majority of German Democrats of Chicago support the former Mayor C. H. Harrison, is merely a political maneuver. Consequently, the meeting held by prominent German citizens at La Salle Hotel last night, which culminated in the founding of a German club identified as the Andrew J. Graham Club, could be interpreted as a protest of Chicago's Democrats of German origin. The gathering was a large one, since close to 400 persons were present, who emphatically declared to support the candidates of the Democratic party in the primary. They are Andrew J. Graham, for the office of Mayor; Henry Stuckart, for Treasurer; and Francis D. Connery, for City Clerk. Furthermore, to make success for the party certain, a society for the furtherance of their ideals was organized, and well-known German businesamen elected to reponsible offices. An energetic campaign is being planned among the German voting population, If the Germans of Chicago insist upon their rightful place within the Democratic party, according to. their numerical strength, they must show more interest and activity in the primaries. This was the opinion of each speaker of the evening.</p>
