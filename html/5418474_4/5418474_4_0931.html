   <p>The infamous Tweed-Hesing Ring plunder bill has passed the house of representatives and a correspondent predicts that it "will meet with little opposition in the senate, unless relief comes from Chicago." What is the meaning of this? Does it mean that the senate of the state of Illinois, at the bidding of the Boss Hesing Ring, will pass a bill which is an almost exact counterpart of the Bill Tweed charter - which it is declared by City Comptroller Hayes would bankrupt this city; which is condemned in unequivocal terms by assemblies of taxpayers and denounced by the united voice of the press of this city (with the solitary exception of a German sheet owned by the Boss of the Ring, an inconsequential morning paper which prints school boys' essays without knowing what they are about); does it mean that the Illinois senate will commit this monstrous outrage against honor, decency, and public policy, unless a lobby ring is sent to Springfield to outbid the Tweed-Hesing Ring lobby?</p>
   <p>This is what it would appear to mean. For the same correspondent goes on to say that "a prominent member" said to him: "I shall vote for this bill for the reason that there seems to be no opposition to it among your citizens.</p>
   
   <p>There has not been one single individual down here lobbying against it!"</p>
   <p>What member said that? Whoever the member is that gives as his reason for supporting this Tweed-Hesing Ring bill that there is no lobby opposing it will bear watching. There is, and has been from the outset, a lobby "pushing it through," Just as there was at Albany when the Bill Tweed charter was pending. The Ring has had its lobby men at Springfield continually, incurring large tavern and whisky bills, on behalf of a duplicate of the Bill Tweed charter - a bill with "millions in it"; a bill that "would bankrupt the city if carried into effect."</p>
   <p>Does any one imagine that these patriots of the Ring are squandering so much time and money at Springfield for pure patrictism? If so, the statement of a member that he shall vote for the bill because no lobby is sent down to bid on the other side, ought to open the eyes of all such innocents.</p>
   <p>Very well. The Bill Tweed charter was "pushed through" the New York legislature by the lobby agents of the Ring in spite of all the arguments and denunciations by the city press, and in spite of the protestations of all persons not in the interest of the thieves. "The Ring," said a historian, "brought to bear influences more potent than arguments and denunciations."</p>
   
   <p>Rings always can - always do - when there is a bill to be "put through" that has "millions in it."</p>
   <p>The opposing taxpayers are placed at every disadvantage, for, having no hope or expectation of plunder, they are not induced to contribute money to pay lobby agents and outbid the Ring with "influences more potent than arguments." And so, when law-makers are merchantable, taxpayers are robbed.</p>
