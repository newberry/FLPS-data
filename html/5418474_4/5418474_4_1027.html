   <p>Our streetcar problem is as old as the hills, or at least as old as the streetcars. It is just too comical to watch seven different boards and committees, city officials, and employees vie with each other in telling John Q. Public how right he is in demanding satisfactory transportation. We listen to the song and we are familiar with the lyrics since Yerkes' time. Every year a few new stanzas are added. It is hard to find out just what is transpiring between the administration, the Traction Committee (Alderman Eugene H. Block), the traffic engineers, and the streetcar company. To the uninitiated it would seem that whenever things have progressed to a point of stalemate, all the parties involved begin to stage a sham battle among themselves to give the public the impression that each of them is just bending over backwards "to do what is best for the people's interests." During the course of this endeavor, the controversy gets more and more heated. Name calling is the order of the day, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and the result is usually the creation of a new committee, and another investigation by brand new experts. More often than not--and anybody can make these observations--the elimination of the pressing problem is postponed by this method while an enraged public calms down. Up till now nothing tangible or useful has come of all these investigations, except that the examining bodies have made a nice chunk of dough for themselves. Maybe this is part of the "social policy" indulged in by our city administration. The problem of unemployment is solved at least as far as those willing "experts" are concerned. Right now we can already hear the usual suggestions, "to investigate the complaints thoroughly" popping up from all directions. Every citizen knows what the result will be. Everybody recognizes as false the promises to remedy this or that bad condition, and in the end the transportation system will be worse than it has been before.</p>
   <p>Anybody who is unfortunate enough to have to use the streetcars knows how poor the service is these days. In spite of new cars and better rails and foundations, in spite of all the authorities set up to supervise the operations <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of the streetcar company and to make it conform to the regulations, the passengers have to risk torn clothes and physical injuries in the attempt to get home or to reach their places of employment on time. A one hour ride in a streetcar, jammed to capacity, and this is the rule, even outside of "rush hours" reduces a human being to the consistency of a jelly fish. Anybody reaching his place of destination without incurring bruises and stepped-on toes or torn garments can consider himself lucky. Then there is the expert--called a motorman--who has never learned how to apply brakes without breaking people's ribs. What is there to investigate? The lampposts on the street corners and the curbstones at the intersections are going to laugh at us poor humans pretty soon! When hundreds and thousands are suffering day after day on account of this incompetent and purposely run down system, no new investigation is necessary, only an iron broom to clean out these overpaid officials and committees. More investigations! Not enough that conditions are intolerable, but the public is to be fooled by promises of "investigations".</p>

   <p>Great hopes were placed in the State Board for Supervision of Public Utilities. The real reason why all these companies--streetcars, telephone, gas and electricity--were put under state supervision was to prevent them from exerting a corrupting influence on local politics, or to put an end to corruption where it already existed. The State Commission is supposed to take care that the public is given honest and efficient service by these companies for the franchise which the latter have been granted and which, in most cases, amounts to a monopoly anyway. The people have to pay the price fixed by the companies; they have no choice; pay they must! It is well known and has been proved that these companies had bought the men who have influence in local politics. In return, the companies had tacit permission to loot the public for all the traffic would bear. The "influential" local big shots are joining in the denunciation of the State Board by crying "Home Rule for Chicago!" But certainly! But of course! Self-administration is a vital factor for a community! But who was it that disgraced this principle to such a degree that even its most ardent advocates felt that it would be a salvation if only a State Board would put an end to this nickel diplomacy and grafting <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>corruption? Perhaps we are going to be fooled again! As members of the [State] Board the same birds were appointed that had nibbled those luscious seeds before [graft money]. Of a sudden, this exalted body is awakening too, stirred by an outcry of indignation. But let nobody believe that they are really going to work, to do something. That would be contrary to their nature. As the saying goes: "A leopard will never change his spots".</p>
