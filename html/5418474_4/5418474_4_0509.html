   <p>As we come to the end of the campaign, we are confronted by a very amusing contrast: The white washing, lovely hues of the Republican party and the dismal black color to which the Democrats resort to. According to the Republican view, Mc Kinley's administration converted the United States into an Eldorado, where people labor only for the sake of its agreeable diversion.</p>
