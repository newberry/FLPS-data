   <p>The Illinois Staats Zeitung condemns the present mode of selecting the party representation for the Republican National Convention. It maintains that there should be no representation admitted to that convention and be entitled to vote therein, excepting from those states which cast the majorities for the party and who actually do the electing.</p>
   <p>It quotes its leader on the subject as follows: "A really just representation of the party in a national convention called for the purpose of nominating a presidential candidate, would only be that by which the selection of a candidate is referred to those states only, which must eventually elect him by their majorities. As these states do the electing, they are certainly supposed to know best who is the strongest man. What does it avail to place a man in nomination preferred by the minority in those states, that can not give him a single electoral vote?</p>
   <p>"As long as the old system prevails, the party runs the risk of having its success frivolously endangered by political schemes and wire-pullers, who may use those states in which the party is in a helpless minority, or "rotten boroughs", to force an obnoxious candidate upon the majority.</p>

   <p>"The national convention of a party should be composed of delegates from these states only in which the party has a clear majority, or where the minority could by proper exertion be raised to a majority. The states could be classed for this purpose in two different ways: First, every state in which since the last four, or more, years the party gained at least one victory. Second, every state in which the party casts at loast forty per cent of all the votes polled. shall be entitled to so many votes in the national convention as the state casts electoral votes for president. These states, nowever, that are hopelessly lost to the party, and all the territories, including the District of Columbia, may send their delegates who will be entitled to admission under the same rules and regulations as govern the admission of delegates from the territories to the lower house of congress.</p>
   <p>"In this manner, we arrive at a party representation, which would stand in equitable proportion to the party's strength to elect a candidate. Thus a candidate would be selected by that power or strength in the party which has to elect him."</p>
   <p>party representation, as now in vogue, is nothing more or less than a humbug. It would not be tolerated any longer if we only would once clearly and logically draw the difference between national representation and party representation.</p>
