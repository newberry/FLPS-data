   <p>We have called the attention of the Germans of the State to the fact that they now have a very good opportunity to send a German Representative to the United States Congress. The citizens of the State of Illinois are entitled to elect a fourteenth Representative, a Representative at large, besides the regular Representatives of the thirteen districts.</p>
   <p>The Germans of Illinois constitute an important part of the population of the State, and nobody could justly accuse them of being immodest if they ask that one of the fourteen men chosen to represent the people of Illinois in Congress be a German.</p>
   <p>The German citizens of this State, as well as those of the other states of the Union, have always been known as staunch advocates and defenders of liberty, and it was due chiefly to their willing co-operation and strong support that the standard-bearer of the Chicago Platform was elected President of the United States. In the present war for freedom they not only have proved that they are loyal patriots and brave soldiers, but they have also provided a number of military leaders who have won the admiration of the whole country.</p>
   <p>Far be it from us to demand that Germans in general, or any individual German, should receive a reward for the deeds of our German heroes; we shall merely say that a people who, collectively and individually, have done so much for the cause of this country should also have a voice in the national assembly of the nation, aspecially when they have in their ranks men who are capable of representing the people as a whole.</p>
   <p>Had Mr. Gustav Koerner not left recently for the court of the King of Spain to serve as ambassador of our country, the Germans of the State certainly would not have missed the opportunity of doing everything possible to elect this man to Congress, since he has brought honor upon the German name by his record as judge of the Supreme Court and also as lieutenant governor. However, since Mr. Gustav Koerner, the man of our choice, is abroad in the service of our country, we heartily recommend Mr. Caspar Butz. We know of no other German in the State of Illinois who is better qualified to represent the State in the Congress, and many German citizens have urged him to be a candidate.</p>
   <p>As Representative to the State Legislature from the northern and western District of Cook County, Mr. Butz has often demonstrated that he is an able parliamentarian, and he has proved that the interests of his constituents have been entrusted to a faithful and honest man. Mr. Butz is a very good speaker; he is a master of the English language. He has the necessary knowledge of statesmanship, and he is a zealous advocate and champion of absolute freedom. Being a liberal-minded man, Mr. Butz would be in favor of prosecuting the war more vigorously, and, in general he would recommend only such measures by which the Rebellion would be suppressed now and for all time.</p>
   <p>If the Germans want a German Representative in Congress, and if they have chosen Mr. Butz as their candidate, they will have to make their wishes known in unmistakable terms at the mass meeting which will be held next Monday.</p>
