   <p>The United States Senate has passed a resolution with a two thirds majority, having for its purpose the protection of youth against industrial exploitation and to incorporate it in the Federal Constitution by means of an amendment. Persons of youthful age should be protected against excessive labor in the interest of society; this protection should have been provided long ago, and that it was not puts the greed of our industrialists (for cheap labor) into stark light. For they alone, by dint of their power and influence, were--and still are--mainly instrumental in preventing the passage of such laws in the legislatures of many states.</p>
   <p>Twice Congress has seem the importance of laws for the protection of minors, both male and female; but the Supreme court declared such laws unconstitutional because they relate to the individual states. The Court relied, in this case, upon a clause in the Constitution providing that all rights which the Constitution has not given over directly to the Federal Government are reserved for the individual states. There is nothing in the Constitution about laws protecting children, and this in why legislation in this field belongs to the several states. For years, the groups who have a Special interest in the passing of laws for the protrection of children have endeavored to bring about an amendment to the Constitution which would enable Congress to pass such a law, and the Federal Government to enforce it. The resolution now adopted by the Senate propeses to the forty-eight states the favoring of an amendment to the Constitution which would grant this right to the Federal Government.</p>
   <p>It is too early to predict what fate this bill will meet with in the various legislatures. But it appears to be certain that the states will not be as quick in accepting it as they were with the notorious Eighteenth Amendment.</p>
   
   <p>And it should not be adopted, for its acceptance would mean another step in the direction of centralizing the power of the national government in Washington. This centralization, through which one right after the other will be taken from the individual states, until they have some down to the status of more provinces, should neither be permitted nor tolerated. The makers of the Constitution know well enough what they did when they gave over to the states large administrative areas for their own ploughing, but never a central, all-overshadowing sun around which dark satellites should cruise. They knew likewise that social reforms can be brought about but in a rather moderate manner by way of legislation. The chief means for reform is education to a better understanding of existing evils, and to a decisive will to do away with them. But here laws of a social nature become imperative, they should be left to the individual states.</p>
   <p>The aspiration in Republican [party] circles to shear all parts of the country with the same comb and to tow them from one central position should, because it does not fit in with American principles nor with our democratic form of government, by all means be suppressed. If it were successfully continued, it would be better immediately to abandon the self-administration of the states instead of slowly jerking from them one right after the other. Out of humane considerations one does not chop off a dog's tail piece by piece. One should not proceed more cruelly with the states of the Union. If they have become superfluous, then out with them, and good riddance! The people could then save a great deal of money and would get orders from Washington.</p>
   <p>The folly of self-government would, to be sure, be over with, because the influence exercised by the individual citizen upon the central government is considerably less than that upon the administration of his own state, or even upon the municipality. These, too, could be disposed with forthwith and the citizen would no longer have to bother his head about whom he should elect judge, sheriff or mayor; all these officials could be nominated by a central office. What a Wonderful patronage this would be for senators and congressmen! But it has not come yet, though America is doing its best to get there when its citizens give thoughtless consent to a continuous and planned restriction of established state rights.</p>
   <p>The second part of the proposed amendment, which provides that the rights of the individual states may be abrogated only insofar as their laws disagree with the Constitution, is just foolish verbiage, the first clause has actually taken away their rights to issue pertinent laws. There remains for them nothing but the doubtful right to introduce laws more rigid than those to be passed by Congress. But there are no limits put upon Congress with respect to the severity of the law save as far as the age of those to be protected is concerned. It may make its laws as drastic as it places, and with no regard whatever to the particular conditions in the various states.</p>
   <p>As in the matter of the Eighteent Amendment, we are dealing here with a completely new right to be turned over to the Federal Government, a right that formerly belonged to the states. The citizens of these states will have to confer with one another and decide whether they want to forgo these rights or to snub Congress as it deserves. The children should and must be protected against industrial exploitation, but it should be done through the state legislatures and not through Congress.</p>
