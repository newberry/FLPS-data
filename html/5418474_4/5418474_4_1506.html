   <p>Alderman Stauber has shown particular interest recently in matters pertaining to special assessments, which are fraught with injustices of long standing. We have previously reported these in our columns. We have also, recommended a very practical method of combatting their evil; in fact, we have often criticized existing procedures.</p>
   <p>Stauber learned that the major portion of the special assessment fund consists of a surplus and that the city treasurer, who is in charge of it, derives interest payments therefrom, whereas the money (surplus) should be returned to the assessed property owners.</p>
   <p>Special assessments are levied according to estimates, and the latter are of necessity higher than the subsequent actual cost of the improvements for which the assessments have been made, and so surpluses accumulate. These the comptroller is supposed to return prorata to the property owners concerned.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>What the total surplus amounts to and which serves no purpose--except to pay dividends to the city treasurer--can only be conjectured. The comptroller admitted last spring that the surplus to be returned would probably, reach $150,000; Alderman Stauber estimates the amount to be returned at the present time at about $300,000.</p>
   <p>The modus operandi for a refund of the surplus as prescribed by the present comptroller, is as follows: Anyone having a receipt for a special assessment is to present it to the Superintendent of the Special Assessment Office at the City Hall, to ascertain how much is due him in a given instance, whereupon a voucher, payable by the city treasurer, will be issued to him.</p>
   <p>The City Council, upon a motion made by Cullerton, directed the comptroller about a year ago to notify all property owners who are entitled to prorata payments from the special assessment fund and to request them to present their claims. The comptroller declined to abide by the decision, however, as it would have entailed more work than could have been performed by his available <span class="page-break">\3</span>personnel.</p>
   <p>Thereupon in this column the proposition was made that the county treasurer, in as much as he collects the city taxes, be given a list of all the separate surplus assessment funds so that the individual property owners concerned might have their allotted prorata amounts credited to their 1877--and if possible 1878--tax bills. In this manner the special assessment fund surplus would have accrued to the city and provided money for general expenditures.</p>
   <p>But this suggestion also was ignored and the comptroller left the money in the city treasury where it accumulated interest for the city treasurer, and where watchful waiting was indulged in, except as someone made inquiries about his share. As the individual amounts were often only a mere trifle, and as property owners in most cases wore entirely unaware of the existence of such a fund, it followed that the grand total (sum) grew constantly, while only a few made any claims whatsoever.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>In order to serve the public in general, and his voters in particular, Alderman Steuber [Translator's note: The original spelled the name with "e" and also "a"; thus: "Stauber" and "Steuber"; "Stauber," with "A" predominates in the text.] has made and published a partial list of such surpluses. Owners of the herein mentioned properties may present their claims for refund by showing their receipts at the Office of Special Assessments, City Hall (Entrance on Adams Street, next to the LaSalle Street door), where a voucher on the comptroller will be issued.</p>
   <p>The list showing where refunds are due [follows:]</p>
   <p>Laying of water pipes on West Chicago Avenue from Wood Street to Ashland Avenue.....[Translator's note-: Improvements in fifteen districts are listed, including such items as "filling in", "paving", "water pipes" etc.]</p>
   <p>The owners of property on both sides of the streets mentioned above will do well to present their receipts for special assessments. All others having such receipts are urged to do the same.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The surest preventative of the accumulation of such tax money consists in crediting the surplus amounts annually to the property owners to whom they are due. A casual examination of the law discloses, that this method presents no legal difficulty, and the extra work which it would entail upon the comptroller would surely be compensated for by the gain in readily available tax money. And in addition it would eliminate a grave injustice to the taxpayers.</p>
