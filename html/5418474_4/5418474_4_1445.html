   <p>Chief of Police Hubbard is said to be about to resign his post. His principle in employing policemen is to select them for ability and not politics.</p>
   <p>The Bosses of the Chicago Republican Party, Swift, Swift, Davis &amp; Co., do not agree with those principles and have been trying, since Mayor Roche came into office to put the orthodox - Republican stamp on the whole police force.</p>
   <p>Hubbard is in many ways too honest - he is called in some authoritative quarters "Sleepy Head".</p>
