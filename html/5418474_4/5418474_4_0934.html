   <p>We have received the following telegram from Springfield: Governor Beveridge has just discharged the prison commissioner Theodore Canisins and appointed Woodbury M. Taylor in his place.</p>
   <p>The purport of this change can briefly be explained by these words: "Damn the Dutch".</p>
   <p>Dr. Canisins was the only German who had received a public office from the Republican governor. He was one of the few Germans who had not joined the opposition movement. But he is a German and the majority of Germans has forsaken the Republican Party, and thus: out with the Dutchman.</p>
   <p>Woodbury M. Taylor, the new commissioner, is the same scoundrel, who has repeatedly insulted the Germans in the Chicago Evening Post. His appointment is a direct insult for the Germans, who know that the Evening Post is one of their most bitter adversaries.</p>
