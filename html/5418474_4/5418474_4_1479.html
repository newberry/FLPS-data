   <p>To-day, Monday, August 23rd, in the evening in the Hall at Milwaukee Avenue, no. 703, an extraordinary secret meeting will take place. Each member should by all means be present as matters of great importance will be discussed. Don't forget, Comrades, that our member, Charles Howe, has been treacherously wounded and thrown on the sick bed by a gang of vagabonds of the 14th Ward.</p>
   <p>Don't forget that further heavy consequences will occur if this deed is not avenged. Therefore take care and come to-day to the meeting. Every member reading this announcement should make it known to the nearest living comrade, so that nobody remains at home. No excuses will be accepted.</p>
