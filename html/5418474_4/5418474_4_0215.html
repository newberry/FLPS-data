   <p>The Improvement Club of the 20th, 21st, and 22nd Wards, under the leadership of Pres. A. C. Baumann, has called the North Side property owners to a mass meeting at Folz Hall, North Ave. and Larrabee St. in order to obtain greater membership. The club has achievements to its credit; it represented the interests of the property owners from the northern district in an energetic manner and did its share in objecting against May's tunnel system. The club has hundreds of members, all property owners; it now resorts to a membership drive in order to become more effective and make its influence felt throughout the entire North Side.</p>
