   <p>Municipal ownership of all transportation systems, will be the campaign slogan, which Ex-Governor Altgeld and his faithful followers will adopt for the mayorality battle. Any other "issue" is to be ignored, and not even the wooden horse is to be ridden any more against Harrison' s bolting party leaders, and the obnoxious free-coinage proposition since, so Altgeld declared yesterday, the people are "momentarily only interested in the municipal ownership question." In front of Altgeld' s headquarters, at the "Unity" Bldg., flutters a great campaign banner with a likeness of the candidate, which apparently, does not instill any particular fear in the Harrisonites.</p>
   <p>As we see at first glance, the new executives of the County Central Committee are strongly pro Harrison, which throws light on the fact, that Gahan is favoring the re-election of the mayor. Originally, it was claimed, that he had little inclination for such a view, since it was a "public secret" that Gahan was opposed to Harrison's nomination, two years ago. Concerning his present sentiments, the chairman of the Democratic Central Committee expressed himself in this manner: " I am for May or Harrison's re-nomination and re-election, and will work accordingly. Two years ago matters were different. At that time I was opposed to him, and we could have beaten him in an open convention, if it had not been for Altgeld. He threatened to fight any other candidate at the voting booths, so we finally abided by the wishes of the Ex-Governor, although we had the control of the nomination convention fully in our hands. Today, Altgeld fights his protege; not for party reasons, but because he considers that Harrison is a dangerous rival. This time I remain faithful to the mayor."</p>
