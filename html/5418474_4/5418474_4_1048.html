   <p>I read your article about Hoechster. Why is it that envy, so popular among Germans, is manifested even in newspapers? Let us assume, Mr. Hoechster comes far too short of the ideal representative of the local German population, yet you will have to admit, that he is just as good, if not better, than most of the Irish, who are always supported by the Abendpost, if they are only devoted disciples of the gold standard".</p>

   <p>Reply: "The Abendpost has no reason at all to envy Mr. Hoechster, and would not have mentioned his case, if the latter had not ferociously attacked our Civil Service system. He did this to please the Irish bread and butter brigade. Only recently he embraced in a spectacular way the silver theory". He should be aware of the fact, that the citizens of German origin in this country have fought relentlessly against the "spoil system" from the beginning. The Germans cannot be blamed for the partial breakdown of Civil Service. A german candidate, who discredits the greatest political achievement of the German-Americans, the Civil Service reform has no just claim upon the support of the German Voters. But when it comes to support a bad Irish candidate, it must be stated, that the "Abendpost" never recommended one simply because of the candidate's adherence to the gold standard.</p>
