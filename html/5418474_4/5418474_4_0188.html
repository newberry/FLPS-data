   <p>In the German Department of the Silver Democratic States's Committee, they are working, with great zeal, on the preparations for the German Mass Meeting, which will be held Tuesday evening at the Auditorium in Altgeld's honor, "independently of the currency question."</p>
   <p>With reference to the proofs of his manliness and administrative talents, which the Governor demonstrated during the occupancy of his high post, almost all German societies and a large number of private individuals of the city, were invited by Messrs. Philip Henrici, Harry Rubens and others, to attend, this meeting.</p>
   <p>The Governor will not in his address, touch the currency question.</p>
