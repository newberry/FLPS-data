   <p>During the coming days the State legislature at Springfield will consider the matter of retaining or abolishing the office of State Public Utilities Commission. Several proposals to repeal the law under which the office was established have been placed before the people's representatives. The citizens of Chicago, especially, will be interested in the discussions and debates which will take place. For the State Commission has, or at least is supposed to have, authority to supervise, or act as a sort of guardian to, the City of Chicago, regulating, among other things, transportation within the City's boundaries; for it is by no means certain that the Commission has the right to interfere arbitrarily in Chicago's transportation affairs, and thus to limit the City's right to govern itself. At least the Commissioner's alleged authority to do so is being attacked from various quarters.</p>
   <p>Only a short time ago the Commission made known its existence to the people of Chicago in a very unpleasant way, by granting the request of the elevated railroads to increase their rate of fare to six cents. Just now a similar request by the Surface Lines is before the Commission, which has as yet taken no action in the matter. The citizens of Chicago consider the Commission to be entirely superfluous; in the eyes of Chicagoans the Commission is only a tool which the State of Illinois is using to regulate the progress and development of the Western Metropolis. It is a retrogressive institution, just as many of the relations between the State and the City are not conducive to progressive development. Chicago emerged long ago from its childhood, and is not in need of guidance at every step which it takes. The demand of Chicago, and perhaps also of other cities of the State, for greater independence will be one of the prime factors in the impending revision of the constitution of the State.</p>
   <p>It is wrong to give to inhabitants of rural Illinois, who do not understand the needs of a great city, or to farmers who live in the southern part of the State and whose interests, therefore, have nothing in common with the industry and business of Chicago, a voice in the City's transportation problems or in the administration of other civic affairs which concern only the local citizens. Chicago's sphere of home rule should be widened. And the first step to that end would be to abolish the State Utilities Commission which reserves for itself the right to issue franchises and arbitrarily to alter contracts which City authorities, as representatives of the citizens of Chicago, have let. The city either has, or has, not the authority to grant franchises and to make contracts. If the City has the authority, then it is improper to invest a State commission with the power to change the t terms of a franchise which has been in force for decades--without obtaining the consent of both parties interested. The State Public Utilities Commission is a cancer which should be removed--in the interest of the City and of a great number of the inhabitants of the State. Springfield should not be afraid to wield the operating knife. There is no doubt concerning the necessity of the operation. The sooner it takes place, the better it will be.</p>
