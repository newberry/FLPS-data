   <p>A number of German Societies, who as a rule keep themselves aloof from party politics, are making an exception this year, and agitate for the reelection of Governor Altgeld.</p>
   <p>For this purpose, they are going to hold a number of massmeetings, in different parts of the city. The first will be held next Sunday in the social TurnerHall, corner Paulina and Belmont Streets, near Lincoln Avenue. Speakers will be Messrs. Engene Debs, Clarence Darrow, Julius Goldzier, Adolph Strum and Julius Vahlteich. As Honorary presidents of the meeting, Dr. Ernest Schmidt, Philip Henrici and Hans Jensen are selected.</p>
   <p>The meeting will be preceded by a parade through the main streets of Lake View.</p>
