   <p>At last the Benner affair is settled. In spite of the mayor's efforts, and the work of his wire-pulling friends, and all the lobbying, the City Council refused to ratify Benner's dismissal. The vote was twenty-eight to six in favor of Benner.</p>
   <p>The Council Chamber was crowded long before the opening of the session. The aldermen appeared at the proper time.</p>
   <p>The mayor opened the session promptly at half past seven. He was surrounded by politicians, among them William J. Hynes, John Forsyth, Doolittle, Jr., Abner Taylor, and others....</p>
   <p>The Main Event <span class="page-break">\2</span>The most important business of the evening, the dismissal of Benner, could not be postponed any longer. The mayor read his message to the Council, and in closing made the following remarks:</p>
   <p>"Can the mayor of such a large city give a good administration if the various department chiefs refuse to obey? The mayor may make mistakes, but he cannot be blamed if he has no authority over the officials. If the people wish to hold the mayor responsible, then the Council should give proper consideration to the verdict and the consequences. If you favor disobedience, then you must accept responsibility for the results. Alderman Cullerton will be chairman!"</p>
   <p>The mayor was repeatedly interrupted by loud applause from his followers, and made no attempt to silence it. After making Cullerton chairman, Harrison left the assembly.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Cullerton had barely reached his chair when McCaffrey stood up and made a motion to object to Benner's dismissal. In a rather long speech, McCaffrey spoke of Benner's outstanding labors in behalf of the city, and emphasized the fact that the aldermen had done all in their power to prevent a clash with the mayor and the Council, since the aldermen felt that the mayor's action was prompted by injured pride--but that now it was the duty of the aldermen to reinstate Benner, because the man had been ousted for insufficient reasons.</p>
   <p>The speaker's eulogy of Benner and the fire department was received with boisterous acclaim by the crowd, and Cullerton threatened to exclude the public if there was any demonstration.</p>
   <p>Thompson declared that Benner had done everything the mayor could demand, and that Benner was justified in entertaining doubts about the mayor's <span class="page-break">\4</span>sincerity in wanting to reduce salaries. The mayor acted hastily, and not in the interests of the city, when he demanded Benner's resignation.</p>
   <p>Dixon was of the opinion that the mayor's order to economize by reducing salaries was not quite justified, and said that if the mayor wanted to save money for the city he could have done so by postponing purchases whenever possible, but that the low wages of the firemen should not be reduced further.</p>
   <p>Dixon also denied having influenced either Benner or the firemen, as the mayor claimed. "It is our duty," continued Dixon, "to reinstate the fire marshal; his dismissal was inexcusable, just a whim of the mayor."</p>
   <p>Throop spoke highly of Benner, and of the fire department under his leadership, and considered the mayor's reasons for the dismissal of the marshal <span class="page-break">\5</span>insufficient.</p>
   <p>McNally said that he is not opposed to Benner, but believes Swenie capable of taking charge of the fire department. It is plain that Benner did not obey the mayor, and any alderman who encourages such acts by voting favorably for Benner rebels against constituted authority. The people will not trust such councilmen.</p>
   <p>While McNally was speaking, the Harrison lobbyists created a disturbance, and McCormick (to whom Cullerton had relinquished the chairmanship) could not silence the men.</p>
   <p>Waldo's motion to end the debate met with strong objections. Among the Socialists, only Altpeter voted against the motion.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Cullerton then tried to prove that the mayor had acted according to law, and declared that it was foolish to save money by not building schools and sewers for the sake of maintaining salaries at present levels. He showed that the Republican administration had made all these economic measures necessary. In Cullerton's opinion, all expenses should be cut twenty-five per cent. He then became involved in an argument with Dixon and Harrison's lobbyists. Cullerton accused Dixon of duplicity, and said that Dixon was responsible for Benner's obstinate conduct. Finally, Cullerton told the Council that it would be useless to reinstate Benner, because his official term expires on August 1 anyway, and the fire department would be thoroughly demoralized if Benner were to be reinstated, because the firemen will not know whom to obey. The aldermen will never be able to justify their actions before their constituents, if the mayor's authority is questioned by a reinstatement of Benner.</p>
   <p>A number of protests, resolutions passed at mass meetings--including the one <span class="page-break">\7</span>at the North Side Turner Hall--as well as statements of the representatives of all fire insurance companies opposed to Benner's dismissal, were then presented.</p>
   <p>Everett then spoke, and showed that the mayor's arguments for Benner's dismissal were very flimsy. That Benner had done his duty was admitted in the mayor's message.</p>
   <p>Lawler read a letter Benner had written to the corporation counsel on June 18 wherein Benner asked whether, as fire marshal, he had a legal right to reduce the salaries of the firemen.</p>
   <p>Corporation Counsel Adams neglected to send a reply. This shows that Benner definitely intended to obey the mayor. After Benner's dismissal, Adams <span class="page-break">\8</span>expressed his opinion by sending a legal brief to the mayor, in which the latter's actions in reducing salaries were upheld. This is something the Council should consider. Finally, Lawler commended Benner in a most eloquent manner, and defended him against the accusation of having acted unfairly when he (Benner) submitted the salary reduction order to the firemen.</p>
   <p>The mayor is mistaken if he believes the Council is opposed to him, but the aldermen must encourage an official who endeavors always to follow the law.</p>
   <p>Cullerton interrupted Lawler, and asked whether it was not Benner's duty to accept the mayor's demand.</p>
   <p>Evertt wanted to know if it was not the corporation counsel's business to advise officials.</p>
   <p>Cullerton: "The Mayor is above him!"</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Everett: "And we are above the Mayor!"</p>
   <p>Great applause followed.</p>
   <p>Lawler ridiculed Cullerton's fears that Benner's reinstatement would cause trouble. Frequent applause interrupted the speech, and the audience seemed highly excited.</p>
   <p>Upon Smyth's motion, the debate was ended and the aldermen voted on the question Benner's dismissal.</p>
   <p>The following aldermen were in favor of Benner's reinstatement: Dixon, Ballard, Phelps, Clark, Mallory, Grannis, Turner, McAuley, Altpeter, Lawler, Purcell, Smyth, Eissner, McNurney, Throop, Swift, Rawleigh, Everett, Knopf, <span class="page-break">\10</span>Thompson, Stauber, Lorenz, Waldo, Wetterer, Meier, McCaffrey, Jonas, and McCormick--twenty-eight aldermen.</p>
   <p>Opposed to Benner's reinstatement were: Cullerton, McNally, Riordan, Peevey, Meyer, and Barrett--six aldermen.</p>
   <p>Absent: Tuley and Sanders.</p>
   <p>Terrific applause greeted announcement of the results....As the council adjourned, Benner was cheered.</p>
