   <p>From a dependable source we hear that on the "liberal" side the proposition has been made to nominate Gustav Körner for governor. The nomination of Körner would be much too smart a move than we would. believe such fossils as Uncle Jesse K. Dubois, Hatcher, Miner, and "Long" John Wentworth, who have taken the lead in the liberal movement in Illinois would be capable.</p>
   <p>But let us suppose that Körner would be nominated for the governorship - we would be quite satisfied. In him we would gladly support a man about whose attitude toward the Temperance Law we have no doubts. The majority in the legistature has been pleased to disregard party restrictions in respect to temperance legislation, it therefore must not be surprised that we, on our side, in fighting this law will <span class="page-break">\2</span>recognize no party difference. Besides, Mr. Körner, up to now, has been a firm and faithful Republican and the fact that he is regarded by the "Liberals" as one of them will not make us doubt the honesty of his Republican convictions. Taking into regard his statesmanlike ability, his legal knowledge and thorough acquaintance with all public interests of the state of Illinois - there is no eminent man in the state who surpasses him in these respects.</p>
   <p>Americans could regard it as proof of his Americanism that he is almost 40 years a citizen of the state, that is to say, longer than most of the native Americans living in Illinois. As to the Germans, they will support in him a man who has never been ashamed of his German birth...</p>
