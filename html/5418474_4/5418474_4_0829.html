   <p>Independent political clubs have been organized in almost every German Lutheran congregation in Cook County, and this action has been largely imitated by the churches of the state. These clubs take in not only the membership of the congregation but all voters who are in sympathy with the fight on the school law.</p>
   <p>A central organization, composed of representatives from the independent political clubs, has been formed, and there are indications that it is receiving aid from outside sources. At a meeting held on the North Side last week it was proposed that a resolution be passed indorsing the Straight Democratic ticket. While there were some in the meeting ready to support such a step, the cooler heads deemed it premature, and apparently suspected something was wrong. There are a great many Lutherans who believe the Republican party will sacredly keep the pledges in its platform and are not prepared to rush into the Democratic party....</p>

   <p>The campaign against the school law is being conducted by the German Lutheran School Committee, which is looking after the matter of organization and the exacting of pledges from the legislative candidates now before the people. It is stated on good authority that the Secretary of this Committee is in communication with the Secretary of the Democratic Campaign Committee, and that the latter organization is kept advised as to what is being done.</p>
   <p>There is a strong foundation for the belief that the Democratic committee has instructed the legislative candidates of the Democratic party to sign the pledge presented by the school Committee. The secretary of this committee is Andrew Mueller, who conducts a school at 683 Loomis Street. He was seen yesterday afternoon and asked whether many of the candidates for seats in the Thirty-Seventh General Assembly were signing the pledge sent out by the committee.</p>
   <p>"Look at that," he replied, opening a hand satchel full of letters. "Each one of these letters contain a reply with a pledge signed or a promise equal to the pledge. We have a majority of the Democratic candidates. All the nominations have not been made yet, so I cannot tell how many we will have. A few Republican candidates have signed the pledge. As soon as I get replies <span class="page-break">\3</span>from all the candidates our people will be advised regarding their support. We will try to elect those candidates who have agreed to support our cause.</p>
   <p>"The Republicans do not seem to favor it. They do not answer our letters. The Democratic party incorporated our resolutions in their platform just as we drafted them, but the Republicans rejected them, and adopted one that we think is evasive. The worst thing, however, was to nominate Dr. Edwards. We cannot trust that man. We fear if he is elected, a worse law will be enacted."</p>
   <p>Mr. Mueller was asked if the German Lutherans were not satisfied with the Republican plank, when it was first adopted, and replied: "I do not think it was understood at first. We are not opposed to the English language. The reason we do not send our children to the public school before they are confirmed is that we want them to get a religious training. There is too much danger in a law which says the English language must be taught. If we allow the state to make one step the next step will be how much English shall be taught, then the method, then the books, and so on."</p>
   <p>Mr. Mueller stated that the committee was not cooperating with the Democratic <span class="page-break">\4</span>Committee. It is reported that the School Committee will also make a fight on P. A. Saundelius. Regarding this matter Mr. Muller said: "We will make our whole fight on members of the Legislature and the Superintendent of Public Instruction. We will pay no attention to the county ticket. The failure of the Republican legislative candidates to sign our pledges or answer our letters may influence some to support the DEmocratic ticket, but this committee will not advise our people on that matter."</p>
   <p>William Tatge, who is the legal adviser of the School Committee, said: "The pledge which is sent out does not demand one itoa more than is contained in the platforms of the two parties. Our School Committee deened it advisable to exact a pledge. They feared a great many politicians nominated for the legislature would, if election, say either that they had been nominated before the platform was adopted, or if nominated later would say they did not consider themselves bound by it.</p>
   <p>"I think generally that the Republican German Lutherans will support the Republican ticket, and the Democratic Lutherans the Democratic ticket. A great many will vote against Dr. Edwards and in favor of Raab. The belief is widespread that Dr. Edwards is responsible for the present law and that <span class="page-break">\5</span>he secured the governor's signature to the law through misrepresentation. They will also oppose Senator Humphry, but district is so strongly Republican that I guess he will be elected any way. There was no necessity for enacting so vicious a law. I say this because I believe in the doctrine that that country is governed best that is governed least."</p>
   <p>Minister Discuss The Situation.</p>
   <p>TThe Rev. Henry Wander of St. Paul's Church said: "The action of the Republicans to grant our request May force our people to suppert the Democratic ticket....We are not politicians, but it we get beat this time we will prepare for a stronger fight next time."</p>
   <p>The Rev. C. Eisfeld of South Chicago said... that the action of the Democratic party in Wisconsin has had the effect of creating a kindly feeling for that party among the Lutherans of Illinois and Mr. Eisfeld criticised Gov. Hoard's course severely. McHenry has been recently canvassed by a couple of men who, it is presumed, were sent out by the Democratic Committee. These individuals called upon the German-Lutherans and inquired whether they were sending their children to private schools or not. If the reply was affirmative
<span class="page-break">\6</span>the parents were informed that if they did not take their children out of these schools they would be prosecuted under the Compulsory Education Law to its fullest extent. Naturally parents were at first much alarmed, but on learning that this pair were an irresponsible couple sent out by an irresponsible committee their fears subsided.</p>
   <p>A. S. Wright of Woodstock was seen yesterday and said: "This pair traveled much of the entire county and called upon almost every German Lutheran family. We have not been able to obtain their names or find out where they came from, but they were undoubtedly sent out by the Democratic Committee.They are about 400 German-Lutheran votes in McHenry County."</p>
   <p>Political Party Planks Bearing on The Question.</p>
   <p>Republican Plank - We recognize the American public school system as chief agency in securing intelligent citizenship and chief bulwark of popular liberties, and we declare in favour of a compulsory education law which will guarantee to all children of the state ample opportunity of acquiring such an elementary education as will fit them for intelligent performance of civic and political duties when they reach the age of manhood. But we are, at the same <span class="page-break">\7</span>opposed to any arbitrary interference with the right of parents or guardians to educate their children at private schools, no matter where located; and we favor the amendment of the existing Compulsory Education law so as to conform with the declarations herein set forth, and also the repeal of so much of said law as provides for public supervision over private schools.</p>
   <p>The Democratic Plank - Resolved, that the Democratic party in conventions assembled heartily indorses the public school system of the State of Illinois and it declares that the parental right to direct and control the education of the child should forever remain inviolate, and that the provisions of the law of 1889, commonly known as the compulsory educational statute, impairing that inalienable right should be at once repealed.</p>
   <p>Respecting this subject we adopt the following propositions and hold them to be self-evident truths:</p>
   <p>1. To determine and direct the education of the child is the natural right of the parents.</p>
   <p>2. There arises out of this parental right the duty to provide education.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>3. When one who, by natural or human law, owes a duty to another and fails to perform that duty, the State can (a) enjoin or compel performance, (b) punish for non-performance, and (c) supply the lack where to the injury of society non-performance is wrongfully persisted in.</p>
   <p>4. Wise statemenship encourages general popular education, but this does not mean, or require unjust or unnecessary interference with those who are educating their chidlren according to the best of their ability, and conformably to the condition in life of the parent and the child.</p>
   <p>5. Compulsory education, in the sense that parents who violate or neglect their parental duty, may be compelled to its performance or punished for its none-performance, in licit.</p>
   <p>6.Compulsory education, in the sense of compelling or seeking control or dislodging from their rightful place those parents who are discharging their parental duties commensurately with the state of life of parent and child is not allowable even to the State.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>7. For the education of his children one may select the public school another may select the private or denominational school, and still another may furnish proper education without the aid of any school, and each of them in so doing exercises a right protected by law of the land and as well as by the law of nature, and for doing which he need offer neither excuse nor apology.</p>
   <p>8. Public and private denominational schools are in law neither related, nor are they subordinate one to the other; nor need they be antagonistic. We favor and pledge ourselves the enactment of the statutes.</p>
   <p>1. To require parents who are not at all performing their duty in respect to educating their children to do so.</p>
   <p>2. To correct incorrigible truants by providing means for their amendment and to minimize the evils of truancy by sending truant children to such schools as the parents may designate.</p>
   <p>3. To prohibit child labor, with all its debasing consequences.</p>
