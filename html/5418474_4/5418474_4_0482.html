   <p>The American people suffer. The specter of fear is being presented everywhere; worry and enervating apprehension swamps the proud and mighty nation! Who instigated it? The bluff politicians of Anglo-Saxon origin.</p>
   <p>Ominous forebodings about whom or what? And then one perceives the traditional but not truthful soft, sinister whisper, the German danger. There are really a few old ladies extant who consider the beloved Monroe doctrine in the light of their asthmatic lap dog and tremble in anticipation of the German danger, as if it were a pestilence and inexorable death.</p>

   <p>Then clandestinely comes another threat, the Mongolians, the yellow Japanese, inspire the Americans with awe. The horror of the yellow peril is more justified. That accounts for our willingness to give liberty and independence to the Filipinos following a procrastination of many years after the Spanish-American War of 1898. As usual, this delay was prompted by humanitarianism. It was suspected that without a guardian, the Filipinos might do mischief. But now the panic cured the hysteria. Altruism is a nice subject for contemplation, but egotism gives greater security.</p>
   <p>The World War supplied the bluff politicians with a new weapon to realize their plans, the fear of England. Thereby the Washingtonian administration will be bamboozled and the obstreperous public tamed under English pressure, which was the motivating power shaping our political issues during the War. We have referred to it before. This English force depresses the conscience of the American people like a nightmare and the suspense makes the masses <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>unruly.</p>
   <p>The Americans are fully aware of their cardinal sin, foisted upon them by the unsatiable greed of the munition makers, who export tremendous quantities of arms to the Allies regardless of world opinion. The population protested; meetings, thousands of them, were organized; resolutions, signed by millions, were sent to the President and Congress. Although humane senators and representatives offered embargo bills, it all seemed useless. One dares not release the bills from the committee lest an open discussion before the plenary powers expose the political situation and foreign connections. And that must be obviated by all means, our worry about England.</p>
   <p>Senator Fall of New Mexico wants to be fully informed just why the President recognized Carranza so suddenly. The riddle, thus far, has not been solved. The reasonable request met with refusal, probably for fear of England.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The U-boat question was to be settled in the only conceivably just and proper manner. Instantly Washington reversed itself when it was frightened by England.</p>
   <p>Our commerce with neutrals is being maliciously ruined. A few feeble notes. Our courage permits no more when it comes to England.</p>
   <p>The United States Mail, emblem of inviolability, is recognized even by our indigenous crooks who have no compuctions about sacredness; they reverence all boxes which are labeled U.S.A., being fully aware that Uncle Sam tolerates no fooling. But the foreign connivers, the English pirates, ransack our postal sacks in a most imperturbable manner and Uncle Sam does not complain, being afraid of England.</p>
   <p>This compendium of gins could be greatly enlarged. Whenever the public <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>objects, an answer is supplied, we dread England.</p>
   <p>But was it always thus? No. Once upon a time we had a Democratic President, Grover Cleveland, and a Secretary of State, Richard Olney. Both were knights beyond any doubt, undaunted and commendable. None were obsessed with fear of England, and therefore, they acted in the typically American manner, not pro-British.</p>
   <p>During the Teklenburg Line controversy in Venezuela, England attempted to gobble up a little territory, a long established custom, but Cleveland interjected a mighty Quos Ego (I want you), and Olney wrote a spicy note, not a la Bryan, nor like Lansing. Promptly the snarling, termagant English lion retracted his covetous claws and grudgingly relinquished his morsel. Anxiety about England was unknown then, although it was the period when Great Britian reached the zenith of her power and was blessed with ample, unhampered elbows, whereas the American Army and Navy eked out a meager <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>existence. But courage ruled Washington at that time.</p>
   <p>To-day it is different. England is hog-tied. Canada has become a veritable pawn of the United States, considering our magnificent sea and land power. And yet, we tremble before England. It is a psychological conundrum. The more so when one compares our former struggles with that nation.</p>
   <p>During the Newfoundland fishery question and the Alaskan boundary dispute the Americans were insistent and England acceded. One may remember the Fanama affair, with the British interests well represented by the Clayton Bullwer agreement. England was busy with the Boers, and we announced the abrogation of the bargain which gave England certain rights in this waterway. As an alternative, it was forced to accept the Hay-Pauncefoote stipulations, which, to use a popular phrase, kicked the English out of Panama. There was gnashing of the teeth and compliance. It was accomplished by the full-blooded English with the exception of American-minded President <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>McKinley. And the United States at that time was the only nation which made political capital out of Britain's South-African dilemma. The Kaiser even, it is said, helped his venerable grandmother Victoria by drawing a war plan, for which he now gathers his thanks.</p>
   <p>It is well, at times, to rehash old, forgotten stories. World history always is the best teacher, that is, if one remembers it. But just that is our national and administrative deficiency.</p>
   <p>During the none too remote era when these arguments always ended in an English capitulation, the continental European diplomats would wink surreptitiously and comment on the latest sport of the American shirt-sleeved officials. "It consists in pinching the British lion's tail; he growls, but does not bite," they said.</p>
   <p>Considering world events from this angle, our present governmental <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>attitude appears entirely undecipherable. Afraid of the British lion whose teeth are mostly broken and whose claws have been neatly trimmed?</p>
   <p>Regrettable, indeed, that Grover Cleveland and his staunch Secretary, Olney, are not here to admonish our leaders: Courage, boys, the British lion roars, but he won't bite!"</p>
