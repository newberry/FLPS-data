   <p>In any one should still doubt, that the great, mass of Chicago's Germans five their unequivocal support to Hesing's mayoral candidacy, then he should come to different conclusions after seeing yesterday's meeting, of the Branch Clubs, (under the auspices of the German Democratic Central 1 Association,) at the Orpheus Hall on LaSalle Street.</p>
   <p>There were about 150 influential German Democrats at this gathering. Every ward was represented, although a terrific snow storm hampered our transportation system and districts, in outlying the service was abandoned altogether. One can readily perceive what a crowd it night have been, if the weather god had not interfered during one of his periodic, frigid moods. It is gratifying to observe, however, that the German people of divers callings, felt immune to the inclemencies of a congealing temperature, and, after a strenuous day's work marched to the hall. It is a splendid proof that the German interest in the forthcoming mayoral election transcends anything known in the history of local politics!</p>
   <p>The purpose of the assembly was to declare its principles, i.e., to adopt <span class="page-break">2</span>a platform and suitable proceedings for its enforcement, commensurate with the constitutional rules made by the German Democratic Central Association at its first annual meeting. Another object was to remind the German voters in an emphatic manner to do their share at the polls.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Sturm read the declaration of principles: "The Platform: As the German-American Democratic Association of Cook county has resolved to support the principles and interest of the Democratic party and also to augment and strengthen the influence of the German-American citizens within the ranks of that party, and</p>
   <p>"As it is aware of the direct help it has given by organizing Branch Clubs in the separate wards and remembers the splendid Democratic victories during the last national and state elections, towards which it contributed its share, by leading the German element into the fight for personal liberty and parental educational control, principles, which brought a glorious triumph and culminated in the election of Grover Cleveland and John P. Altgeld, and</p>
   <p>"As it intends to achieve its objective and fulfill its obligations towards all the German voters of Chicago who trustingly followed it in the last <span class="page-break">3</span>campaign, the club considers it a duty to give its staunchest support during the approaching election and to announce its principles in an unequivocal manner. Therefore be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved: that we, the members of the German-American Democratic club of Cook County and of its branches give the following explanation of our intentions:</p>
   <p>"We demand of the Democratic city administration, which we hope to elect wish our voting power, that it shall act in conformity with true business principles, and that it shall always consider the welfare of the city and its inhabitants as being above party expediency. Honesty and economy must rule in the city's management, ability and trustworthiness shall be the essential requisites for all officials and employees in the upper and lower positions.</p>
   <p>"We require that the administration we may elect, shall be dedicated to a sensible progress and to take cognizance of the requirements of our giant city whose population is growing and expanding constantly, and that it be adequately protected from the ever-increasing exploitation by the gas trust <span class="page-break">4</span>and other plundering monopolies to whom the people pay their daily tribute. An untiring, unrelenting fight must be waged until the city is able to acquire municipal control of these utilities, thereby relegating these corporation to oblivion.</p>
   <p>"We insist upon an unrestricted continuation of German language instruction, as it is next to English, the most largely used language of our civilization during the present era; gymnastics, drawing, singing, etc., must also be taught in our public schools, as we subscribe to the belief, that America is destined to lead in the field of education, just as it has been a guiding beacon in so many lines of human activity; what wherever the Star Spangled Banner may wave, it may proclaim equal opportunities in educational matters for rich and poor, a thorough education for all children, which prepares them in their fight for existence and provides a true enjoyment of life.</p>
   <p>"We demand an absolute compliance with the eight hour system, for the protection of labor and employer, the impartial and just adherence to the laws.</p>
   <p>"We desire regular and general cleaning of all streets and alleys whose present condition is a disgrace to the good name of our city as well as constant threat to our hygenic welfare; that the poor or wealthy districts <span class="page-break">5</span>must be treated with impartiality.</p>
   <p>"We objects to further increases in cost of license for our tavern keepers, as we consider that this recognized legitimate business has been taxed enough since the Harper law was passed and the multiple city ordinances Which are based upon it; that an abuse of the taxing power will act only to the detriment of that industry and is in effect an insolent injustice. We insist that all disreputable drinking places be abolished.</p>
   <p>"We request that our next city executives use their power to provide Sunday admission to the World's Fair, so that the less fortunate classes may have an opportunity to see it.</p>
   <p>"We want proper consideration for the German-American citizens; they shall be given official positions in proportion to their relative importance as tax-payers and citizens.</p>
   <p>"We ask that the candidates of the Democratic party who will fill the city positions apply a more equalized tax distribution than has been customary heretofore, so that the tax burden does not rest upon the little man, while the wealthy are assessed only for one thirtieth of their fortune. Vacant <span class="page-break">6</span>property must be taxed in the same proportion as improved land with buildings."</p>
   <p>The paragraph about the closing of all obnoxious saloons and places, Which Mr. J. Berger offered as an amendment, was not only adopted unanimously but one could see that the audience was, heart and soul, in favor of it. The last paragraph was offered jointly by Gen. Lieb and Joseph Suess, and it also met with general acclaim.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the platform, Mr. William Legner asked permission to speak:</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen: I am heartily in favor of these principles. I go Further. It is my opinion, that we name the man from whom we expect action in accordance to these views. Shall we, as candid German man, walk around the hot stew like the proverbial cat? Show your colors openly, undismayed, as befits genuine men! I am not an office seeker, either from Hesing or Harrison. I am a plain citizen, and consider myself as good a Democrat as any one, anywhere. But in one respect I am a practical politician after all. As you probably know, at one time I was driven into politics, quite against <span class="page-break">7</span>my will, and there I learned much from experience which has often been advantageous.</p>
   <p>It is absolutely necessary that our Germanity take a definite and positive stand in the forthcoming election. We Germans have built a foundation for our future political power through the election of Cleveland and Altgeld. Forward then! The work we commenced last November shall come to fruition and achieve its final glory through the election of Hesing for mayor! (Tempestuous applause.)</p>
   <p>"If we express our will in such a manner, then even the practical politicians will recognize us, and we will attain that political eminence in the Democratic party to which we are rightfully entitled.</p>
   <p>".... I am not particularly concerned with Hesing's success, but I always feel exhilarated whenever a German becomes especially prominent. Or does any one doubt, that Mr. Hesing is not the proper man for the mayoral office?(Vociferous answers: 'No, no!') "Hesing's courageous stand on the prohibition questions, his opposition to these teetotalers heightened my esteem for him and enhanced his value to my way of thinking. Is there any one among <span class="page-break">8</span>you, who is opposed to him? (Breathless silence.) "Again I shall challenge: Let us be honest and show our colors!" (Shouts of approval.) Hesing was nominated...</p>
