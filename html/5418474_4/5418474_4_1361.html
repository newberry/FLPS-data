   <p>No state, no national presidential convention ever witnessed a scene like yesterday's Democratic city convention at the Central Music Hall.</p>
   <p>Washington Hesing, although beaten at the convention, is greater today, commands more respect from his fellow-citizens, the better elements of the Democratic and Republican parties because hehad the courage to tell the assembly what he thought about their corruption.</p>
   <p>Regardless of how closely allied the Staats-Zeitung may be to Hesing, (Hesing was the editor of the above newspaper, Fransl.) it can make these statements and will be supported by everyone who was a witness to this singular occasion, where Hesing exposed the machinations of the "ward-heelers" and <span class="page-break">\2</span>bought delegates, before, withdrawing from the mayoral contest. Even his adversaries, after vainly trying to out-scream him for an hour, pay homage to the astounding fearlessness of this man who faced his antagonists, boldly told them the truth which bribable politicians of the Billy O'Brien, Capt. Farrell, Harry Donovan or Senator Patrick O'Bartling variety are not accustomed to hearing. That hour which Washington Hesing spent on the convention platform, oblivious of the animosity of a roaring mob, will always be remembered as one of the sensational events of our city's history.</p>
   <p>Washington Hesing could have been nominated. That he was not, under the existing conditions, is really fortunate; that he declined the nomination or rather any hints pertaining to it, enhances the public's esteem for his integrity. It has been discovered - now we shall quote a choice bit of little known history - that Hesing controlled more than 260 votes of the <span class="page-break">\3</span>convention; Harrison had 421 delegates but 94 were willing to bolt and go to Hesing upon certain conditions or form the nucleus for a third party. To the latter group belong the delegates from the Stockyards district, under the leadership of our sincere fullblooded Irishmen McInerney, Aldermen Kenny, Carey and Altgeld's trusted companion, Gahan. Furthermore, we must not omit certain delegates who had themselves elected, so that they were in a favorable position to do "business"; the delegates of the 10th ward under the guidance of Alderman Dorman and Jack Cullerton, as also the followers of Stanley Kuntz from the 16th ward. To buy them would have been somewhat expensive, - but what of it, Carter spent money lavishly. A well-known Democrat from the 11th ward, who is in a position to get inside facts, stated, that $20,000 had been spent in the 10th and 16th wards; and then, there are all the others still to be heard from.</p>

   <p>When Washington Hesing came to his office yesterday morning, some gentlemen were there to see him about a proposition. Its blunt essence was to buy some delegates and to make a deal with Cullerton from the North Side, Alderman John McGillen or Pat Duggan, McInerney's man, or Mike Bransfield, Dan Corkery's man. These were the stipulations.</p>
   <p>Washington Hesing was adamant and said most emphatically: "No. I'll not 'run' with a Bransfield or Duggan, and will not buy any of Carter Harrison's delegates, regardless of how corrupt they were and what methods they pursued to be elected. If the Democratic party can stand Harrison, so can I."</p>
   <p>At this juncture Washington Hesing resolved to do something extraordinary, a repetition of a heroic act he performed when a young man.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>We must now revert to the year 1874. It was at another Irish-Democratic convention. The intentions were to elect an infamous Irishman for sheriff. Hesing did what no candidate ever contemplated before. He mounted the platform of the Convention Hall and in strong words told the delegates, that in consideration of the despicable corruption practiced at the primaries, he refused to be selected by such a convention, even if he could obtain the nomination.</p>
   <p>Yesterday afternoon Harrison and Hesing entered the hall together amid a loud ovation from the assembly. Had Chairman Green known what an ill wind was about to blow, never would his consent have been given. Hesing stood in the glare of the foot lights and lectured on that loathsome topic: graft. It was unique. Undaunted, with no regard for any political future, in which Hesing has no interest, he faced the "gang," the ring of corrupt venal aldermen who controlled the convention, gave them a frank lecture <span class="page-break">\6</span>on their nefarious dishonest methods and, despite the howling, and screaming, Irish mob, made them like it. For an hour, a full sixty minutes, he spoke in an imperturbable and fearless manner until the bunch had to listen and realize that Hesing is not the man to pay homage to a rabble of the Billy O'Brien, Corkery, O'Mally, Donovan, Farrell or Bartling type.</p>
   <p>Hesing had barely spoken ten words when he mentioned "corrupt primaries," and pandemonium broke loose. What was this? A candidate who addressed a convention as a judge or plaintiff, who did not grovel abjectly to win the good will of Patsy? And the tumult did not cease, while Hesing's supporters cheered and were jubilant about this daring, unprecedented deed. Carter, fearful, lest his candidacy be jeopardized by these unveiled accusations, jumped on the table, tried to arouse the people for his own cause and divert attention from Hesing's scatling indictment. Hesing roared thunderously to the screaming mass which tried to silence him. Alderman John Yerkes Powers, <span class="page-break">\7</span>notorious 19th ward representative, the present manager of the Harrison party, stepped on the stage. He tried to have Hesing overruled. "Neither you nor anyone from your corrupt clique can remove me from this platform until I have spoken!" exclaimed Hesing in a stertorian voice. Ed. Cullerton, Harrison party commander of the 9th ward, came to the rescue of his friend, Carter. He, too, had to give way.</p>
   <p>Appealing to the Germans, Hesing ended his speech with the question: "What do you say to this infamy of the notorious Boss Farrell of the 22nd ward?"</p>
   <p>Prompted by this cue, Farrell made a deep, satirical, saturnine bow.</p>
   <p>A memorable speech!</p>
