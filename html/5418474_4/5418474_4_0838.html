It has the controllership and the fire marshal-ship. It is represented at the head of the building department and controls the nominal heads of the police and the public works departments, who feebly affect to represent the Anglo-American element.</p>
   <p>In the subordinate places also the Teutonic element is practically without representations; unless Ebersold, sugg and "Yamp" Cohen may be classed as representative German-Americans. The "ruling race" has crowded all others out.</p>
