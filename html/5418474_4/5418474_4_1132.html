   <p>The candidate of the Socialists, Dr. Ernst Schmidt, is well known and, in spite of his mixed political views (it now appears that he has been a regular dues-paying member of the Socialist party for [only] fifteen months), the gentleman possesses more personal friends and fewer enemies than any other eminent German in Chicago.</p>
   <p>One need hardly mention that neither he nor anyone else considers the possibility of his election, but his candidacy serves one purpose: All votes given him by friends who are not party members will thus be accredited to the Socialist fold--a harmless trick for which the party deserves no reproach, and which only shows that the third political party [Socialist] now "Knows the <span class="page-break">2</span>ropes" and is as familiar with political "hocus-pocus" as the other factions.</p>
   <p>If there were any chance to elect Dr. Schmidt, then we would suggest two "reforms" to make his administration effective: first, the day should be lengthened from twenty-four to forty-eight hours, and second, untwistable, unremovable iron buttons should be invented for people visiting the mayor. We hope the Socialists will not accuse us of despicable tactics and calumny in offering these suggestions; we mean well, and the gentleman who has been a member of the party for fifteen months will understand just what is meant thereby.</p>
   <p>The actual election involves only Wright and Harrison, the Republican and Democratic candidates. The presence of the third member has only one significance--it makes predictions about the outcome more uncertain. The Republicans will not have an easy time of it, and must be satisfied with a plurality of three or four thousand votes at the most.</p>
