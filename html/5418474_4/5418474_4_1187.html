   <p>The Chicago Incorporation bill will soon come to a vote in the House of Representatives. Concerning the assertion that Hesing favors the bill, because he hopes to become mayor of Chicago, Mr. Hesing says that nobody has the right to connect his name with that office; that he is hunting no office, and has given evidence of this by refusing four times the office of State Representative and by refusing in 1872 the nomination of vice governor - which in the meantime would have made him governor instead of Beveridge.</p>
