   <p>For many reasons it is not desirable that two Germans enter as applicants for the Mayor's office at the Democratic Convention, then if this happens, we can predict positively that neither will be nominated. The German who enters now as opposition candidate against Wenter, will by all thinking Germans be suspected that he works under false pretenses for Hopkins. Should the rumor that Governor Altgeld wants to push the new candidate (Dreyer) by publicity be based on truth, then the "Abendpost" can only advise Mr. Altgeld intimately to leave his fingers out of this pie.</p>
   <p>It would have been better, if is had remained in Springfield during the last election instead of coming to Chicago. As things stand now, the Governor must be continually defended. He certainly does not constitute an element of strength.</p>

   <p>The state of affairs demands positively that the truth is said openly and freely. A German candidate No. 2 would be eyed by most of the German plainly as a traitor.</p>
