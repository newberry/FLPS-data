   <p>Convincing proof against a dry Chicago is contained in the answer of Corporation Counsel Brundage, his reply to the questions propounded by Alderman J. Cermak at the last meeting of the City Council, wherein the financial aspect has been considered. Brundage asserted, among other replies that the Juul law would have to be recalled, to permit an increase in taxes; also a diminution in income, necessitate the discharge of many city employees. At Brand's Hall, Erie and Clark Streets, Mr. Brand, President of the United States Brewing Company, spoke about the social aspect of the prohibition question and the serious financial damage which would result, should the city become dry. He explained, that the professional agitators, hirelings of the Anti-Saloon League, will seek other fields when the propaganda against the liberals ceases. A large element which supports the League are the hysterical women, who consider themselves qualified guardians of everybody, they take an interest in everything, except their homes; and some employers, who believe that laborers will be satisfied with lower wages, if they are prevented from spending money for spiritous beverages, these are the supporters of prohibition. Besides we have the fashionable preaching reverends. I have true respect, added Mr. Brand, for those ministers who are concerned with the welfare of <span class="page-break">\2</span>their fellowmen but lately there has been a great increase of those spiritual advisers, who do not fulfill their mission, but intend to prescribe to the mayor and the city administration how to run the city. I must protest against this attempt to convert Chicago into a village. We admit, there are people who cannot control themselves in matters pertaining to drink. Shall hundreds of thousands, who have self-control, be compelled to abstain, to save a few? To protect these from poverty, 50,000 shall lose their bread and jobs. The meeting ended by admonishing all to register.</p>
