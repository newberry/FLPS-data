   <p>P. 4.. General Hermann Lieb... wrote to "The Open Court," a local periodical publication, in order to protect Governor Altgeld against the rantings of the Know-Nothing element. The Washington Post uses such vituperative terms as "Greenhorn" and "Henchman of Anarchists" in referring to this matter.</p>
   <p>The Washington Sentinel, Schade's paper, had a most appropriate reply: "Obviously this blast is the work of the Republican head of the Democratic Post. He and several editors of a similar tribe indulge in a war-whoop about the genus Greenhorn of late. It behooves us to give a little information to Mr. Hatton as he displays such a lack of knowledge.</p>
   <p>"Long, long, ago, when Hatton was a little urchin, playing with marbles in the streets of Burlington, Iowa, Hermann Lieb was fighting in the bloody battles of his adopted fatherland and as a sequence of his heroic conduct was honorably discharged at the end of the war with the title of Brigadier General. This much about Lieb, the "Greenhorn."</p>
   <p>"In regard to his anarchistic affiliations, suffice it to say, that he is an old conservative German-American Democrat, and one of the most capable Democratic speakers in the West. We suggest that the editors of the Post and other Know-Nothing papers peruse our American history - at least the period of the last 40 years. We mean well; it may be possible that thereby their empty heads may yet be cleansed of this indigenous conceitsdness and Know-Nothingism."</p>
