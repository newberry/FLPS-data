   <p>During the last meeting of the Brewers' Association (Brewers' Association), one of the members, Mr. Bemis expressed the opinion, that it should be the duty of one newspaper to protect and support the business attitude of all Chicago Brewers who are advertising a lot in all Chicago newspapers.</p>
   <p>In the first place we must call Mr. Bemis' attention to the fact that one newspaper cannot be bought or bribed with any payments for insertions. And therefore still today we maintain the standpoint that the price for beer from any Chicago brewery is too high in comparison with its quality.</p>
   <p>As far as we know, this the opinion of all Chicago residents, who so far did not have an opportunity to fight the price dictation from the Chicago breweries.</p>
