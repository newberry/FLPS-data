   <p>As soon as the two major parties, Democrats and Republicans, bring in their candidates at the City Hall, these chosen alderman are soon losing their political color...for good or evil. The powerful influence of private corporations and large business, the temptation of bribes and graft, also the selfish, individual ambitious, give the city council the aspect of several groups without any party lines.</p>
   <p>These groups are more concerned about the interests of their greedily selected financial bosses than about the welfare of their duped voters. Only at very rare occasions, do our brave councilmen show their party-colors, particularly when the public has been enlightened and enraged by some newspaper-editorial. This is the situation in the City hall, even if we have to admit, that these are some honest aldermen, who often have a hard stand in the bad crowd of fellow councilmen.</p>
   <p>This newspaper always has sponsored the Democratic party as the People's party "Honesty and clean Politics" should be the leading motto for all Democrats in the City hall. This means particularly our German-American Democratic <span class="page-break">2</span>Councilmen, who have brought with them from the old country a clean character and honest principles as a rule.</p>
   <p>All Germans of our community should do their utmost to encourage and back up their fellow-men in the city council, to be leading examples of sound morals, for the Good of All.</p>
