   <p>Many Democratic clubs, from the principal cities of United States, accompanied their delegates to the National Convention in Chicago. Enthusiastic Democrats and members of various clubs from all parts of the country, have come at their own expense. The Germans in Chicago, should take this commendable action into consideration. Such clubs or forums, where public opinions are clarified and trustworthy and competent men, to whose judgment we can entrust the nomination of electors, without fear and terror, are elected. Politics is a regulation of political economy for the welfare of all concerned, and this includes each and every citizen.</p>
   <p>It does not suffice to work and enjoy the profits. One ought to express his opinion about public affairs, which can be adjusted or regulated only by the will of the people. To ignore the duties of a citizen is not being loyal. Political questions of dispute can be understood by all, who are willing to listen.</p>
   
   <p>Neighborhood clubs and central organizations are as necessary for the discussion of political questions, as are churches for religious congregations. The Germans in Chicago need not fear that a German Democratic club would benefit only job-hunters. There is no prospect for political propaganda through mass-meetings among the Germans, because the numerous clubs, lodges, and unions intirely ignore political affairs. It seems that the Germans need no political education; and that they can trust the Irish and Americans completely.</p>
   <p>Political-social agitations are indispensible in arousing intellectual activities. This is especially true among the Germans, where Socialism, Anarchism and other strange theories are inculcated and advocated in their own publications. We have no political organization; although the German population is steadily increasing, advancing commercially; and maintains its own churches and schools. The candidate for governor, John P. Altgeld, deserves the full support of his German fellow-citizens. He has demonstrated the fact that he fully comprehends the problems of our time, and uses every effort to solve them.</p>
   
   <p>The Germans ought to organize clubs in their wards and towns, and send delegates to the central office where speakers will be appointed to discourse at their meetings.</p>
   <p>If the Germans wish to assert themselves politically, they must vote for German candidates. Altgeld is capable, indeed, of acting as governor of the State of Illinois.</p>
   <p>His financial condition is such, that he can spare something for political purposes, and can decline all political sources of income. It is difficult indeed to persuade well-to-do Germans to accept nominations, and make the efforts to pay the expenses of an election campaign. Therefore, the Germans should be as active in this campaign, as they were two years ago, when Raab was nominated.</p>
   
   <p>The Republican party has become worthless to the Germans in the Northwest. It is dominated by the monopolist and the exploiters.</p>
   <p>We request the Germans to agitate in their clubs and unions for the promotion of political meetings as they did two years ago, which resulted in the election of Raab, with a majority of 40,000 votes.</p>
