   <p>The bill for the creation of mortgage banks, in the English papers usually referred to as "Greenebaum's Bill", has been definitely killed in Springfield. That is an infamy against Chicago that can hardly be explained otherwise, than by the boorish hatred of the American yokels against everything initiated or supported by the Germans. These miserable Kaffirs would gladly have voted for the bill if it had originated with an American banker like Coolbaugh...</p>
   <p>In the interest of the owners of burnt-down homes, especially on the North side, we hope that Mr. Greenebaum will not give up his plan but will get a concession from the legislature of any other state where the nativistic prejudice is not as strong as in ours. To forbid a "mortgage bank" to be active in Illinois luckily our legislature has not the power, even though it may not lack the desire.</p>
