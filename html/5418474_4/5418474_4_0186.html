   <p>The convention of the Turn District, Chicago, passed yesterday two very important resolutions: First, to make an attempt to induce the three Chicago Turner Clubs: Chicago Turngemeinde, South Side Turngemeinde, and Central Turner Club - which belong to the Turn District, Indiana, to re-enter the District "Chicago." Second, to send a section of District Turners to the great Turner festival at Frankfort on the Main in the summer of 1908.</p>
   <p>The discussions were taken up at 10 A.M. yesterday under the Chairmanship of Dr. Hartung and came late in the evening to a conclusion. Present were 81 delegates. Not represented were Turner Clubs, Hammond, and LaSalle, Illinois.</p>
   <p>The question, who shall be recommended to the Mayor as representative on the School Board, was submitted to the Local Board.</p>
   <p>Delegate Paul Pause of the Social Turner Club made the following motion: "The convocation shall ascertain what party does come closest to the principles of the Turner League in the coming elections, for instance, in the feminist-movement - and shall ask the members to support this party."</p>
   <p>Immediately the addition was recommended that Turner Pause himself make these investigations and report at the next convention. But the joke is, that the election <span class="page-break">2</span>is held tomorrow, and the next convocation in spring.</p>
   <p>After a short discussion, the motion was laid on the table.</p>
   <p>Turner Dr. Backhusen mentioned that a new school on Belmont Ave. shall be named after the father of Turning, "Friedrich Ludwig Jahn" and that it may be proper that a bust of Jahn be offered to this school by the Chicago Turners. It was resolved to order the Local Board to find ways and means for the acquisition of such a bust, probably by making collections in the clubs.</p>
