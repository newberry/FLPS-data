   <p>At tomorrow's election, let no German voter fail to cast a ballot marked against "the banking law on a specie basis". This law is not founded on a "specie basis". The so-called Union Bank is not even required to have a single dollar in gold in its treasury. The words "on a specie basis" have been smuggled into the wording by the most corrupt of all legislatures in order to defraud the people. Down with the infamous bank law!</p>
