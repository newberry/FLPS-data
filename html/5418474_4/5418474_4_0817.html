   <p>During the seventies the Germans showed an exceptional interest in state politics and victory was achieved with the German vote; since that period their concern about the fate of the state has not particularly come into the foreground, but in this battle most of the Germans flocked to Altgeld under the banner of personal liberty and parental rights, to oppose the transgressions of a misused state power which is wielded by an antagonistic, anti-foreign element and flint-hearted fanatics.</p>
   <p>The Germans of Chicago and the entire state are being given the most scrupulous attention by both parties. Never before have the party leaders seen such demonstrations; what might rests in the German vote! The result of the present conflict will be the deciding factor for the political powers; for years to come fashioning and amelioration of administrative proceedings. The great masses, the majority of the Germans, the Democrats per se, most of the Independents, and thousands of Republicans are on Altgeld's side. If Altgeld wins, then the power of the Germans will have been splendidly vindicated. If he is defeated, then the Republicans will forsake them and explain that they can dispense with the Teutonic vote and the Germans must submit to still greater chicanery.</p>
   
   <p>So this fight in which the Germans are particularly involved, is not only a struggle for personal freedom, it also represents a competition for political dominance and position.</p>
   <p>Its importance has not been overlooked by Chicago's Germans. Weeks ago an enthusiastic assembly created the German Central Organization, clubs were formed in almost every ward which has a German populace, whilst the executives worked unobtrusively but efficiently. A few days ago the Finance Committee consisting of Messrs. Eugene Prager, Senator Thiele, John Ernst, Adam Ortseifen and Peter Biegler, to the leading German families...Chas. H. Wacker,... Washington Hesing, etc., (nineteen names are listed, altogether,) and others who will meet today at 4 P.M., at the Sherman House.... That the people throughout the state follow the German political regeneration with the profoundest interest, is evinced by the following letter sent to us from Peoria. Mr. John Endres wrote: "Peoria has a large percentage of Germans, most of whom are democrats. Although the city and county administration is Democratic, the Germans have only the smallest part in it.... We intend to organize an Altgeld, Cleveland, Stevenson Club, in order to give all possible support;....we wish to create the respect to which the Germans are entitled, commensurate to their strength.... Please send Club Bylaws... Resp. J. Endres."</p>
   
   <p>Such communications reach us almost daily and proves what one local German organization can accomplish, if its members are inclined to devote a little time and to sacrifice a few comforts for the cause.</p>
   <p>The impression which this movement has made on the Republicans is shown by the actions of the Republican Central State Committee which nominated a German Auxiliary Council yesterday. Whilst the German followers of Cleveland and Altgeld were able to create such an organization from among their own ranks, the Republicans of the Central Committee and their candidates who are not German, had to go far afield to build an Auxiliary. The names of the Germans who prefer Fifer to Altgeld have not yet been announced. This Auxiliary will nominate a large German Committee with a member from every ward and county district. A German campaign literature bureau was also brought into existence yesterday, with Eugene Seeger functioning as German secretary.</p>
   <p>The Auxiliary Council of the Democrats, whose Committee will meet Tuesday, has excluded newspaper publishers from its invitational list, so that it cannot be said, that the press intends to dictate the nominations. It has been practically agreed, that the "Non-Partisan Judicial Nomination Humbug" will be dispensed with, once and for all, and so the Auxiliary may nominate eighteen for the six judicial posts, Adolph Moses, George F. Sugg, Siegmund Zeisler are the German Candidates.</p>
   <p>The Republicans mostly favor party nominations. But, as they fear the disapprobation from some sections and certain newspapers if they vent their opinions publically, they give themselves the appearance of indorsing a "nonpartisan" ticket, and so instructed a committee to confer with the Democrats. If the Democrats should now make regular party nominations, then their adversaries believe the odium will revert to the Democrats. The latter however...will show that the best judges of Chicago...Altgeld and others, did not offer their candidacy on a Non-Partisan ticket.</p>
