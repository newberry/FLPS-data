   <p>The German Republican voters of Chicago have resolved to emancipate themselves from their Irish bosses, the trade and machine Politicians.</p>
   <p>The first steps have been taken last Saturday night at a meeting in the Grand Pacific Hotel, where about 60 to 70 representatives of the various wards were present, to form a central committee of the German Republicans in Cook County.</p>
   <p>It is intended to effect a proper representation and consolidation of the German element inside the party and to break with the dominating influence of the boss and the clique reign. The reports of the representatives of the various wards showed, that German Clubs were existing already in more than half of the wards represented. Dr. A. E. Eberts proposed that an agitation committee should be formed by all present, to organize the Republican voters of German descent in all wards and to prepare for the formation of a central committee. This proposal has been accepted and the next meeting, in which it was hoped to form the Central Committee is to take place Saturday, February 2nd, also in the Grand Pacific Hotel.</p>
