   <p>Several days ago there was a meeting of fifteen or twenty prominent German Lutherans to discuss the matter of issuing an open letter denouncing a paper called the Tageblatt, which pretends to be the organ of the German Lutherans. This sheet is published by Louis Wagner, a member of the Democratic County Central committee. Wagner had written an editorial belittling Judge Collins interview on the school question.</p>
   <p>The German Lutherans do not recognize the paper only as a local publication in Proviso and say it in no way represents them. They think Wagner is making political capital out of a matter which is a principle with them and that his only object is to benefit himself. While those at the meeting said they were in accord with Judge Collins, they do not want the question to become a political issue and would prefer it settled outside of politics.</p>
