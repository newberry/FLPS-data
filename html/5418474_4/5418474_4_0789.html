   <p>Ben Cable begged another Consulate today, without help from Senator Palmer, or the Congressmen although the names of some of those may appear on the paper. Otto Doederlein of Chicago, who is named as Consul to Leipsig, was one of Cable's lieutenants last fall in swinging the German Lutheran vote over to the Democrats. He has a family connection with the people who control "Die Rundschau."</p>
   <p>The Leipsig Consulate is a desirable one. The salary is $2,000 with perquisites in the way of fees. The selection of Doederlein, is looks upon as good politics because, it will show the Germans, who supported Cleveland, that their support is appreciated.</p>
