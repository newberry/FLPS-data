   <p>The Civil Service Commission will meet in session Thursday to discuss the case against Dr. Gottfried A. Koehler, who for many years has held the position of the first assistant in the Department of Health, in the city of Chicago. Because Doctor Koehler was regarded as a proficient official, executing his duties to the utmost satisfaction, the interest exhibited in this case by the Germans of this city, is of course, more than ordinary. The Department of Health has had many chief executives for many years. Doctor Koehler never did seek political influence in order to be retained as first assistant of that department. He is well known as a man who seeks no popularity, and as a man who always fulfilled his duty, thereby has become an important member of that institution. However, an announcement was made which followed closely this year's Mayoral election, that in the "interest of service" it became imperative to dispense with the services of Doctor Koehler. Since no indictment was forthcoming within the legal thirty day period, following his suspension, he has been re-installed, but dismissed again. After a lapse of three months, he was finally indicted on grounds of statistical falsification. Furthermore, he is accused of misleading other employees of the department in the pursuance of their duties. And lastly, he is accused of being the author of the supposed reports coming from the Department of Health, designed and sold for political purposes.</p>
   <p>Mystery is surrounding this case thus far. Therefore, we sincerely hope that a thorough investigation will soon be conducted by the Civil Service Commission. The German people wish to know the truth, and only the truth. They do not look forward to a modification of guilt, if Doctor Koehler should be found guilty. Nevertheless, the German people do expect an unprejudiced examination of the collected evidence, which must be free from political influence. Moreover, that in case of conviction, a just sentence should be imposed upon the transgressor of the law. This case has evoked the interest of the Abendpost, which will print the reports of the trial in detail.</p>
