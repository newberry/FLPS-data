   <p>Vagabond Mc Grath, has finally departed. The criminal Press, as that of the "Illinois-Staatszeitung", "The Tribune", "The Inter-Ocean" and others, who so willingly put themselves at the services of that swindler, are now, through the court's decision, unmasked, and known, as the protectors of crime. But the medal for such services, goes to the German newspaper, the "Illinois Staatszeitung" which has suffered a defeat.- Stauber has won in every instance, and the editors of the dishonest newspapers, as well, as the villians of the City Council, would have to blush, if they were not accustomed to dishonesty.</p>
   <p>We want to mention the names of the men, who deserve great credit, in bringing about justice. To that group belong all the witnesses summoned by court, first of all Stauber, Peter Peterson and Lawyer Prendergast.</p>
   <p>Owing only to the excellent work of Mr. Prendergast, it was possible, during a year's time, to go into the details of the case, and expose the technical tricks of their opponents.</p>

   <p>The Stauber-Mc Grath case, has uncovered the corruption of the City Council, and that of the capitalistic Press, and unveiled also the sacrifices made, and the perseverance of the Socialists. It was a case, by which we have learned much and have won much also.</p>
