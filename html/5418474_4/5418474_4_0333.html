   <p>Are the local Republican Germans so few in number or so poor, that in order to listen to an outside German speaker, they have first to reach an agreement with the Anglo-American Central Committee concerning money matters? The funds needed by a party should be provided by the free contributions of its members. If the German Republicans do not want to be considered as mere auxiliary troops in the pay of the American Republicans, they must learn to open their own purses. Two years ago, Hecker received for his speech against the Republicans $300. Since then, prices have gone down. Thus, if a speech can be secured for a few hundred dollars, the German Republicans, having Mr. George Schneider as their leader, should be able to arrange matters without having to run to the American committee to beg for financial assistance.</p>
