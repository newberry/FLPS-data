   <p>Some Democratic politicians of Chicago seen to think that they can govern their party only by a strong machine. They intend to form a club, which will not only work for the organization of the party during election time but will tighten the party up during the whole year. Whatever might be their original idea, they may be assured that Chicago is not the field for an association like the famed Tammany Hall. Here the German votes will turn the scale and they do not consider the promises and the jobs, they are only anxious about the welfare of the country. They will support the Democratic party as long as their principles are good but will leave them as soon as they start to trade their principles for selfish interests. A ring inside the Democratic party will not be permitted in Chicago.</p>
