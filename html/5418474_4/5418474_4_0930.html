   <p>p. 4.. If there is a madder man than Boss Hesing over the defeat of the Hesingite bummers and political desperadoes in the recent charter election, that madder man is Philosopher Josef (Hesing). The Philosopher has given strict orders to all his "cub" philosophers not to write a word for the philosophic organ that looks, sounds, or even remotely implies that an election was held last Friday.</p>
   <p>The Philosopher positively refuses to know anything about such an event, and forbids any of his literary "cubs" to know, hear, think, or guess anything about it, on pain of instant dismissal. It is already a case of willful and premeditated ignorance, induced by the unquenchable wrath of a disappointed champion of philosophy and the disreputable Hesing Ring scheme to commit Chicago to the hands of a gang of Tammany thieves.</p>
