   <p>Praise goes to the "Lehr and Wehrverein" for their stand, by insisting that, before the 4th of July Festival, a judge has to decide upon the constitutionality of the Militia's law, which went into effect July 1st.</p>
   <p>A company of ten men, under the leadership of Captain Bielefeld of the 12th Street Turnhalle left at 10 o'clock last night fully equipped with weapons and ammunition, to practise in the street. On his return to the Turnhalle be was arrested by Police-Lieutenant Callaghan.....</p>
   <p>As Judge McAllister's ruling, in the case of the Bohemian Sharp-shooters was, that the, officer in charge is responsible for the action of his men, the rest of the Lehr and Wehrverein's men could go free.</p>

   <p>Men, free of prejudice will agree that it is an insult to the constitution, which permits every man to carry weapons. No rightful judge, reaching the "Lehr and Wehrverein's" license, could decide on anything but, that it is the Society's right to carry weapons. Paragraph 2 of the license reads: "The Society's duty is, to develop mental and physical qualifications of their members, and thus enable them to exercise their duty as good citizens, that the member should get acquainted with the law and political economy, and practice military and gymnastic drilling.-</p>
   <p>As long as the license has not been revoked, no state law can stop the Society from military drilling, furthermore, no rightful judge will decide against them.</p>
