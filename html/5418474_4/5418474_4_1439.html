   <p>We figured out that the income of the present Sheriff Kanute R. Matson, besides his wages of $6,000 per year, amounts to about $54,000 annually or a total of $60,000.</p>
   <p>This means that the taxpayers of Cook County pay to Mr. Matson besides his salary $10,549.45 for feeding the prisoners.</p>
   <p>We can see that this sheriff lacks nothing and need not be worried about his job. If he should fail to get re-elected after his four year term he will retire with an easily acquired fortune of about $200,000.</p>
   <p>He will have the satisfaction of being honored and praised by the friends of his former prisoner, ex-Chief of Police McGarigle who disappeared from the Hotel Matson to the great joy of two thirds of Chicago's prominent residents.</p>
   <p>If you add to the bad and insufficient food, the dirt in the county jail as well as the fact, that the musty air is filled with fever miasmas from defective drain pipes you must come to the conclusion that the imprisonment for any length of time in such a place is not only a punishment but a torture disgraceful to all citizens of Cook County.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>At present the country jail is nothing more than a breeding place for disease, where all interest in life and reformation of character and spirit is broken down, unless you happen to have some friends who provide you with healthful food and means of amusement.</p>
