   <p>In the 1st ward we have Somers, an Englishman, and Knickerbocker, an American;</p>

   <p>Of our forty aldermen, therefore, two are English, seventeen American, thirteen Irish and only 8 Germans. As regards the influence of the Germans aldermen it might be mentioned that only in four of the twenty committees Germans preside. These are the Judicial Committee (Schintz), the Committee for Streets and Alleys on the North side (Schmidt) the Committee for Harbours and Bridges (Busse) and <span class="page-break">3</span>and the Committee for Markets (Battermann). In the most important of all Committees that for finance, is just one German, Buhler; in the next most important, that for justice, likewise only one, Schintz.</p>
