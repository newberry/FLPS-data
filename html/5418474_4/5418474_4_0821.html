   <p>The Republican State Executive Committee, had an important session yesterday morning. At the informal meeting the day before, the necessity for campaign literature in the German language, was strongly dwelt upon and a committee discussed the ways and means for procuring and distributing the same. It is probably certain that a German newspaperman will be employed as assistant secretary to attend to the preparation and distribution of documents dealing with the subject at issue in the campaign, especially the school question.</p>
