   <p>Everyone knows that since the beginning of the election fight the English-speaking press has fought the opposition party and A. C. Hesing with misrepresentations and lies. That it deceives its readers is for instance evinced by the the fact that it omits completely to mention such magnificent meetings as the one in the Vorrv√§rts Turher Hall.</p>
   <p>But one would not expect a newspaper to be so insolent and mean as to refuse to print an answer concerning events which were grossly misrepresented and for which answer Mr. Hesing was willing to pay the regular advertising rate.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Joseph Medill has done that. What an insolence and cowardice: The hypocrites from Farwell Hall and their ally, Medill, will try to ruin the honor and good name of a man, but are so conscious of their own hypocrisy that they will deny their opponent the opportunity to defend himself either orally or by writing. Joseph Medill, by refusing to print Hesing's answer, confesses that he is an impostor and a liar.</p>
