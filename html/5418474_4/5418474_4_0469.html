   <p>The sudden alarm which sways the American people now, the result of the preparedness question, created a general change in sentiment which in some instances amounts to hysteria. Such occurrences, however, are common here, which is rather unfortunate.</p>
   <p>This is mostly due to the respectable press, which should use cool judgment and ascertain the facts in the right manner before submitting them to the public. If the American newspapers would mind their business instead of running after sensations and steeping their readers in excitement, much foolishness would be averted and considerable expense avoided.</p>
   
   <p>At present sensationalism revolves around the insufficiency of our national defense. Why the hysteria? What changed our position in world affairs so suddenly that we have to worry? To answer the question the truth is that nothing affects our position, for both oceans separate us from foreign lands as of yore, not a yard more or less. Germany thus far made no attempt to annex Canada or Mexico, and the prospect of the Teutons becoming a dangerous neighbor is simply nonsense.</p>
   <p>To the contrary, the present world outlook shows, as any intelligent person knows, that if the World War ends in victory for Germany, it would not affect our position in the least. Hence, an overhurried heterogeneous preparation is uncalled for. Out status is the same as before the conflict; if anything, vastly better, because this struggle will checkmate our real and most dangerous enemy, England, for a long time. The imaginary adversary, Germany, we need not fear, nor a successful Germanism for that matter. And in regard to our trans-Pacific opponent, Japan, no change can be perceived there. Why the deliberate, artificial anxiety? Keep cool! But this does not signify that we should remain inert and continue in our accustomed slipshod manner. A good provider puts his house in order long before the winter storms create havoc.</p>
   <p>Preparedness is necessary, but it must be attained in a calm, sensible manner. Si vis pacem, para bellum [If you desire peace, be prepared for war], said the old Romans. Germany acted accordingly and thus protected home and hearth from the torch wielding, murderous hordes of numerically superior powers. We should and must act accordingly.</p>
   <p>Our army should be able to protect our land against an invasion. But can it present an adequate defense? Unanimously, no. Well, then we shall strenghhen, increase, and reorganize our defenses until the goal is attained.</p>
   <p>A lot of suggestions are offered which circulate quite freely. One in particular, the problem of a Continental Army, proved a stumbling block to Garrison, Secretary of War; he fell. Should we increase our Army to 500,000 men? What about a universal military service? Would it be advisable to place our State militia, the National Guard, under direct Federal control?</p>
   <p>These are the predominating questions. But the first and most important is the undeniable necessity of an army fully capable of providing proper protection. Our regular Army consists of approximately 87,000 men and nearly 5,000 officers. The State Militia has about 25,000 members, with an additional 4,000 officers in round numbers. Thus we have a total of 120,000 men and 9,000 officers,more of less. Somewhat surprising, however, is the ratio of officers to men in so far as the militia is concerned; only 25,000 soldiers, yet we have almost as many "commanders" in the regular Army. The reasons are known. Reforms are urgently needed here.</p>
   <p>It is the President's prerogative to impress the National Guard into service for a nine-month period, if the occasion warrants it; but otherwise, regardless of its name, this force is under the control of the separate states. This is a serious mistake, which becomes most apparent when one considers the official aspect. The regular Army and National Guard (State Militia) should be a homogeneous body; our present distinctions ought to be eliminated. The general training of the Army and Militia must be conducted in a more serious, regular and comprehensive manner. To play soldier, for the sake of display, is not within the realm of the States.</p>
   <p>Of course, the most suitable reform would be compulsory military service for all. It would end that certain odiousness which we unfortunately attach to the uniform. It is common knowledge that the American soldiers' uniform does not evoke much respect as is the case in Germany. One notes often enough, especially in the more elite social circles, that a state's regalia is not considered a desirable emblem. Some invitation cards proclaim the dictum, "Please do not appear in uniform." Strange conception! If a German officer leaves his "insignia" at home, then it is entirely due to certain circumstances, such as a meeting at a Berlin maison d'amour, where he might enjoy himself unreservedly with the girls. But if a soldier of rank dares appear at some gathering attired in the customary civilian fashion, then his host would regard it as a mortal insult. Everybody in Germany honors and loves the uniform of the country's defenders.</p>
   <p>But where and how did the American attitude originate? It is a product of the system. The American soldier is a professional, a hireling. He serves for money. Then comes the rather opprobrious but well-known fact that certain elusive elements endeavor to avoid the far-reaching arms of ambitious sheriffs, and thus seek refuge and security by enlisting. Even American judges share this view and offer the choice of jail or army life to a culprit. This abnoxious idea must be eradicated. Military badges are not akin to the night-watchman's identification tag. The soldiers' garb represent honor; permission to wear it confers great distinction. Therefore, universal military service! Every young American should feel elated and proud if he is found acceptable and permitted to join the defenders of the Nation. Abroad, the rejected recruits are given the sympathetic sarcastic appellation of government cripples. Not very elegantly expressed but it shows the public sentiment and characterizes it most eloquently.</p>
   <p>Then we might continue with additional reforms. Two years of service and five years in the reserves. The militia under National control. After all, why do we call it a National Guard? This Governmental jurisdiction is of particular significance so far as the officers are concerned. In this manner we can obtain an army which is fully prepared and at a resonable cost; yet it will be able to solve the vital problem.</p>
