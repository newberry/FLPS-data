   <p>The proceedings and the end of the Granady trial were equally sensational. Frank J. Loesch, as representative of the state's attorney, asked to have the case nol-prossed, and Judge Joseph B. David, who originally desired such a procedure, changed his mind at the last moment, but nevertheless granted the request.</p>
   <p>The jurors were asked for their opinion before the witnesses had given their final testimony--a rare procedure indeed--and the members of the In Coram Paribus realm declared that the accused, Police Lieutenant Carroll, was not guilty of the murder of Granady, the colored candidate for city alderman.</p>
   <p>The trial was an unusual spectacle, even in Chicago where bizarre judicial <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>actions are no singular occurence. The judge denounced the witnesses testifying for the prosecution. He called them deliberate liars and declared repeatedly that if a verdict of guilty were forthcoming, he would bar it, since he did not give any credence whatsoever to the evidence. Special Prosecutor Loesch reproached the judge for his unseemly, insulting conduct.</p>
   <p>Each daily session was fraught with one or more sensations of its own. The ranting of the tempestuous judge and of the no less irate state's attorney could be heard far beyond the confines of the courtroom. The jury, twelve men good and true, had to be repeatedly excluded, as judge and prosecutor became embroiled in bitter controversies.</p>
   <p>The trial had barely ended, when the Chicago Bar Association resolved to <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>investigate the affair. Judge David declared that any kind of an investigation would suit him. Instantly, rumors arose ascribing this inquiry to political enemies, iniquitous party politicians, who had a bone to pick with, and were inimical to, Judge David.</p>
   <p>For the present at least, the final momentous incident revolves about Prosecutor pro tem Loesch's declaration. He avowed that the conclusion of this trial also marks his withdrawal as a public official from all cases where murderous and corrupt party politicians are involved.</p>
   <p>These happenings and facts provide food for thought for our citizens. New conclusions, laboriously derived, are unnecessary here; it is merely a matter of reviving old impressions. Long ago, the war against the criminal, political element in Chicago was inaugurated with much ado and with a great fanfare. An infinite amount of litigation and prolonged investigation ensued. The citizens <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>were fed with daily assurances that the sinister characters were smitten and were grovelling in the dust. Then came repeated promises that all guilty higher-ups would soon dangle, with gurgling throats, from the gruesome gallows.</p>
   <p>What Happened? A few miscreants, not, however, the most infamous ones, were given lenient sentences. The outstanding crimes--the murder of Granady, the squandering of millions by various administrative bodies and persons who, to put it mildly, enjoyed the trust of the public and gained eminence thereby while wallowing in ill-gotten wealth--went unpunished.</p>
   <p>The Granady trial presents a typical case of judicial procedure. The various incidents, the conduct of the chief personages are of little importance as a whole. The essential feature is the ending. Granady was shot in the presence of scores of witnesses on the street, but to this day the murderers are <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>unknown. The deed is unavenged, and apparently is destined to remain so.</p>
   <p>To forthwith ascribe these conditions to definite persons entrusted with apprehending crooks is not easily possible. Incontestable evidence is required. Besides, our corrupt politicians are too firmly intrenched and far too mighty to be routed in a day or two. But here was a starting point.</p>
   <p>When one considers the events since the last election, insofar as they concern the state's attorney, then the fact is vividly brought out that real accomplishments have hardly been realized. This does not imply that the various so-called leaders in the fight against crime lacked genuine intentions or adequate enthusiasm. But thus far they have been unsuccessful in establishing their ideas on a practical basis. They could not clean out those dismal, turbulent areas, habitat of a soulless fraternity <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>which is not deterred by compunctions or by such inconsequential trifles as corpses, when money is at stake.</p>
