   <p>The last months of the disastrous Washburne administration appear to be dedicated - involuntarily, of course - to the commendable purpose of uncovering the prevalent corruption to public view. The disclosures of the last few days and weeks reveal an alarming situation. At the city water department such a criminal negligence and despotism exists that it has cost the taxpayers millions of dollars, besides the salaries of a horde of superfluous inspectors and assistants. What corruption was revealed in the department of the maintenance of streets and sidewalks:</p>
   <p>It reminds one of the worst period of the Tweed administration in New York. Although it was proven that contractors had not only done their</p>
   
   <p>work very badly, but had charged for four to five time more than they had really finished; yet their bills were paid by order of the Commissioner of Public Works, or the Superintendent of Streets, or by order of the mayor himself. In this department are many subordinate officials, who seemingly have no other duties than to shut their eyes, and receive their salaries plus tips for keeping their eyes shut. Large sums are spent for cleaning streets which have really not been cleaned at all. The city's water department exempts well-to-do people from paying millions of dollars for water delivered. And in other departments hundreds of thousands of dollars are wasted in order to enrich some favored contractors. And how much did the officials receive? - for the people could not be defrauded without their consent and direct assistance. It is unquestionably true that they demanded reciprocal service; some in the form of hush-money, others in the form of contributions to the party treasury, and again in the form of some political support for other cliques.</p>
   
   <p>Whoever lends his assistance to thievery, demands his share.</p>
   <p>We may look forward to other exposures, because the beginning has been made, and others will follow. But what good is accomplished by these exposures, when the strong will to reform is not there? If Mayor Washburne had a spark of independence, he could have demanded the resignation of those officials, whose corruption and criminal negligence of their duties made such conditions possible. Above all, he would have requested Commissioner Aldrich to resign, because during his whole term he did nothing else than to promote his election to Congress, at the expense of the city. But we cannot expect such determined action from Mayor Washburns.</p>
   <p>It is therefore improbable that improvements can be expected before the first of May, when a new mayor enters upon his duties, provided, of course, he is a man who not only has good intentions, but also possesses the power to throw out the whole gang of dishonest contractors and inspectors.</p>
