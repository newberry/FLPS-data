   <p>Campaign speakers for political parties are now being paid according to their celebrity and ability. This action followed a number of unfortunate experiences with "stump" speakers.</p>
   <p>The Democrats are lacking German speakers very badly. Not even old General Sigel is available this time.</p>
   <p>Formerly so warlike, he feels now that he has no influence whatever, and states therefore that his job as Pension Agent does not leave him any time for stump-speeches.</p>
   <p>The compensation ranges from $200 to $300 per speech. Carl Schurz demanded $500, the same amount Bob Ingersoll, the Free Thinker, receives from the Republicans who engaged him in this campaign. The deal with Carl Schurz was postponed until his return to America and as this wont be until November, according to the latest news, it is not very likely that he will appear on any of the speakers' platforms in this campaign.</p>
