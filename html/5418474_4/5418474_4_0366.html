   <p>A well attended meeting was held in the Archer Road Hall, the owner of which is Mr. Adam Sohn.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Koch called the meeting to order. Mr. F. Schlund addressed the assembly and pointed out that in serious times like the present it is necessary to forget all local and party differences or interests and to keep in view that which is most important to America, namely, the preservation of the Union.</p>
   <p>"History teaches us that victories have been won only by concentrating the united efforts of patriots upon one and the same object," declared Mr. Schlund. "Thus Germany once accomplished great things, and only thus did Garibaldi recently attain the unity of Italy.</p>
   <p>"The Union of our adopted country will also be preserved if all men, regardless of their political, social, or religious affiliations, unite in defending our <span class="page-break">2</span>United States."</p>
   <p>He recommended that the resolutions accepted January 14, at the organization of a Union Club at the Metropolitan Hall, be adopted by those present as fundamental paragraphs of the constitution of a club. A committee was then elected to frame a constitution and to submit it to prospective members for adoption.</p>
   <p>The report of the committee was accepted after some minor details had been altered.</p>
   <p>Then the constitution of the Union Club of the South Side was submitted for signatures, and the following persons were elected officers: F. Schlund, president; John F. Koch, secretary; Ludwig Bachale, treasurer.....</p>
   <p>Adjournment followed.</p>
