   <p>The confirmative official news has been received concerning the pardon of A. C. Hesing. According to a telegram from Washington, the official disposition of the case has been postponed until the return of Taft from Ohio, where he went  to make a few campaign speeches.</p>
   <p>A telegram received by Washington Hesing from a Washington friend says: Taft says that he may not tell me. This makes it certain. Official silence, I believe, prevents him; the pardon is, in any case, assured.</p>
