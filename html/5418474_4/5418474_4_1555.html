   <p>The first public meeting of the Jefferson Club was held yesterday, at Greenbaum's bank building. About four hundred people were present, among them....A. C. Hesing.....[Translator's note: Several German names appear, but only the German speaker is mentioned, as we are concerned with no others.]</p>
   <p>.....The council of the Club has control of the organization in all political matters. A quorum of thirty-five shall constitute executive action.....Colonel Arno Voss recommended that the committee [of eleven] should also nominate the city officials.....</p>
   <p>The chairman nominated the following persons as members of the committee:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>....Washington Hesing, Hermann Lieb, Henry Greenebaum....[Translator's note: Altogether eleven names appear but only the German committee nominees are given here.]</p>
   <p>A. C. Hesing was the next speaker. He said that he was proud to see so many intelligent faces. He believes that politics have entered upon a new era. While he entertains this hope, he does not regret the Government's two-billion-dollar debt. He is proud that he helped save the flag. He does not care to speak about Democrats or Republicans, but he will always be glad to shake hands with those who risked their lives for the unity of the nation. He can safely predict that none of the gentlemen who were opposed to the war[Civil War]when it became necessary, will ever be in power again. He is not a Republican any longer, but he is not an Ohio Democrat, either. After the Democratic Convention....rejected the sound money platform and adopted an inflation plank, it became difficult to speak of the "Democratic" party. If the National Convention of 1876 acts in the same way, he does not wish to be associated with the party. The country demands sound money. He agrees with the <span class="page-break">\3</span>preceding speaker in wanting no class legislation; he does not want to be told what to believe, what to wear, eat, or drink.</p>
   <p>What he desires, and what the Club's platform stands for, is reform: opposition to the unlimited squandering and corruption which is everywhere present, in town, city, county, state, and government.</p>
   <p>"Why does the government try at times to limit corruption? Because it sees the writing on the wall and knows that this is the only way to save itself.</p>
   <p>"It is true, of course, that labor suffers; but is it democratic to speak constantly about the rights of labor and then deny them the simple pleasures which their poverty permits?" (This is a reference to the fact that the previous speaker, Dr. Davis, was a well-known advocate of temperance.)</p>
   <p>The speaker then continued on matters of policy. "Adopt a platform of economy, <span class="page-break">\4</span>honesty, and sound currency and let the past rest. Half of those I see here were Republicans like myself and do not wish to be isolated. I never voted Democratic; I am glad to have belonged to the Whig party, but I do not think it timely to rake up the past. If the former rebel soldiers are greeted so cordially in Boston, then it is time to forget the past.</p>
   <p>"It is not for us to find out how the debt was created [Civil War debt] but we must find out how to pay it, and that can only be done with economy and honesty."</p>
   <p>In closing, the speaker urged his audience to abide by the Club's platform and to forget all former differences. He....was given enthusiastic applause.</p>
   <p>Long John was the next speaker.....</p>
