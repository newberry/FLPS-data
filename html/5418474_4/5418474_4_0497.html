   <p>The Anti-Saloon League, the fighters in the front ranks of the prohibition elements, published today their recommendations for the legislature. Of the 800 candidates for Congress, only 112 were found deserving the support of the League, Of these candidates 21 are from Chicago and Cook County, among them are 19 Republicans and Democrats. Apparently the League considers the candidates from Chicago as hopeless material since only 21 of the 73 have been indorsed. In spite of this, the League is hoping that sufficient candidates will be available at the next election, as the State -Superintendent, Mr. J. K. Shields declared to-day, to insure the acceptance of the local-option law.</p>
   <p>Two factors determined the selection of candidates acceptable to the League. Only those candidates are being supported, who have proved their loyality to the League by their previous record or who have promised to take a definite stand for the endeavors of the League. Of this kind there are two candidates to be mentioned in particular, who reside in overwhelmingly German districts....</p>

   <p>The following is a list of candidates which are considered as hopeless by the League. In so far as political matters are concerned, the League became likewise a subject of interest. In the camp of the Republicans it was so quiet after the recent storm, that it aroused suspicion. Evidently both sides prepared for the battle.</p>
   <p>The consolidated Prohititionists of the Anti-Saloon League and the Chicago Law and Order League submitted a petition to the Board of Election to-day, to permit the removal of these names, which have been illegally recorded on the voters list.... They asserted that a thorough investigation of the names and addresses recorded on the list as legitimate voters of the first ward, 902 of them could not be found at their respective addresses.</p>
