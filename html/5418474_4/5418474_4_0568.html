   <p>The Chicago Tribune, in an article yesterday, tries to clear itself on the reproach that it does agree with the abstract monopolists by trying to make its readers believe, that behind the assignment given the Recorder - the lawfully installed officer - for completion of the abstract books a "job", an impure business, was being urged, this is clearly nonsensical, for the Recorder could gain no other advantage from this assignment that perhaps an increase of its political influence by hiring more office help. It is the other side, the one represented by the Tribune, the side of Mr. Simmons, former partner and present agent of the abstract monopoly firm, that expects to garner large profits by the abolition of the county competition. From a dependable source, we hear that a considerable sum of money is deposited in order to make the county fathers more compliant. It is said the amount was $15,000. What the Tribune was promised for its assistance, we do not know. It supports every robbery of the public, just as it once recommended giving the franchise of the right of way for 99 years to the street car companies, for what cause and reasons, it best knows itself. The Citizen's Association also recognizes that the sale of the abstract books to Simmons would be a great economic mistake and has lodged an energetic protest through its representative.</p>
