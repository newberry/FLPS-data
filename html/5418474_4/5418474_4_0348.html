   <p>Tax inspector and mailman Francis Rodmann convoked yesterday a meeting in the restaurant of Fritz Frillmann, in order to organize the Republican Party of the North side.</p>
   <p>Mr. Barker, candidate for the legislature, described the sufferings of the negro in the south.</p>
   <p>Rodman as next speaker said he would like to talk about a man who claims to be a friend of the laboring class, but who isn't, namely A. C. Hesing. A man who drives every Sunday to Lincoln park in a stolen coach..... This was the end of Rodmann's speech and of the meeting. The majority of the assembly cried out: "You rascal, no calumny. Every one knows that A. C. Hesing's coach is a gift."</p>
   <p>During the ensuing confusion the meeting was adjourned.</p>
