   <p>p. 2- Mr. H.H. Kohlsaat's plan: "An attempt should be made to perform most of the labors which have been authorized by the City Council, that is, make the improvements which have been covered by special taxes and assessments; above all, this should be done immediately. As far as I know, there is enough work available to last for five years, at an estimated cost of $11,000,000, and if this is attended to at once, then 2000-3000 people will find employment!"</p>
   <p>A large part of the special taxes has already been collected by the City treasurer. Mr. Kohlsaat suggested that a committee be appointed to investigate this angle and give a report by next Monday. His proposition was accepted, and Messrs. J. Lombard, Pres. of the Real Estate Exchange, J. Badenoch and J. K. R. Van Cleave, were nominated to form this committee.</p>
   <p>Another suggestion by Mr. Kohlsaat will undoubtedly also be accepted. He proposed that the assessments be paid in 20% installments.</p>
