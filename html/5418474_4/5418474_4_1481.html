   <p>In a column long article the "Tribune" this morning writes about the citizen's demonstration of last Monday evening. It calls this wrongly a communistic one and states, that the council has been intimidated by same. There is every reason to fear such demonstrations.</p>
   <p>Experience teaches that the communists are very quick with fire, murder and slaughter. Only a passionately spoken word last Monday was necessary to sow the seed of discontent amongst the crowd and incite same to deeds of force. Surely everything would not have gone so calmly if the thunder storm which came up abruptly and unexpectedly had not created a calming influence on the hated tempers. Such intimidations against the authorities as they had been enacted last Monday should under no circumstances be repeated. Lawful measures should be taken to keep the Communists away and to prevent in the future similar demonstrations, as with following ones it surely will come to forcible acts.</p>
   <p>That in short is the contents of the long article of the "Tribune". The main statement is an absolute lie as the capitalistic papers cannot exist without lies. It is against their inner nature to state the truth. The demonstration <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>indeed was no Communistic one and has been enacted directly by the people, caused by the oppressions of their free election rights. The "Tribune" did know this as the control committee of the Chicagoer Socialistic Party of the working people in their last meeting expressively declined all responsibility for the taking place of the demonstration, as same cannot be considered as a measure of the Parts. Notwithstanding this openly made publication of the resolution of the Socialist Central Committee, the "Tribune" with their accustomed habit for lies, brands this demonstration Communistic.</p>
   <p>With reference to their talk about murder, fire and slaughter intended by the protesting citizens, this is very much nonsense. The demonstration has been made with a very peacable intention. Torches are no spears or swords. The whole manner of the participants of the demonstration must explain to everybody that the first object of the protesting citizens was to prevent repetition of the oppression of the free Electorial right of the people and to warn to guard in future for forcible acts.</p>

   <p>Where are the so-called thoughts for incendiary murder and slaughter: It is indeed true that the guilty conscious Alderman in the presence of the armed masses of the people became afraid. That was right and was as it should be. It had to be brought to the conscience of the scoundrels that the people could not be oppressed constantly. It is also without doubt, that the protesting citizens would have set a forcible example for the politicians if they would have been refused a hearing and denied the right to present their wishes to the council in a peaceable way. Could the municipal criminals expect a milder and more humane treatment from the insulted and ridiculed citizens? Has it not been humane and Christian like to pardon those scoundrels, who belong on the gallows or in the Bridewell, on the condition that they make good their crimes? Indeed the crooked politicians in the council would not have acted so humane and patient as did the protesting citizens last Monday at the Townhall if they had been in their places.</p>
   <p>What else remains for the oppressed to do if all peaceable ways are exhausted to procure their rights than to use force?</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>If there is no way of peace, to get one's right, then there only remains War!' The fathers of the Republic laid down the Immortal Motive in the Declaration of Independence. This Republic has been built up on the same. Can the citizens of Chicago destroy the most important of all popular foundations? he "Tribune" wants to induce them to do so representing as a lust for incendiarism, murder and slaughter the intention of our citizens to maintain the most sacred laws of our Constitution, the free Electoral right and to defend same if necessary by force.</p>
