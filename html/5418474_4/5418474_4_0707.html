   <p>Alderman McCauley asks us to correct our interpretation of his Motion regarding the creation of a large railroad depot on the North Side. He says it is not the question of a freight yard, but of a central passenger depot, which instead of harming the North Side would contribute to its quick reconstruction. The strong influx of tourists would become the foundation for the reconstruction of a great numbers of shops, and the value of real estate in the burnt residential districts would be increased.</p>
   <p>As far as these are the intentions of Alderman McCauley they are praiseworthy. If however, the passenger depot would not be followed, by the freight yard is another question. We had better harbor no illusions; there exists among the rich citizens of the South Side the intention to make the North Side into a district of freight, Mills, lumber, and grain elevators; to squeeze out the middle strata and to leave at best a proletariat a la Bridgeport. Impudently the Chicago Times begins its first article after the fire with the words: "The reconstruction of Chicago means the rebuilding of the South Side." Such is the situation, citizens of the North Side. All your zeal, all your energy, and the poignant consciousness that the existence of Chicago as a German city is at stake, are needed to prevent the debasement of North Chicago to a suburb of South Chicago.</p>
