   <p>The same impertinence which was shown of the Republican party last fall has now been adopted by the Democrats. It may be recalled, that the Republicans selected Hertz as coroner. He was a Scandinavian and they tried to pass him off as a "German." Following this precedent, the Irish Democrats now claim that Charles Gastfield, a young clerk at the city hall is good enough for us, as Germans go; if the "Dutchmen" are not willing to consider him as one of their representatives, well and good. We select your candidates, and we are the masters.</p>
   <p>Gastfield never considered himself as a German. He is Teutonic in the sense of the Chase's, McGillen's and Powers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The Germans do not know him, and will not consider him as a German, because he never had any connections which entitle him to that claim.</p>
   <p>There is not one German on the West Side town ticket, but instead there are three Irishmen and an antagonistic Bohemian! The North Side town ticket is overloaded with the Irish, and a Jim Crawford on top of it!</p>
   <p>Not a German on the city ticket: And Carter above all! That's the soup which is served to the Germans, a suitable reward for last fall's service. Congratulations:</p>
