   <p>All German Republicans, who, in these times of intended compromise and "great concessions," still adhere to the principles of the Republican party as embodied in the Chicago platform, are requested to meet Tuesday, January 8, the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans, in the hall of the German House. This meeting is being held in order to give the German Republicans an opportunity to express their opinions on the present national crisis.</p>
