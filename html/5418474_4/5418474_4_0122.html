   <p>The German-American La Follette Campaign Committee will hold its second meeting on Friday, August 22, at the Northside Turnhalle.</p>
   <p>As it was impossible to notify all German associations promptly, they were not enabled to select delegates, and the second meeting became imperative. The Committee expects every German, and German-Austro-Hungarian club will be represented. More than sixty delegates of various associations already belong to the finance committee of the La Follette campaign movement.</p>
