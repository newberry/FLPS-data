   <p>p. 4 - Although Carl Schurz mode use of his brilliant oratorial gift whenever opportunity presented itself, he failed to convert his anti-imperialistic comrades to the Bryan camp. And still more important is the fact that they are decided anti-Bryanists. Charles Francis Adams, the grandson of John Quincy Adams, that highly educated and liberty loving President of the United States, himself one of the outstanding anti-imperialist, said in a communication to Schurz the following: "Since your last public speech, the movement for the re-election of McKinley has become more intensive as the campaign draws to a close. Nevertheless, it is evident that the majority who joined this movement has not done so in sheer approval of an imperialistic policy; neither are they inclined to overlook the many serious shortcomings of the present administration.</p>

   <p>This step was taken out of consideration for the main issue, and is the choice of the lesser of the two evils in question. No doubt, many of the voters fear, myself included, that serious financial difficulties would arise during the next four years, similar to the years of the second term of Cleveland's administration. It is our belief that it would be, in this case, within the power of President Bryan, to put the country on a bi-metallic 16-1 basis. And according to his own statement he is resolved to do this. Thus he would throw the nation into a chaos, even then if the attempt would prove a failure.</p>
   <p>Our stable gold basis is more important in our opinion, than is additional legislation. Mr. Bryan's policy and the stubbornness of his character are well-known, therefore, considering the possibilities of our future, we cannot support his election to the presidency. Notwithstanding your analysis of imperialism, to which you have our approval, we feel that we <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>have to choose the lesser of the two evils. Thus, only one course is open to us, and that is to vote for McKinley."</p>
   <p>But Schurz turns a deaf ear even upon his friend, Adams, whereupon the N. Y. Staats-Zeitung, known for its loyalty to Schurz reproached him saying: "In his fight against imperialism, Carl Schurz excludes every other idea worthy of support. He has retained up to this day the full fervor of youthful temperament; a privilege for which he is envied by many young persons. And this same temperament causes him to overlook points which are of real importance in the eyes of the clear thinker. Schurz is so absolutely absorbed in his ideas that even Croker, whom he fought so bitterly, became fairly unimportant on Mr. Schurz's political horizon at the present time."</p>
