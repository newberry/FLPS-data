   <p>To maintain the true German interest on the South Side, as well as in suburbs, a German American Democratic Club, has been organized. They held their first meeting on January 29th, in the Fuchs Hall. Although it was their first meeting it was unusually well attended. The club already has 150 actual members.</p>
   <p>For Germans who have not their first or second papers, it is to their benefit, as well as interests, to join this organization, as they will receive undivided attention, should they require assistance with their papers.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be called on February 4th, at 8 o'clock.</p>
