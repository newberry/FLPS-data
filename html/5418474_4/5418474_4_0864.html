   <p>That the North Side was predominantly a German district of the city, was for years the belief of almost everybody living in, or in the neighborhood of Chicago. However, the last city election proved that the North side is an Irish district. Considering the nationality of the elected officials, it does not leave a shadow of doubt in our mind, that this is absolutely true.</p>
   <p>It is also true that the elected assessor is an American, but he is in the clutches of the worst Irish band, that of Corcoran, Callahan, Crawford and Hale. The new Irish officials are: one collector, one supervisor, one town clerk and nine constables.</p>

   <p>Not one German was considered in the election on the North Side, and thus alarmed, the so-called German leaders tried in their anxiety to give consideration to the German Democrat, Mr. Vogt, an honorable man and a trustworthy citizen, in preference to the Irish Republican, Mr. Murphy.</p>
   <p>It can be expected that in the future the green flag will fly from the roof of the Turner Hall.</p>
