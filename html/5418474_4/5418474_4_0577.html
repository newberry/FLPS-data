   <p>The report of the treasurer and those of other officials were postponed to the next meeting.</p>
   <p>The Main Section of the Socialist Labor party also was in session yesterday. The fairly well attended meeting adopted the resolution drafted by Morgan in his peculiar verbose style, in which exception was taken to the assertion that Guiteau [assassin of President Garfield] was a Socialist. In the resolution the Socialists protested vigorously against the aspersion, expressed indignation for the attempted assassination, and at the same time made the declaration that the office of President and the Senate should be abolished. Then followed the semiannual election of officers. Charles Wheeler was elected organizer.....[No German names listed.]</p>
