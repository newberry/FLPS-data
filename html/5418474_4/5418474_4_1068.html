   <p>A unanimous resolution by the German-American citizens of the 21st Ward made Mr. Washington Hesing our next candidate for mayor. The meeting was at Griesbach's Hall, Lincoln and Garfield Aves. The reception room, which has a capacity of 100 persons, was crowded and as early as 8 o'clock. In the course of time... the adjoining hall accomodated the overflow, probably 200 altogether.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. A. Keogh, the lawyer, called the meeting to order, explaining its purpose, i. e. the selection of the Democratic candidate for the mayor's office by all bona fide citizens. Mr. Herman Tews was elected as chairman and Carl Haerting made the first speech. After a general retrospect over the recent Democratic victories, he digressed into a searching analysis and proved that Carter Harrison not only broke his word to his rival, Mr. Washington Hesing, but disregarded the pledge to the entire Democratic party; that the latter could never rely upon Harrison who already acquiesced to a clique of aldermen; that the Germans, who heretofore supported Harrison, have now definitely cast their lot with Washington Hesing. When we consider his thorough education, his studies of sociology, and above all, his travels, experience, and youthful exuberance, then it is evident that he is endowed with the best qualifications, which makes him vastly superior to others. The year of the World's Fair brings problems which demand a man of the highest attributes.</p>
   <p>In the next speech, Gen. Lieb gave particular emphasis to one phase of the recent election, saying:</p>
   <p>"The Democratic party has to thank Mr. Hesing for having a Democratic Governor in Illinois.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. R. Keogh in a lengthy speech, also reiterated the obligations of the Democratic party. In the most uncompromising terms he exposed Carter Harrison as a man who sold the party to the Republicans, when he declined the nomination at the last moment and again later, when he appeared as an independent candidate.</p>
   
   <p>General Meade's speech followed; it made a profound and lasting impression upon the audience. As an introductory remark he declared, that he speaks strictly as an American.</p>
   <p>"Washington Hesing has accomplished in the West, what the editor Ottendorfer achieved in the East. We Americans repeatedly expressed our profound admiration, when we realized how Washington Hesing was able to bring this colossal fight, in all its details and intensity, to the attention of the nation's entire population. As an American, I have the greatest esteem for the editors of these German papers who upheld the very foundation of our Republic; who gave us an Altgeld, a Cleveland, procured parental rights for the people and thereby secured for us a never-to-be-relinquished heritage. The Americans who were born here, those of Irish, English, Swedish and other descent look with just pride upon their co-citizens, the Germans. Now is it not our mutual duty to do the utmost for that man who brought these prized possessions to all of us? Who helped fashion the destiny of our country?"</p>
   <p>A constant, tempestuous approval rewarded these inspired speakers... M. Franzen, formerly oil inspector under Harrison, ex-Alderman J. M. Armstrong.. and others, gave their unequivocal endorsement to Hesing's candidacy. The sentiment towards Hesing was so pronounced, that the following resolution was unanimously adopted:</p>
   <p>"Resolved, that this assembly declares Washington Hesing to be the Democratic party candidate for mayor, because in his honest, impartial fight for the people's rights he has earned the confidence of the party and population who recognize his ability and achievements."</p>
   <p>Matters did not rest there. A Committee of Twenty was appointed forthwith, one member from each precinct, which will espouse the Hesing mayoralty candidacy in each of the alloted districts. This committee will represent the candidate and try to promote a lively participation in the primaries. It will not be concerned with the nomination of delegates, but may offer suggestions to the regular, established clubs. The names of the 20 precinct committee members are appended ..... (Seven non-German names, (English, Irish, one French) appear in the list...)</p>
   
   <p>The German Democratic Club of the 21st Ward has arranged another meeting for Thursday evening, at Gales's Hall, 152 Burling St.</p>
