   <p>The German-American Republican Club of the Eighteenth Ward held a meeting last night at which Mr. Lorenz Brentano acted as President. He made it known to the meeting that the advertisement in connection with the last meeting was donated by the Illinois-Staats-Zeitung, but that a small charge was made by the Freie Presse. Today's meeting was announced by both of these papers free of charge. Because the Freie Presse called the meeting as - "The meeting of the Hesing jail-guard", - this resolution was proposed and decided upon, considering that the Freie Presse in its issue of the 16th of this month announced the present meeting as the "Hesing Jail guard meeting", the members of the German-American Republican Club of the Eighteenth Ward, repel this infamous insult upon the members of this Society, all of whom are respectable German citizens and businessmen, and furthermore; that a newspaper pretending to be the organ of the Republican Party publishes insults against the party, is unworthy of the confidence and support of the party. This is to be made known to all Republican organizations of the city through our corresponding secretary. The resolution was accepted without any debate.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Hesing who was urged to give a speech, advocated joining the Republican Party, and warned against the so-called Independent reform organizations... The Republican Party is in a far better position, according to history, to solve the burning questions satisfactorily; especially is this true of the labor question. The rights which the worker enjoys today he owes to our party. The homestead law and the law against attachment of worker's tools, and other protecting labor laws were the work of the Republicans....Harmonious work between the Germans and Republican Americans would make honesty the victor.</p>
   <p>Mr. William Floto the next speaker, urged also the cooperation with the English-speaking Republicans. These two nationalities in accord, could guard against a revival of the temperance and Sunday fanaticism....</p>
