   <p>An extraordinary demonstration to honor several German-Americans, who, notwithstanding insufficient education in their youth, have worked themselves up to prominent business men, took place last night in the Bismarck garden. It was a farewell party principally for Peter Reinberg and Oscar F. Mayer. Both made speeches and the listeners regretted that Mr. Mayer had not studied to be a poet instead of a salesman of the best hams and sausages of the world. The mayor functioned as toast-master. Corporation-lawyer Sexton made a speech, and the former State Senator and candidate for judge, Thomas Dawson regretted the loss of the two men.</p>
   <p>The party consisted of Mayor C. H. Harrison, Peter Reinberg, Oscar F. Mayer, Wm. H. Sexton, Ph. T. McKenna, Thomas T. Dawson, Judge John E. Owens, and State's Attorney Maclay Hoyne. The grand demonstration for Mr. Mayer and Reinberg is regarded in political circles as a movement for Democratic unity.</p>
