   <p>The success of Altgeld, the state, and perhaps even the national ticket, depends in a great measure upon Cook County. This has so often been demonstrated to the local Democrats that one would believe the message had not fallen on fertile soil. That this assumption is erroneous, that one is confronted with the apprehension that matters might turn out contrary to expectations and logical conclusions, is plainly shown by the mounting friction which manifests itself from day to day in the great Democratic family circle. That the Republicans are facing a similar crisis, the problem of mediocre candidates groping for the spot light, that also here a veritable war of extermination is in progress which will only widen the present breach, all this may serve as consolation in so far as the Democrats are concerned, but it is no excuse whatsoever for the truly suicidal conduct of the Democrats at a time when victory can be visualized.</p>
   <p>The intensity of this struggle for the nomination to the five great county offices is after all, a customary pre-convention fight, and the candidates who are finally chosen and elected should prove satisfactory;...surely, they won't be any worse than the Lorrimers, Neeleys, and Dorsey Pattons which the Republicans <span class="page-break">\2</span>will bring into the field.</p>
   <p>The Democrats are now on the verge of making some blunders; it is the decision which affects the nominations for state representatives. For the Germans who are so involved in the approaching campaign since the results will decide the school question and the political significance of the German vote, it is of paramount importance that not only Judge Altgeld and the Democratic state -ticket be elected, but that the party in whom they have placed their confidence should also have the majority in the State Legislature. The Democrats of Illinois have been justified in basing their aspirations on the German voters' edict. Their hopes for success materialized at that auspioious moment when thousands of German Republicans forsook Gov. Fifer who had broken his pledges and who then actually demanded a reward for his offensive disdain towards the German Republicans by asking for their support in a new election, but the German inhabitants turned their thumbs down, and flocked to Altgeld. Today, more than ever, the Democrats know who helped them to victory, if they win. That school fight which brought such excellent results two years ago wrought miracles. It was the first time in years that the Germans reached that eminence in state and national politics which they deserve and to which they are entitled; it opened the eyes of the Americans, the Irish, and the rest, it showed the significance of the German vote and what it <span class="page-break">\3</span>can achieve when it acts as a united force.</p>
   <p>Since the Democrats can win only with German support, it is obvious that the Teutonic wishes should receive the most courteous consideration. The Germans do not demand much. They do not ask that the county ticket be overstuffed with Germans; they do not insist on such concessions because that slogan. "Too many Irish" might be paraphrased to, "Too many Germans". But they do demand that the Germans whose names appear on the ticket should be good and honorable representatives of the German element; they desire above all that the selfishness of the individual legislative candidate be subordinated for the common weal. The Germans' principal concern is, that the legislature must be in such a position, numerically speaking, that they will give the proper support to Gov. Altgeld's reforms.</p>
