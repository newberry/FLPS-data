   <p>A resolution was unanimously accepted which says that the questions with which the election is concerned are of greater importance economically and politically than the prohibition question. Those present will do their utmost to induce the German-Americans to give their votes on election day to the Republican presidential candidate, Herbert Hoover, as well as to all the Republican candidates in city, county and State.</p>
