   <p>Without giving ourselves credit in any way for the inspiration, the evening edition of the New York Staats-Zeitung writes as follows in its edition of February 2nd, regarding the idea of the foundation of a liberal league, that was brought up in this paper:</p>
   <p>In the west there was made lately, in regard to the newest attacks against personal liberty, the proposal to create a liberal party, which should take up in the name of the German Americans, the fight for preservation of personal liberty as presented in the Constitution of the United States. The Liberal Party stands against all laws by force, but it must in no way stand under the sign of the beer-barrel, Dr. C. J. Hexamer, President of the German-American National League, has now replied to the matter and said: "The foundation of a National Liberal or Anti-Prohibition Party was repeatedly proposed. But whether a party with such a tendency could really gain a powerful position seems more than doubtful, judging by the experiences which the prohibitionists themselves have encountered as a national party. Only since, as "Anti-Saloon League" and "No-License League", they have made common cause with big existing parties, they can show success and in such States as wanted to have nothing to do with Prohibitionists as such. If the foundation of an Anti-Prohibition party <span class="page-break">\2</span>should be considered at all, the initiative for it would have to come from native Americans, who stand above any interest policy. I know of no one who would comply with this. I lack confidence in any success if Germans alone wanted to start such a motion. They only would provide welcome food for the natives and assist Prohibition in place of opposing it successfully.</p>
   <p>So speaks, (according to the New York Staats-Zeitung), the President of the German American National Lague, who with certain presentiment of danger blows the horn on occasion and calls the Germans to arms. Why the battle cry, when Dr. Hexamer designates the fight from the beginning as hopeless?</p>
   <p>But Dr. Hexamer does not seem to have understood our suggestion in the right way. The hopeless mess of a political party, that put up its own candidates at every election, is of course also well known to us, and our endeavors are of too grave a nature, in that we wanted to sharpen our pens for a fight against windmills.</p>
   <p>It is not the founding of a party which is occupying our mind, but the founding of a League whose members, no matter to what party they join are filled with liberally independent views, and who would force the candidates of their own <span class="page-break">\3</span>respective parties to take a stand against movements which were anti-liberal. In New York there exists a Citizens' Union that was founded by both Republicans and Democrats, for the purpose of destroying their common enemy, Tammany Hall, and which in fact, showed a result in last fall's elections. The same purpose shall be served by the planned League, which of course, would also be anti-prohibitional, but the latter only as one of many points in the program, and not to be termed as being the program itself.</p>
   <p>According to this, an anti-prohibition party, is absolutely not intended. The founding of such we ourselves would fight, because as explained in former articles, the political endeavors of the Germans are not limited to the defense of the beer barrel.</p>
   <p>Erroneous is the assumption of Dr. Haxamer that prominent Americans were not interested in a league that defends all the ideals of liberty in danger. The speech that was given by Edgar M. Cullen, former superior Judge of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, about the downfall of our liberal institutions given before the Bar Association, contradicts the President of our National League.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>But even if Dr. Hexamer maintained his point of view, if the foundation of a Liberal League in our described tendency would carry the birthmark of non-success, the test would still be worth the sweat of the noblest among us.</p>
