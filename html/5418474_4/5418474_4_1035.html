   <p>The indorsement of Alderman A. W. Beilfuss as candidate for the office of City Treasurer was announced at a meeting held last night by the followers of Alderman Charles E. Merriam. This group is confident that Mr. Beilfuss's candidacy will strengthen considerably the chances of their own candidate. It would suggest the certain defeat of John. F. Smulsky, if the chooses to run for the candidacy.</p>
