   <p>When Mayor Washburne returns from the East, there will be an unpleasant surprise in store for him, if the statements of Mr. Samuel Herzberg, which the latter affirmed under oath before a notary, can be verified.</p>
   <p>Herzberg's affidavit, signed in the presence of Alfred S. Austrian, a notary public, follows:</p>
   <p>"State of Illinois, County of Cook:-Samuel Herzberg, being duly sworn according to law, deposes and says, that he was employed as a detective by Mayor Washburne and the Chief of Police, McClaughry. That he entered into this service on Nov. 27, 1891 and continued therein, without intermission, until Sept. 23, 1892, that he found it necessary however, to discontinue his activities on the above, last mentioned date, since he was not successful in collecting his wages for the months of August and September.</p>

   <p>"The affiant (Herzberg) declares, that he was instructed to become affiliated with all organizations which show any anarchistic tendencies, in order to give reports about the secret activities of such associations; that he joined the aforementioned alliances and that he delivered the required reports; that in the month of March, 1892, Hempstead Washburne told him, that the reports he had submitted, did not come up to expectations, and that something more definite must be resorted to.</p>
   <p>"He (Herzberg) was asked, if he would agree to induce the members of such societies to manufacture bombs; the mayor explained, that he would like to send a half-dozen to prison. He, Herzberg, lived at 1530 Wabash Ave. at the time he was employed by the city.</p>

   <p>"Signed and subscribed before me, this day, Sept. 26, 1892. Anno Domini.</p>
   <p>Alfred S. Austrian,</p>
   <p>Notary Public."</p>
   <p>This, then, is the text of the astounding document. Whatever phases are truthful will probably be shown by an eventual investigation.</p>
