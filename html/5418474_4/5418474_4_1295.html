   <p>The first act of the great scandal which excited not only Chicago, but the entire country as well, is now over. In order to understand the matter it is necessary to accept Judge Wilkerson's decision and the influences which governed it. The Judge's decision is apparently final and the public has no cause for criticism.</p>
   <p>As Judge Wilkerson states, no proof has been given that Sheriff Hoffman accepted a bribe; but on the other hand, the judge is of the opinion that Hoffman was criminally neglectful of the duties of his office in the case of Druggan and Lake. The details of this negligence are set forth in the docket which contains ample and undeniable information. The kind of discipline which prevailed in that prison can be gathered from the freedom enjoyed by Terry Druggan, who, with the friendly assistance of the prison warden, dared <span class="page-break">\2</span>to mistreat brutally a reporter who merely came to see whether the beer bootlegger was still in jail or whether he was far from the gray walls attending to his business and pursuing his pleasure.</p>
   <p>That the whole prison system was scandalous, a cesspool of corruption, there is no doubt. And for this Sheriff Hoffman bears the responsiblity, no matter how large or how small his guilt in the case of Druggan and Lake. This is in larger measure true of Captain Wesley Westbrook. It is inconceivable that this man who has served twenty-eight years as a policeman, enjoying an irreproachable reputation, could so grossly infringe upon his duties. He was scurrying about somewhere in the world, now in Illinois, now in some neigh boring state, and all the while the supervision of the prison was left to his first assistant. When the latter happened to be away on some trip or other, the prison was left in charge of the second assistant, or the third or fourth, until finally it could no longer be determined who was actually responsible for the more serious happenings at the prison.</p>

   <p>Also, in regards to Captain Westbrook, Judge Wilkerson leaves open the question as to whether or not he accepted a bribe. The Judge takes the legally correct viewpoint that this question does not concern him directly. His aim is merely to establish whether the court's orders had been obeyed. In case they were not, then the men into whose custody the two prisoners were given are guilty of contempt of court. Whether or not they received bribes is not essential for evaluating the case from a technically legal standpoint. The judge leaves this phase of the affair to the grand jury and to the state's attorney.</p>
   <p>On December 7, Judge Wilkerson will pass judgment on the other defendants. It seems that he wants to wait and see what the other state authorities are going to do in this case and to make his decisions accordingly. He also orders Franklin R. Percival, the dentist, to be brought before a grand jury. He is the one who did enough dental work for Terry Druggan to accommodate a whole regiment.</p>

   <p>And so this scandal comes to a close, for the time being at least. It proved once more that which actually needs no proof: that in this country there is graft and corruption aplenty. But it also proved that the grafters and corrupt officials can at any time be reached by the long arm of the law. It is only regrettable that the political friends of Druggan and Lake cannot be put in jail, for they, in the last analysis, are the real culprits. It is just as regrettable that the leaders of the Prohibition movement cannot be dispatched to prison along with Hoffman and Westbrook. They are the ones who enabled Prohibition to become a large and profitable business which plays into the hands of criminal elements. In the same manner they made it possible for corruption to expand to its present state.</p>
