   <p>The appeal of the United Societies for local self-government has been accepted by the Liederkranz, which have resolved in their last meeting to join this organization and have formed a committee of three to agitate together with the committee of the Turner Club to induce other clubs to join and prepare a mass meeting. They reminded the clubs of their last victory against the propaganda of the nativists, who wished to prevent the introduction of German schools.</p>
   <p>The Germans in the United States belong to the staunchest and most law-abiding group, but have not come to this free country to be enslaved. The members of the committee of the Liederkranz and the Turner Club are well known and respected citizens and none of them belong to the saloon or building trade. Gottlieb Maier, chairman of the Turner Committee, was the Democratic candidate for Mayor at the April election, and only had been beaten by a small majority by getting together all forces of the machine and financial means.</p>
