   <p>Julius Goldzier, Democratic candidate for the 4th District, has again received considerable approbation from the German element. Many members of the various Turnvereins (Gymnastic Clubs) have offered a resolution which speaks for itself. We quote its texts:</p>
   <p>"The undersigned consider Mr. Julius Goldzier, the capable, dutiful, courageous ex-alderman, as a gentlemen who combines all the essential characteristics to properly represent the voters of the 4th District in an honorable and active manner. We will do everything within our power to elect him as our representative in the United States Senate."</p>
