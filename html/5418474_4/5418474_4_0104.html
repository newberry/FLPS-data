   <p>The German-American Liberty League, which was organized only last week, and of which leading German-Americans of Chicago have become members, can already look back to the successful results of their solicitation, because in the course of the last few days, a number of German societies and clubs with their entire membership have again joined the League.</p>
   <p>Several hundred thousand solicitation cards are today in the hands of German-Americans, requesting them to join the League; the cards contain the following: "Whenever the most vital interests of the country were at stake, the Americans of German extraction took up a position to prevent many unfortunate happenings. Again it is our duty as citizens of this country, to prevent the oppression of our freedom as citizens, to prevent a further plundering of our Constitutional rights as citizens, and to preserve the liberty and welfare of our people. To reach this goal, the League has indorsed a candidate for United States Senator of Illinois, who is a champion of our principles, and who has obligated <span class="page-break">2</span>himself to do this also in the future. This candidate is James Hamilton Lewis. Therefore come and join us.</p>
