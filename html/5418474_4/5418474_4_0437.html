   <p>Yesterday the City Council acted wisely. It passed two ordinances--one unanimously, the other with but two opposing votes--which make it very probable that Chicago will soon emerge as a city of undreamed-of great ness and beauty. The estimated cost of this project is approximately $197,473,000.</p>
   <p>One of the ordinances provides that the twenty-eight-million-dollar bond issue necessary to carry out the well-known Street Extension and Improvement Plan shall be submitted for approval to the electorate at the November election. The other is the so-called Lakeshore Development Ordinance which endorses the elaborate plan devised and agreed upon by representatives of the Illinois Central Railroad, the South Park Board, and the Chicago Plan Commission. It is estimated that the plan will cause the Illinois Central Railroad to spend $88,523,000; the cost to the South Park Board-- <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>that is, to the citizens of the South Side--is approximately $53,000,000. The Illinois Central Railroad will receive 107 acres of the land which is to be obtained by filling in the Lake; the South Park Board will get 1,700 acres for park purposes, and the city of Chicago will realize about 550 acres, to be used for harbors if they seem feasible.</p>
   <p>The ordinance provides for electrification of the suburban service of the Illinois Central Railroad within seven years, for electrification of all trains running north of Twelfth Street within ten years, and for complete electrification of all city service within twenty years. If the plan is carried out as proposed and accepted, Chicago will have the largest passenger depot in the world, a stadium with a seating capacity of one hundred thousand, an aquarium which will be equal to the famous New York Aquarium, four big bathing beaches, a boat race course six hundred feet wide, etc.</p>
   <p>But all this is not yet certain. Mayor Thompson still must give his consent, and the approval of the War Department must be obtained to fill in the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>shallow shore of the lake, by which process from 2,300 to 2,400 acres of ground would be gained. Mayor Thompson's consent will no doubt be given very soon, but it will be more difficult to get the permission of the War Department, and it probably will require more time, for Washington's mills grind very slowly. In fact, they grind so slowly that it often seems that Washington is opposed to all great plans, and exercises authority to prevent their execution merely because it has that authority and wants to demonstrate it. However, since it appears that there are no valid objections to the plan, we may soon expect the sanction of the War Department, and after that, our beautiful dream will come true.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the two ordinances had been accepted by the City Council, Mr. Charles H. Wacker said, "Without exception this is the greatest day in the history of Chicago. What came to pass today means more to the growth and development of Chicago than anything that has ever happened. This day is more important than the day on which it was decided to hold the <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>World's Columbian Exposition, which made Chicago famous throughout the whole world. When these improvements have been completes, Chicago will have left the ranks of provincial towns and will be counted among the metropolises of the world. In years to come this day will be remembered as the one 	on which the city's trade and commerce received new impetus, and its industries new life; the day on which public convenience was increased, public health promoted, recreational facilities augmented, and on which the city was assured of the Most beautiful waterfront in the world. Truly, it is a great day!"</p>
   <p>The Chairman of the Chicago plan Commission is right. It was a great day. A great day for Chicago and a great day for Charles H. Wacker and his associates in this great enterprise; and especially a great day for those Chicago citizens who, like Mr.Wacker, may justly be proud of their German origin and skill--of their German nature.</p>
