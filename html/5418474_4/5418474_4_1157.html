   <p>The pardon of A. C. Hesing is imminent according to a special telegram of the Evening Post. Here are some comments in the Post: "Hessing's plea of guilty gave an opportunity for revenge to many who resented his stand on public matters. Others were of the opinion that a man of such importance should serve as an example, etc.</p>
   <p>The answer to all these people is a statement in a letter from Bangs, in which he says: "Hesing, Burroughs, Miller and Powell pleaded guilty to the same transgressions as the others. The government would be unjust should it punish them more than the others and the most eminent jurists of the city and the state agree with me.</p>
