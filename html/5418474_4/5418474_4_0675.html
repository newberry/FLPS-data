   <p>An unexampled infamy! So the English papers (with the exception of the Evening Mail and the Republican,) are shouting, howling, screaming, grunting and twittering. An unexampled infamy, so say we too, but in a different sense. An unexampled infamy is the malicious damnable rascality, and the ignominious calumniations and revolting lies, that dirty dogs of reporters have catapulted into the world about the happenings on Monday evening. A role so completely bare of all honor and shame as the scoundrels play who phantastically exaggerate those happenings in the Chicago Times and Tribune (in order to awaken the spirit of the most brutal nativism) could probably not be found a second-time in God's wide world. One feels put back into the darkest times of know-nothingism.</p>

   <p>The demonstration on Monday should have been ended before the City Hall with a courteous presentation of the petitions, that we willingly admit. That a number of participants pushed into the Chamber, and tried to take banners with them was wrong. And that one of the banners showed gallows with a threatening inscription, was a scandal, though nothing unheard of. However, that is not intended as an excuse for the vandalism. Such excesses one should leave to the Americans, who have invented them.</p>
   <p>Absolutely mendacious and devoid even of an atom of truth are all descriptions which represent the City Council as a pandemonium, and speak of the breaking down of the balustrade and of desks and of the plundering of drawers, or even try to create the impression as if the aldermen had to flee for their lives.</p>

   <p>Only when some stones came flying through the windows, due to the flight of those who believed they heard shooting a tumult was caused in which two of the desks were broken from their bases. That was the "mob violence" about which the English papers raised such a hue and cry. The only thing that is lacking is that the same cowardly elements who at the end of October in fear of dangers that existed only in their imagination turned to General Sheridan for military assistance, should once more urge the declaration of a state of war.</p>
   <p>The naturalized citizens of the North Side who insist on Chicago's remaining a city where the common laborer too can live in his own little home are better Americans than the insolent money-bags who demand that the laboring classes should be squeezed into large dirty barracks, in order to sink to the level of the European proletariat.</p>
