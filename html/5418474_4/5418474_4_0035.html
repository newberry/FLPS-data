   <p>A complete register of German-American papers has appeared recently; 119 papers support Grant, while 105 favor Greeley. Of the German papers supporting Greeley only the Milwaukee Seebote and the Louisviller Anzliger are important ones.</p>
   <p>In favor of Grant are the largest and oldest German-American papers, as v.g. The N.Y. Handels Zeitung, the N.Y. Belle &amp; Journal, The Illinois Staats Zeitung and the Cincinnati Courier, etc.</p>
   <p>In regard to Chicago, our conservative estimate is that the total number of subscribers of Greeley papers does not exceed one-fifth of the subscribers of the Illinois Staats Zeitung. It is thus evident that as far as the German reading public is concerned, Greeley is in a pitiful minority.</p>
