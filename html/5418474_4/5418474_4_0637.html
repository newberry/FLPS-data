   <p>Our Polish fellow citizens held a great mass meeting Saturday night in the open air in front of Sherman's Hall, which had proved too small. The Poles are heart and soul for Grant, yet no, not quite, as there is also a Greeley Club which before that meeting still had nine members. The meeting was opened by N. Michalski, deserving President of the Polish "Grant Club." Messrs. J. D. Ward, John Van't Woud, A. C. Hesing and others spoke.</p>
   <p>There were, at least, 700 persons present...</p>
