   <p>The meeting was opened by Dr. Schmidt. Schmidt declined the chairmanship; Franz Lackner was elected to preside. On taking over his office Mr. Lackner made a speech:</p>
   <p>"We who are not actuated by any personal interest, whom the well-being of the country and a feeling of duty alone drive to participate in politics, - we have long felt that it is time that the people take the reins of the party in their hands. In view of the terrible corruption inactivity begins to be a crime. We declare war against the administration:! Reform is our battle-cry and with that we will victoriously advance! From German throats this cry has issued, and already the whole of Germandom stands united!(?)"</p>
   <p>(Footnote: The Illinois Staats inserts the question mark).</p>
