   <p>The closing of the World's Fair, soon to take place has created a universal desire to continue the use of the grounds, at least in part. As the area of the World's Fair is under the administration of the South Park authorities, the latter will have a decisive word about the future utilization of the land. It is not known what its plans are with respect to the grounds. The proposals made until now had their origin in the heads of various citizen groups or of certain individual inhabitants of the City. This public initiative, however, is in a large measure to be welcomed, for it seldom gets an expression. As a rule, the public hears what has been decided in the high places, and makes use of its prerogative to curse afterwards about the decisions of the council. This is, at any rate, comfortable, and easier than to make better suggestions. This time, however, it seems to be different, which goes to show that the Chicagoans are strongly concerned about the further fate of the fair grounds.</p>

   <p>Several suggestions so far have been submitted, but they all agree that the wide area on the lake should not be given over to buildings, but must be given over to the citizens for recreation purposes. A large park is to be created, with green surfaces and beautiful trees and flower beds, with places for sport and play and a bathing beach or, better, two of them. The island, now known as Northerly Island, is to be incorporated into the large park and, as heretofore, will be connected with the mainland by two bridges. The desire is expressed by many to leave permanently the island's garden, and to make it freely accessible to the public. These ideas are good in every respect, and deserve thorough consideration. As to whether they can be realized in the face of the current monetary calamity in city and county remains to be seen; for the way the grounds will look after the fair buildings have been broken up, they could be of little use for the intended purposes. Their transformation into a public park that would be useful for the public would cost much money.</p>

   <p>Even if the plan could not be materialized in its entirety, it will be well to keep an eye on it in the future, and not dispose of the land in a manner that would imperil its future usefulness, in the sense mentioned. Above all, let us keep speculators from it, and prevent the raising of private buildings. Nor should public buildings take a foothold there. The whole area should be turned over for park purposes and only such structures built there as are necessary for the administration of the park, or serving the purposes for which it is destined. Above all, we again sound the warning never to permit the growth of a Coney Island there. That all present fair buildings have to be torn down is too bad, for there are some among them that one would like to see preserved. Most of them were, from the beginning, destined for the fair only and are, for that reason, not built to withstand climatic influences for long without undergoing costly repairs. It perhaps might pay to make a few of the larger buildings so solid that they could even be used for exhibition purposes. Such ideas were, of course, not voiced three or four years ago.</p>

   <p>One was at that time glad to be able to open the exposition at all in such hard times. That it would be such a splendid success, only a brave few of its creators expected at the time. But now, since it concerns the future of the large grounds, one may take into consideration whether it might not be proper to have in Chicago, a permanent exposition. The United States has not one of those commercial fairs which are so abundent in Europe, of which even today the celebrated Leipsic Fair is a model and a pattern. Wouldn't it be well if, in time to come, the World's Fair grounds were made the center of a like institution, a real commercial fair which would repeat itself each year, at which buyers and sellers would have their trysting place, getting there a view of America's production in all fields of trade and industry? Once such a fair is established it would soon become a habit, a need, a recessity to visit it, and Chicago would fare well by it. It would receive a new and lasting power of attraction for interstate or international commerce. In doing it one would not have to adhere strictly to the pattern of Leipsic, but rather adjust oneself to requirements peculiar to America. It would be necessary to erect a number of solid exposition buildings and supply them <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>with modern equipment. These could all be concentrated without any difficulty in the northern wider part of the grounds where they would be nearer to the main business section of the city. This would not prevent the use of the rest of the grounds for park purposes only.</p>
   <p>An exposition of wares that would be concentrated in space has been lacking in America until now. It constitutes a gap which sooner or later will have to be filled, if not in Chicago then in some other progressive city. Chicago is more adaptable for such an annual commercial fair than any other city, because of its geographical location and facilities of transportation and communication, and also because it is the industrial center of the entire middle of North America. The leaders of our industry and of our commerce have never yet lacked in foresight. Chicago is today known all over the world as the exhibition city. Why should it miss the opportunity to make use of this reputation?</p>
