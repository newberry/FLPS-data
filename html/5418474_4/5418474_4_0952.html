   <p>"Is Mark Sheridan not the sole Democrat in the police council of three? And does not the majority decide in this council? Then how is it to be explained-except by gross negligence of their duties on the side of the two Republicans-that so many Irish Democrats are appointed policemen?"</p>
   <p>"We answer the writer of the above that the procedure in appointing policemen is so that each of the three Police Commissioners in turn proposes his man (when a vacancy is to be filled, or the police strength is being raised) and that two other police commissioners usually concur. So that, of the men appointed since Sheridan came into office, one third have been nominated by him, and they, of course, are without exception Irishman. If the German Commissioner had proposed Germans with equal exclusiveness, and the American proposed Americans, then the police force would have to consist of one third Irish, one third Germans and one third Americans. That Herr Gund, (the German Commissioner) has named mostly Germans, is certain: but not infrequently it has happened that German Aldermen have strongly urged the appointment of Irishmen.</p>
