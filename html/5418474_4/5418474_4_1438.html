   <p>On August 20, 1885, Ehrich Dankwardt started suit against Louis Schultz in Justice of the Peace, Max Eberhard's court. On August 30th, Dankwardt received a judgment against Schultz which he swore into immediate execution.</p>
   <p>No money was forthcoming and on August 10, 1888, a return was registered and execution served but neither Schultz nor any of his property could be found. This return was made out in Eberhard's office and dated back for a whole year.</p>
   <p>Dankwardt had to pay $1.70 for the second time because without pre-judgment even Eberhard will not do anything.</p>
   <p>Judge Foote and Constable C.M. Stephens are angels in comparison with Eberhard, who openly confesses that he does business for the purpose of making money. Eberhard works under cover of virtue.</p>
