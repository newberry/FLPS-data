   <p>The judicial election is announced for next Tuesday. Simultaneously the voters must give their decision on a number of propositions and amendments. The latter appeared suddenly. The citizenry was not aware that they would appear on the ballot and this made it impossible to thoroughly scrutinize matters in the press. The propositions appear on the ballot under the following numbers: Two, seven, eight and nine.</p>
   <p>With the exception of amendment number eight, they have been so worded as to be postively incomprehensible.</p>
   <p>Proposition number two, for instance, may serve as an example:</p>
   
   <p>Shall the bill (accepted on June 24, 1929) entitled a bill to amend paragraph 25 of the law for the revision of a law affecting the counties, accepted and in force since March, 21, 1874, in its amended form, be accepted in Cook County?</p>
   <p>Naturally, an intelligent person cannot make sense out of it. It is, to put it mildly, an atrocious presumption to expect our citizenry to solve such conundrums and then request a vote to decide the factor.</p>
   <p>In reality this proposition has no independent significance. It merely was put on the ballot as a compulsory measure to pave the way for number three.</p>
   <p>This proposition asks for an appropriation of $3,320,500 for viaducts in the county. By accepting it the debt limitation as provided by law, would be exceeded and, of course, that can only be done with the consent of the voters, i.e., they must vote for both measures.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost leaves the matters to its readers whether they wish to vote for both measures or not. It is a well-known fact that wherever street-car lines and a railroad cross at the same ground level, accidents are bound to occur. In the course of the year viaducts must be built there and the sooner the better.</p>
   <p>This newspaper warns its readers however, that the financial situation of the city, county, and drainage board is in a deplorable condition.</p>
   <p>The overwhelming debt which rests on us, due to the miserable administrative management of the last few years, must be paid eventually and it behooves the citizens to consider if it is advisable to vote for an increased budget and the taxes which are entailed thereby.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost has a similar opinion in regard to proposition Number One which asks for an appropriation of two and one-half million dollars for comfort stations and shelters, not to mention other improvements in the Forest Preserve District. The realization of such plans, is of course highly desirable, but the financial condition at present really makes it imperative that all these necessary improvements be postponed.</p>
   
   <p>Propositions four, five and six, are known as the Michael Faherty propositions, because he is particularly active in promoting their acceptance. We must add here that this gentleman is the head in the Department of Public Improvements. The three propositions require a capital outlay of eighteen million dollars. This money is to be used to reimburse property owners on North and South Ashland Avenue, Western Avenue, and North La Salle Street. In widening these streets, condemnation proceedings are necessary to obtain the required land, and this money is to pay the land owners for the loss of their land.</p>
   <p>The money has already been promised to these people, that is, tentatively, there being no doubt that they are entitled to prompt payment. If they do not receive it, they will righteously regard it as a great injustice.</p>
   
   <p>On the other hand our present administration showed an utter lack of conscience in handling its entrusted funds, in that the probability existed that the money may eventually not be used for the purpose for which it was originally intended. That is the specific reason why the Abendpost does not consider itself in a position to make any definite suggestions to its readers.</p>
   <p>Proposition number eight provides for a slight modification of the City Charter, that is, our local constitution. According to this new dictum, all candidates of the City Council who desire to withdraw their candidacy, must submit that request within thirty days prior to an election. Heretofore only twenty days were required. The Abendpost considers this a practical suggestion and we recommend that our readers vote for it.</p>
   <p>But propositions seven and nine are unintelligible. It is claimed that number nine is intended to empower the corporation counsel to nominate or select attorneys to defend public employees in the courts, and the City treasurer shall be empowered to pay the fees of such defenders.</p>
   <p>Through proposition number nine, the presiding judge in the Municipal Court shall be empowered, when necessary, to draft judges from other courts.</p>
   <p>The Abendpost recommends that its reader decline this proposition. This newspaper does not declare that it is inherently wrong, but considers it to be highly improper that the City administration should offer suggestions and propositions to the voters which are not understandable.</p>
   <p>The citizen at least should demand knowledge of what he is voting for, and if those authorities who are only interested in the acceptance of certain paragraphs find it convenient to resort to subterfuge then the citizens should not vote for such ordinances.</p>
