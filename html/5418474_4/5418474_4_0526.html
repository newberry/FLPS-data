   <p>Some time ago, we defined our attitude towards the disastrous effects of our legislators, silver-policy on the business abroad and inside of our borders. The predictions, we then made, are receiving a realistic confirmation through the study of the present worldmarket situation.</p>
   <p>The price of Silver today is so low, that the metal of a silver-dollar is actually only worth a half dollar. At the same time, there is only a weak demand for Gold. The Banks of the United States, England, France and Germany are bulging with Gold. But without any doubts, the deplorables business conditions in the mentioned countries are caused solely by the steady fall of the Silver. It proved to be unreasonable and impractical, to change the situation by rigid silver-standard laws or by the introduction of a Double-Standard.</p>
   <p>The World market is to-day a complicated machinery of "give and take." The permanent, systematic study of the World-Market flunctuations should be the object of international sound money exchange-agreements, which alone can be the underlying forces of stabilized business and prosperity in every country.</p>
