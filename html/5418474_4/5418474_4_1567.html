   <p>We see in the pages of the Tribune that the prosecution of the crooked distillers by Bristow, Secretary of the Treasury, is involving the professional politicians in serious difficulties. The politicians insist that the influence of these tax dodgers was highly important during elections, since they spent large sums to assure the success of Republican candidates, and that without this help many important districts would have been lost last fall.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances it would be very dangerous for the Republican party to arouse the distinguished tax dodgers, since their influence would then be used for the benefit of the opposition.</p>
   <p>Obviously, this is to be expected and is bound to happen, if the Government acts too aggressively.</p>
   <p>A pleasant prospect for the opposition! But this is all we care to say about the opposition, in consolation of the whimpering Republicans: "Be calm: we don't want this rotten fruit: We experience no longing whatsoever for the influence of these scoundrels and thieves who in bygone years defrauded the public treasury out of millions, thus serving as receivers of stolen goods for Republican Congress--men and officials. We prefer to be defeated by a party whose strength depended on thieves than to be victorious in their company."</p>
   <p>We believe that no compromise should be made with these crooked distillers and refiners of whisky. Our understanding does not permit us to differentiate between the ordinary pickpocket or embezzler and the whisky distiller who defrauds the public treasury out of hundreds of thousands of dollars by re-using the same revenue stamps or by inducing public officials to commit perjury. It is an abominable and detestable state of affairs when stealing from the Government is not considered as contemptible and dishonest as filching from individual citizens. That attitude is poisonous to public morals. A man who steals hundreds of thousands from the Government by resorting to fraud, bribes, and perjury in order to build a princely home, acquire fashionable furniture, valuable paintings, and imposing green houses, etc. and for the purpose of entertaining high society with a copious flow of foaming champagne--that man is by no means superior to the purse-snatcher who is jailed in the workhouse because his larcenous tendencies induced him to take a handkerchief or tombac watch [Translator's note: Tombac, an East Indian alloy consisting of copper and a small percentage of zinc].</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that this rather plain explanation will suffice to keep these people from our threshold, now that the Republican Administration has made their peculations unattractive and has thereby induced them to offer their staunch friendship and "influence" to the opposing party. Crooks who practiced their criminal vocation under the protective wing of the Republican party, and enjoyed immunity as long as they could, will find no shelter with the opposing party. They will find none if they call upon their compatriots for aid.</p>
   <p>That the national register of crooked whisky distillers contains many German names is very disagreeable to us--not for their sake, but because it affects the good reputation of the Germans. It has often been emphasized that the average German in America is more honest than men of other nationalities. The rule may hold true, but it is evident that the exposure showed a surprisingly large number of exceptions. We regret it profoundly, but to deny it or attempt to dispute the evident truth, would have a bad effect upon the German character. Whoever believes that it is the duty of a German paper to protect tax evaders merely because of their German names will find that he has a wrong opinion about us. German diligence, German honesty and conscientiousness will always merit our esteem but this does not include rapacity, cheating, bribery, embezzlement, and perjury.</p>
   <p>We reiterate: Let the refractory distillers remain contentedly on that side where their "influence" became so noticeable last fall.</p>
   <p>If the thousands of dollars so lavishly spent on a congressional election, to seat a man whom they supposed to be their guardian angel, proved to be a bad investment, that constitutes no reason whatever for their adversaries to feel sympathy for them.</p>
