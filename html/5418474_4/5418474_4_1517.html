   <p>Jacob Rehm is free. As is his custom, he has acted in secret. He has asked Judge Blodgett and Mr. Bangs to sign a petition for his pardon and upon their recommendation, the president has granted it. How Judge Blodgett could recommend Rehm's pardon after having refused to do the same for A. C. Hesing is beyond understanding. One is forced to believe what was whispered before Rehm's conviction, namely that $50,000 changed hands between Rehm and because the latter might else forget his customary reticence on certain matters.</p>
