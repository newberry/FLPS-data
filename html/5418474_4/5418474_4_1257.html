   <p>Chicago is often regarded as the youngest of the world's metropolitan cities. The appellation is absolutely justified. A city acquiring three million inhabitants in less than a century is phenomenal. Only three more years and we shall witness the centennial celebration!</p>
   <p>If history is at all reliable, then not since the dawn of humanity, has such a rapid growth been recorded. This intense development from a small settlement to a cosmopolitan city of colossal proportions is undoubtedly a source of pride to Chicagoans. But, on the other hand, this tremendous growth has had its less favorable consequences, and, if our inhabitants are introspective and honest, they must admit that this creation of theirs has not advanced in every respect - in its politics, for instance.</p>
   <p>The citizens of Chicago were so preoccupied that they entrusted the management of their community to individuals who did not deserve the trust. Now their <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>sins of omission entail serious consequences. All, or nearly all, of the local administrative departments are threatened with bankruptcy; they face an indebtedness of 270 million dollars. In this dire crisis the citizens find it necessary to intervene, since otherwise all our urban departments would be hopelessly disorganized.</p>
   <p>The so-called Strawn Committee, consisting of prominent citizens, intends to come to the rescue. But first of all, it desires to ascertain what became of the money and for what purposes funds will be used in the future. It would have been more to the point, if the good inhabitants have displayed such concern in the past. But perhaps time was pressing; perhaps our people also lacked the understanding to perceive that it is inadvisable to entrust control of such a gigantic community to professional politicians who, in many instances, are incapable and unscrupulous.</p>
   <p>The Strawn Committee intends to investigate the budget of the Drainage Commission. Accountants will be supplied without charge by large firms. The <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>chiefs of the Drainage Commission consented to open their books to inspection, and offered to collaborate in providing an economical, efficient procedure and a suitable budget. Hitherto, the city administration has been very reticent in such matters. It was unwilling to expose its hand. But when confronted with an inexorable necessity, it changed its political dogma. City Comptroller George K. Schmidt desires to work honestly and aboveboard with the Strawn Committee, and similar declarations have been made by nearly all department heads. Mayor Thompson, however, still appears to harbor definite resentment against any "interference" in his own affairs by members of the public. At least his representative, Oscar Nelson, speaker of the City Council, permits that inference.</p>
   <p>The County Commission has, of its own accord, initiated drastic reductions, and it appears that it may emerge from its financial dilemma without recourse to radical measures. The School Board, however, is threatened with an overwhelming crisis. Both of the aforesaid departments expressed no reluctance about showing their records and giving any desired information.</p>
   <p>If the Committee works thoroughly and conscientiously, then our inhabitants will <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>learn, for the first time, what the politicians have done with the public funds. That, in itself, is worth something. It would, however, be preferable, if the Committee were to extend its activities by adopting a plan for an all-embracing reorganization of the entire administration.</p>
   <p>The rule over Chicago and Cook County presents about the most confusing picture imaginable. The city, the county, the Drainage Commission, the various parks, the school system are all independent bodies. Even the separation of city and county is senseless. Logically, the city should form a county of its own, and the other localities of Cook County that refuse to be annexed by Chicago could, of course, also organize a county. Does it not border on insanity that every park system has its separate directorate? That is foolish and results in systematic squandering.</p>
   <p>Then there is the Drainage Commission. Its jurisdiction is definitely confined within the limits of Chicago. But a few square yards belonging to the district happen to lie beyond the boundary line of the city, and so politicians found it expedient to create a special administrative department. In reality, this drainage <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>district must be regarded as a genial product of politics, designed to raise the indebtedness structure to staggering heights, thereby providing new opportunities for graft. And on this point unassailable evidence is provided by the history of the Drainage Commission - a history replete, in recent years, with luscious scandals and profligate wastefulness.</p>
   <p>Governor Alfred E. Smith, in his biography recently published in the Saturday Evening Post, gives an account of his difficult protracted fight as he attempted to reorganize the administration of New York State. Conditions in this Eastern state were similar indeed highly akin, to those existing in Chicago and Cook County. For years the Governor was involved in vehement controversy and confronted with obstinate resistance, before he finally succeeded in breaking down political barriers. Eventually he established a simple, controllable, economical, and faultlessly functioning system.</p>
   <p>The Strawn Committee would establish an unforgettable memorial for our city and for Cook County, if it attains similar results here. It has that opportunity. <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>Now the bread basket is at stake, and politicians are not averse to making far-reaching concessions.</p>
   <p>After the citizens liberated them from their financial straight-jacket, they began to display pernicious intolerance to any suggestions and methods where-by a simple, practical, and economical administration could be obtained.</p>
