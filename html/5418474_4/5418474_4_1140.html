   <p>Gen. Lieb makes an awful noise and attacks A. C. Hesing to the best of his ability because the Staats-Zeitung is turning away from the Irish and our Lieb is getting concerned. He would like to be county clerk once more or preferably county treasurer. Unfortunately his party friends make fun of him. Here is what the Journal has to say: "The ingratitude of politicians is amazing. Dr. Lieb - ("does that mean Doctor or Debtor?") - was pulled out of obscurity by A. C. Hesing and received from him the best office in the county. Now he attacks Mr. Hesing more bitterly than his worst enemies."</p>
