   <p>Although I did not seek the honorable position of delegate to the Constitutional Convention, I deem it my duty to accept the candidacy, since, to my knowledge, no other German has been placed in nomination in any part of this state, and I consider it necessary that the Germans be represented in this all important body which is to establish the fundamental principles of the new constitution.</p>
   <p>With reference to the position which I shall assume, I would like to say that I consider gold and silver to be the best and only reliable mediums of exchange; that I am convinced that too high salaries paid to public officials and too long terms of office are the basic causes of corruption; that the office of County Clerk should be separate from the office of Clerk of Probate Court, and the office of Recorder separate from the office of Clerk of the Circuit Court; that the authority to force local laws upon the people of a city should be taken from the state legislature; and that the so-called "Black Laws" should be deleted from the statutes.</p>
   <p>If I am elected, I shall endeavor to embody these principles in the contemplated new constitution, and to protect the civil and political rights of all citizens by adoption.</p>
