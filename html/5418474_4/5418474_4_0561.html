   <p>The Staats-Zeitung warm the Republicans of this State, that if they do not amend the Compulsory Education law to suit it, the German Republicans will desert their party and a Legislature will be elected which will send Gen. Palmer to the Senate. If that happens it will doubtless be gratifying to the paper on question, which has acted with the Democrats for the last seventeen years, and has supported Gen. Palmer whenever he has been a candidate during that period. Since this would give the Staats-Zeitung so much pleasure, it is surprising that it should point out to the Republicans the way in which to save the Legislature and defeat the General. How much better Staats-Zeitung politics it would be to let the Republican enemy march blindly to his fate. But has the Staats-Zeitung yet learned, what the views of Sen. Palmer are on this educational question? Does it know whether he is for the repeal of the law, for the adoption of the amendments which will remove possible defects but not lessen its efficiency or for the adoption of amendments which will emasculate it? Should the general turnout to be in favor of giving elementary instruction in English in all schools it might dampen the enthusiasm of the German paper to see him Senator. The Staats-Zeitung should insist on its candidate showing his hand without delay.</p>
