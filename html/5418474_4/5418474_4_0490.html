   <p>The European War, which claims all our sympathies and attention, gives new life to the industries of this country. While the sword in the old country does its bloody work, this country will have to produce the necessities for Europe and other parts of the world. While the old countries are fighting for world's supremacy and command, the United States will reap the benefit and might well attain the object of their fighting for their own. New enterprises will rise and prosperity will come to this country, if it knows how to take care of prosperity and maintain it. A protective wall will have to be built for these new enterprises and the return to the Republican principles, which for eighteen months have left us, will be necessary.</p>
   <p>The present administration may have the best intentions, but it cannot be denied that its experiments have brought the country to the border of misery. Before we can celebrate the resurrection we must remove the causes of the economic paralysis and return to the Republican ticket. Already for the next election, it must be the duty of every good citizen, who loves his country, to elect Republican candidates as members to the next Congress. The return to the Republican ticket means return to healthy and same conditions and those are necessary to keep the country out of complications.</p>
