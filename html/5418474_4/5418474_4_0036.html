   <p>We have received a letter from Gustav Körner, dated May 8, and saying: "Because my attitude to the presidential election has been misinterpreted, as I see from several journals, I beg you to put into your widely circulated paper the following lines: 'Between Greely and Grant - always for Greely.'"</p>
   <p>(Signed) Gustav Korner.</p>
   <p>Hecker has returned seriously ill from Cincinnati. From his sick bed, hardly able to hold the pencil, he writes to Mr. Rapp: "And all that I have taken on me in order to join the most infamous sell-out. This reform is worse than the evil. The whole sell-out has been fixed by Davis and especially Frank P. Blair, together with the besotted swindler Gratze Brown."</p>
   <p>These unequivocal utterances of Hecker are well fitted to console us over the <span class="page-break">2</span>so different conception of Gustav Körner. However, we must sincerely regret that Korner, through his conditional declaration for the arch-temperance man, Greely, actually refuses to become the candidate for governor of the antitemperance forces......He who works for the elevation of the high priest of all temperance agitation to the presidency, can neither be the governor's candidate of the opponents of all temperance legislation, nor would he, himself, want to be.</p>
