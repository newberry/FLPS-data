   <p>Mayor Edward J. Kelly announced that he will request the City Council, at its first session after the summer holidays, on October 4, to confirm the appointment of former Fire Marshal Arthur R. Seyferlich as Fire Commissioner in the place of the deceased Daniel J. Carmody.</p>
   <p>Seyferlich had belonged to the Department for thirty-seven years when, during Thompson's administration, he suddenly was relieved of his position as Fire Marshal. It was expected that he would be content with his former job as division marshal, but Seyferlich replied that he wished to resign.</p>
   <p>Meanwhile Seyferlich took a rather modest part in politics and co-operated in various election campaigns. When Carmody died, the Abendpost made every effort to call the Mayor's attention to Seyferlich as a man who would be able not only to keep the Fire Department at its present level but also to improve it. A committee was then formed of prominent German-Americans who then took on the task of urging the Mayor to appoint Seyferlich Fire Commissioner. The work <span class="page-break">\2</span>of this committee was crowned with success.</p>
   <p>Seyferlich is in his sixty-fifty year and is astonishingly robust, an indication that the hardships of his calling have had little effect on him. He enjoys great popularity among the members of the Department.</p>
