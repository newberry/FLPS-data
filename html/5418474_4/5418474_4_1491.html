   <p>In yesterday's meeting of the Independent Tax-payers from the 16th Ward there were about 103 men present. 25 Independent Republicans, 7 Democrats and 71 Laborites and Socialists. Comrade Schoffner was recommended as president. Also Comrade Fred Korth was recommended. The votes were only thrown away on Comrade Schaffner. The Comrade took the chair and spoke in anger against Anton Imhoff. The candidate for the Socialist Party does not own any property. The audience was afraid to talk. Comrade Wahl stood up and explained that Anton Imhoff did not even reside in the ward, but that he had property and that he was paying taxes in the 16th ward, and he asked every good member to vote for him as he was the only person who could save the ward. The next speaker was the lion of the day, the ex-President for the Trade and Labor Union, Anton Imhoff. He spoke, "I am here as a candidate. It took me two weeks of hard work to get the nomination but at last I got it." Mr. Imhoff explained that he lived in the ward 16 years and since 1869 worked as a good member, and that it was against his wishes that an inspector had been given his office. Never before in his life had he tried to run for a political office. It was always handed to him on a <span class="page-break">\2</span>silver plate. Never had he for one minute imagined that the "Arbeiter Zeitung" would bring up all of the old blackmail charges. He claimed that everything said were infamous lies. Mr. Kirchner stated that he had 12 sworn witnesses willing to testify against Imhoff. Mr. Underwood declared that if the tax-payers wished to help the Gas Company and the Street Car Company, then they should absolutely vote for Imhoff.</p>
