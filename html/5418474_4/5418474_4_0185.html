   <p>Friends of the Ex-Governor are preparing a reception for him, which will take place on the 23rd of this month at the Tremont House. Whether such an honor would have been thought of, if the Gentlemen of the featival board for the Inauguration of Governor Tanner, had not cut Mr. Altgeld in such a petty way, must be questioned.</p>
   <p>To the rece ption, besides the leaders of the Silver-Democrats, also the Peoples Party and the Republican Silver Crowd, further many representatives of Workers organizations will be present. Mr. Altgeld is going to live on the Northside and is having his house, corner Maple Street and La Salle Avenue refurnished for this purpose. In several German circles they intend to arrange a kind of declaration of confidence for Mr. Altgeld. They choose, for this purpose a form of honorary gift and Mr. Richard Michaelis took up collections for this purpose.</p>
