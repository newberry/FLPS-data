   <p>To the Germans of Chicago! In conformity with the privilege which every citizen enjoys, I seek the honor of being Chicago's mayor for the next two years. I rely upon the hearty support of my German-American compatriots for the following reasons: During my twenty-year activity in public life, I have always espoused an honest, economical and liberal administration for our city and nation; to the best of my knowledge I only supported such candidates, where these expectations were justified. I have always used my full strength and influence to promote the interests and views of Germanism.</p>
   <p>When I entered public life, I fought with my father for unrestricted Sunday freedom; I have labored successfully for German language instruction in our public schools; every German enterprise found an ardent supporter in me, and my attack against state interference in private and community schools is too recent to be forgotten.</p>
   <p>However, I do not ask for your patronage as a reward. Whatever I have done, was the result of my own inner conviction and initiative a sense of duty towards my native land, the city which became my home and the German-Americanism <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of which I am a part. But I do seek the help of my German American compatriots, because I share their views regarding the management of our city and I have merely alluded to my past, so that they may consider my reliability and feel confident.</p>
   <p>I am a genuine American: I was born in this country, studied at the Kinzie public school in Chicago and finished my education at Yale, that typical old American college in Connecticut. I challenge Grover Cleveland, who is an ideal American - to call himself a better American than I am. We are both sons of this soil, and in our love for this land, in our fervent ambition to make it the most desirable on earth, that all should have equal rights, equal duties and identical opportunities to obtain happiness, - in that thought we are one.</p>
   <p>I had a German father, whose name is known to every child in Chicago, whose deeds are inextricably interwoven in the history of our city. I grew up under the guidance of a pious and sympathetic German mother, whose quiet labors have likewise left a lasting impression in many a heart.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>In German universities I obtained a deeper insight of Germanism; through travels and observations in that nation I learned to love Teutonic customs; my esteem grew for the Germanic methods of conducting local and community administrations. This recognition became more pronounced, when I visited other lands at a later period.</p>
   <p>I reiterate, I am a genuine American, but I subscribe to the views of a certain fraction of our Americans - and to this percentage belong the German-Americans without exception, who do not consider public offices as cows, ever ready to be milked, sponges that only need squeezing, or convenient recreation places. This minority considers that the acceptance of a public office constitutes a great responsibility which requires definite knowledge, and that a person's motivating force must be a superior sense of duty.</p>
   <p>I believe that anyone who obtains a public office must forget all selfishness; his only aim should be the public weal. I also adhere to the tenet, that his entire time belongs to the people and that he must earn his salary. I do not believe in parasites in my own business and they are not wanted in public offices.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>It is my opinion that a city can be managed like a big business; that men may be found whose only ambition is to so discharge their duties that they are rewarded with the public's gratitude which leads to higher positions of trust. And this is by no means a sacrifice; whosoever has proved himself a man of honor, a sincere, strict adherent of the dogma which specifies that duties shall be well performed, such an individual never suffered want in America. There is a demand for such always, everywhere.</p>
   <p>I did not seek this candidacy in the beginning, but consented eventually, not by any coercion, but by convincing arguments, wherein it was shown to me that my views about city management, the trust which is placed in me and my capacity, will benefit the city.</p>
   <p>Long ago I announced the program to which I have pledged myself, if elected; and I shall give a brief resume: The appointment of able men as leaders in all branches. A business-like, economical conduct in all departments. Introduction of the eight hour working day in all city bureaus, and insistence that every employee be compelled to earn his wages. Thorough cleanliness for the city. Sufficient police protection and separation of the police <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>department from politics. No restrictions on amusement places on Sundays or during the week, but no libertinage. Restraint of the social evil; strict control of gambling. A firm stand against the transgression of corporations. Constant efforts to realize the elevation of the steam railroads; regulation of street car traffic. Improvement of the special tax division; consistant action to ameliorate the tax system, to relieve the less prosperous tax-payer.</p>
   <p>I believe this program expresses the desire of Chicago's Germans. If they wish it to be enforced and consider me qualified, then I request them to go to the polls with the same zeal as formerly, when the school question was an issue, during the two previous state elections. The results have shown that their opinions will be respected whenever they are determined.</p>
   <p>In order to be elected it becomes expedient that my candidacy be approved, and I request that my German co-citizens express themselves accordingly during the primary election on February the 27th.</p>
   <p>Washington Hesing.</p>
