   <p>The management of the German Democratic organization herewith expresses its thanks to all its members and friends who contributed to the great success of the Democratic landslide.</p>
   <p>Our thanks go also to the singing organizations "Harmonie", "Orpheus", "Senefelder" and the leadership of Karl Rekzel as to the singing club of the Hermann Sisters under Tegtmeyer for their co-operation in the last German mass meeting at the Lincoln Turn Hall. Without the co-operation of the German press and the radio such a great treat would hardly have been possible.</p>
   <p>For this, the gentlemen of the German press and the radio deserve special thanks as does the management of the Bismarck Hotel where we had our headquarters. The German Democratic organization has, in the last few weeks, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>grown into a strong organization. It proves that the idea of political participation has gained more and more ground among the Germans of Chicago and Cook County, and that purposeful efforts will not be short of success in this respect.</p>
   <p>For this reason, we ask all German men and women of Chicago and vicinity to support us in our endeavors to give Germans the political respect and recognition due them.</p>
   <p>To all who have contributed to the great success we again give our heartiest thanks.</p>
   <p>Those, however, who are still at a distance we call and tell them: Get into the German Democratic organization! Fortify our ranks! Unity makes us all strong.</p>
   <p>S. Neumann, organizer.</p>
