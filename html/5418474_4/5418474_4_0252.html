   <p>The naturalization of immigrants who have been in the country for five years and are in possession of their first citizenship papers and the registration of qualified voters is one of the essential labors which the leaders of the various parties have to perform now. The Republicans and Democrats are working on this task and the German Democrats intend to do their share.</p>
   <p>The executives of the German Democratic Central Organization held a meeting yesterday at Julius Goldzier's office under the leadership of its President, Mr. Austrian, and it was resolved to devote considerable effort in this direction. A report of the sub-committee, submitted by Messrs. Berblinger, Hoechster, and Goldzier, advocating the founding of a German Central Bureau, which shall control and direct the naturalization and registration proceedings in the separate wards, was unanimously adopted by the members of the Executive Board, consisting of Messrs.Austrian, Sigwald, Dr. Leininger, Haerting, Goldzier, Zernitz, Berbinger, Kueken, Demmlea, Kotzenberger, Thiele and Schmittschmitt.</p>

   <p>Text of the report:</p>
   <p>"As a codex to its verbal report, your committee hereby respectfully appends its recommendations for your valued consideration.</p>
   <p>That a Committee of three active Democrats be appointed in each ward, whose purpose shall be: 1. To organize a German Democratic Club in every ward, if possible and if conditions warrant it. 2. To select a reliable Democrat in each precinct, who shall compile a census of every German who is or who may be, a voter so that a systematic naturalization drive can be achieved.</p>
   <p>A Central Bureau shall be organized immediately. It should be centrally located and should superintend the work of the separate wards. A permanent secretary should be employed, a man who can dedicate his time to the cause.</p>
   <p>3. Cards, containing information about naturalization proceedings such as time, place, and rules should be printed. 4. A Finance Committee should be nominated forthwith, in order to obtain the necessary campaign funds."</p>
   <p>The presiding official, Austrian, in accordance with the above enumerations <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>nominated a Finance Committee.</p>
   <p>The executives will be at the Democratic County Committee in corpore, in response to a special invitation, in order to assure the selection of such Germans for the County ticket as can be regarded as truly representative of the German cause.</p>
   <p>The plan to call mass-meetings in the various city districts to arouse the German interest in the primaries has been abandoned. It has been decided instead, to call the officers of every German ward club to a meeting, where a "pep" talk to instill some enthusiasm among them which shall promote participation of German voters in the primaries will be made...</p>
