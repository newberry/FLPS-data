   <p>Assistant Fire Marshal Shay is in a predicament. He compiled a list of all captains and high ranking officials of the fire department who should be discharged for the good of the service (which means, of course, political expediency benefitting Harrison, the Mayor). Whether Shay made up the list of his own accord or at the Mayor's suggestion is not divulged at this time. The list includes Marshals Petrie, Kenney, and Green, and Captains Charleston, Smith, Schimmel, Cook, Punt, Franzen, Anderson, Firm, and Walters.</p>
   <p>Shay foolishly made a copy of the list--a carbon copy--as well as of the accompanying letter; however, he tore up the duplicate and threw it in the stove. The pieces were found, were fitted together and there you are!</p>
   <p>Apparently the Mayor has promised Shay the post of fire marshal.</p>
   <p>It appears that the German fire marshals will now be dispensed with, after <span class="page-break">\2</span>training the men thoroughly and bringing the fire department to its present efficiency, and that this part of our city government is to become an Irish domain.</p>
