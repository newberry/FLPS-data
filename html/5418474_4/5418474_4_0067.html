   <p>Captain E. F. C. Klokke, a soldier who served in the old Hecker Regiment (Twenty-fourth Illinois) has agreed to accede to the wishes of his friends and become a candidate for the office of Clerk of the Superior Court.</p>
   <p>Captain Klokke was a brave soldier, according to the unanimous opinion of his comrades in arms and superior officers. He is a loyal Republican, and a sworn enemy of all fanatics and advocates of temperance. He is able and ambitious, respected as a citizen and soldier, and deserves the support of all true Republicans. We heartily recommend him to our voters.</p>
