   <p>Among the seven newly appointed and re-appointed members of the School board, there is only one German, namely Mr. E. G. Halle. Three of them, Messrs, Cameron, Thornton, and Mrs. Sherman count as enemies of German instruction and of special branches.</p>
   <p>The re-nomination of T. K. Cameron came as a last minute decision. The Mayor wanted first to nominate the German contractor T. E. Diener, but was informed that he has business connections with the school board and the Mayor declared that for this reason he re-appointed Cameron.</p>
   <p>Mr. Diener received another office, namely nomination as a member of the Library board. The nominations will be given to the Committee of School affairs. etc.</p>
