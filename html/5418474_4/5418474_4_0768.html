   <p>Two reliable and capable city-officials resigned last week, Corporation Council H. Rubens and Comptroller W. R. Ackermann. Their successors are John M. Palmer and J. McCorthy. Changes in the City Hall are nothing unusual and probably cannot be prevented for good or bad. As political progress is going on, the choice of our representatives and officials is reflecting the will of the people and its leaders.</p>
   <p>In this particular case we are regretting the disappearance of two good old German names on the list of our City employees. As a fact, this list is showing every year less German names.</p>
   <p>We have aroused our readers repeatedly about this and cannot urge enough the German elements of our City to show more interest in political activity, as otherwise the influence of the Germans in Chicago on decisive problems, economically and socially, will soon be a thing of the past.</p>
