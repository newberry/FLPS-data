   <p>This was said to us by an honest Swabian, who has been five years in this country, and this fall receives his second papers. Without doubt many German-Americans would vote the same way, like this Swabian, who had not ample time, to get acquainted with the laws of the Federal Constitution, if this could only be done!</p>

   <p>But the case of our Swabian indicates, that the direct electoral system of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>President's and Vice President's election, is not an "empty formality" through this it divides the primary voters, under such circumstances; in doing so it creates a strong unpleasant restriction.</p>
