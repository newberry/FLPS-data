   <p>The United German societies of Chicago, The Executive Board of Turners, and the Chicago Federation of Labor have passed resolutions favoring legislation providing free text books in the public schools. The resolutions adopted by these organization cite among other reason for their action that twenty four States either have permissive or compulsory free text book laws. Twenty six large cities are given an example where the plan has been tried while it is urged that Philadelphia has had the sixteen since 1818. Then the resolution urges:</p>
   <p>The present plan of furnishing free books to the poor children from the so called indigent fund cannot be carried on without doing grave injustice.</p>

   <p>We can not organize a detective force and investigate whether parents are entitled to ask for free books or not. Moreover, the label now placed on the found books puts the stamp of social inequality upon the receipients. The whole scheme is illogical absurd, and un-American.</p>
   <p>The resolutions set forth that it is advantage to have all the children furnished with books the first day of the school year, that the board now has enough books to supply fifty per cent of the children, and there is little danger from contagious diseases.</p>
