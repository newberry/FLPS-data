   <p>The Republican press has published a notice in behalf of the Republican presidential candidate Herbert Hoover. It is signed: Hoover Committee, Charles Rodner, secretary, Cincinnati, Ohio. The notice is composed very awkwardly; its contents are not all true, its tone is altogether spiteful. It conjures up Woodrow Wilson's spirit, by making a comparison between the election of 1916 and the present election. The first paragraph of the notice reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Remember 1916! At that time the bait went through the country: 'If you Americans of German blood will help to re-elect Wilson, there will be no war with Germany and no national prohibition.' Woodrow Wilson was re-elected, <span class="page-break">\2</span>we got into the war with Germany and national prohibition as well."</p>
   <p>In this vein it continued. The author of the notice employes lies and half-truths. Not a word is mentioned about Governor Alfred E. Smith, the Democratic candidate for president. The notice attacks the deceased Woodrow Wilson and his advisers with much vehemence.</p>
   <p>How can an honorable and sensible man make Alfred Smith responsible for Woodrow Wilson's deeds? Was Wilson and the Democrats the only ones at that time to insult the Germans, and the Americans of German descent?</p>
   <p>The headlines read: "For that reason we are followers of Herbert Hoover, the standard-bearer of Abraham Lincoln's, William McKinley's and Theodore Roosevelt's party."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>It would be far better not to stir up all the hatred of the war, but to let it rest. But because the adherents of Hoover do not want it so, we should remember that Theodore Roosevelt, who in the appeal is described as a pillar of the Republic party, cast the most imfamous and wild slander against the German-Americans. He called them hybrids. Neither Woodrow Wilson, nor any other prominent Democrat would have allowed himself to be carried away by such invectiveness.</p>
   <p>What about Herbert Hoover? At that time he did not belong to the party of Abraham Lincoln, William McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt. He was a faithful servant of Wilson, and his contribution to war literature is the preface of the book The Iron Circle. In this calls the Germans a nation of dishonor and speaks of all the Germans as a decaying and contaminated people. Again, we say it would have been far better not to stir up the old war hatreds. But when the opposing party drags the dead from their graves in order to create propaganda against Alfred Smith, then it is time for us to let everyone know that he never uttered a word against the Germans or German-</p>

   <p>Americans, while Hoover attacked and defamed them. How untruthful the arguments of this announcement are is best brought forth by the fact that they make Woodrow Wilson responsible for the introduction of national prohibition. As a matter of fact, Wilson was always opposed to prohibition. He sharply condemned the Eighteenth Amendment; he vetoed the Volstead Act, and asked Congress, after the Armistice, to lift the restrictions on the production and sale of beer and wine.</p>
   <p>The whole announcement wilfully and intentionally attempts to mislead the German-American voters, but especially those who have signed the announcement. In the past it has been the custom to have such appeals signed by men who are honored and respected by their fellow citizens and all the members of their race. Above all, it is taken for granted that these people are politically independent and are not financially interested in the results of an election campaign. Such is not the case in the announcement of the Hoover Committee. The Chicagoans who signed the announcement are men of good reputation. But they are not independent politically, they have been well-known Republicans

for many years. Many of them are professional politicians, who either occupy political positions, or are candidates for them.</p>
   <p>To use the names of these men for such an announcement is an obvious and intentional trick to deceive the German-American public. If those men would further their candidacy and the interests of their party through such an announcement only in their own city no sane-thinking person could blame them for it, but this announcement appeared in several German newpapers in other cities too. The publication of these signatures for readers in other cities, who are not familiar with the situation, can only be to mislead and deceive them also. Such methods, even in the heat of a political campaign, are unforgivable.</p>
