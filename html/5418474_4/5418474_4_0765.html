   <p>At the Republican Headquarters, there was held yesterday a "German Day." Mr. Edward F. Grosse, Internal Tax Collector from New York, as Representative of the German-American Sound Money League, who has just returned from an extensive trip through the middle West, paid a visit to Mr. Hanna, to whom he brought some very good news.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grosse also held several conferences with prominent Germans of the city. As a consequence, Messrs. George Schneider, President of the School Board, Hall, and Judge Brentano, went to the Headquarters of the Republican Party, negotiated with Mr. Hanna, and submitted further propositions, especially how further campaigns among Germans in favor of Mc Kinley and Sound Money, could be carried on. The highest Manager of the "Mc Kinley Men" knows only too well, what value the German votes just now have, in the doubtful western states, and for that reason he promised to enlarge the German "Bureau" in every way.</p>
