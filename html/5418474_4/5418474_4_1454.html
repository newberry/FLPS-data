   <p>The English-language press, which first exposed the humbug of the saloon-bond business and caused the present indignation, still regards the affair as a hot potato and attacks the poor notaries who supposedly earn huge fortunes by providing bonds for one dollar. It cannot be denied that it is a violation of the law if a notary accepts and guarantees property as worth $2,000 and free of encumbrance while the bondsman whose oath he witnesses is not present. The Mayor, however, commits the greater transgression because he neglects to investigate the saloon bonds and thereby makes the swindle possible. Indeed, through his tacit consent he becomes an accessory to the crime in every instance when a fictitious bond is offered, or a fraudulent oath is accepted.</p>
   <p>If the Mayor had ever considered it expedient to become conversant with his official duties, then he would know that he was responsible for ascertaining that the bonds of a saloonkeeper are legitimate before a license may be issued, and he would not have given so nonsensical an answer when asked what he <span class="page-break">2</span>intended to do to abolish the saloon-bond humbug. His answer actually was:</p>
   <p>"I have not had time to look into the matter (Editor [of Staats-Zeitung's] Note: He was too busy with picnics and horseback riding). I pay particular attention to saloons, and everything is in the best of order. If a saloonkeeper sells whiskey to a drunkard or to a minor, then I revoke his license. Whoever suffers through a saloonkeeper's transgressions may sue the offender. But I shall investigate the saloon-bond affair, and if there is anything wrong, then I'll do my best to change it!"</p>
   <p>As we said before, it is not a question of furnishing the prohibitionists with a weapon, the bond fraud, with which to attack saloonkeepers, but it is to the interest of respectable tavernkeepers to see that they are protected from disreputable elements, and therefore we admonish the Mayor to do his duty in regard to saloon bonds.</p>
   <p>The clerks of the License Bureau and the city clerk's office now assert that all <span class="page-break">3</span>the ado about the bonds already makes prospective saloonkeepers more cautious about offering security. However, these officials are still sufficiently gullible to believe that any bond must be accepted simply because it is notarized. Mr. Rummel can relieve himself of all responsibility and scandal at once by simply referring all applicants for saloon licenses to the Mayor to obtain his consent, after the Mayor approves of the bond, and then only, has Mr. Rummel the right to issue a license.</p>
