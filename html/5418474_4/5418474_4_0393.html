   <p>Ever since the autumn of 1929, when because of a bank crash of unheard of severity and of dimensions for which there is no equal the era of so-called prosperity came to a close, numerous articles, pamphlets, and books have been written about the causes of the collapse. The reasons underlying the sorrowful event are naturally numerous and manifold. The chief reason, however, is exorbitant taxation. The collapse would have come even if none of the other causes had existed. The correctness of this statement is confirmed by numerous official data and established facts which have been published in recent years. Added to them are the data discussed at their convention that took place the other day by the national organization of state auditors, treasurers, and comptrollers.</p>
   <p>Scott Lucas, the chairman of the State commission of taxation for Illinois, declared that government costs in the United States have increased 355 per cent since 1913. In that year all the costs for government and administration, i. e., the costs for local and state administrations as well as for the Union, totalled two and one quarter billion, in other words $23 per capita of the population. In the year 1913 the total costs for government and administration rose to a round sum of ten billions, or $84 per capita of the entire population. In seventeen years the total amount spent for governmental purposes rose 355 per cent. Figured for each head of the population, the increase amounts to 256 per cent.</p>
   <p>Lucas' statements are based on official data exclusively; their correctness can therefore not be doubted. He further declared that in the year 1927 the teachers, male and female, employed in public schools constituted one-third of the total [public] employees. Their salaries have been increased since 1913 by 160 per cent. For the federal employees, the increase [in salaries] amounted only to 63 per cent, but here it was numbers that did it. The Department of Agriculture had 3500 employees in the year 1900; in 1931 it had 28,000. In January of that year, there were 200,000 persons on the government pay rolls in Washington.</p>
   <p>Then Lucas continued:</p>
   <p>"The federal government was bad, but the State and municipal authorities were worse."</p>
   <p>This ought to be enough. In 1913 this land was governed in an orderly fashion, and at that time it was possible to reduce quite considerably the doings of the authorities and along with that the employees and the costs of government. But since then the costs of government have increased 355 per cent. By a proper reduction of the costs of government, i. e., by the restoration of the standard of 1913, these costs would be diminished from ten billions to three billions and a half. This latter amount would take account of the increased population since 1913 in a most liberal manner. In other words, the costs of government could be reduced to one third of what they are; thus we could get back to the standard of 1913.</p>
   <p>No further proof is necessary that a national economic life compelled to spend enormous sums for non-productive purposes for years must disintegrate. Therefore one may in justice maintain that the collapse four years ago would have been brought about by the exorbitant taxation even if no other factors had intervened. It must be admitted that in recent months the federal government has taken energetic steps to reduce its personnel and to decrease costs. Also Mayor [Anton J.] Cermak and his successor Kelly have made vigorous efforts to restore order in the city finances after a mad period of squandering under the Thompson regime.</p>
   <p>Now, Mayor Kelly nominated a committee consisting of a number of prominent citizens and State and city officials. It was ordered to elaborate plans for a complete reorganization of the local administration, for reducing the budget, and for a thorough reform of taxation. This is a step in the right direction, for the reduction of taxes is the key to prosperity. As long as the taxes are not reduced, all efforts to combat the depression will be without any result.</p>
