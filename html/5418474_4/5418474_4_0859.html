   <p>The "Aurora Turn Society" decided at last night's "Intelligence" meeting to send a vigorous protest to the House of Representatives at Springfield against the bill on corporal punishment and also, to advise the Central Committee to see to it, that all the district societies agitate against this bill and thus put pressure on the Senate and the Governor.</p>
   <p>Congratulations!</p>
