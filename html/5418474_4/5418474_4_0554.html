   <p>Mayor Washburne says that during the Primary Election, every City Employee should be allowed to vote according to his own opinion and inclination.</p>
   <p>But after the Primary, Mr. Washburne says, when all Republican candidates are in the field, every city employee not only should vote for these candidates, but also should work for them.</p>
   <p>We are asking herewith the Mayor, if our city employees are receiving their salaries from the Republican party funds or from the City Hall.</p>
   <p>As the City of Chicago is collecting taxes from all of us(Democrats included), to pay the city employees, we think that the latter should work solely for the interests of the city.</p>
