   <p>Next Sunday night a soiree will take place in the Aurora Gymnastic Hall, and any surplus takings will be applied to cover the "contest" expenses. It is still fresh in the memory of all, that, not long ago one of the most shameful deeds in the history of Chicago was done. It has not been forgotten how, a scoundrel capable of any crime insulted the citizens of a whole Republican State by fraud, forgery, theft, perjury and shameful brutality. Who was supposed to be an honorable gentleman chosen by the people as Alderman. He installed his accomplices at his place. This could not be permitted by the people so a lawsuit followed (A rope for this rogue and his followers would have been better). It can be said to-day that we succeeded in retaining the seat tho very great sacrifices had to be made. Everybody knows that the expenses of this case, has been paid with the assistance of the well known gymnasts Wolf, Seitner and Glotz.</p>
   <p>The evening will end with a dance and as the object is such a deserving one we think it can be said with safety that one and all will have a pleasant evening.</p>
