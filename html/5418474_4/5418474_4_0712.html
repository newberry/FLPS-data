   <p>The Illinois Staats Zeitung, claims to have been first to urge minority representatives and attacks against Medill of the Tribune, who is said to have given up his own plan, (and to have been successful in putting it into the new State Constitution)but whose paper now calls it a "Free Election." The Staats Zeitung says that it betrays a lack of confidence in the people to try and sell it a new thing by camouflaging it by an old and popular name. It would be right to call it "popular representation" only, that this expression has been used, heretofore, for what in fact was majority representation. The phrase "minority representation" will give every body, immediately, a clear idea.</p>
   <p>Let us hope that the people will adopt it but dont let us try to swindle the people into an acceptance of it.</p>
