   <p>The hopeless and ever stirring enemies of immigration are blaming the latter for the defeats of our political life and social, economic structure.</p>
   <p>According to the opinion of these dogmatic critics, our country would not have any poverty, crimes or vices without these invading foreigners, who are responsible for the degeneration and degradation of our nation. One of the worst and most arrogant agitators in that direction is Senator Chandler from New Hampshire, who bluntly opposed a proposition ofSenator Palmer to have the election of Fereral Senators carried out by a direct vote through the People and not through the legislature.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chandler takes the morbid standpoint, that the mass of voters consists of ignorant and spineless, immoral foreigners, who by not means should decide the outcome of an election. It is not necessary to argue with Mr. Chandler over his foolish and senseless criticism.</p>
   <p>We all know, that the native born citizens have contributed considerably more towards graft, corruption and vice, than immigrants, who often, in groups and individually, were duped voters under the guidance of unscrupulous native politicians.</p>
