   <p>The Illinois Staats Zeitung has never, even with a single word, recommended the reelection of Grant. It has only refused to agree with the demand that the Republican Party must be destroyed if the National Convention should re-nominate him. For all that, it has not prevented the contemptible press mob among the "liberals" from assuring its readers, unceasingly, that the Illinois Staats Zeitung is a "Grant paper," that it goes with Grant through fire and water, and to heap the most brutal abuse on it. These attacks have not had any other effect than to increase our contempt for the dishonorable press rabble. One glance at the list of our subscribers, which since the start of the movement has kept rising without interruption and has risen vastly more than the total of subscribers of all German papers in Chicago, gives us the pleasant assurance that the vast majority of the thinking Germans know how to esteem the wretched "bummers" who have assumed in Chicago the role of "reform leaders."</p>
