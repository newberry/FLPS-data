   <p>Today the final conference between the Central Committees of both parties, for the construction of a common list of candidates, will take place. (Footnote: In the Central Committee of the Republican Party at this occasion, Raster, the editor of the Staats Zeitung, seems to have played a considerable role.)</p>
   <p>To our German Republican friends who zealously protest against all concessions to the Democrats we only want to submit the question: Is the Republican Party at this moment still a majority in Chicago? It is so possibly, but it is not certain. The most dependable Republican wards lie in ashes. The Republican voters have been spread in all directions of the compass. How many can and will on election day wander miles and miles in order to vote? Hardly one among ten. And even if they do it, it would still be very questionable if they are legally entitled to vote in the wards in which they no longer live.</p>
   <p>For these reasons, together with those evident from the whole situation of Chicago, the two parties have regarded it as just and proper to conclude <span class="page-break">2</span>an armistice. The election of 1871, so to say, shall not count in the party politics of Chicago.</p>
