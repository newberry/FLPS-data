   <p>Energy and perseverance lead us towards our aim. The cheating done by Gibbs, Maloney, Walsh and their clique, was so well known, that no judge could decide the case in favor of Mc Grath. The Socialists have fearlessly worked toward the unmasking of the swindlers, and proving the actual election of Mr. Stauber.</p>
   <p>The Superior Court of Justice at Ottawa, decided the case in favor of Stauber, therefore it is the City Council's next step to oust the election swindler, Mc Grath, from his office and install Mr. Stauber, as the elected Alderman of the 14th Ward. The majority of the corrupt City Council, has well earned such a slap in the face, in the moral sense, and this is by no means the last one, for the Socialists are not inclined towards any fun of this nature. They possess energy and perseverance, and will always fight for the rightful cause.</p>
