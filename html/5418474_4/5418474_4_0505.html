   <p>The following resolution was adopted on Sunday, November 10, 1901 at Columbia Hall; Another mass meeting is to be held on Sunday, November 17, 2 P.M. to protest against the closing of various streets, between Halsted and Western Avenue, during the elevating of the 49th Street railroad. This meeting has all the earmarks of becoming a magnificent mass demonstration, since speakers will address the crowd in different languages to consider the question and the Germans will go hand in hand with the other populations of the district while some Germans will make it their duty to lead many of their countrymen to the assembly.</p>
   <p>No German should be absent; we must use this opportunity to halt the usurpation of the Railroad Company and show, that we have sufficient intelligence to take care of our interests.</p>
   <p>Respectfully, in the name of the Committee, Ed. Klingenberg, Chairman. (4950 Wood Street.)</p>
