   <p>If the Republicans of Cook County follows the Chicago Tribune, they will hold their County Convention during the first days of September. For two weeks the Tribune has been trying to explain to its readers the necessity of an early convention and of a two months lasting election campaign.</p>
   <p>That the Tribune in regards to state and local politics is the most important newspaper, should be known to the Chicago Republicans as an experience of many years. For this reason we are justified in believing that the convention will be held considerably later with a subsequent shorter election campaign. Such a decision of the Republicans would be appreciated by the public opinion and probably would mean a small step forward towards success. If the Republicans are following the voice of reason, they will postpone the convention until the middle of October.</p>
