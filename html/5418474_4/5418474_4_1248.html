   <p>Since the Seventy-third Congress convened, the press, especially the Republican press, which considers it to be its duty to criticize the governing party whenever it can, is stressing the fact that our national representatives who receive a comparatively good salary for their strenuous work, are not satisfied with the amount of their salaries and expense allowances, but are diligently bent on obtaining spending money for their wives, sons, daughters, nieces, nephews, etc., at the expense of the government. They find opportunity to do so in their privilege to hire their own secretaries and clerks, for whose services the government allows them a certain sum of money each year. And now our senators and representatives are in the bad habit of using the greater part of the money to pay their wives or other relatives who act as official secretaries, and only a small part of it as salaries for clerks who do the work.</p>
   <p>Of course, that is not right. It is wrong thus to give one's nearest relatives an unearned means of support, while the people who do the work which the relatives should do, must be content with the few crumbs that fall from their lords' tables. And it certainly cannot be justified when we consider that our representatives do not give some one of the millions of unemployed in our country an opportunity to earn the money appropriated for the purpose, but devote the funds to self-enrichment or to the benefit of members of their own families. Such relatives do not need financial aid as badly as do the thousands upon thousands of unemployed who are dependent upon public charity for existence. There may possibly be exceptions which justify employing relatives; but as a rule the relatives of our national representatives need not worry about their next meal, and the evil described should be removed whenever and wherever it is discovered.</p>
   <p>However, the Republicans have no reason to put on airs as the Pharisee did, nor to cast sanctimonious glances upon the poor Democratic sinners. The Republicans have no reason to mislead the honorable citizens to the conclusion that they were never guilty of such offences; they have been committed for many years, no matter which party was in power. The Republicans were just as bad as the Democrats. In fact, the matter has nothing to do with a party as such. It is a bad habit that has developed into a right by habit--a little side-graft to which some of the people's representatives made claim. However, in view of the present economic conditions, it has grown to be a scandal which the members of Congress should eliminate immediately if they wish to be able to face their constituents; for in every congressional district there are people who are forced to be idle, and are able to fill the positions in question. Will one of our senators or representatives put his hand into this wasp nest?</p>
