   <p>The sympathy shown for A. C. Hesing, even outside of the city of Chicago, is proven by the following letter:</p>
   <p>"Kankakee, June 29, 1876.</p>
   <p>"Dear Mr. Hesing,</p>
   <p>"In the name of most of the Germans here, irrespective of party affiliations, I wish to extend to you my deepest sympathy.</p>
   <p>"Should we be able to do something for you by way of a petition, kindly notify me.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Charles Schneider."</p>
   <p>The meeting held last night by the Germans from Town Lake and from the South Side, was well attended and the petition was signed by a great number.</p>
