   <p>At yesterday's annual meeting of the United Societies for self government, the majority of the German speaking clubs of Chicago, were represented by delegates. It looked like a united assembly for the defense of personal liberty. It was their 9th convention and the most successful of all.</p>
   <p>The principles of the union have been again approved and Secretary Anton J. Cermak read the annual report. The sensation of the day, without doubt, was the marvelous speech of that workmen's lawyer, Clarence S. Darrow. He succeeded in explaining to the delegates of the various assembled nationalities, why individual liberty in this free country is being suppressed. The speech of Congressman James S. Burns of the 7th aenatorial district on the activities of the Legislature, was welcomed with much applause.</p>

   <p>"Years ago, bosses could not find enough workmen," Darrow began, "and now they will stop immigration. Let the American people spend their hard earned money abroad. That is not our business and it means personal liberty but I prefer the immigration of well behaved persons; they are an asset to the country." Mr. Bergmann proposed a resolution, that no member of the Executive Committee of the United States should have a political office. The proposal was voted down. From the yearly report it was stated, that the membership of the union had steadily increased. Honorable tribute was paid to those who had died during the year. After several anti-prohibitionists had made speeches, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
