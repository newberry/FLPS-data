   <p>The Abendpost is pleased to note, that its readers have made extensive use of its invitation to express their opinion in the currency question. In order that the readers could consider the matter independently, the Editor will not make any remarks. But it will later compile the different views, and specify its objections. The matter in question is so serious, that is to be hoped, that every German voter will be ready, to let himself be enlightened in regard to some possible mistakes. With prejudice and passion, no country can be governed any length of time and as the people of the United States govern themselves, every voter has the moral obligation, to seek after the truth, without prejudice. Every honest opinion must be respected, even if he is wrong, again on the other side, everybody means it honestly, has to give up mistaken opinions, if they are rectified in a convincing manner.</p>
   <p>The debate which is now carried on in the Abendpost ought to be very useful to every German-American voter, irrespective of party affiliations.</p>
