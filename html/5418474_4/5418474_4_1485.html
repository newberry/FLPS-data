   <p>On May 19, the Republican State Convention convenes in Springfield. [Its chief objectives will be] to (1) appoint forty-two delegates to the party's National Convention and (2) to nominate the party candidates (e. g. governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, treasurer, auditor, state's attorney, and presidential electors).</p>
   <p>With the exception of three or four counties, the election returns of the State Convention are available. The election returns of two counties (Cook, with ninety-two, and Greene, with four delegates) are contested. If, therefore, the ninety-six delegates of these two counties are not allowed to vote for officers during the Convention, its destiny will lie in the hands of the majority of the representatives of the remaining one hundred counties of the State.</p>
   <p>The Logan gang have based their plan of operations on this fact: They figure <span class="page-break">\2</span>that with Cook and Greene Counties eliminated, the Grant henchmen could muster up a majority among the representatives of the rest of the counties, and that they could use this majority to engineer an arbitrary act [Illegal measure] in order to exclude the lawful representatives of Cook County. According to their calculations, Grant would have over 350 votes, without Cook and Greene Counties, which would be an overwhelming majority providing these two counties could be kept from voting. But, their calculations are based on the assumption that all "doubtful" delegates are for Logan, and that all opponents of Grant, who have been gagged with "instructions" would not mind staying gagged. Their calculations are further based on the assumption that the German delegates, who are primarily for Washburne but who have been deluded by an infamous trick into believing that in order to be an active friend of Washburne's one first had to be for Grant, will go through thick and thin with Logan.</p>
   <p>We are sure that the delegates of all those counties, where the German Republicans are a decisive factor at the elections, will dash these hopes. They will prove that nothing less was asked of them by Logan and his henchmen <span class="page-break">\3</span>than to betray their own counties to the Democrats. That is precisely what it would amount to in all those counties where, just like in Cook County, the Republican party would be in a minority without the German votes. If, therefore, an eventual majority of delegates, outside of Cook and Greene Counties, instructed to go for Grant, were to be called upon to exclude the legally elected representatives of Cook County, they would probably think it over twice and ask themselves the question: what effect will such deception and falsification of the true sentiments of the Republican citizens of the State have on the November elections?</p>
   <p>Not every "Grant man" will be so mentally deficient as to believe that a candidate could find consolation in a faked nomination, when he knew full well he was going to be defeated in the election. Suppose then, that among the members of the State Convention, not counting the ninety-six of Cook and Greene Counties, the representatives "instructed" and pledged for Grant would have a majority. We could expect, nevertheless, that enough Germans and representatives of essentially German counties could be found to safeguard the admission of the legally elected ninety-two representatives of <span class="page-break">\4</span>Cook County, even if an investigating committee appointed by "Long Jones" were to render a report to the contrary. But, if this expectation should not be realized; if all the "Grant men" should blindly follow their "Pied Pipers" (Logan, Long, Jones, etc.) and decree the disenfranchisement of forty-seven thousand Republicans in Cook County, it still would not secure Illinois forty-two votes for Grant at the National Convention. Nothing but a great National scandal would have been created, because the duly-elected delegates of the first three congressional districts of Illinois would then elect their own six representatives to the National Convention; these would demand an admission which they could justify by telling the whole shameful story of Logan's bulldozing and crooked ness. Even if the National Convention should condone these underhanded practices and, thanks to them, nominate Grant as the choice of the Republican party, the first Tuesday in November would make the difference between a nomination and an election painfully clear to them. In other words, the Democratic candidate, regardless what his name will be, would command not only the votes of all the former slave states, but also the votes of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, <span class="page-break">\5</span>Illinois, and perhaps even Wisconsin. The power of the Republican Party would be wrecked for many years to come.</p>
