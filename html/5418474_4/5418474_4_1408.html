   <p>Much has been said and written recently about reforming the City Council. A proposal has been made to create an upper house consisting of one fourth to one half of the aldermen. This arrangement, according to the originator of the plan, will prevent the lower house from carrying out any schemes of plunder.</p>
   <p>This plan can never succeed. Experience as well as logic teaches us that there is no difference between the men elected from large districts and those elected from smaller ones. And there is likewise no difference whether the group of legislators is large or small; it is possible to bribe both.</p>
   <p>There are a number of cities in the United States whose aldermen are divided into the upper and lower houses, but we have never heard that these cities are better governed, or that they had less boodlers among their aldermen.</p>
   <p>Nothing can protect us against the corruption of the aldermen except to completely deprive them of all opportunities to boodle. If the city council is deprived of its prerogative which they have claimed thus far, namely to give away our streets <span class="page-break">2</span>and grant other privileges, the plundering of the citizens will be largely stopped. This can be done by a decision of the court or by a special law.</p>
   <p>It is not easy, however, to find a substitute capable of exercising the above rights honestly. To relegate these into the hands of legislators would not improve conditions; because the majority of the state legislators are farmers and they do not understand the affairs of the city, and besides they are just as easily bribed as alderman. However, there must be some in authority who are capable of granting privileges, otherwise the progress and development of the city would come to a standstill.</p>
   <p>Again and again the fact becomes obvious that our system of government in its present development is inadequate for large cities, although it has achieved great things in general. This does not imply, however, that it could not be adjusted, but it is exceedingly difficult to find a system which will preserve the self-government of the people, and also obtain for the administration of the city the absolutely necessary stability, not only of its institutions, but also of its personnel. If somebody would propose today to elect our mayors and aldermen <span class="page-break">3</span>for life, and to demand of the respective candidate proof of their capability and fitness, he would be ridiculed and considered a fool. Nevertheless, similar methods will become inevitable if our large cities shall ever have a sensible administration.</p>
   <p>If the whole population could be convinced that the affairs of the city must be separated from politics, and if our mayors and aldermen would be elected on a city platform instead of a national and political one, this platform would then clearly specify the improvements, as well as administration policies, which one party favors and the other condemns, this would improve our conditions immeasurably, particularly if the people could be induced to cooperate with the administration, thereby obtaining a better understanding for the affairs of the city. Soon the necessity would be felt to have city officials instead of politicians, and to retain them as long as possible instead of changing them every few years.</p>
   <p>It is certain that our city council needs to be reformed, but this is likewise true of our whole administrative system. To change one part, even if this was thinkable, without reforming the whole system, would produce only an insignificant advantage.</p>
   <p>Many years will pass until the masses will realize that a complete change of our <span class="page-break">4</span>system of city government is imperative, and the change becomes an actuality.</p>
