   <p>The editor of the Neue Freie Presse says it was a lie to assert that Von Hollen had been a main share-holder of the Neue Freie Presse. The writer of this report grants that this had only been a supposition on his part. G. Von Hollen has never stated that he was a main share-holder of that paper, but in view of the sum, which he claims having invested in the Neue Freie Presse, if one remembers, that it may at any moment have the value of the shares of the Neue Freie Presse, i. e., nothing, this sum could have bought the majority if not all of the shares of the Neue Freie Presse.</p>
   <p>If said editor denies that Von Hollen is a share-holder at all, we wish to state that we rather give credence to the word of Von Hollen, although he was an unfaithful official, than to the editor of the Neue Freie Presse.</p>
