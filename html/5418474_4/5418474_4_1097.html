   <p>The political parties in this country still make use of abusive language in attacking their opponents. If a man enters a public career, he must be prepared against ugly and abusive slander from his competitive political opponent.</p>
   <p>However, most of these abuses from the politicians do not come from the heart, but from their lips only.</p>
   <p>When the National Democratic Convention assembled yesterday, the great Republican statesman, Blaine, stood at the coffin of his second son, only about a mile away from the Convention Hall. His first son and one of his daughters had died recently, and his second son had followed so soon.</p>
   
   <p>Practically the same Democrats - many of whom in a previous election campaign had pitilessly attacked Blaine, and had not even spared his faultless home life - arranged as one of the first moves of their National Convention to convey their sincere condolences to their deeply sorrowing political opponent in a most impressive and touching way.</p>
   <p>Such actions must be pleasant to every feeling human heart, as well as a comfort to the sorrow-laden heart of Blaine.</p>
   <p>Similar emotional expressions, which burst out with elementary force at extraordinary occasions, is a gratifying evidence of the kindness of the American heart. The kind heart convicts the bad tongue of Iying. But why can not the American party-politician also control his tongue?</p>
