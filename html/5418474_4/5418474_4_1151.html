   <p>To prove that A. C. Hesing's pardon was advocated by influential people, we publish the following letters: Letter from T. Lyle Dickey to A. Taft, United States Attorney General:</p>
   <p>"Honorable Sir:</p>
   <p>"I wish to say a few words in regard to a pardon petition for A. C. Hesing.</p>
   <p>"To the astonishment of every one, the judge imposed on A. C. Hesing a sentence of two years imprisonment, while others, having pleaded guilty to exactly the same indictments, without the benefit of mitigating circumstances, received from one day up to three and six months' imprisonment.</p>
   <p>"The only possible reason for the discrimination against A. C. Hesing might be his testimony in the trial of Munn. Now, any one reading it must gain the conviction that Hesing's testimony was the unadulterated truth. If punishment is increased because a witness fails to suppress the truth, this would indeed be a grave mistake. It is my conviction that A. C. Hesing for the sake of justice is entitled to a pardon.</p>

   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>T. Lyle Dickey."</p>
   <p>Letter from Federal Prosecuting Attorney Bangs to United States Attorney General Taft:</p>
   <p>"Honorable Sir:</p>
   <p>"The facts are briefly as follows: - that each of the accused pleaded guilty to two indictments of entirely similar nature, and that all of them, A. C. Hesing included, were assured of the same kind of punishment. For that reason I consider it to be my duty to advocate a milder punishment.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Mark Bangs."</p>
   <p>Judge Rogers' letter, to the president of the United States:</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>"Honorable Sir:</p>
   <p>"In view of the fact that Jacob Rehm was sentenced only to six months imprisonment and a $10,000 fine, while according to public opinion with myself included, he was the master mind of the fraud ring, I consider the punishment of A, C. Hesing to be entirely out of proportion.</p>
   <p>"Without any doubt, he is a better man than the other and because of that and because he is less guilty, he is entitled to an early pardon.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>T. S. Rogers."</p>
