The names of the members of the committee follow:</p>
   <p>Consumers: Mrs. Edward Felske, 4838 West Ohio Street; Mrs. Ella R. Miessler, 1909 North Kostner Avenue; Mrs. Alma Schelain, 3229 Thomas Street; and Herman J. Koehler, butcher, 1757 Roscoe Street.</p>
   <p>Experts: Charles Happel, director of the Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium; Russell J. Poole, wholesaler in cheese; and Harrison Jones, attorney. Yesterday a number of restaurant owners who believe that they have been short-weighted by ice dealers met to formulate plans to compete with the ice dealers by purchasing a small plant for the manufacture of ice. This ice will be sold to restaurants.</p>
