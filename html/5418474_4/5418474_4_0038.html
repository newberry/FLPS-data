   <p>For the profit of those who might be deceived by the supposedly growing popularity of Greeley, be it said, that Greeley is gaining strength only on the anti-German side......The Democratic Irishmen, popularly called, "Russians," hate the Germans with the same ardor as their kinsmen, the French. They gloat over every humiliation of the Germans, and just because Greeley has been nominated to spite the Germans, they loudly acclaim him........</p>
