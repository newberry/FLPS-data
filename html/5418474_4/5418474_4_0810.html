   <p>"This victory (referring to the recent election) is a lesson for the politicians, which they will not so easily forget,"asserted Th. Stephani. "They dare not try again to attack our parental rights. Our schools must remain undisturbed. I believe that the Republicans will agree with me today. Before the Republicans assailed our schools, I was one of their most zealous adherents. Now I am a Democrat, and 95% of the German-Lutherans of this state belong to the same party, to which they will be be loyal as long as the party remains the defender of liberty.</p>
   <p>"The leaders of the Republican party will, undoubtedly, in future election campaigns, marshall the same arguments, as recently; but the German Lutherans are convinced of the fact that the Republican party is no longer their party. They will vote for the party which defends liberal viewpoints. The German-Lutherans have a real reason to be proud of their victory. Altgeld and Cleveland's election is chiefly due to their activities. Not only did the Lutherans vote for Altgeld, but for the whole Democratic ticket."</p>
