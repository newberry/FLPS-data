   <p>The Central Turn Society decided in its last meeting to instruct all its representatives to the Alliance Societies for local home rule to exercise their influence and induce these organizations to refrain from taking part in practical politics, even though such action does not attack the principles upon which the society was founded. Moreover, it is expected that the constitution, as well as the by-laws of the United Societies will be submitted to a change at the next annual convention, according to which, any official or member of the "Political Action Committee" would have to withdraw from the Society's service, provided that such a person holds or accepts a political position. This is unavoidable, if the principle upon which the society was built should be preserved.</p>
