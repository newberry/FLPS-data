   <p>An open letter to the editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>Although the manner in which the Inter-Ocean attacked me after the election is rather amusing, I do consider it my duty to reply to some of those attacks, in order to square myself in the eyes of the public. That prompted that newspaper to print these articles against me is obvious. The Inter-Ocean, as it may be known, is the organ of John A. Logan, whom I and the Staats-Zeitung helped to defeat as the presidential nominee last year. Mr. Logan also tries to avenge his pet candidate Mr. Spalding, who was defeated at the primaries of this year for the city council. This was, however, greatly of his own doing, due to the lack of enthusiasm shown in the campaign. He is also indebted for this to the indifference of his good friends, although he accuses me and my participation in the campaign of having caused his defeat.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Gratitude is an unknown thing to the Inter-Ocean, else it could not have forgotten the time when it struggled for its existence, and when the selling of the paper by the sheriff hung over it like the sword of Damocles. It was then, that Postmaster Palmer, in order to save the Inter-Ocean, pleaded with me to use my influence with H. B. Hiller, the county Treasurer, to favor that paper with the printing of the tax list on the grounds, that the Inter-Ocean was the mildest newspaper of any in its attack upon the People's Party. I have obligingly complied with this request and thus saved the existence of that paper. Later, when this case was investigated by a grand jury, I could have testified against Messrs. Nixon and Palmer, for accepting bribe for their services from other people, a fact well known to me. But I preferred to keep silent, although I could have been instrumental in sending both of these gentlemen to prison. It was the Inter-Ocean's good fortune indeed, to be twice favored with the printing of the tax list, earning thereby $30,000, without which additional money it would have ceased to exist. And as far as the alleged interviews by a reporter of the Inter-Ocean are concerned, some of these have actually taken place with prominent German people, while others were such in <span class="page-break">\3</span> name only. I use the word "alleged," because I have found that the words which have been put into the mouths of Mr. Adolph Schoeninger, and Mr. M. Ullrich, for instance, were to a certain extent miserably misstated, and partly altogether invented. The opinion expressed by Messrs. H. H. Floto and Pruessing, which was no surprise to me, is not a product of their own thoughts either. Mr. Pruessing insists that the Germans did not forget my past, and that my participation in public affairs would not be suffered. It might be well for Mr. Pruessing, to recall his own past, by referring to the time when he sold building lots to laborers who did not have any funds, which lots he himself had acquired on credit only. Unable to meet his obligations, he lost the right to the property. As usual, however, the innocent had to suffer, and the people who bought of him were forced to leave. This furnished Mr. Pruessing with an excellent opportunity to take possession of the humble homes built by these poor people on that property. When did I incur Mr. Pruessing's enmity? When, as deputy sheriff, it was my duty to serve these poor people with the injunction order procured by Mr. Pruessing against the removal of their homes from <span class="page-break">\4</span> that land, In such cases I always managed to get just a little too late to the scene of action. His hatred toward me is thus explained. Mr. Schloesser, could supply the German people with a great deal of information about the honesty of Mr. Pruessing.</p>
   <p>Replying to the statement of this gentlemen, that my unpopularity did great harm to the Republican ticket, I am willing to let the German people settle the question as to who is the most unpopular of us - Mr. Pruessing or myself. This could be done by the simple system of voting.</p>
   <p>But the main object in publishing this letter is, to tell the public that I supported Mr. Clark's candidacy as the Republicans' choice for mayor, because I was convinced of his superior qualifications; and I am still of this opinion. There is no doubt but that he would have put an end to the ill-famed beer-houses and gambling dens, convincing thereby the American people that taverns, operated under the code of decency, are as desirable as any other decent business. Thus, the unpleasant question as to whether or not taverns should <span class="page-break">\5</span>be discriminated against would have been excluded from future politics. As it is, will remian an open question for years to come.</p>
   <p>This explains why I have stood for the election of Mr. Clark. But to fight against the betrayal in a camp, and also against 5,000 indifferent voters and "reporters" is a difficult task. It seems quite a mystery, why my support of the Republican candidate should have proven a disadvantage to him, when the Republican ticket scored a success last fall despite the energetic support I had given it. The candidacy of Adolph Muller, for which that I have been blanced and attacked by various American newspaper-writers, was, so far, not important enough for me to discuss it. But, since Mr. Floto has declared, that I could have prevented his candidacy, I must make it clear that Mr. Mueller was offered the candidacy before my return from Mexico. Muller informed me that he had the promise of support from Messrs. Adolph Schoeninger, McConnell, (Field &amp; Leiter) E. F. Cragin and many other prominent citizens and property owners. Furthermore, he said, when he first became conscious
<span class="page-break">\6</span>
of his candidacy last year, Adolph Schoeninger introduced him to the publisher of the Nene Freie Presse, inquiring whether Mueller could count on the support of his paper, if nominated. Nichaelis replied, that there was not a thing against him except that he was a friend of the Staats-Zeitung, but being the choice of Schoeninger, and considering the fact that the people like him, he would not deny him the support of his paper. I nevertheless, besought him not to run, for I considered it a great mistake to step before the public after all that had happened. He answered that he was the choice of the people of the 10th, 16th, and 17th wards, and that the many friends he also has in ward 18, would make his nomination certain. Thus things have taken their course.</p>
   <p>As far as my participation or support of Mueller is concerned, I propose to send a $100 check to the Alexian Brothers' Hospital for every man to be found on the North Side, whom I have tried to influence either at the preliminary nomination or at the convention, before Mueller was nominated.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>In conclusion, I wish to warn the Inter-Ocean and the Daily News, both closely related in their policy since the beginning of the last campaign, thus pleasing John A. Logan, their commander-in-chief, that if this is the latter's way of assuring for himself an unlimited dictatorship of Illinois he is very, very far from the realization of his dream. If he is inviting a combat, we shall not shun it; the Staats-Zeitung, and myself are ready for him.</p>
   <p>Respectfully</p>
   <p>A. C. Hesing.</p>
