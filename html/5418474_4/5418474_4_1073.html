   <p>Springfield, January 10th- Today, a few minutes before three o'clock, John P. Altgeld gave his official oath in the festive, decorated House of Representatives, before the state's highest officials, and the Vice-President of the United States.... This is the first time that the state has had a Democratic governor in 36 years.</p>
   <p>The multitude, virtually thousands, will never forget this most imposing scene, these inauguration festivities which herald another era. After speaker Craft, in the presence of both Houses opened the session with the customary formalities, Judge Altgeld, accompanied by his wife and Ex-governor Fifer, entered the Hall amidst thunderous, well nigh unending applause. He was seated next to the speaker, followed by Vice-President Stevenson and officials of the former administration, the elected officers and their wives as well as by Henry Raab, the German schoolmaster, whose victory made the success of November 8th possible, also several prominent citizens - personal friends of Altgeld, amongst them General Winston, Washington Hesing, James Ewing, R. Ridgley and Major Orendorf from Springfield.... The members of the State's <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Supreme court followed their leader, Senior Judge Schofied. They all were greeted with tumultuous, enthusiastic applause.... any a greyheaded Democrat, who, like the children of Israel, had waited 40 years until he entered the promised land and patiently hoped for this long protracted victory, was in the crowd, a witness to this long sought for moment, Altgeld's induction.</p>
   <p>The Governor appeared to be sickly; he gave the impression of a man who is able to stand only, by using his last, ebbing energy, as he falteringly walked to the Clerk's desk. After the fiery and fierce approval of his listeners subsided, he commenced to read his message. His strength was not equal to the task, and a few minutes later the clerk continued it. Those who heard it, gave a highly complimentary verdict to Altgeld.</p>
   <p>After the presentation of the inaugural address, the retiring governor made his farewell speech. Altgeld's message, when compared with the words of his contemporary, is a true index of the characteristics of these two, who today are in the limelight of political interest. Altgeld, the thinker, highly erudite, staunch, the phrase-abhoring jurist who knows mankind, spoke tangibly, practically; Fifer, the politician, resorted to sonorous, melodious phrases, but succeeded in relinquishing his office in a courteous manner and tendering <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>it to the victor with the proper tact, commensurate with the dignity of such an exalted office. The conquerors expressed their hearty approval.</p>
   <p>How seriously the Democratic party considers its obligation towards the school was shown during the assembly, as Altgeld, in his first point of the proclamation, pleaded the cause of the school. He asked for an absolute withdrawal of the law in most energetic terms. The audience was in full accord with its leader; the acclaim which followed these exclamations is an indisputable proof indeed. After this paragraph he asserted his views on labor, which prompted an almost similar response. It was four o'clock when the festivities drew to an end, whereupon the public visited the highly decorated halls of the capitol and above all, the governor's chambers.</p>
   <p>Altgeld will require a few days of rest to recuperate and then comes the Herculean task which is incidental to the ensuing nominations which will be postponed until next week. The presiding official of the Joliet Prison Commission, will be a German manufacturer of Chicago. Nominations for the Lincoln Park Commission are on tomorrow's program; Goudy, Kirk, E.S.Dreyer, Rob. Waller orcol. Hennessy have been selected. Wm. Schlacke, who was the Sixth Senatorial District candidate for the legislature, two years ago, will be the Board's Secretary.</p>
