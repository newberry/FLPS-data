   <p>The entire press, without exception, is praising the bravery of Mayor Roche and of his chief of police who raided Chicago workers' meeting halls and forbade street parades. Roche says, that his procedure was in the interest of "public policy", which could be translated as "public welfare."</p>
   <p>We shall not quarrel with Roche about what "public policy" means, but we would like to ask him this question: Suppose a Republican mayor would find it necessary in the interest of "public policy" to stop demonstrations by the Democratic party - what then?</p>
   <p>Said mayor could simply explain that according to his best knowledge he considers the aims of the Democrats as dangerous to the government and believes that the achievements of the Democrats would be synonymous with the ruin of the commonwealth, therefore the Democrats are considered to be enemies of the people who should be suppressed.</p>
   <p>A Democratic mayor could go to war against the Republicans for similar reasons. If the press, being so laudatory today, intends to be logical it ought to side with the mayor in case he should start a fight with his political enemies. <span class="page-break">\2</span>We hope it will come to that.</p>
