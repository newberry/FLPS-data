   <p>We demand: 1) That no further privileges shall be granted to corporations such as street-car companies, that all such shall be in the city's possession, and shall be operated and maintained by the city.</p>
   <p>2) Considering the state of the lighting system, we demand the <span class="page-break">\2</span>same procedure as above.</p>
   <p>3.) The progressive spirit of the 19th century demands, an education for every child. Due to a shortage of schools etc. 10,000 school children past 5 years of age, are deprived of the opportunity of attending a school, therefore we hold, it is the city's duty, to build schools, thus giving every child a chance to get at least an elementary school education; that text books etc. shall be given free of charge, and to establish kindergarten classes at all schools.</p>
   <p>4.) Regulating the railroads, as to the right of the way, within the city limits. The city should demand of the railroad companies, that they erect viaducts on all crossings, and employ flagmen at street crossings.</p>

   <p>9.)Public libraries in three different districts of the city.</p>
   <p>10.)That the Board of Education, consists of teachers and pedagogically <span class="page-break">\3</span>educated persons only, and that all public school teachers should have passed 25 years of age.</p>
   <p>11.) Not to engage in beautification of streets and boulevards, for the use of the wealthy class, with hundred of miles of neglected and impassable streets as in the case just now.</p>
   <p>12.) That the city council shall force the tramway companies, to put into operation a sufficient number of cars, thus putting an end to the ever crowding, thus endangering the lives of the passengers.</p>
