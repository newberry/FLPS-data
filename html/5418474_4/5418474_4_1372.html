   <p>At one o'clock this morning it was impossible to say whether Washington Hesing or Carter Harrison had obtained the majority of the delegates, as the result of yesterday's primary. The Harrison headquarters announced as usual, that they will monopolize the entire convention, and people who listen to the Harrisonians believe that the old demagogue was victorious. But then, the Harrisonians subscribe to that time worn, traditional tactics: "Claim everything."</p>
   <p>At this early morning hour, the Hesing headquarters counted on 300 delegates out of the total 681 which are pledged to Hesing.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>The election news from some wards has not reached us yet. From others we hear about a "Harrison delegation," declaring at the closing of the election places, that they would never vote for Harrison, and about other delegates who, elected on an "unpledged ticket," were looking for a third candidate. The question, how any candidate can obtain a majority from this colorful, heterogeneous assembly may not be solved until the convention is in session. The primary election of 1891, with its corruption and unbridled violence, provided more than a casual opportunity for Carter H. Harrison; it allowed him to enter the field as an independent candidate.</p>
   <p>The primary election, which the machine managed for him yesterday, surpassed the one of two years ago, probably any - in the annals of our local political history.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>Carter and "fair primaries"! Listen to the evidence of the party greybeards, - German Democrats who have grown old in the service,- as to how they were treated in the 5th, 9th, 10th and 22nd wards. Read what Senator Thiele, Alderman Tripp, and Adolph Sturm have experienced, what they know about the outrages which the Germans had to endure under Dan Corkery, Capt. Farrell and others. So it is that one recognizes Carter Harrision in his true form, as an hypocritical demagogue who sanctions every corrupt scheme as long as it is advantageous to him.</p>
   <p>The most revolting side of this fight is not the villainous disbarment of the German Democrats in this or that ward, nor the use of money bribes, but the established fact that Washington Hesing was fought in the American and Irish wards as "a Dutchman" and in others as a Catholic. And this, shortly <span class="page-break">4</span>after the Democrats came into power; thanks to their fight against religious intolerance, led by the "Dutchman"!</p>
   <p>You want proofs? Does Mr. M. W. Robinson intend to deny his commands given in the 25th ward: "Let no German vote, or if he does, challenge his vote"? It did not help him, though!</p>
   <p>In the 5th, 6th, 15th and 18th wards, nobody with a German name was allowed to vote if he favored Hesing; even the right of such well-known Democrats as Fred Sommer was disputed. In the 25th ward, a circular was distributed which attacked Hesing on religious grounds. In the 2nd ward a follower of Hesing found it impossible to vote. Chas. King and other friends of the Hesing cause did a little investigating. Whenever a Hesing voter was refused admission, he was sent back, provided with a Harrison ticket, and presto! - he was permitted to vote.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>It must be a satisfaction for Mr. Hesing to know that such German wards as the 9th, 21st, 25th, and 26th were for him, and the 5th, 6th, 10th, 15th and 22nd wards likewise would have been his, if the Germans had not been actually hobbled. He was honestly defeated in only one German ward, the 14th. Among the Harrison party-leaders, neither Frank Wenter, Walter Boyle, William Mangler nor Adolph Kraus was elected as delegate. They'll have to borrow or buy the cherished seat. The first named is the president of the Drainage Commission and let us hope that he will hence-forth focus his attention on that costly enterprise instead of on ward politics.</p>
   <p>News from the Polls.</p>
   <p>Relentless elimination of citizens' rights; this was the characteristic which the Harrison cohorts stamped on yesterday's election, for future historians to ponder over. Not only were the polls closed and barricaded <span class="page-break">6</span>in countless instances by the Harrison helpers, so that the Hesing challengers and judges found no means of entrance, but even windows were boarded up, so that none could discover what tickets were dumped into the sacred box. But the undeniable proof is available, and is accumulating hourly, that Hesing votes have been destroyed by the hundreds; that the Harrison judges and challengers did personally commit this nefarious work.</p>
   <p>In the 2nd district of the 5th ward, which includes the 4th, 5th, 6th and 23rd precincts, the Hesing representatives were excluded from the very beginning. Such despotic usurpation cannot be condoned, and the incensed Hesing agents marched forthwith to the police lieutenant of that district and demanded instantaneous intervention. The commanding official, however, refused to budge. At one of these polling places, Christ Eck was to function as a Hesing judge; he was simply refused admittance. When the Hesing challenger, John Budinger, asked a policeman, on duty at one of the voting places, if he might tear off the boards with which a window had been <span class="page-break">7</span>barricaded, so that the ballot box and the depositing of the ballots could be seen, as required by law, the officer said: "No!"</p>
   <p>A Mr. Paul Purcell sat in one of the polling places and the proof of many witnesses is available, that Purcell deliberately destroyed the tickets which were given to him, and threw the torn scraps under the table. Nobody controlled the proceedings or knew what was put into the ballot box.</p>
   <p>With a deliberate impertinence which infuriated the Germans, Harrison's friends in other precincts prevented every German from voting under the pretext that he was not a Democrat. The votes of many, after having been accepted, were merely thrown away, while unknown and suspicious fellows from the city's worst elements were considered full-blooded Democrats because they voted for Harrison.</p>
   <span class="page-break">8</span>
   <p>When the Germans and other Hesing adherents noticed these unconcealed, deliberate and insolent methods, by which their fundamental rights were trampled upon, many considered it expedient to return with affidavits to certify their political creed and were laughed at.</p>
   <p>In a district of the 5th ward, the disfranchized citizens found it necessary to open a polling place of their own. Within a short time 91 votes for Hesing were registered. It was worse in other wards.</p>
   <p>Scenes similar to those with which we became conversant in the 5th ward, were repeated in other parts of the city. Thus we note, that in the 4th district of the 1st ward, a detachment of Harrison men, under the leadership of William Skakal, tried to storm the polls and intended to oust Mr. Walters, a challenger for Hesing. The police were absent. Mr. <span class="page-break">9</span>Skakal succeeded in breaking the door, then, in upsetting the table and ballot box. Walters interfered and was knocked down. At this juncture the police appeared and Skakal was dragged out. He procured a cigar box in a nearly saloon and opened a polling place in a lodging house at 446 Clark Street, where 64 votes for Harrison delegates were obtained. They are trying to get a seat and voice in the convention today. In the 11th ward we find the enterprising Mr. J. R. Synon, the very one who attempted to kill one of the supervisors, M. E. McDonald, just two days ago. When this Synon, with his managerial ability, perceived that the Harrisonian chances were nil at the public booths, he considered it expedient to improve the situation by opening a private poll at his own home, 649 Harrison Street. The results from this ward will also be contested. In the second district of the 9th ward the police had to be called repeatedly, as the Harrison hirelings tried to throw out Mr. Fred Stoll, the Hesing election judge. They were successful, as the police showed no inclination to establish order.</p>
   <span class="page-break">10</span>
   <p>Unconcealed fraud, intimidation and coercion by the opposing party, and finally actual attacks upon respected citizens who insisted upon their right to vote for Hesing, these were the exploits of "Boss" Farrell's leadership, in yester day's primary in the 22nd ward. It is doubtful if ever viler means were used to obtain election results, than the Harrison party conceived for this ward. "Boss" Farrell told his infamous "gang" that the ward must be won for Harrison, and the "gang" did its best to the utmost satisfaction of its leader. The respectable Hesing element of that voting district was riled to the point of open rebellion.</p>
   <p>"Captain" Farrell's stamping grounds were the worst. At 22 Clybourn Ave., in the 4th district, is a polling place, which during more peaceful days <span class="page-break">11</span>serves as a brushmakers warehouse and store. Long before the scheduled opening a large crowd of drunken rowdies, regular Basserman-ical creatures, did sentry duty and every decent, peace-loving citizen found it advisable and prudent to shun them. "Let no Hesing voters approach," that appeared to be the watchword and it was carried out most carefully. The Hesing challenger was not admitted and the dozen or more Farrell imps who were planted inside, challenged every man who did not belong to "the bunch." The most trifling excuses sufficed to exclude dozens of voters. Sworn statements by known and respected citizens were simply ignored. When several people insisted on exercising their rights, Capt. Farrell himself exercised them in a very unceremonious manner, - in plain English he threw them out.</p>
   <span class="page-break">12</span>
   <p>"Bob" Burke and other "prominent" apprentices of the Harrison school carried on in a similar fashion. One can readily predict the results in this primary district when one takes cognizance of such conditions. Apparently Harrison received 139 votes, Hesing 76. If honesty had prevailed, the Hesing forces would have won that district. In the 3rd district the Harrison election officials were accused of gross irregularities, it is even claimed that frauds were indulged in. In the 5th district, Hesing followers found it necessary to open a polling place of their own at 179 Clybourn Ave., as they were aware at the very outset that they could never hope for justice at any price. A separate voting place with legally sworn officials was therefore a necessity. That district gave 160 votes for Hesing and only 3 to Harrison. Inversely, at the Harrison voting place it is alleged that Harrison received 124 and Hesing 11 votes.</p>
   <span class="page-break">13</span>
   <p>The question, as to what delegates will be entitled to seats must be decided at the convention today. "Boss" Farrell's past labors will surely meet with profound approval, insofar as his superior and master, Carter H. Harrison, is concerned. This is "fair play," the Harrisonian model!</p>
   <p>The 23rd ward will be a closed Harrison delegation - 17 will go to the convention. Here too, there was a bitter fight. In the early period the Hesing element predominated and the Harrisonians found they could win only with brutal force; and so it was applied, to keep the Hesing followers from the ballot box. The ward consists of five districts. In the first, the German and Swedish contingents showed a strong Hesing disposition; but during the afternoon hours a horde of drunken ward bums sent into this region by the Harrison fixers, were able so throughly to intimidate the voters, that they returned home. In the 2nd district the same strategy was used.</p>
   <span class="page-break">14</span>
   <p>There the Harrison ticket received 208 votes and the Hesing only 38. The Hesing proponents openly accuse the Harrisonian hirelings, election judges and clerks of falsification. In the 3rd district, originally, only two parties were in the field. At about 2 o'clock a third one made its appearance in the interests of ex-Mayor Cregier, (at least so it purported to be), but after two hours Sen. O'Malley, a lieutenant of Harrison's succeeded in fusing them - just a matter of purchase. In this district the election judges Mallins and Cinochio refused to perform their duties, and the Harrison men forthwith appointed one of their own followers as election judges and "managed" the election in the interests of Harrison. The spurious Cregier ticket drew only 39 votes. The 4th district is said to have brought 144 votes for Harrison and only 26 for the Hesing ticket.</p>
   <span class="page-break">15</span>
   <p>In the 5th district the Hesing forces held their own, in the beginning, but the usual Harrisonian strategy resorted to its "tour de force" which routed the opposition.</p>
   <p>"The ward must be won for Harrison, regardless of cost!" That was the war-cry and the results show that the Harrison army achieved its goal.</p>
