   <p>Since corruption is gripping our city-Administration, certain newspapers, pretending to represent public opinion, are demanding a city hall cleanout. Unfortunately, this cleanout-demand is concentrated on the leading figures of the administration and likewise on absolutely immaterial political factors.</p>
   <p>Now again, since politicians have made a mess out of our city-administration, the most impossible reform-suggestions and would be cures are published. Some recommend an Upper-House in the City Council. Others want to take away all rights from the City Council and give them to specified Boards. Many are inclined to give the Mayor the power of a Dictator and some others want him to be only a political stra-boss.</p>
   <p>As a fact, everyone of us, is to be blamed for the deplorable conditions, prevailing in American City Hall administrations. And things can be changed only by training all of us towards a growing feeling of responsibility, concerning our government, local and State. In this way alone we will be able to do away with professional politicians and elect some capable men to manage one's civic affairs. If this can be accomplished, we will make a real start in eliminating graft, waste and corruption, which are a real scourge to our nation.</p>
