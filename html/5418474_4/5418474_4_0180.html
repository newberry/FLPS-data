   <p>The State Central Committee of the Democratic Party assembled at the "Tremont House." Quite a number of eminent Democrats from all parts of the State were present. The reports of the different congressional districts sounded very hopeful. The Chicago representatives asserted that they will easily carry their candidates in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th districts to victory at the coming election.</p>
   <p>A resolution passed to start the election campaign in Chicago, beginning with a mass-meeting at the auditorium. Ex-Governor Altgeld, Mayor Harrison and Colonel W. J. Bryan are appointed as the chief speakers of the campaign. Finally, the committee decided to send a strong protest against holding before election the planned peace celebration, in order to prevent political exploitation of the same.</p>
   <p>Ex-Governor Altgeld is chiefly responsible for this attitude toward the peace <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>celebration before election. He seemed to play again the leading role at the committee meeting. In speaking before the assembly he exposed the Altgeld selfish plans of the opposing party, and also fiercely attacked the Federal Government, because they acted heartlessly and incompetently toward their own soldiers in the Spanish-American War.</p>
   <p>Mr. Altgeld also stated that the "silver-question" is still the primary issue of the Democratic Party and could not be ignored.</p>
