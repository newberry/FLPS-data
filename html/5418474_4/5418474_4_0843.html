   <p>The private secretary of our new Mayor discovered that the rate of applications for jobs is 5 to one. In other words, the Mayor will create four enemies out of five friends; we do not envy him.</p>
   <p>Yesterday again Mr. Emil Hoechster kept on pestering the Mayor for a job.</p>
   <p>He told him all kind of stories about his pretended influence among the Germans in Chicago and tried to convince him that he would oblige the Germans "eternally" if he only would give him, Emil Hoechster, the office of city collector.</p>
   <p>Well, maybe he will succeed. Emil Hoechster is not by far the worst fellow!</p>
