   <p>Altgeld has extended his travels of political recognition lately and visited larger and smaller towns in the northwestern section of Illinois. He contacted all classes of people irrespective of party affiliation, and went into workshops, stores, and places or business, talking with the people.</p>
   <p>Altgeld obtains in this manner not only first hand information about the conditions of party politics for the coming campaign; but he also gathers real information concerning social and economic conditions in Illinois, which are very essential for an effective management of a governorship. He will need them for this purpose, because Altgeld's chances of becoming governor are steadily improving, although the result of the national campaign remains uncertain.</p>
   <p>The school question is an important factor in the state election. Altgeld adheres strictly to the promises made by himself and his party, while on the other hand his Republican opponents begin to take a contrary attitude in this question. Although they started with many sweet words, their former bitterness is starting to creep out now.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Altgeld states his viewpoints about this matter in conversations and discourses as follows:</p>
   <p>"A democratic republic can not function without general intelligence on the part of the people. For this reason, my party and I are for the public school and its continual elevation ad improvement. I myself, have obtained instructions in a 'little red schoolhouse', and was a teacher in one of them for five years.</p>
   <p>"We will attempt to gain the people's appreciation of our public school system and not make it a torture chamber for many a brave citizen.</p>
   <p>"The Edward Law is such a torture and is very effective in arousing hatred for our public schools; therefore, it is contradictory to domocratic principles. Furthermore, by turning over to the state the control over parochial schools, it constitutes the beginning of the control of the state over the church, which is gangerous and contrary to our essentially republican institutions and principles.</p>
   <p>"Therefore, away with the Edward Law! But in its place put another law which <span class="page-break">\3</span>requires that each child must receive elementary education, but without intruding upon the rights of parents in their choice, and without enroaching upon the realm of religion."</p>
   <p>We may safely assume that Altgeld, if elected governor, will exert his whole influence to have the Edward Law replaced by a new compulsory school law which will be patterned after Wisconsin's famous new school law.</p>
