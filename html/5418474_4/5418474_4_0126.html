   <p>The German-American National Bund of Chicago and Illinois is going to stay out of politics, but will endorse candidates for the board of directors of the Illinois state university, and actively campaign for their election. Endorsed are Henry W. Huttmann, because, as member of the Board of Education and otherwise, he has always worked for the promotion of German interests; also, Dr. T. J. Montgomery, of Charleston, and Robert R. Ward, of Benton, of whom the German element in the state can expect support of their interests. Circulars will be sent to members of the Bund, asking for active support of these candidates.</p>
   <p>The resolution not to go into politics was adopted last night by the Chicago branch at a meeting of delegates, held on the North Side, and by the Illinois <span class="page-break">2</span>branch this noon at a session of the officers of the executive committee of the Staatsverband [State Association]. The reason for this resolution was a communication received by the Zentral Verband (Central Association), asking the branch associations to become politically active for the purpose of supporting the candidacy of men upon whom the German element could rely.</p>
   <p>At the meeting of delegates of the Chicago branch association, sharp controversies arose. There was a long and heated debate about the letter of the Zentral Verband. Some delegates, led by D. B. Brillows and August Lueders, advocated participation in state and national politics, contending that this was the only way to have men elected who looked with favor upon the activities of the National Bund; other delegates strongly opposed the suggestion to drag the Bund into politics. Advocates of the opposition, among them Ernst Brosius, E. G. Kusswurm, and Dr. Karl Kabell, pointed out that the associated clubs, <span class="page-break">3</span>pursuing a liberal policy, favored local self-administration, and the election of liberal-minded men. The Bund, therefore, need not interfere in this matter, because once it became mixed up with politics, it would soon mean the end of all its idealistic efforts, and concepts. Politicans would try to muscle in.</p>
   <p>Ernst Brosius especially was very outspoken in his condemnation. He declared that, if the Bund were to go into politics, hundreds of cheap politicians would soon become members, and try to gain control. The Bund would degenerate into a racket. President Ferdinand Walther intimated that he would resign from the chairmanship if the association went in for political experiments. D.B. Brillow, on the other hand, pointed out that the National Bund, with its many dues-paying branch associations, did not have to "play second fiddle " to other associations, which recruited their members from "Little Italy" and "Little Hell". A participation in state and national politics,in conformity with the policy of the Zentral Verband, was indicated. After a lengthy debate,the proposal for <span class="page-break">4</span>participation in politics was rejected by a comfortable majority.</p>
   <p>Unanimously adopted, however, was a proposal by the secretary, Charles Christmanns, to indorse and support [certain] candidates for the board of directors of the state university. Opponents of the Bund's participation in politics were in favor of this proposal, too, since interests of the German element and the promotion of the German language and cultivation of German ideals were involved in this case.</p>
