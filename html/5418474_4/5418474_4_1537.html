   <p>Judge Blodgett; Prosecuting attorneys: Bangs and Ayer; for the defense: Ingersoll, Doolittle and Dow.</p>
   <p>Cross-examination of A. C. Hesing by Ingersoll:</p>
   <p>Hesing: My name is Anthony C. Hesing; I have been living in Chicago and neighborhood since 1854. I know Jacob Rehm and I also was acquainted with him in May, 1875. I had at that time a conversation with Rehm about the defendant Munn. Rehm said it was a shame that Munn had been discharged because Munn, so he said, had never belonged to the conspiracy.</p>
   <p>Ingersoll: Have you had a conversation with Rehm concerning a certain Beck, whom he wanted as tax supervisor in case Munn should be promoted to the office of commissioner?</p>
   <p>Witness: Yes, under the following circumstances. In the year 1874 Ch. Farwell was a candidate for congress, as well as my son, Washington Hesing. Great pressure was put upon me to have my son withdraw his candidacy, but I refused.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Rehm said that would cost much money and I answered that it would cost more than I was able to spend. But I told Rehm that no amount of money would induce me to sell my son; that he knew that I was in bad financial shape and that if he would discount my paper, he would render me a great service. He discounted my notes and took ten per cent interest and bond.</p>
   <p>Ingersoll (gravely): Mr. Hesing, have you really seduced J. Rehm? (Laughter)</p>
   <p>Witness: No, it is too ridiculous.</p>
   <p>Ingersoll: You thus do not need to assume the paternity of the contraband baby.</p>
   <p>Witness: If I had wanted to do that, I could have been at the head of the conspiracy, when I was offered the position of Collector in 1869.</p>
   <p>Cross-examination by Ayer.</p>
   <p>Hesing: There are three indictments against me; one against Rehm, Hoyt and myself for conspiracy; one on account of tax defraudation as distiller (upon <span class="page-break">3</span>this I have pleaded guilty); and one against Miller, Newhaus and myself.</p>
   <p>Since 1862 I have been in the newspaper business, Formerly I was deputy sheriff and sheriff of this county, and I have filled no other public office since. In 1875 I was candidate for the office of county treasurer. In 1870 I bought a third of an interest in the Keller brewery. My partners were Edward Salomon and Joseph Grunkut. I then went to California and later to Europe. When I returned from there after the great fire, the brewery had burned down. In 1872 I was not in partnership with H. B. Miller in a distillery; I paid Rehm money for Miller. After my return from Europe Miller came to me and asked me for a letter of credit and for bond for certain taxes he owed the government, which was at that time legal under the credit system of the tax office. But Collector Irwin received orders from Washington to confiscate the distillery on account of the taxes being in arrears. Irwin said that he could grant Miller no further time, but he accepted my name as sufficient security. In July, Miller told me that he had made some contraband whiskey. He asked me to get him from Rehm a storekeeper who could be trusted. When I told Rehm about it he smiled and said if Miller wants to make contraband whiskey, he must pay $10.00 a barrel and I should collect, because Miller talks too much. From the first $500 I gave him <span class="page-break">4</span>he allowed me $250. Miller knew that I kept part of the money because I had told him myself. From Miller I gave Rehm $1800 and I kept $900.</p>
   <p>In 1873, H. B. Miller was candidate for the office of county treasurer. At that time I surmised that he was crooked, but I was not sure. I supported him and he was elected. He was a good county treasurer and managed the money honestly. Miller paid me part of the interest of the county money, from $500 to $600 a month. From other politicians I have never received any money.</p>
