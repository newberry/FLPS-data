   <p>Chas Taute, a German-American of the 14th ward, is one of the inspectors of sidewalks. These inspectors must now serve as scape-goats for the negligence and blunders of the higher-ups in the city administration of public works, and are accused by the latter of incompetency.</p>
   <p>Taute, however, is determined not to be a scape-goat. He has proofs that he repeatedly called the attention of his superiors to the extremely high bills of the contractors and to the very low quality of material, which was used in the making of sidewalks. He did his duty; and when his superior instructed him to accept the work as it was, he could not do anything else but obey.</p>

   <p>Taute is president of the Improvement Club of the 14th ward, and its 300 members are among the best citizens of the ward. He was again elected president of the club last Saturday in order to convince him that the accusation raised against him did not affect his standing. A committee of 25 members was appointed to request the mayor to grant Taute a public hearing so that he might defend himself.</p>
