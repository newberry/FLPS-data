   <p>While William F. Bryan still calls the undervalued silver Dollar the sole remedy for all social evils, and exerts in vain, to explain some disagreeable facts away from the world, the unlikely more spirited and more versatile Mr. Altgeld has thought already of a new "issue." To the former governor it is not the gold standard that seems to be the worm that gnaws at the heart of the Republic, but the moral corruption and bribery that has spread in the public life of the United States. In his opinion, chiefly the big corporations are to be blamed for this putrifaction, as they hold in their hands the public means of communication, the municipal lighting systems, the coal mines etc. and have secured for themselves, by trickery and by force, the most outrageous privileges. To break the reign of these tyrants, Mr. Altgeld proposes that the nation should take over the great Railways, Telegraph lines and Coal mines and that the communities should get control of all street railways, gas and electric lines.As for Socialism, he says, we are not ripe yet, but the United States could at least go towards state ownership as far as the European countries do. Besides he recommends the establishment of Postal Savings Banks.</p>

   <p>In as far as Mr. Altgeld declares the donation of valuable privileges to certain people or corporations, the fundamental evil of the Republic, he is without doubt in his tight. The "Abendpost" called attention to this matter often during the last election campaign and showed by many examples, that the threatening gigantic fortunes did not grow out of the gold standard, but by the bestowal of monopolies. The latter has become to the politicians an extremely lucrative business, to which they devote their entire energy and time. It has gone so far, that the Congress as well as the State legislatures and the municipal councils occupy themselves only with the wishes of the monopolists, and refuse any activity that does "not pay." On the other side the big corporations recognized a long time ago already, that they cannot attain anything without bribery. As often as they want something they do not offer an adequate payment to the state of the municipality, but they "buy for themselves" the politicians whom the people have intrusted with their representation. Whether the corporations now provoke the corruption, or whether they only take advantage of it, is hard to decide. Perhaps this also is influenced by reciprocity.</p>
   <p>Another question is whether Mr. Altgeld's remedy would eliminate the evil. The <span class="page-break">\3</span>European experiences cannot be called upon for comparison, because the conditions in this country are entirely different, without regard to the fact, that for instance many complaints are made against the state railroads. Mr. Altgeld has big expectations for the Civil Service Reform, but the latter concerns only the lowest ranking employees, who have no influence at all or very little. It is impossible to extend this in the democtatic state to the responsible office holders or even to the legislators.</p>
   <p>With external means alone a sickness cannot be cured, that has poisoned the whole body already. At the end the entire populace is responsible for the corruption of the public life, and therefore can only be checked if public opinion is filled with abhorrence for it. As long as the thieves and crooks are only envied, and not despised, a correction cannot be thought of.</p>
