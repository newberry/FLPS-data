   <p>The hardboiled American sometimes can be very softhearted. He believes in "live and let live." He overlooks the errors of humanity. This is shown in the low percentage of guilty verdicts in Jury actions. The system "make money, my son. Make it honestly, if you can, if you cant, make it anyway." is often followed.</p>
   <p>The average American is very lenient with the political boodler. Exceptions from this are the trusts and great corporations, principally the railways. Everybody seems to be affected. From Washington comes the news, that an investigation has been ordered, which promises some big surprises about irregularities- whether this plan of the Taft administration will be a success or not, will have to be seen.</p>
