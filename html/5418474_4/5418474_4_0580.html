   <p>The Grottkau, or in other words, the anti-conformist branch of the Chicago Socialist Party met last night to nominate its candidates for the coming election. Contrary to the customary noise, the convention proceeded with unusual quiet. The appointment of Mr. Wilhelm Blum, as chairman, and Mr. August Spies, as Secretary, was followed by the usual business routine. At the conclusion of that, the party's platform was read by the secretary, and accepted without any opposition. The party members express in that platform their devotion and loyalty to the principles of International Socialism, emphasizing their absolute independence of any other party. It also explains that equality and welfare of all is the aim of the party.</p>
   <p>Then followed the nomination of candidates. Mr. O'Meara was chosen as candidate for mayor and Mr. Frank Stauber was unanimously nominated for the office of the city treasurer. Mr. A.R. Parsons received the nomination for the city attorney and Mr. J. Belohradski for city clerk. The election of aldermanic candidates fell upon Messrs. Frank Koch, J. Altpeter, Sylvester Artley, Mr. Juelson and Peter Peterson.</p>
