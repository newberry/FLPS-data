   <p>The German Democratic Club of the Fifteenth Ward held a meeting at 577 Larrabee Street yesterday. L. Schwuchow presided, and a large crowd was present.</p>
   <p>The resignation of George Menzel, wherein he stated that business interests prevent him from continuing as financial secretary of the organization was read. E. H. Fischer was then elected financial secretary.</p>
   <p>H. P. Metz offered the following resolutions, which were unanimously adopted:</p>
   <p>"The German Democratic Club of the Fifteenth ward hereby declares that the organization was founded to further the interests of the Democratic party, and to utilize to the fullest extent the power presented by the German-American vote. And we hereby emphasize that no special interests are to be considered, and that it is the duty of the club to oppose all attempts within the party to <span class="page-break">2</span>cater to the few. We declare unequivocally that the organization desires to attain the realization of true Democratic principles, and that efforts in that direction will be the most effective propaganda for the party.</p>
   <p>"And because of this, we expect the German-American Democratic voters to give us their support. The German Democratic Club of the Fifteenth Ward therefore appeals to all who share our view, to found ward clubs in all wards where none has yet been established, and to elect three delegates in every ward to the German Democratic Central Club.</p>
   <p>"It is the object of the Central Club to provide uniform leadership in the ward clubs, and to function as the connecting link with the Democratic party."</p>
   <p>After a general discussion about the prospects of the Democratic party, and acceptance of several new members, the meeting adjourned until the twenty-first day of August.</p>
