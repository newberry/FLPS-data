   <p>The elevated highway from the Loop to the west end of the city has been debated for some time. It is an old wish and a pressing need for transportation. Transportation to the west of the city, as far as roads are concerned, has been treated in a step-motherly fashion as compared with the north or the south. Washington Boulevard is the main thoroughfare, and, particularly during the rush hours, it is so overcrowded that it is difficult to use it without peril. And the many traffic lights compel the motorist to stop so often that he is able to proceed very slowly. On Sundays and holidays it is a veritable torture to travel from the Loop to the west of the city and back. For these reasons the demand has been made for an elevated highway which would ease traffic congestion.</p>
   <p>Not very long ago, a plan was evolved in which the estimated costs amounted to a round sum of twenty-seven million dollars. Its financing was to be done in part by the city and in part by the state. But the plans were turned down because the city's finances were low, as is usually the case. The West Park authorities put the question of building an elevated road to a vote, but the project was tabled, probably because the neighboring real-estate owners feared they would have to pay higher taxes. So the plan was dismissed.</p>
   <p>Now news has reached us from Springfield that the plans for an elevated road are going to be resumed. We are told that the new legislature will, in the coming year, pass the resolution to build the road. It will probably be patterned after the familiar plan which makes traveling possible from the west to the business center, and vice versa, and to shorten traveling time by twenty minutes. We can only hope that the legislature rises to the occasion. By building the road, thousands of people will be put to work, and traffic will be eased. At the same time, the risk from accidents will be minimized, for the smoother the traffic, the less danger that accidents will occur.</p>
   <p>Costs, we are told, will be defrayed by gasoline taxes. But the fund accruing from those taxes has in the past been made to serve all possible purposes, and today it serves those purposes only to a small extent; namely, to build new roads and to maintain them. Under pressure of necessity, like using gasoline taxes for the financing of aid to indigents, such deviation may be justified. But the exception should not be made a rule, and over and above the general needs of today, the true implication of taxes on gasoline should not be forgotten. Even if the State of Illinois is famous for being among those having the best highways in the whole country, the unburdening of traffic in the west of the city is all the same a necessity which cannot be denied.</p>
   <p>It is up to Chicago, which until now has done such a magnificent job of city planning, not to be outdone in building the elevated road and in serving as a model for other cities, because the development of the modern metropolis moves forward with giant strides, and the blazing of a trail for this progress is an aid to civilization for which all the money spent is not too much to pay.</p>
