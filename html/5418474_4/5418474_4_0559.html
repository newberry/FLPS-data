   <p>The German Democrats are in open revolt at the attempted dictation of the State Central Committee. Every German publication in Chicago, daily, weekly, or otherwise, is against Cregier. The German business-men and the German politicians denounce the State Central Committeemen as "interlopers who wants to dictate to the people of Chicago who they shall elect to supervise the expenditure of their taxes and to administer their local affairs".</p>
   <p>The Bohemian leaders are equally emphatic. L.W. Kadlec, the well-known Bohemian who used to be a member of the Public Library Board, said yesterday:</p>
   <p>"This business is intolerable. I am a Democrat but I will not be dragooned into voting for Cregier by Mr. Peck of Wisconsin, Mr. Ewig of Bloomington, Mr. McDonald of Jacksonville, or Gen. Black of Danville. What business has the State Committee to interfere in our local affairs? If it becomes necessary in order to defeat this attempt at dictation by impudent interlopers, I will vote for Hemstead Washburne".</p>
