   <p>The "Abendpost" has called on all candidates eligible as members of the City council in the next election regarding their position on the resolutions made at the recent protest meeting. Only one of the thirty-one aldermen Jonathan Ruxton of the 34th ward has declared himself against a special license to associations; according to his opinion, such action would increase greatly the danger of the dance halls. He also thinks it unlawful to give the permit to one association and refuse it to another. The Democratic candidate Finn of the 29th ward refused to state his opinion and said that the state law forbids the permit of a special license. Thirteen of thirty-one candidates have agreed to vote for a change of the ordinance if elected; so that social associations, against whose reputations nothing bad is known can obtain a special license to sell alcoholic drinks <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>at their festivals. It is expected that the remaining candidates according to their expressed opinions will also vote for the change.</p>
