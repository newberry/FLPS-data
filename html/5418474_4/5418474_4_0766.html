   <p>Governor Altgeld has nominated Mr. Ed. G. Uchlein for a second term as a member of the Westside Park Commission for the period ending 1902. Mr. Uchlein has always been a great friend of horticulture and gardens and his private greenhouses belong to the most beautiful ones of Chicago. During the last years he has procured from his own private means hundreds of rare plants and ornamental shrubs for the Parks of the Westside and it is chiefly to his credit, that these parks, without doubt, take at present first place among all public places in the U. S. of America as far as views of flowers are concerned. By his renomination , the Governor has rendered a valuable service to the park.</p>
