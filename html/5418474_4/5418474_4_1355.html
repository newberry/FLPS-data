   <p>Ex-Governor Altgeld did not reply to the open letter of the County Judge, so far. He contents himself, with declaring same in general terms as "weak", and says, that he will probably answer later.</p>
   <p>Judge Carter thinks, the silence of the Ex-Governor is the best proof, that his talk about extensive frauds, which allegedly have taken place during the last presidential election, is nothing but babble. It is to be regretted, that a prominent man like Mr. Altgeld should lower himself, to throw groundless denunciations among the masses, which would only have a damaging influence on the opinions of those, who took same for granted.</p>
