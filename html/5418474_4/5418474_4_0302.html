   <p>The Socialists held a meeting at 99 West Randolph Street yesterday afternoon, and many party members were present. The purpose of the meeting was to reconsider the list of candidates, since the original selections met with considerable objections in Socialist circles.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stahl was named chairman, and Mr. Morgan acted as secretary.</p>
   <p>The chairman called the meeting to order and explained its purpose. He said that the choice of candidates made two weeks ago had caused considerable dissatisfaction in many sections, and that requests had been received from various sources to provide a new ticket. The list of proposed candidates submitted by <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>various local sections was read by the secretary.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the names of candidates proposed by the several local bodies, the chairman suggested that the assembly proceed forthwith with the nominations. The suggestion was accepted, and the office of county treasurer was first considered. Mr. Altpeter and Mr. Juergensen were named: the former received 118 votes, while Juergensen polled only 14.</p>
   <p>The chairman then announced that a candidate for county commissioner of the North Side was to be chosen, and, that, as several gentlemen had declined to accept, it would now be a question whether Alex Eilert should be nominated or Mr. Davoust, who was favored by the Scandinavian and French sections. According to the vote, 114 were in favor of Eilert, and 28 preferred Davoust.</p>
   <p>Messrs. John Gimbel, C. Johnson, O. A. Bishop and Leo Meilbeck were proposed as candidates for county commissioner. However, before a vote was taken, Mr. Schilling declared that it was imprudent to select so many German <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>candidates, because that would arouse antagonism among Americans--we would be ridiculed. The remark produced strong objections, particularly among the German constituents, and it appeared that a disturbance would result there from, but several members interceded in time and allayed the excitement by declaring that such assertions were entirely uncalled for, and that the nominations were not based on nationality but on the character of individuals. The debate became rather lively, and one of the members of the Lehr-Und Wehrverein [Education and Defence Association], who entirely ignored the chair-man's insistance upon order, was asked to leave the assembly, and did so in a very spectacular manner and with loud protests. After this incident, the assembly proceeded with the nominations. Erich Johnson received 100 votes; Leo Meilbeck, 101. These gentlemen were declared nominated, since Gimbel was given only 60 votes, and 0. A. Bishop had but 36 supporters.</p>
   <p>James White was nominated for county commissioner of the South Side. He received 78 votes; John Ryan, 45; Henry Smith 10.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Mr. Bowler was slated as clerk of the superior court; his nomination was unanimous, as was that of Mr. Wedekind for surveyor.</p>
   <p>After the new ticket was nearly completed, a collection was taken up to pay the hall rent, and then the assembly proceeded with the most important issue--selection of a candidate for judge of the superior court.</p>
   <p>The nomination resulted in a lively debate, caused mainly by two differing opinions. It was emphasized by one contingent of the party that only a Socialist should be considered, and that the members should not, under any circumstances, vote for Democratic or Republican candidates. The other faction expressed the view that the Socialists should first ascertain who will be nominated by the other two political parties, and then support one of these candidates, since there is no one in the Socialist party who is sufficiently versed in legal matters to assume the responsibility of such a high judicial position.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>According to the written requests sent by the various Socialist sections, Harry Rubens was highly recommended as a candidate for judge of the superior court, while a few local bodies suggested former Judge Booth, who has been known as a very liberal-minded man.</p>
   <p>A lengthy debate ensued. Several people in the assembly declared that Mr. Rubens had declined the nomination at an earlier date, and so a resolution was passed that it would be detrimental to the party if it were admitted that no capable men could be found in the ranks, and that, even if Mr. Rubens had declined, a Socialist would have to be nominated--otherwise the Democratic and Republican "ticket peddlers" would pester the Socialist voters, and this would lead to dissention in our party, and might bring about serious difficulties. A candidate should be chosen forthwith--a man who would be willing to accept--if Harry Rubens again refuses the proferred nomination.</p>
   <p>The resolution was adopted, and Mr. Juergensen was nominated. He received 50 votes; Mr. Buckleen, 35. The former will therefore be the party's candidate <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>if Harry Rubens again declines.</p>
   <p>The proceedings lasted until it became too dark to continue the deliberations, and so the chairman declared that an organizer and financial secretary for the Socialist Party would be selected on another day. The assembly adjourned at about six o'clock in the evening.</p>
