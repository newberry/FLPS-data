   <p>Among the Democratic candidates for the County Council we find the name of George F. Ruh, at the eleventh place on the list. Born and reared on the North Side, he has, by hard work, perseverance, and honest dealing with others, earned for himself a respected position in the business world. He has always been very interested in questions concerning the public welfare, which has made him familiar with problems the County Council has to solve. The fact that both factions support and endorse him, the regular Democratic faction of the Twenty-Fourth Ward, and the United Democracy of that ward as well, shows the high esteem which he enjoys among his fellow citizens regardless of factional partisanship. George F. Ruh is president of the ice company of the same name, which he founded thirty-three years ago.</p>
