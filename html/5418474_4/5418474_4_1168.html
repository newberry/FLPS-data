   <p>More expressions of sympathy were received yesterday by A. C. Hesing. He received a bunch of flowers, to which the following note was attached: "To Mr. A. C. Hesing, as token of our sincere sympathy, from several North Side ladies." A most appreciated token of sympathy, was a letter from an influential American, a former county judge, who now occupies a high position in the Republican state party. The letter reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Morris, Ill., June 28.</p>
   <p>"Mr. A. C. Hesing.</p>
   <p>"My old friend! I wish to express my sympathy to you and also wish to assure you that my trust in your honesty and integrity has not diminished.</p>
   <p>"your noble intentions, your independence and virility have long since gained my admiration. Although I did not always agree with you, I have never doubted your integrity. Now, my friend Hesing, can I do anything to help you regain your liberty? Would a petition by our fellow citizens help? I would be most happy to render you a service that would restore you to your family.</p>
   <p>W. T. H."</p>
