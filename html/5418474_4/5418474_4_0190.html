   <p>A great political meeting was held by the German Democratic Club of the Sixteenth Ward yesterday, in the hall at 440 Noble Street. Mr. Joseph Klein presided and Mr. John Hauber acted as secretary.</p>
   <p>The speakers told the crowd of the necessity of electing an alderman who is just, who has an unblemished character, and who is respected by all nationalities, and after announcing that Mr. Peter Kiolbassa is a candidate for alderman of the Sixteenth Ward, they praised his high character and also the disinterestedness shown by him when, as city treasurer, he turned over all the fees of that office--which he could rightfully have claimed as his own--to the city for the use of its citizens.</p>
   <p>The news of his candidacy was received with wild enthusiasm, and it was unanimously decided that the club should support the candidacy of Mr. Kiolbassa with all its strength.</p>

   <p>A committee was immediately selected to notify Mr. Kiolbassa of this decision, and Mr. Rudolph and Mr. Kirstein, among others, were chosen for this committee.</p>
