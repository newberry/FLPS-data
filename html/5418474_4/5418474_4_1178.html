   <p>A. C. Hesing has been beaten by a small majority. It is apparent that A. C. Hesing has been beaten by Mr. Keeley and not by the friends of Mr. Huck (by them only in so far, as they provided funds which enabled Keeley to continue his fight.) Mr. Hesing had to fight against the combined campaign of lies of the Tribune, Times, Inter-Ocean, and Journal.</p>
   <p>The entire fight was a contest of personalities and of the three, A. C. Hesing was by far the most outstanding. One remarkable fact of the campaign was that nothing detrimental to the honesty of A. C. Hesing was brought to light.</p>
