   <p>A few years ago, when Mayor Harrison opposed the late Sheriff Barrett for control of the local party organization and occasionally denounced the rule of political "bosses", a smartalecky newspaper reporter asked him: "But don't you yourself try to become the boss of the Democratic party organization in the county?" "Oh no," replied Mr. Harrison, "there are 'bosses' and 'leaders'; my only ambition is to be the leader of my party in public affairs." After more than a decade has passed, this question seems well justified: Has Harrison ever been a leader in the sense he applied to that term?</p>
   <p>Take the street car problem, for instance, which to solve he always had the same "patent medicine" handy while the election campaign was on, and always the same promises! Doesn't it sound ironical, if he begins his annual <span class="page-break">\2</span>report to the City Council for the period from May 1, 1913 to April 30, 1914, with the following words: "Chicago is faced with a street car problem. How can it be solved?" Let's take the telephone monopoly. When the Illinois Telephone and Tunnel Company obtained a thirty-year franchise in 1899, the automatic telephone, introduced by this company, was to provide competition and therefore assure better and cheaper service. The automatic telephone has become legend today; instead the above-named company owns an extensive tunnel system which it was able to build through the friendly co-operation of the chief building commissioner. This tunnel system was to become the unencumbered property of the city in 1929, according to the terms of the franchise, but the fulfillment of this provision has been forestalled by all kinds of manipulations. Now let's take the gas monopoly. Instead of the promised seventy cent rate, the consumers are paying eighty cents today, and all competition has been eliminated by the merger of the Ogden Gas Company with the People's Gas Light and Coke Company. Now we come to the problem of municipal ownership of the public utilities. When former Governor Altgeld, during his election campaign for mayor, advocated municipal ownership of such <span class="page-break">\3</span>enterprises, Mr. Harrison declared that "such institutions may be all right for Europe, but do not fit the American spirit of free enterprise". But when public opinion reacted favorably to Mr. Altgeld's ideas, poster pictures of Harrison appeared all of a sudden, bearing the inscription "Garter H. Harrison, the champion of public ownership".</p>
   <p>During the past weeks, Mr. Harrison has cluttered up the house walls with giant posters, praising the accomplishments of his last administration and unscrupulously assumes credit not only for things that never got started, or proved failures, like "Unemployment Relief" etc., but also for projects which have materialized through long years of effort by other groups, like the municipal dance halls (the work of women's organizations), the bathing beaches and playgrounds (the work of civic-minded aldermen), etc.</p>
   <p>But when Harrison goes so far as to claim credit for improving the police force and for taking the school board out of politics, we think it is a big joke.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Harrison's official career does not show one single incident where he has ever taken the initiative in important and worthwhile matters, or where he has grasped and competently took advantage of an opportunity to further the city's interests. But whenever public opinion "kicked him in the pants to get a move out of him," to use the expression of a well-known suffragette, nearly all the achievements of his administration have been accompanied by sordid and notorious side issues. For instance, when the garbage disposal plant was taken over, land was purchased at exorbitant prices from political favorites; the acquisition of school grounds [real estate] was tainted with shady manipulations of his West Side politician friends, who gypped the city out of tens of thousands of dollars; a million dollar contract for voting machines; the purchase of land for harbor improvements from a group of politicians, who cannot furnish a clear title for it; street repairs made with inferior material, and at enormous costs, which netted his political cronies a pile of dough; etc.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Just like England managed to win allies by promising them territory belonging to other nations, Carter Harrison has afforded the leaders of political groups opportunities to get reimbursed for their expenditures and efforts, made on his behalf, by giving them contracts for public works or similar deals at the taxpayer's expense, and it must be stated in all fairness that the German-Americans have not been the beneficiaries of that kind of raid on the city treasury.</p>
   <p>Neither has Harrison scored any appreciable success politically, although he was able to exert quite an influence on the Board of Elections through a New York publisher, who owns two Chicago papers. The way he was elected mayor with a majority of a little over 3,000 votes is best illustrated by the pre-election statement of a ward heeler of the First Ward, who said: "Providing they don't check up on us too closely, we'll give Harrison a majority of 4,500, but we are prepared for 3,000 anyway". At several <span class="page-break">\6</span>elections that have taken place since he became mayor, there were indications of vote frauds, always in favor of Harrison-sponsored candidates, which on one occasion necessitated the appointment of another state's attorney, since the elected state's attorney, who was only indirectly involved in the scandal, assumed a nonco-operative attitude, although he belonged to the Harrison faction. When the Harrison friends refused to vote for the necessary funds in the county council to carry out the investigation, the means had to be raised by voluntary contributions of the citizenry. The things that were revealed at these vote fraud investigations caused only a few to be sentenced, but it was enough to demonstrate to the citizens of Chicago that Harrison was mainly motivated by political ambitions and by a desire to make his own position secure.</p>
   <p>Harrison Scoffs at German-Americans</p>
   <p>Politics for selfish gains has been the formula for Harrison's public career. Personal politics has dictated his actions, his appointments [of friends], <span class="page-break">\7</span>his methods of administration. Being a professional politician made him a drawback to Chicago's progress and prevented him from granting the German-American element a participation in the city government proportionate to their number and capacity as taxpayers. It makes no difference whether Mr. Harrison resorts to that old trick and cries "Hold the thief!", to divert attention from himself. He has always tried to drown out unwelcome criticism by crying "Politics!" The impending primary election, which will determine various nominees for the office of mayor, is therefore of extraordinary significance for the citizens and taxpayers of Chicago. Democratic voters who believe that the "achievements" of the present city administration justify its continuance for another four years, will vote for Carter Harrison for the sixth time. But people who think that greater energy and competence in the municipal service is to be desired, that politics should be eliminated and progressive ideas given a chance, will certainly vote for Harrison's opposing candidate. Democratic-minded German-Americans, who do believe that "blood is thicker than water" and who remember the way [Harrison] scoffed at <span class="page-break">\8</span>the German element a little while ago, even though he pours chocolate on them today, will prefer to give their vote to Robert M. Sweitzer next Tuesday.</p>
