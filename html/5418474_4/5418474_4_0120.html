   <p>At the annual meeting of the German-American Citizens Union, all officials were re-elected. After the election, an animated debate about the general conditions of the society was held.</p>
   <p>Of special interest was the yearly report of President Lorenz Schlegel, who pointed to the necessity of an independent participation in the election battle, to protect the personal liberty and lives of individual families, as well as of societies, and also to re-conquer the lost rights which were taken away by the Volstead law. He was greatly applauded.</p>
   <p>The president then demanded that all members of the union participate in this great cause, with all their ability and place themselves upon the right side of the combat.</p>
