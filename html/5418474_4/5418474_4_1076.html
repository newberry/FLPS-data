   <p>Our friend, W. Hesing, has earned exceptional honor at the last election campaign. Hesing's practical and famous advice, which he gave Cleveland regarding his speech of acceptance, and also his efforts extended toward arrangement of the western headquarters in Chicago, as well as his energetic and far reaching support of the same, gained for him well deserved recognition.</p>
   <p>Not a few of the German-American newspapers expressed the opinion that Hesing is prompted in his efforts by a desire for a high public office. The name of W. Hesing, therefore, has been brought in connection with all kinds of political offices since the election.</p>
   <p>In order to stop these rumors, we declare solemnly that neither W. Hesing nor any other official of the Illinois Staats Zeitung is striving for a federal office.</p>
   <p>The Illinois Staats Zeitung supported Cleveland simply, because the officials had the honest conviction that Cleveland's election would benefit the whole country.</p>
