   <p>Like those personally interested in the agitation that has arisen against the fire limit ordinance we feel moved to the strongest reprobation of those who last night, after the demonstration of citizens of the North Side was ended and after most of the participants had already left the neighbour-hood of the City Hall, threw stones into the windows of the session room of the City Council.</p>
   <p>Like the personally interested we, too, regret of course deeply that such an act of wantoness has occurred. We are convinced that it could have been executed only by boy gangsters (Gassenbuben). The idea suggests itself that they acted by order of those who were displeased with the aim of the demonstration, and to whom no device can be too low for the manifestation of their displeasure.</p>
