   <p>A pretty large number of voters have become emancipated from the old party slavery to the extent that they do not blindly vote for the whole ticket but pick their better men. That goes of course only for local or state elections while in national elections the voters still follow their habit and the party whip.</p>
   <p>Now, since the better man, Cleveland, has had his chance for correcting governmental systems what has he actually done? In place of Republican machine bosses, Republican boodlers and thieves in customs-houses, post-offices, navy-yards, government-offices and public buildings, etc., there are now Democratic-machine bosses, Democratic boodlers, Democratic thieves!</p>
   <p>Since Jackson's slogan: "To the victor belong the spoils" represents the most important part of the unwritten constitution of this country it was customary to change all governementpositions with the victorious political parties. Now we have to give Cleveland credit for keeping 7 3/8 percent of the Republican boddle-guard on their jobs.</p>
   
   <p>Of course they have to contribute to the Democratic party-fund.</p>
   <p>Harrison or Cleveland - to vote for either one is the same as getting roses from a thorn-brush as the better man in this case is - none.</p>
