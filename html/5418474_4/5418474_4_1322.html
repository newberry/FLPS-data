   <p>The present investigation of the alleged profiteering, ordered by the Senate, resulted in some rather unpleasant revelations, according to the report by the Federal Commission of Commerce submitted to the President. Unpleasant yes, because the report excludes any doubt that certain individuals, as well as corporations, took unjust advantage of our present predicament.</p>
   <p>The Government and the people were, of course, in need of certain foods and materials, and those in a position to supply us with these commodities availed themselves of the opportunity to indulge in illegal profits. Such business tactics are contemptible even in normal times, but in time of War, it is nothing less than a crime. The fact that in some instances trick bookkeeping has been practiced in order to cover up the perversity of profiteering is proof that the guilty persons were well aware of the committed transgressions. Those who chose this shameful way of enriching themselves at the cost of the Nation should be adequately dealt with. Publicity of their transgressions seems no adequate punishment for the crime, because whoever has the audacity to try to enrich himself during the period of War at the cost of his fellowmen, is not the sensitive type. He would, at the most, only sneer at a scandal. His pocketbook contains his honor.</p>
   <p>It is within the Government's power to recompense itself and also the fleeced people from the profiteer's unreasonable accumulation of wealth, and in addition it may provide a cure for the loathsome disease. Information about the incredibly high rate of profits taken by some of the war supply firms may be derived from several instances found in the report of the Commission of Commerce. Thus the United States Steel Corporation registered a 4.7 per cent profit on its invested capital in 1912, while in 1914, the profit rate dropped to 2.8 per cent, then in 1915, it rose to 5.2 per cent; in 1916, to 15.6 per cent, and in 1917, to 24.9 per cent. Thus the year 1917 yielded that company a profit of no less than four hundred seventy-eight million dollars. And even then, when income and excess profit taxes have already been deducted, the remaining two hundred forty-five million dollars is still a nice little sum to be divided among the shareholders of the company. However, this enormous profiteering by the said organization is moderate in comparison with other steel manufacturing corporations found to make a profit of between 40.03 percent and 319.67 per cent. Armour, Swift, Morris, and Cudahy, meat packers of Chicago, averaged a profit of 16.8 per cent, 26.7 per cent, 18.5 per cent, and 18.7 per cent, respectively, during the year 1917, according to the report.</p>
   <p>Similar conditions prevail in other branches of supply companies. A salmon conservation company in the West disclosed a sixty-two per cent profit in the past year. All these profiteers should be adequately dealt with, and their officials likewise, who receive enormous salaries and commissions, which corresponds, of course, with the illegally high profits. The commission reported an instance wherein the president of a metal corporation whose salary and commission equalled $364,000 during the year 1917. . . .</p>
   <p>Such conditions must be curbed by Congress. President Wilson did the proper thing when he addressed Congress on May 27 as follows: "We cannot reach the evil of profiteering either by appeal to the transgressor's conscience, nor through patriotic appeal, however, one infallible course is open to us, it is taxation." Yes, the removal of this evil is within the power of Congress.</p>
