   <p>The executive committee of the German-American Democratic Club was in session yesterday evening. Three new ward clubs have been organized, according to reports. The consideration of resolutions in regard to the school question, which was approved at the last regular meeting, has been requested to complete its findings by Monday, May 19th, so that the resolutions of the club can be submitted to the next Democratic State Convention, which is scheduled to take place in Springfield, during the early part of June. The demands ask for a change in the present compulsory school law, namely, that reading and writing in English must be taught in all schools, but that instruction in private or parochial schools may be given in that language which the parents consider the most suitable.</p>
