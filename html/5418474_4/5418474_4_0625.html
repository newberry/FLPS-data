   <p>And now, even the Illinois Staat-Zeitung, the principal Germanic newspaper in Illinois, lifts itself, out of its habitual advocacy of "personal politics" long enough to give expression to its approval of the forthcoming September convention for honest money and a free market. The Staats-Zeitung finds it difficult to get out of its narrow rut all at once. It must speak of the Opposition convention as if it were intended particularly to express opposition to "the paper money swindle and the temperance tyranny." The credit-money swindle is national; like the protective tariff swindle, it is a swindle and a tyranny which makes every honest producer a victim to licensed robbers and monopolists. The "temperance tyranny" is only another mode of applying the principle of the credit-money swindle and the protective-tariff swindle and the subsidy-giving swindle; but it is a mode of tyranny that afflicts only a comparatively small number of people, mostly inhabitants of cities and populous towns. It is essentially a local tyranny, exercised by local police authorities, under local ordinances.</p>
   
   <p>Its scale is narrow, and not broad and national like that on which the political power at Washington enforces the most tyrannical robbery over the whole country, in every state, every county, city, township, hamlet, and household, - by statutes that arbitrarily exclude all men from the freedom of the market and the money of the world.</p>
   <p>The Times is neither defending nor apologizing for what the Staats-Zeitung calls the "temperance tyranny." Among the most reprehensible of statutes are all of those known sumptuary laws" statute whereby the political agency assumes to prescribe what men shall or shall not eat, drink or wear. They are not any more defensible than statutes which prescribe that men shall use in their exchanges of commodities, and in all their buying and selling and contracting a mere form of obligation which is not an equivolent of value, and not anything but a worthless bit of paper with a printed lie on it. They are not anymore defensible than statutes which prescribe that one part of society shall contribute of the things they have labored for to enrich a more favored class of persons who have not earned them.</p>
   
   <p>They are simply other modes of applying the paternalistic principle, upon which principle. Negroes were formerly deprives of their natural liberty to exercise their individual rights of labor, and upon which principle both white men and Negroes are still deprived of their natural liberty to exercise their individual right to sell the products of their labor in the world's market for the world's money. Against the practice of the paternal system by the political agency, in any mode or form whatever, the spirit of modern progress, and what a recent Fourth-of-July orator has called the "ensouling idea" of American nationality, protests. What the time and the occasion demand is not a mere local crusade against this or that particular mode of applying the paternalistic system in a particular community, to a particular class of persons; it is a grand movement against the paternalistic system, aimed most particularly at those modes of its application which affect injuriously the largest interests of the whole nation. There is no national freedom without individual freedom. What is called national liberty and independence is nothing, can be nothing, but the ratio of individual liberty and independence. It is common to style this a "free country."</p>
   
   <p>It is a more free country than Turkey in the degree that its inhabitants have more individual freedom than the Turks have; but to speak of a country as "free" whose government arbitrarily debarsits inhabitants from the money and market of the world, and says to one part of them. "You shall labor to enrich this other part, composed of the tariff monopolists and credit-money swindlers," is to utter a gigantic lie.</p>
   <p>The avowed purposes of the September convention might otherwise be expressed in these words: The Liberty of the Individual,-the Freedom of the Money and the Market of the World.</p>
   <p>With this comprehension political sentiment, the Staats-Zeitung seems to be in accord, though somewhat inclined to favor a particular local application of it as more important then a wide national application. But as the Germanic organ esponses the projected September Convention, there is hope that it will grow out of its narrow groove in the course of the next six or seven weeks; to the degree, at least, of not insisting that a mere local application of the non-interference principle shall overshadow the application of it to the national issues now pressing for decision.</p>
