   <p>To the question of the interviewer if his step had, "The political significance that certain people ascribed to it"? Mr. Raster answered:</p>
   <p>"The whole affair is purely personal which of course will not prevent the papers from imputing to it such significance as they will find agreeable. As far as the Illinois Staats Zeitung is concerned, I will only say that editor and publisher of the Zeitung have expressed their political convictions without giving my personal position the least consideration. From that follows, automatically, that my resignation has no relation to the attitude of the Zeitung.</p>
