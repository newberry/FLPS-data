   <p>It is without doubt, that the Germans in Chicago will receive the deserved consideration from the Democratic party. The greater part of them, who have declared themselves for Cleveland and Stevenson have not done this on account of a lust for jobs and therefore will not burden the present government with claims, but naturally they have the patriotic wish to take, part in the expected reforms of the Public affairs. As one of the most prominent German-Americans and most deserving one, Mr. Carl Schurz has been named for a position in Clevelands cabinet. Mr. Schurz has just recovered from a long illness and it is a question if he is physically strong enough for such a strenuous position. In this case there will be no question that the president can find another prominent German for this place. Most of the best suited Germans are too modest to push themselves forward but Cleveland knows best how to value the men, who prefer that they are looked for by the office. However, there would be no harm done if the Democratic and independent German Press would give him some indications.</p>
