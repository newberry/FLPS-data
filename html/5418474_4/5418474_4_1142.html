   <p>The Germans cannot complain about the distribution of elective offices in the County, when the majority of offices will be filled by Germans after the first Monday in December.</p>
   <p>The County has the following elective offices in which will be filled as follows: State's Attorney, L. L. Mills, American; Sheriff, Ch. Kern, German; County Clerk, Gen. Lieb, German; Coroner, E. Dietzsch, German; Recorder, J. W. Brockway, American; Clerk of the Superior Court, J. J. Healey, Irish; Clerk of the Circuit Court, J. Gross, German; County Treasurer, L. C. Huck, German; Clerk of the Criminal Court, A. Doyle, Irish. As can be seen, the Germans fill nine offices, while the Americans and Irish fill only two each. Besides that, the Germans hold the most remunerative and influential offices i. e., the sheriff, county treasurer, and county clerk office.</p>

   <p>But the Irish are strongly represented in the County Council. Ayars, American; Busse or Serme, German; Carroll, Irish; Cleary, Irish; Gunther, German; Hoffmann, Danish; McCaffrey, Irish; Tabor, American; Lenzen, German; Fitzgerald, Irish; Bradley, Irish; Schmidt, German; Mulloy, Irish; Conley, Irish.</p>
   <p>This proves, that the Americans do not have the representation to which they are entitled.</p>
