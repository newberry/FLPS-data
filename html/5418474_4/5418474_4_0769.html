   <p>There are 19 German Aldermen in our city council, and 15 of these voted for the acceptance of the new gas-ordinance, which not only provides no income for the City of Chicago, but also is a splendid occasion for some individuals to make a stack of money at the expense of the taxpayers.</p>
   <p>The mayor was honest enough to explain the sober facts of the situation and left the decision to an honest, loyal vote of the city council, which accepted the said ordinance without much deliberation. This acceptance would have been impossible without the weight of the German vote, which in this particular case has been an unforgettable disappointment for us. The black list of those German aldermen, who have voted for the ordinance, is composed of the following names: Vogt, Stuckart, Ellert, Kuntz, Potthoff, Hage, Mulhaenser, Kleineeke, Lutter, Finkler, Hausen, Utesrh, Miller, Wilt, Berger.</p>
