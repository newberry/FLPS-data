   <p>The Times calls "incendiaries" all who want to permit the owners of houses that burnt down to build wooden huts. Obviously this characterization must find application with double force on all those who build wooden barracks even inside the old fire limit.</p>
   <p>This is what W. F. Storey has done. Yes, the grey old scoundrel who calls the decent German workers and craftsmen on the North Side "incendiaries," because they don't have money enough to build stone houses, has for himself secured the privilege to build in the middle of the business section on the West Side a tinder-box in which he maintains an easily inflammable industry (steam printing).....</p>
   <p>And such a scoundrel thinks he can call decent German workers "incendiaries" (Mordbrenner). Would it not be high time that somebody administered to this creature another portion of Lydia Thompson?</p>
