   <p>Again nothing has come of the smashing of the Republican Party machine in Chicago. In spite of the terrible indignation (of the newspapers!) over the "snap" convention advertised by the bosses, in spite of Uncle Allerton of the influential newspapers and the elegant clubs, the "gang" was victor along the entire front. It also defeated Congressman Foss in the Seventh District, for whom the entire Republican respectability stood up. Doc Jameson, Billy Lorimer, Painter Pease and Henry Cormorant Herz proved anew, that they are the Republican Party of Cook County, and that without their permission no sparrow-candidate can sit on the roof.</p>
   <p>It would be silly to believe that the Republican voters will revolt against the list of candidates who were already selected before the convention by the bosses and that they will destroy the slate on election day. Although today the "independent" Republican Newspapers call this list a selection of rogues hedgepoliticians and ignorant ward bums, but their fury will quiet down. In the same way the elegant Republican Clubs will cool off, considerably before election day: "for the National ticket's sake", which must be elected at any cost, one not only will swallow shoe nails, but also his own disgraceful speeches.</p>
   
   <p>Also politics is a business which must be learned and mastered. Amateurs alone cannot succeed against experts and masters of the trade.</p>
