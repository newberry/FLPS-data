   <p>A very amusing scene took place yesterday in the city council room. Aldermen Cullerton, Wheeler and Thompson, functioning as a committee, were investigating what had become of the money taken by von Hollen. Orders to appear were sent to owners of prominent gambling houses. The committee was so informal in its proceedings that newspaper reporters did not know an inquiry was taking place. Not one witness was sworn in. George Holt said that von Hollen gambled several times in his tavern, sometimes losing $1,600. Similar reports were made by the other owners of gambling houses, and this ended the big investigation.</p>
