   <p>The Times mentions today that Michigan seems to produce only millionaires as senators, referring to Palmer Stockbridge and James McMillan, and winds up its article with the supposedly harmless question:</p>
   <p>"Is there no chance for anybody to get elected senator in Michigan but millionaires?"</p>
   <p>The Times knows well enough that the body of the senators consists almost entirely of millionaires or their henchmen, and that even these henchmen soon become millionaires if they are crooked enough - and that's exactly what almost all of them are.</p>
