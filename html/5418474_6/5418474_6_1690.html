   <p>The extraordinary success of the last song festival brought good results. Not only was an opportunity provided to hear the singing societies of the larger cities, but the performances proved to be a stimulus to the Americans. The great festival orchestra was purposely restricted to men of western cities in order to prove that a local orchestra could excel even without the aid of talent from remote places, and that Chicago's orchestra could be absolutely independent if a little support were received. Apparently this intention was realized. The splendid orchestral performances as well as the great impression made by the choral groups prompted a number of music lovers to see Mr. [Hans] Balatka [German orchestra leader] and organize a musical society. And as a result of the conference the Mozart Club was born.</p>
   <p>The Club, at present, consists of an American chorus of sixty to eighty select voices. For concerts a full symphony orchestra will be engaged. The Mozart Club is already incorporated, and at yesterday's session John V. LeMoyne was <span class="page-break">2</span>elected president for one year, and Hans Balatka director.</p>
