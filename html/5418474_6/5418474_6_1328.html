   <p>The Wirthsverein (Tavern Keepers' Association) held its regular meeting yesterday. After reading the minutes, Peter Miller quoted figures from the financial report of the Association, giving details since its founding on March 7, 1879. The following items appear: initiation fees and dues, $1,421.25; collections, $836.40; receipts from picnic, $185.53; total, $2,443.30 (sic). Expenditures were $1,712.55 leaving a balance of $730.53 (sic). The report was accepted.</p>
   <p>The Committee on Legal Affairs read the report of its meeting held the previous day. Adolf Mueller spoke in behalf of Mr. Freyer, an expelled member, and made a motion for a thorough investigation. It was decided, however, that, as the assembly had already passed the resolution, it would not be desirable to reconsider the case.</p>
   <p>Peter Mueller made a motion that the saloonkeepers should not be obliged to pay <span class="page-break">2</span>a poolroom license in compliance with the existing ordinances, and that such a declaration be published in the newspapers.</p>
   <p>An unsavory debate then took place on the question of the presence or absence of the Association's attorney, Mr. Rubens, and it ended with the sensible assertion that the lawyer will be present during meetings if necessary, but that he may also attend to other business. No definite conclusion was reached on this matter.</p>
   <p>Mahr made a motion that Mr. Baum, treasurer of the Collection Committee, should submit a report at the next session.</p>
   <p>L. Schwuchow's motion to grant a donation to the flood sufferers in Hungary resulted in a lively discussion. Several of those present asserted that the money is more urgently needed to fight the fanatics of the temperance movement.</p>
   <p>When this discussion ended, A. Mueller made a motion that Mr. Baum give to the Association all the money the latter still has in his possession. Thereupon the president replied that Mr. Baum will make his report to the proper committee, and <span class="page-break">3</span>that this report will be submitted to the Association.</p>
   <p>After a tiresome debate on the subject of paying the attorney, Peter Mueller indulged in a justified tirade about the "honorable" Paxton, "equestrian afoot," and made a motion to nominate a vigilance committee of which he [Mueller] was willing to be the leader.</p>
   <p>A motion was then made by Mr. Len that a photograph of that honorable gentleman, Paxton, be bought, since he appears to be unknown to so many tavernkeepers, and that the picture be hung up in every saloon. Even this provoked an argument, a rather animated one, in fact.</p>
   <p>The proposition to have Paxton photographed was finally withdrawn, because too many members objected to ornamenting their taverns with the visage of a scoundrel.</p>
   <p>Mr. Baum then made a motion, in the interests of the Association, to abolish treating before and after meetings. Mr. Schwuchow supported the motion, but <span class="page-break">4</span>Adolf Mueller objected to it in general. Mr. Miehle was also opposed to the motion....The president favored Baum's suggestion for the reason that he [the president] believed quite a few people refrained from coming to the meetings because they object to treating. Baum's motion eventually passed, and this caused such enthusiasm in the proponent of the measure that he invited the entire assembly to have a drink.</p>
   <p>The next meeting, in conformance to the chairman's suggestion, will be held at the Vorwaerts Turnhalle.</p>
