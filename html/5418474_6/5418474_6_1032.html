   <p>Professor Bamberger gave an interesting committee report yesterday about handicraft schools.</p>
   <p>The interest in handicraft instruction and for working schools of the type of workingmen's school in New York has in the past year improved immensely. While a year ago here and there the existence of these efforts was still being questioned; today, in the very same places one is convinced of the soundness of the working schools.</p>
   <p>The attitude toward this question, however, is certainly quite different. In France the work schools are accepted exclusively as an excellent means to promote from the cotton trade and industry by educating capable workers. In Germany interest is arounsed mostly because one believes oneself able to help the terrible distressed and poverty stricken population in many sections of the country, by training the children early to contribute to the family income. Also because one thinks that the education of workers by these schools will be beneficial to the craft as well as to the young craftsman. In Switzerland where <span class="page-break">\2</span>the working school is very popular, it appears, that one aims at improving nature through this school work, just as one would work on the perfection of a machine.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon session Miss Wiegand from Cleveland read the report of the committee for kindergartens of which Professor Hailman of Detroit the well known protagonist of Frobel's ideas in America, is the author.</p>
   <p>Finally, the teachers association was requested to protest strongly against the intentions of the Milwaukee School Board to eliminate the Kindergarten from the plan of education. During the debate Mr. Schuricht said that he thought it advisable to appoint a committee, which should work out an address to the school boards in general to protest against the abolition of kindergartens or their being damaged, because he said, he had been informed that in most cities which adopted kindergartens, forces were at work against them.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grossman asserted to be sure, that there was no intention in Milwaukee to abolish the Brobel institutes, but the motion of Mr. Schuricht went <span class="page-break">\3</span>through nevertheless, and Messrs.Schuricht, Staab and Miss Wiegand were appointed to work out the address. Mr. Soldan predicted the efforts of St. Louis' authorities against German instruction would soon come to an end.</p>
