   <p>The so-called suffragists have one thing in common with their spiritual relations, the prohibitionists namely, every time their demands come to a public vote, they lustily assert victory, before the votes are counted. Afterwards it becomes known that the shouts of victory were premature, and instead of winning they suffered a total defeat. However, they get over it lightly; they enjoy the intoxication of victory, celebrate the same, with ice cream and lemonade, and nice speeches, and , lo and behold, the next time they do it over again.</p>
   <p>The great triumph of the prohibition idea in Canada subsequently turned out to be a real defeat. The same is true in regard to woman suffrage at the election in S. Dakato. Its alleged victory was heralded by the whole world, but in reality it turned out to be a serious defeat.</p>
   <p>Of the 32000 voters, who expressed their opinion in regard to woman's suffrage, only 14000 voted in favor of it, and 18000 voted against it. The majority against the constitutional amendment of women suffrage amounts to 4008; but in reality this majority is considerably larger. The overpowering majority of those 42000 voters, who did not consider it worthwhile to express <span class="page-break">\2</span>their standpoint regarding this matter at the election, are undoubtedly against woman suffrage. In view of the untiring efforts of the disciples of woman suffrage to get all citizens to vote, the neglect to do so must be considered as a silent protest. This fact should solve the problem for S. Dakato for a long time to came, but this is not true. The people have not the time, nor do they desire to put their thumb upon the suffragettes of both sexes continually. The latter will agitate again, and claim a great victory at the next election.</p>
   <p>They will get enthused about their nice phrases and mutual admiration, since there is no other purpose in evidence.</p>
