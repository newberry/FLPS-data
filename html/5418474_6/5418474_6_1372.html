   <p>The mishap to the downtown savings banks, or rather the run induced by their failure, has caused the suspension by a West Side institution, not of payment however, but of the savings business.</p>
   <p>The bank, owned by John Buehler, corner of Chicago and Milwaukee avenue, has decided to shut down that department and hereafter devote their attention to the commercial business only.</p>
   <p>Mr. Buehler was formerly a stockholder in the Union Trust Co., but in May, 1873, he sold out and established a commercial and savings bank on his own account. In November last, the savings, deposits amounted to $125,000; but since then, there has been a steady decline, although more or less money was received every day. The St. Louis smash-ups made a big hole in the deposits, and it was increased by the collapse of the Bee-Hive establishment, so that yesterday the sum was only $30,000. There is no longer any money in the department. The depositors now number between two and three hundred, and will be paid in full.</p>
   <p>It is possible, when the present flurry subsides, that savings will be accepted again and at a lower rate of interest than six per cent.</p>
