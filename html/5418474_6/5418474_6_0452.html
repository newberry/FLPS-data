   <p>The fight is still raging concerning the observance or the dropping of the Hay-Pauncefote treaty, but it can be accepted with certainly, that it will end as the President, who identified himself with the treaty, desires, even if the victory should not be complete. This fight is interesting because it hastens the process of decomposition of the Democratic party. The theories which came to light are also interesting. The leader of the Democratic majority. Congressman Underwood, of Alabama, in the course of the debate made the assertion that the President's request (that the stipulation of toll-exemption of American coast vessels should be countermanded) contradicts the American spirit. A prominent philosopher, who naturally was not born in Alabama, though it would be hard for respectable people to make a mistake but easy to admit the mistake and to try to make amends for it.</p>

   <p>The Alabama Congressman hold the opposite view. He thinks it is manly and American to persist in upholding a mistake. It is possible that it was unwise to enter into the Hay-Pauncefote treaty and that it would much better serve the American interests to grant privileges to the American coastwise shipping, through the Panama Canal.</p>
   <p>Nobody doubts also the good rights of the United States to act in regard to the use of the Panama Canal, which was built with American money, anyway it sees fit in order to protect the interests of the country. It would have even been their duty to protect these interests and not to place the Panama Canal at the disposal of all nations. The mistake was made. The Hay- Pauncefote treaty has been perfected, and the nation must swallow the bitter pill. If Mr. Underwood asserts that it is un-American to cling to that treaty, we, as Americans and men, protest against such an interpretation of national duty.</p>

   <p>The country is at liberty, to detach itself from its international obligations, which it entered in making that treaty, and to appear before the International Tribunal as a treaty breaker. In that case, this country must be prepared to be treated in international intercourse accordingly. No matter what objections could be raised against the Wilson government, it represents, in this question, the American spirit with greater dignity and emphasis than those, "Hurrah patriots" who are ready to sell the respect of the world for a dish of lentil.</p>
