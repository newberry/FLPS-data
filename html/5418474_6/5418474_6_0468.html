   <p>The twenty-ninth day of January 1854, deserves to be recalled to our mind. It has been of far-reaching significance to our Republic. Chicago's Germans, forty-seven years ago, fashioned our national history.</p>
   <p>United States Senator Douglas had submitted his ominious Kansas-Nebraska bill, thereby circumventing the Missouri Compromise which out-lawed slavery north of the thirty-sixth degree. Strenuous objections in many quarters of the North manifested themselves long before the bill passed both Houses and was given presidential sanction by Pierce, on May 31, 1854.</p>
   <p>Indignation reached its climax on January 23, 1854, when a powerful wave of resentment surged through the meeting of the Chicago Germans who had heeded the call of Schneider and Hillgaertner, former leaders of the Staats-Zeitung.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>This memorable event happened at Warner's Hall, on Clark Street, South of Randolph Street.</p>
   <p>Incendiary resolutions were passed, denouncing the growth of slavery which Douglas' bill fostered, and telegrams were sent to Chicago's representative in Congress, John Wentworth, (Long John), requesting him to vote against the measure. He answered immediatedly, promising to voice his objections, and, although elected by the Democrats, he kept his word.</p>
   <p>Besides Schneider and Hillgaertner, the latter having passed to the Great Beyond three years ago, Franz A. Hoffmann, Lieut-Governor of a later period and Fritz Baumann, architect, were there; both, including Schneider, are still living. The late Fritz Frillmann was also among them.</p>
   <p>As the great fire of 1871 destroyed our old editions of the Staats-Zeitung, we were not able to give any details about their report. If any participant, living in Chicago or elsewhere, will kindly supply us with facts, then we <span class="page-break">3</span>shall also be indebted to him.</p>
   <p>Most of the Germans in the United States and of Illinois voted the Democratic ticket during the presidential election in 1852, because the Whig Party lacked appeal. And so Senator Douglas' apprehensions were by no means allayed when he was confronted with the news that the Staats-Zeitung and other German papers of Illinois were incensed by his Nebraska-Kansas bill, after having previously supported him. He hurried to Chicago, visited the editorial offices of the Staats-Zeitung in an attempt to obtain a conciliatory attitude, applying his great rhetorical talent to convince George Schneider and thus induce him to quiet the opposition. He was not successful. The meeting was held. Douglas, however, stuck to his bill, submitted it to the Senate, and thereby aroused intense antagonism among certain members of the newspaper fraternity.</p>
   <p>Eduard Schlaeger, now living in Berlin, published The German-American, a weekly paper at that time, and the previously mentioned Fritz Baumann, who is still with us in Chicago, organized a German protest meeting, where Douglas <span class="page-break">4</span>was burned in effigy. This spectacle was zealously repeated in many northern localities.</p>
   <p>However, the great gathering of Germans on January 29, 1854, represents the first intense manifestation of an irate public's opinion about the Kansaa-Nebraska bill, which, incidentally, has been the primary cause in giving impetus to the founding of the Republican party in its original purity.</p>
   <p>Feeling fully justified the Germans demanded that the new party dogmas should not only express its opposition to spreading areas of slavery, but insisted upon restraint of our nativism which attains its despicable climax in the Know-Nothing party.</p>
   <p>Many American politicans were favorably inclined towards the new party, but objected to this provision to preclude animosity among those northern elements of the Know-Nothing contingents, who favored the restriction of slavery. In as far as Illinois was concerned, the eventful Twenty-second day of February <span class="page-break">5</span>1856, heeds recording. On that date, a number of Illinoisan journalists and friends, all relentless enemies of expanding slavery, held a convention in Decatur to give birth to a new political party. George Schneider offered a definite resolution against nativism which met with considerable objection. At this juncture, Lincoln (Abraham Lincoln) came to the defence. He belonged to the liberal wing of the Whig party, but when the organization collapsed he did not flock to the Know-Nothings, in common with many of its adherents, but worked steadfastly towards a new, just organization. Animated by this attitude, he exclaimed to the assembly in Decatur:</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen! Mr. Schneider's resolution is nothing new. It is contained in the Declaration of Independence. And you cannot form a new party based on principles of persecution and proscriptive laws!"</p>
   <p>Lincoln was not only victorious in Decatur, but proved his argument convincingly at the State convention, and National convention of the same year.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>To recapitulate: "The great majority of Chicago's Germans were the pioneers in the creation of the Liberty party!" A German minority, however, stuck to Douglas, particularly when the latter showed his abhorrence to the brutal slave raiders, who invaded Kansas, and President Buchanan's contemptible conniving. Douglas fought these transgressions in his accustomed manner, and at the outbreak of the slave holder's rebellion, upheld the Union, even unto his last hour. And these motives then prompted the German Democrats, in common with German Republicans, to fight for the tenets of the Union.</p>
