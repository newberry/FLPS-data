   <p>Even the strictest temperance papers can no longer deny the genuine merit of beer and its definite effect in causing moderation. They all are beginning to see that beer is the only means by which the general use of whisky can be combated in the United States, and the temperance papers are, therefore, in favor of anything which results in good, cheep beer.</p>
   <p>Beer has a beneficial effect upon the human body and that effect has been recognized. Particularly the importance of carbonic acid, the volatile hop oil, hop bitters, and all products included under the name of malt extracts, must not be underestimated, because malt extract furnishes nutriment, carbonic acid produces refreshment, and hop oil, in combination with hop bitters, provides the invigorating element in beer. The custom, found in some districts, of calling this beverage "liquid bread", is therefore quite justified.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The invention of beer preceded that of wine and, aside from its ascription to the mythical king, Gambrinus, it has been ascribed to the ancient Egyptians; first, on the strength of statements by writers of the past and, second, because of the immense productivity of old Egypt with its surplus of grain, which provided a powerful inducement for discovering various ways for using it.</p>
   <p>In the course of time the brewery trade, in common with every branch of industry, experienced various--and often astounding--improvements and perfections. Steam power and intricate machinery rule today in the newer breweries, just as mechanical innovations have been made in all our larger branches of production. [A short description of the making of beer follows.]</p>
   <p>Chicago, Cincinnati, and New York are pre-eminent in the production of beer throughout the United States. Detailed descriptions of the best-known local breweries follow.</p>
   <p>Conrad Seipp</p>
   <p>The casual visitor at [Conrad] Seipp's Lagerbier Brewery on Twenty-Seventh Street <span class="page-break">\3</span>will find it difficult to find his bearings. Incoming and outbound traffic is heavy; wagons use every inch of the road. The restless activity which prevails in all parts of the factory is the surest indication that the enterprise enjoys ever-growing prosperity. Here stand team after team, and the employees find but little time to converse.</p>
   <p>Seipp's Brewery makes no pretense of external splendor. Having been built up gradually, it conforms to its requirements. The establishment reminds the writer of the large Krupp Works [in Germany] which also started as a modest, unassuming factory which labored onward and upward to imposing greatness; it, too, fails to seem a fascinating entity, to the beholder, because construction was contingent upon incoming orders.</p>
   <p>Seipp's Brewery covers three and one-half acres. The southern side faces Twenty-Seventh Street, the eastern part is bounded by the Illinois Central Railroad. The separate buildings are solidly built of brick.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>A fair idea of the establishment's exceptional development within the last few years may be conveyed by the fact that its steam power proved insufficient.... necessitating installation of four additional boilers in a separate building, including a new smokestack, five feet in interior diameter and one hundred and fifty feet high, the highest in Chicago. This work was done under the supervision of Robert Schmid, the architect. Moreover, Seipp's Brewery probably has the largest boiling vats in the United States.</p>
   <p>The establishment is worthy of a detailed description, which we shall try to give in systematic order.</p>
   <p>The purchases of barley and hops are made in such a way as to obtain the best products at fairly reasonable prices. Lately barley has been procured from California. It fills the various storage rooms of the malthouses and a special storage house so full that the joists groan under the pressure.</p>
   <p>A special track, the property of Seipp, connects the brewery with the Illinois <span class="page-break">\5</span>Central Railroad....facilitating unloading. Barley is handled by special conveyers, is cleared and then delivered to the upper floors where it is available for malting. Seipp's Brewery uses 360,000 bushels of barley annually. Hops are usually procured from the East.</p>
   <p>The Brewery has two malthouses, the second of which was built in the fall of 1874. The drying kilns are of the latest construction and are in constant use.</p>
   <p>The brewery building is in the center of the establishment. The boilers are made partly of iron and copper. The wooden containers for wort are of immense proportions. Cooking is done with steam. Two iron cooling vessels provide cooling in the winter, and two copper coolers are used in the summer. There are 170 fermenting vats. All are used throughout the winter, and most of them in the summer.</p>
   <p>The cellars of Seipp's Brewery seem a labyrinth of tremenduous proportions to the casual observer. The icehouses and cellars are excellently equipped; the latter <span class="page-break">\6</span>never contain less than thirty thousand barrels of beer. Here two elevators are used to bring the filled barrels up into the daylight, whence they are loaded onto wagons and delivered to all parts of the city.</p>
   <p>Regardless of the season, one finds uninterrupted activity.</p>
   <p>Two steam engines, old faithful servants of the establishment, one of fifty horse power, the other smaller, never come to a standstill. A third engine, rated at forty horse power, will be added. The eleven pumps for wort, water, beer, or lifting weights are all driven by steam. An artesian well supplies water for the cleaning room, which is sixteen feet high and of colossal dimensions, but lake water is used for brewing.</p>
   <p>Seipp's Brewery has its own black-smith and carpentry shop, also a cooperage where a large part of its barrels are manufactured and repaired. As in all prosperous factories, the proprietor has items manufactured elsewhere only when absolutely necessary; barrels, for instance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>Ice....was secured last winter through a contractor. At that time Twenty-Seventh Street and Cottage Grove Avenue were practically blocked; loaded wagons, closely parked, were heaped with large ice cakes for the mountains of ice already housed in the brewery, and at present there are about five thousand cords [a cord is 128 cubic feet] available.</p>
   <p>The extraordinary popularity which Seipp's beer enjoys at present becomes most apparent when the reader considers that it is on tap even in the city's most remote districts. The beer excels particularly in its large content of carbonic acid and the use of the best ingredients in its preparation.</p>
   <p>Mr. George Bartholomae, whose theoretical and practical knowledge is recognized by the trade, serves as foreman; while W. Seipp gives valuable assistance to his father in all business matters. City business is managed by Messrs. August Newhaus [Translator's note: possibly Neuhaus], Conrad Weber, and Conrad Seipp, a relative of the proprietor.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\8</span>
   <p>The Brewery has customers within a radius of eighteen miles, at Riverside, Dolden, Washington Heights, Calumet, Harlem, Nickersonville, at the City boundary, at Lake View, and beyond.</p>
   <p>Seipp's Brewery produces one hundred and twenty thousand barrels of beer annually, an output hardly exceeded by any other brewery in the United States. A supply of thirty thousand barrels of lager beer is always on hand. For delivery sixteen large wagons are used both morning and night. The brewery also has seven extra wagons. Sixty-six horses are available.</p>
   <p>On April 1 of this year, Mr. Seipp opened a branch office at 298 Milwaukee Avenue to give better service to his customers of the Northwest Side. This branch office is managed by C. Kuttruff. It is of great benefit to saloonkeepers of the Northwest Side, because beer sent there is kept on ice in a special icehouse located at this branch, resulting in colder beer than would be possible if it were hauled from the Brewery.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Among the newest improvements of the Brewery one must mention fire extinguishing equipment, a special pump, piping, iron ladders, fixtures to raise fire hose on the outside of the brewery building, etc.....</p>
   <p>A new office building, completed two days ago....faces Twenty-Seventh Street....</p>
   <p>Mr. Conrad Seipp has been in the brewery business for about twenty-two years. At first Mr. Seipp had no partner. Later he was associated with Mr. Lehmann and after the latter's death in October 1873, Mr. Seipp bought Mr. Lehmann's share and thereby gained control of the entire establishment.</p>
   <p>Downer and Bemis Brewery Company</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Not a Chicago German concern. Description is therefore omitted, except German items.]</p>
   <p>Fritz Hieronimus is the foreman of this brewery and all employees are Germans.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>Mr. Hieronimus has worked in breweries all his life and has been employed in the largest breweries in Germany, such as Anton Dreher's in Kleinschwechat, at the....Lichtenstein Brewery in Lichtenthal, etc.....The Downer and Bemis Brewing Company employs fifty-seven men at present, and living quarters in the brewery are provided for twenty men.</p>
   <p>About two-thirds of the customers of the Downer and Bemis Brewing Company are Germans.</p>
   <p>Bartholomae and Leicht's Eagle Brewery</p>
   <p>From the technical standpoint this brewery deserves particular mention, as experts have regarded it as a most exemplary brewery, with probably the most practical construction of any brewery in the United States. The equipment of the Brewery is such that the highest output can be obtained with the least labor. The Eagle Brewery is on the North Side, at the corner of Sedgewick and Sophia Streets. The plot of ground is 318 feet by 218 feet. The buildings as a whole are impressive and give <span class="page-break">\11</span>the appearance of a single unit....</p>
   <p>When Huck's Brewery was destroyed by Chicago's great fire in October, 1871, Messrs. Bartholomae and [A. E.] Leicht made immediate arrangements--aided by the well-known architect, R. Schmidt [also spelled Schmid]--to construct new buildings. And within a remarkably short period,....six months after the laying of the cornerstone, mash was being cooked....</p>
   <p>Although practical use is made of every bit of space, all parts of the Eagle Brewery are well ventilated and have ample light. All buildings are grouped and connected in a practical way. For example,....every load must pass the office building and all loading space is covered by a roof.</p>
   <p>The barrels are washed....under a skylight. Washing of barrels is done by machinery....In the middle of the cooling vessel a four-bladed paddle wheel is mounted to aerate the mixture....The cooling vessel has a capacity of one hundred and fifty barrels.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\12</span>
   <p>The....product of the Eagle Brewery is of excellent quality and the demand for this beer increased so much that the malthouse proved too small. A new malthouse is now being built; it will be five stories high, 68 feet wide and 120 feet long. It will be equipped with the latest devices....The three kilns are twenty-five by thirty feet and three stories high, constructed in accordance with Architect [Friedrich W.] Wolf's patent....R. Schmid's patented method for firing will be used....</p>
   <p>A steam engine of thirty-five horsepower is in continuous operation, day and night, and transmission of power to all parts of the establishment is accomplished in a most efficient manner.</p>
   <p>In regard to elevators, icehouses, cellars, etc., one can only say that they conform to the standards which are maintained throughout the establishment.</p>
   <p>Bartholomae and Leicht own their own ice ponds at Nickersonville. The ponds cover an area of three acres. The firm of Bartholomae and Leicht employs its own men <span class="page-break">\13</span>during the ice-cutting season. The Eagle Brewery saves considerable money by controlling its own ice supply and this becomes particularly noticeable if the winter permits three cuttings, because then the firm is enabled to sell two-thirds of the entire harvest [of ice] and consequently the ice used for the Brewery costs nothing. The Brewery's present supply, that is, its ice in storage, is estimated at six thousand tons.</p>
   <p>W. Seib, an experienced, conscientious man who has been active in the brewery trade for fifteen years, is the foreman of the Brewery.....</p>
   <p>Bartholomae and Leicht's Brewery brews forty thousand barrels of beer annually, which require one hundred and twenty thousand bushels of malt. The beer of this firm is very popular, as shown by the fact that the company cannot always fill its orders, and by its frequent inability to accept the orders of new customers. This is one reason why Bartholomae and Leicht are not interested in securing the trade of outlying districts.....</p>
   <span class="page-break">\14</span>
   <p>The company owns eight large beer wagons....five of which are in constant use.....</p>
   <p>At the south side of the establishment are the barns....granaries, etc. Ventilation....is hardly excelled in similar barns in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The fire-fighting equipment is very efficient....Within a few minutes every floor can be flooded. As the single men sleep at the Brewery, where a large, airy room is provided for them, fires can be extinguished quickly.</p>
   <p>Not only brewers and men familiar with the trade, but even the public in general find this brewery a very interesting establishment, as it is one of the most recent and modern breweries. Its high efficiency is probably due to the fact that it was created as a unit, conforming to a single plan; in other words, its construction was not dragged out for many years.</p>
   <p>Peter Schoenhofen</p>
   <p>Mr. [Peter] Schoenhofen's brewery proves again that ambition, character, and perseverance <span class="page-break">\15</span>are bound to prove successful....</p>
   <p>The Schoenhofen brewery is located at Seward Street, between Sixteenth and Eighteenth Streets, and a block from Canal Street. On the east side of this street it has a frontage of five hundred feet, and on the west side of Seward Street Mr. Schoenhofen owns three hundred feet.</p>
   <p>In the year 1860 Peter Schoenhofen and his partner, [Matheus] Gottfried, founded a brewery at the corner of Twelfth Street and Jefferson Street. Within a year the brewery's equipment was moved to Seward Street. In the year 1863 the brewery was built of brick and in the year 1873, after the fire, the brewery was enlarged.</p>
   <p>While Mr. Schoenhofen's brewery, with its three-story building and adjacent.... structures,....proves interesting, the effect will be more imposing when the fivestory malthouse, at the corner of Seward Street and Canalport Avenue, is completed. The dimensions of this new malthouse will be 100 by 125 feet, and it will be furnished with modern equipment throughout. It is expected that the roof of this new <span class="page-break">\16</span>malthouse will be completed by July 1, and....in September the first batch of malt is to be prepared....The new malthouse is being built according to the plans of Robert Schmid, the architect. The kilns are constructed in accordance with Schmid's patent....a method which provides....more air.</p>
   <p>The new building on Canalport Avenue and Seward Street will have a tower....which will form the entrance to the new offices....A second tower will also be added. This is to be surmounted by a suitable statue....and will be a part of the ventilating system.</p>
   <p>In the need to erect new buildings we have the best indication of a company's success and....proof that the products are popular. This evidence is furnished by Schoenhofen's brewery. An unpretentious wooden building was replaced by a large and imposing stone structure. Although these various buildings and improvements were added gradually, it all gives a symmetrical appearance, because existing construction was always considered whenever an addition was planned.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\17</span>
   <p>One of the features which surprise the visitor is the exceptional cleanliness. Order prevails everywhere.</p>
   <p>The new copper boiler has a capacity of two hundred barrels. The forty horsepower steam engine....was built by Frazer, Charmers and Company. The engine is separately housed in an especially partitioned-off part of the building. The transmission of the engine's power is very practically and ingeniously accomplished. Malt and hops are stored on the upper floors of the brewery. The cleaning house is to the north; then follows a four-story warehouse. The upper floor of the warehouse is used for cooling....All buildings, including icehouses, are connected. Everything is in perfect condition. Towards the west....are....the yard for.... repairing of barrels and the barns. Mr. Schoenhofen's home is also located on the brewery grounds.</p>
   <p>The cellars of the brewery are light and high,....and the temperature is maintained at three degrees Reaumur.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\18</span>
   <p>The brewery is in operation throughout the year. Mr. Gehringer is the able foreman....The brewery uses only the best malt. The hope which are used are from California and the East. At present the brewery produces thirty-five thousand barrels of beer per year. When the new improvements are completed production will reach forty thousand barrels of beer per year. About twelve thousand barrels of beer are always on hand. Ice in storage is estimated at six thousand cords. From 105,000 to 110,000 bushels of malt are used every year. Schoenhofen's beer enjoys great popularity; it is strong and has a pleasant taste.</p>
   <p>Most of the brewery's customers are in Chicago, particularly on the West Side. Aside from its Chicago clientele, Schoenhofen's brewery also ships beer, by way of the Illinois Central Railroad and the Michigan Southern Railroad, to outlying districts such as Monee, Clifton, Grate, Homewood, Malta, Whiting, etc.</p>
   <p>Whoever enters the cellars of this brewery and looks at the....long rows of barrels....will be convinced that there will be no scarcity of lager beer this summer.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\19</span>
   <p>The Schoenhofen brewery has five large beer wagons and powerful teams....</p>
   <p>Schmidt and Glade</p>
   <p>....The brewery of Schmidt and Glade is located at 9--35 Grant Place, near Lincoln Avenue. It was established in 1860 by R. G. Schmidt, formerly an alderman of this city and County Commissioner at present. Schmidt's brewery, like many other.....successful enterprises, was destroyed by the Chicago fire on October 11, 1871.</p>
   <p>With unusual and commendable energy, Mr. Schmidt started again....and on January 24, 1872,....the first batch was brewed.</p>
   <p>Later Mr. Glade formed a partnership with Mr. Schmidt.</p>
   <p>Schmidt and Glade's brewery covers seventeen lots. Like Bartholomae and Leicht's brewery, the Schmidt and Glade brewery has been equipped with the latest machinery. It was designed by Robert Schmid....All buildings are of brick....The office is <span class="page-break">\20</span>near the entrance to the main building.</p>
   <p>There are two malthouses, one of which is four stories high and covers an area of 110 feet by 50 feet; the second is 40 feet by 50 feet. Both malthouses are connected with kilns....The kettle used for boiling the beer has a capacity of one hundred barrels, and the iron cooling vessel holds a like amount. Another cooling vessel is to be added and will be mounted parallel to the present one.</p>
   <p>The Schmidt and Glade brewery is in operation throughout the year. The cooling apparatus which is used during the summer is one of the best in the city. There are four large cellars, and the three icehouses are brimful. The company stored more than thirty-five hundred tons of ice last year. Messrs. Schmidt and Glade buy only the best materials for their beer. Hops come from the East and from California. The grain used is from California and the West.</p>
   <p>About thirty people are constantly employed by the brewery. Charles Schmidt is the present foreman. He has functioned in that capacity for three years and was <span class="page-break">\21</span>formerly employed in large breweries in Chicago and St. Louis, Missouri.</p>
   <p>The twenty-five horsepower steam engine is mounted near the entrance. There are five pumps....</p>
   <p>Schmidt and Glade's brewery produces about thirty-three thousand barrels of beer, requiring nearly one hundred thousand bushels of malt. To supply its customers throughout the city, five large beer wagons are in constant use. Most of the brewery's customers are on the North Side. Schmidt and Glade's beer has also proved very popular in the country districts, particularly in Freeport, Sycamore, etc. Schmidt and Glade always have about nine thousand barrels of beer on hand.</p>
   <p>The brewery has a large yard where it repairs its own barrels. The company owns its barns and wagon sheds.</p>
   <p>The enterprise is growing constantly.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\22</span>
   <p>Franz Binz</p>
   <p>Franz Binz's brewery is on Cottage Grove Avenue, at the foot of Twenty-Eighth Street, a short distance south of Seipp's brewery. The building site covers three quarters of an acre, and is just east of the Illinois Central Railroad tracks. The brewery was founded in 1865. A few years later it was destroyed by fire....Rebuilding was started at once and in the late fall of 1867 the plant was in operation again.</p>
   <p>All buildings are made of brick, which permits close grouping and facilitates supervision....Mr. Benz's son, F. Benz, Jr., is the foreman.</p>
   <p>The malthouse and four ice cellars are connected with the brewery, etc. All equipment is excellent and of the latest design.</p>
   <p>Mr. Benz uses barley from California and the West and hops from the East.</p>
   <p>Binz's beer is well liked on the South Side and in the western and northwestern <span class="page-break">\23</span>parts of the city. Binz's beer is strong, heavy in body, and of pleasant taste.</p>
   <p>Delivery in the city is accomplished by four large beer wagons and several spare vehicles.</p>
   <p>The brewery is in operation throughout the year. Annual production reaches about eighteen thousand barrels, and sixty-five thousand bushels of malt are required.</p>
   <p>J. L. Hoerber</p>
   <p>J. L. Hoerber is one of our oldest German citizens....He founded a brewery on the South Side....in 1858. He sold this brewery later and established himself at his present location, 220--222 West Twelfth Street. Evidently this was a very fortunate choice, because property values....have increased rapidly in that neighborhood.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoerber has had ample opportunity and means to enlarge his establishment, but <span class="page-break">\24</span>he prefers to brew only as much beer as he requires in his own beer hall, and possibly enough to supply three or four of his old customers.</p>
   <p>Hoerbers's brewery and beer hall is one of the most imposing brick buildings on West Twelfth Street. The frontage, including the cigar business of the younger Hoerber, is seventy-five feet. Since the house on the east, at 218 West Twelfth Street, also belongs to Mr. Hoerber, the total frontage on Twelfth Street reaches one hundred feet....</p>
   <p>The ground floor of the main building is used for the beer hall. It is a popular meeting place for all who like a good glass of beer.</p>
   <p>The upper floor contains a hall, a dining room,....etc., and is used for lodge meetings by the Freemasons at present.</p>
   <p>J. L. Hoerber brews only in winter, and his guests may rest assured that they will always receive genuine lager beer in the summer, since he serves only his own <span class="page-break">\25</span>product.</p>
   <p>The business....is stable and well managed. Mr. Hoerber is superintendent.... He stored one hundred and fifty cords of ice....</p>
   <p>As we pass the main building, walking towards Dussold Street, we notice the following arrangement: The beer hall faces Twelfth Street; at the back is the adjoining icehouse and the brewery. The yard along Dussold Street would make an excellent beer garden.</p>
   <p>Stephan and Company [of Toledo, Ohio]</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: Only Chicago German items have been translated.]</p>
   <p>.....This company produces from forty thousand to fifty thousand barrels of beer annually; Kaltenbach Brothers introduced it in Chicago. This Toledo beer proved very popular here in Chicago and enabled Kaltenbach Brothers to equip a special <span class="page-break">\26</span>hall in which to dispense it. Kaltenbach's hall, the Toledo, is unique....in Chicago. The largest orchestrion thus far built has been installed, giving the exact effect of....a large orchestra....The establishment of Kaltenbach Brothers employs more than sixty persons....Kaltenbach's Hall was the former Brunswick.... Hall.</p>
   <p>There are twelve saloons in Chicago which sell Stephan and Company's beer, including the Little Toledo at 55 North Clark Street, which is also owned by Kaltenbach Brothers.</p>
   <p>In spite of the greater freighting cost, the Toledo beer is sold in Chicago at the same price as local beer.</p>
   <p>Stephan and Company's beer can also be bought in bottles from Kaltenbach's Agency....</p>
