   <p>Quite a crowd of depositors had gathered around the German Savings Bank yesterday morning waiting for the institution. They had learned that the German National Bank had been forced to succumb to the enexorable demands of its creditors, and associating the fact that its president occupied the same relation to the savings bank, became clamorous for their money. They believed that Mr. Greenebaum aroused the three banking institutions which for so many years have existed under one roof, and that the fall of one would necessarily be followed by the collapse of the others. It was in vain that cashier Wise assured the depositors that the institutions were separate and distinct, and that the suspension of one did not necessarily entail the collapse of the others. They would have none of his explantions. They demanded their money, and were then informed that they must give the required thirty days' notice. Some two hundred availed themselves of this provision of the charter. Their aggregate deposits amount to about $38,000. No currency was paid out over the counter.</p>

   <p>The bank insisted on a rigid enforcement of the rule. Mr. Greenebaum says its assets are sufficient to pay its depositors in full and leave a handsome surplus for the stockholders. The liabilities are reported to be about $350.</p>
   <p>Henry Greenebaum &amp; Company.</p>
   <p>The private banking house of Henry Greenebaum and Company was open as usual, though the volume of business was light, and confined mainly to the issue of drafts on New York and European cities in small amounts. Shortly before the close of the banking hours it became known that the New York branch, doing business as the house of Greenebaum Brothers and Company had suspended, and some rumors were current to the effect that it had made an assignment.---</p>
   <p>Henry Greenebaum filed a trust-deed yesterday conveying to H. Schaffner, in trust, five blocks in the vicinity of Humboldt Park as security for a note of $50,000 to run three years, payable to the order of himself, at eight per cent interest.</p>
