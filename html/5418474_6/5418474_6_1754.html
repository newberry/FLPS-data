   <p>The Prima Donna, Frau Lichtmay surpasses even Madame Parpa Rosa. Mr. Bernhard, is a vigorous German tenor, no consumptive little tenor Tenorchen) after American fashion. Beyond all doubt the German Opera is the best Opera that ever visited Chicago.-and yet it is again only the poorer German public that faithfully fills the gallery, while the fashionable German would come perhaps if tickets were selling for $4.00 as they did for Nilsson. Everytime something great and beautiful has come(from Germany) Boston, Philadelphia and St. Louis have paid due homage, only Chicago coldly refuses to do its part. Just because the other Americans keep away the Germans should make it a point of honor to attend. There is no lack of money, because one does not miss other entertainments. If it is lack of interest in art, if it is indifference for everything that does not also fill the stomach, why don't they confess so openly.</p>
