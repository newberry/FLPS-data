   <p>Funeral services will be held tomorrow afternoon in the chapel of Graceland Cemetery for Louis Kaufman, banker and former president of the Kaufman State Bank, who died yesterday at the age of fifty-nine years.</p>
   <p>After the closing of the Bank, about two years ago, Mr. Kaufman was forced to find other employment. He finally obtained a position with the brokers Anderson Plotz, and Company, 29 South LaSalle Street. He lived at the Rienzi Hotel. It was there that his body was discovered by his son, George, assistant business manager of the Covenant Club.</p>
   <p>Shortly before the outbreak of the World War Mr. Kaufman left Hungary and came to Chicago. Soon after his arrival he established a private bank and steamship ticket agency, which was prosperous right from the beginning. Later, in conformance with banking laws which had been enacted in the meantime, the business <span class="page-break">\2</span>was transformed into a state bank, and Louis Kaufman became its president. Many of his countrymen were among his clients. The banking crisis which affected the whole country, more or less, did not spare this bank, which had to close its doors in February, 1932.</p>
