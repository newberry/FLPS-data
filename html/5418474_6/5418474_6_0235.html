   <p>The Fourth of July has passed, thank Heaven! The weather was delightful and cool; the thunder shower from the previous evening clothed nature with new verdure, and the city followed the example; windows displayed green flags and, of course, the American banner, all of it providing a most festive appearance. And, while the day was not entirely devoid of unfortunate incidents, these at least only affected a few, and were not of general concern.</p>
   <p>The great labor parade and picnic were not marred by any disturbances; thus it showed that the labor movement lost ground in general.</p>
   <p>While the parade was impressive enough, for an ordinary affair, one might have expected much better things, considering the hue and cry made about it. As a <span class="page-break">\2</span>demonstration, the affair proved ineffective.</p>
   <p>Regardless of the mayor's proclamation, shooting continued night and day, and a large number of accidents resulted.</p>
   <p>The Labor Festival</p>
   <p>Yesterday we witnessed the long-expected event, the demonstration of Chicago's workers in favor of the eight-hour day. The demonstration proved to be an extremely peaceful affair, which caused no disturbance whatever, except that traffic was occasionally interrupted.</p>
   <p>The participating organizations gathered at the Haymarket, as well as on adjoining streets, at ten o'clock in the morning, and an expectant throng lined the streets along the route of march.</p>
   <p>The parade started at about eleven o'clock. The men marched along Halsted <span class="page-break">\3</span>Street to Madison Street; from there to Dearborn Street, on Dearborn to Randolph Street, then along Clark Street to Chicago Avenue, passed Wells Street, to Division Street and Clybourn Avenue to the Grove.</p>
   <p>The Parade</p>
   <p>J. B. Behloradsky, Henry Stahl, and Tim O'Hara functioned as festival marshals; the three men rode horses and led the assembly. Then followed a large brass band with Hermann Presser as leader, and fifty men, members of the committee in charge of the marching order. After that came the members of the various singing societies, some riding in vehicles, others afoot: The La Salle Liedertafel, Freier Saengerbund, Liedertafel Vorwaerts, International, Socialist Male Chorus, and Rothmaenner Liederkranz. About 150 singers marched, while from fifty to seventy-five rode on three foliage-covered wagons. Many a cheerful melody was heard.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Then came a satirical characterization of Toby's militia, in uniform, carrying "murderous weapons", including a paper cannon. Cobbler Graf, the designer of the display, led the troop of six men.</p>
   <p>Then came an allegorical float which would not have been understandable, if its inscription, in large letters, had not explained its meaning: "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity". About sixty women and girls from the labor ranks followed, marching two abreast, their appearance indicating a certain strong-mindedness; most of them were middle-aged.</p>
   <p>Next in order were the Turners, about seventy-five men; among them members of the Aurora Turnverein, Vorwaerts Turnverein, and several Bohemian clubs. The Schleswig-Holstein Verein, with about forty men, followed, carrying a banner. Then came a large wagon, drawn by four horses, representing in an unostentatious manner, and with considerable lack of humor, the blessings of the eight-hour work day. The allegorical display became understandable chiefly by the inscription.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The float of the carpenters' union came next. The banner of the union was made of wood shavings. After that came a man on horseback, then the brass band; the wood carvers, with about fifty men; the furniture makers unions, with about 250 men; finishers, fifty men; upholsters, with their wagon and about fifty men; the building carpenters union, with about eighty men; the tailors" union, number one, with about sixty men, some of them carrying illustrated signs calling attention to the strike at Willoughby, Hill and Company; the book printers, preceded by a wagon on which a press was mounted which printed the "Eight-Hours' Agitator"; the various divisions of the typographers, about 250 men; and the German section, led by Mr. Lyser who displayed a fearful Bassermannic appearance.</p>
   <p>A lone hunter in regular regalia, with gun and knife made of wood, ended the division of the printers.</p>
   <p>Then followed: Makers of gold lace, about fifty men; shoemakers, about 200 men, <span class="page-break">\6</span>and blacksmiths, probably one hundred men.</p>
   <p>Sam Goldwater led the cigarmakers, about 200 men; one of the men carried his baby.</p>
   <p>A wagon, which presented nothing in particular, followed the cigarmakers; a brass band heralded the approach of the sailors' union, whose officials followed in a light, open carriage. The sailors presented a good, natty appearance, and numbered around 120 men; the hodcarriers, with about one hundred men, followed.</p>
   <p>And, finally, followed the various sections of the Socialist party, headed by a brass band, and gave an allegoric presentation of the slavery of the printers employed by The Times, Chicago newspaper.</p>
   <p>A number of pictures were carried by members of this section, showing the <span class="page-break">\7</span>terrible results of capitalism's control over labor. The militia law (and also the tramp law) was not forgotten. Several red flags were displayed by this division of the parade, which numbered about 500 men.</p>
   <p>The last contingent consisted of about twenty members of the Socialist Education and Defence Society, without arms or uniforms, followed by about fifteen.wagons and buggies containing people who desired to be in the parade, but who belonged to no (particular) organization.</p>
   <p>The parade required about seventeen minutes to pass a given point, and was only one-fourth as large as last year's labor union parade of the Germans, when they gave their picnic at Ogden's Grove.</p>
   <p>Arrival at Ogden's Grove</p>
   <p>After reaching the park, the members broke their regimental order. A large crowd had gathered prior to the arrival of the parade and, with the constant <span class="page-break">\8</span>additions filtering in, one might estimate the number of people at 5000, by the time the Great Western Band played its first selection.</p>
   <p>The committee for the maintainance of order and the police had little to do.</p>
   <p>The people who came to the picnic were a peaceful lot, and the crowd was not large enough to present serious problems. Everybody listened to the music and, when dance numbers were presented, hundreds responded and gyrated merrily.</p>
   <p>Drinking was moderate, and great jubilance was not manifest.</p>
   <p>A clarion call at about 3 o'clock announced the speakers, and about one thousand people gathered near the musicians' platform.</p>
   <p>Schilling, the secretary of the committee of arrangements, introduced the speakers.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\9</span>
   <p>Ira Stewart, of Boston, an elderly gentlemen of docile mien, gave the first address in English in behalf of the eight-hour day.</p>
   <p>The speaker regarded the eight-hour day as a matter of international moment. He said: "Fourth of July and the eight-hour will henceforth be inseparable." The following resolution was adopted:</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That the Fourth of July is not a question of liberty or slavery, but is an issue between poverty and wealth.</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That those persons who criticize us because we want a ten-hour wage for eight hours of work, should consider that we now receive less money for ten hours' work than we received formerly for working eight hours, and this condition made possible the vast accumulation of wealth for the Vanderbilts, Rothschilds, and other great capitalists.</p>
   <p>"Resolved, that popular opinion, and law makers everywhere, must unite in furtherance of the eight-hour workday.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\10</span>
   <p>"We appeal to all newspaper writers friendly to the cause of labor, and to the members of congress.... to recognize the economic necessity of this proposal.... The eight-hour day is of a much larger scope than capitalism (and even labor) has recognized in the past...."</p>
   <p>Mr. Stewart also gave a list of senators who are opposed to labor....and said that the eight hour principle is the foundation of freedom....</p>
   <p>He was given immense applause.</p>
   <p>Then the Bohemian speaker, J. B. Behloradsky, was introduced. He spoke about the blessings of the eight-hour day, and the victory of the Bohemians over their enemies at the recent court trial. He said that the people know what to do to attain their rights.</p>
   <p>After the speeches, the people became interested in their lunch. The picnic grounds were still crowded at midnight.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\11</span>
   <p>Mayor Harrison was present. He rode horseback, and arrived at the beginning of the festival. The mayor commented on the orderly behavior of the crowd.</p>
   <p>During the evening, the committee sent a telegram to George Gunton, in Fall River, expressing sympathy of Chicago workers for the textile strikers.</p>
   <p>The picnic will continue today and tomorrow. The results did not meet the expectations of the organizers, but the occasion proved that the workers of Chicago can enjoy themselves without breaking the law.</p>
