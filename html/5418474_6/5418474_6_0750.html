   <p>General suffrage for women is imminent. Since the Peace Conference has granted women the right to representation in its subcommittees and in the various committees and councils which are to be organized under the League of Nations, since the young German Republic has given women voting privileges and representation, and since the British Parliament has enacted a law which awards women full political equality with men--in view of these facts we cannot think of anything which could hinder women in America from attaining the same political equality which men enjoy.</p>
   <p>It is only a matter of a short time before all American women will have the right to vote and will be eligible for election to any office. Universal suffrage, about which a more or less strenuous battle has been waged for <span class="page-break">\2</span>fifty years, is an absolute certainty because of the war. It will be an experiment, just as every other innovation is an experiment. As an experiment it is just as significant and just as important as the idea of a democratic form of government, of which it is but a logical extension. However, universal suffrage must not be regarded merely as a phase of political development, but the proclamation of it must also be looked upon as the beginning of a new social order. It is certain that universal suffrage will soon have a profound influence upon our moral, intellectual, and spiritual life.</p>
   <p>In what way? That is the question. We of the old school have always held that political activity would decrease the attraction of, and harm, the woman whom we loved and adored; that it is not right and is very unwise to expect her to do work which even many men find tedious and irksome, and to involve her in activity which may harm her morally. We fear especially for the peace and order of the home and for the children if women should receive the right to vote, and exercise that right--and that must happen if evil political results are to be avoided.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Perhaps it will be necessary for us to revise our education, or at least reconsider our former verdict. And this immediate necessity, like many mental adjustments which will have to be made in the field of politics and economics after the conclusion of peace, will be a result of the War. For the War has made great demands on women. The War not only required the greatest conceivable sacrifices of woman, but also drew her from the quiet of her home, from her kitchen, and from her children, into commercial and industrial life with greater force than economic necessity had drawn her previously. The abnormally high cost of living which resulted from the war has forced woman to enter into the economic battle and to take greater interest in all public issues. The War has imposed upon women duties which are just as strenuous as, if not more strenuous than, those which men perform, and with these duties equal responsibilities.</p>
   <p>Duties confer rights. Responsibility engenders a sense of responsibility. In many women, who gave the matter no previous thought, equal responsibility <span class="page-break">\4</span>has awakened and strengthened a desire for equal rights, for the right of self-determination; and all women have a valid claim to these prerogatives. All women must possess these rights if the political experiment is to be successful, and all women must exercise these rights if well-founded hopes for a favorable outcome are to be realized.</p>
   <p>As for other aspects of the problem we, like the rest of society, which quietly accepted the conditions which of necessity led to the rivalry between women and men, can only hope for the best. And this "best" may prove to be as good as, or even better than, anything the most confident and hopeful suffragettes ever dared speak of. In the final battle in the political life of nations conservative idealism and negative materialism will be enemies. And women are naturally conservative and "sentimental"--and as a rule the good, the great, the ideal, maintains itself in flood and storm.
