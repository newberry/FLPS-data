   <p>The advance sale of the Company's bonds proved so satisfactory that the Company decided that Mr. Weberling of San Francisco, the corporation's mining engineer, should come to Chicago, to superintend the construction of ore-crushing machinery for the Company's reduction plant [in Arizona].</p>
   <p>Mr. Hayse, one of the discoverers of the Company's mines, was given instructions to resume work at the mines and increase the output as much as possible.</p>
   <p>Company bonds, at twenty-five dollars, par value, one hundred dollars, are still procurable from us, and we recommend them as a safe and profitable investment.</p>
   <p>A detailed prospectus, and any other information desired, can be secured from <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>the fiscal agents of the Company,</p>
