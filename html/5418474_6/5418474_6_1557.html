   <p>A real enjoyment will be offered to Chicago's music loving public on March 7th, by two still youthful artists of German descent. Both certainly deserve a hearty welcome on the evening which is arranged in their honor. Rudolph Reiners is a descendent of a well known German-American family of musicians. He was already highly gifted as a child. He received the best instructions available in Chicago; later he was sent to Germany to complete his education. He returned to Chicago several months age after he had made many successful Chicago trips.</p>
   <p>Gertrude Gahl has celebrated numerous triumphs here in Chicago already, and like Reiners, enjoys great popularity.</p>
