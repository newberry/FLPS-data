   <p>"Manon" belongs to the best known and most popular comic operas. It always will be a great attraction, particularly, if the casts of the play are filled by outstanding actors like those in Amberg's troupe of performers. The last night's performance was indeed a masterpiece of good acting.</p>
   <p>Paula Lowe as Manon gave her best achievement and Mr. Friese Jr. as Marsillac was a marvelous character representation. Mr. Rotter as Abbe, Mr. Friese, Sr., as king, and Miss Kuhn as page deserve particular praise. Mr. Phillip as Marquis d'Aubigue was very good, but still showed signs of a cold.</p>
