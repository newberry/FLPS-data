   <p>Several dentists have rented a whole floor in the building of the Schiller Theatre, they will occupy according to their own plan. This floor will contain nine private offices, and a, general reception room. The floor has forty windows so that each office is well lighted. Several prominent Doctors of Denistry( Drs. Hermann Kuester, Rudolf Menn, H. Praum, F. A. Sirken and S. Richardson) will occupy some of the offices. Two of the "dental surgeries" may be obtained by the hour so that different Doctors will be able to practice there.</p>
   <p>As the price is so very reasonable, many doctors will avail themselves. Twelve to fifteen dollars will be asked monthly. I forgot to mention that hot and cold water, light and heating will be included so you see, the doctors will practice right in the city which should be very advantageous for them. The offices will be ready for occupation October 1st.</p>
