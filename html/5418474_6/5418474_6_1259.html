   <p>The Culebra Mine, Property of the Chicago Milling and Mining Company</p>
   <p>"The Culebra mine is in the State of Sonora, Mexico, about one hundred and twenty-five miles from the harbor of Guaymas and not far from the trail <span class="page-break">\2</span>leading to the city of Soyopa, which is about ten miles distant. The government mint is at Hermosillo, eighty miles from the mine; a good road leads to the city [Hermosillo].</p>
   <p>"The ore is rich and the vein is large, making the mine one of the greatest in the State, which is readily proved by the ore thus far extracted. Up to the present two shafts fifty feet and one hundred and fifty feet deep have been sunk, disclosing a large, regular vein, twelve to fifteen feet wide, which increases at lower levels. The vein can be traced on the surface for several miles.</p>
   <p>"The ore is a conglomerate of pyrites, zinc sulphide, lead sulphide and silver. The two shafts make about fifty thousand tons of are accessible, representing a value of two million dollars.</p>
   <p>"Tests have shown that the ore can easily be treated by heat, which separates the various ingredients and subsequent melting eliminates expensive milling.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The roasting process consists in dumping one hundred to one hundred and fifty tons of ore on a bed of wood. Only one or two cords are used. After the fuel is ignited, the ore will burn of its own accord, because of the large sulphur content. Through this simple process of roasting, the ore will disintegrate into a powder, so that the expensive labor of crushing is avoided entirely.</p>
   <p>"The next step is to gain a concentrated product. The ore is now placed in a puddling furnace. Wood is used for fuel. The daily capacity is about fifteen tons of ore. From five to ten tons of ore give one ton of concentrates, which are placed in a cupola, where silver and lead are extracted by melting.</p>
   <p>"Conditions for melting near the mine are very favorable. Forests abound near the mine, so that wood can be had for two dollars a cord; charcoal for six cents a bushel. Wages: Laborers, fifty to seventy-five cents; miners, etc., one dollar to a dollar and a quarter per day.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>"Production costs, based on trials, are about as follows:</p>
   <p>Mining expense and transportation of 25 tons of ore @ $2. ............$ 50.</p>
   <p>Treatment of ore in puddling furnaces @ $2 per ton ..................... 50.</p>
   <p>Treatment of 5 tons concentrate @ $12 per ton .......................... 60.</p>
   <p>Other items .................................................................... 96.</p>
   <p>Total...........................................................................$256.</p>
   <p>CAPACITY</p>
   <p>25 tons @ $40 ..............................................................$1,000.</p>
   <p>20% loss........................................................................ 200.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Net capacity...............................................$800.</p>
   <p>Net income per day......................................$544.</p>
   <p>"The estimate of twenty-five tons of ore as shown in the above figures is based on the present capacity. However, by providing more space, more miners will be able to work, which of course will increase the income.</p>
   <p>"Within a year it may be possible to increase the output six times above the present rate, which means a daily profit of more than two thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>"The advantages of this mine, when compared with other mines having rich but small veins of ore, are as follows: Mining costs per ton of ore are high when veins are rich but narrow, because of the large amount of rock which must be removed and also because of the fact that the direction of the vein changes frequently. Very often the vein stops abruptly, giving no indication <span class="page-break">\6</span>of its continuance. Accurate estimates of income are impossible under such conditions, and mining becomes a chance.</p>
   <p>"In connection with the aforesaid, I would like to mention the Eureka Mining and Smelting Company of Eureka, Nevada, which works on ore worth forty to fifty dollars per ton. For two years this company paid a monthly dividend of about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars; yet expenses in Nevada are much higher. Labor costs are four dollars per day, and charcoal (the main essential in smelting) costs thirty-five cents a bushel instead of six cents, as in Mexico. Smelting costs are therefore three to four times higher in Nevada than in Mexico.</p>
   <p>"As we have a large amount of ore available, we can confidently expect a good income for years.</p>
   <p>"C. Weberling,</p>
   <p>"Mining Engineer."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>The reports of A. C. Hesing not only substantiate the conservative estimates of C. Weberling, but show that the ore is much richer. Work continues at the mine day and night. By August 22, three hundred tons of ore had been treated. The success of the Company is now established beyond doubt.</p>
