   <p>The Board of Education is asking once more for German women teachers. Since the fire many vacancies have occurred. But the Board of Education was unable to fill all the vacancies.....Up to yesterday, there were five vacancies during the last four months. Inquiries were made at St. Louis and Milwaukee, but in neither these cities could women teachers be had.</p>
   <p>To appoint men teachers, instead, is not possible either. The positions do not pay a high enough salary to attract good teachers, and poor ones are not wanted. Besides that, American ideals disapprove the idea of a teacher going straight from the drawing-room to the school and vice-versa.</p>
   
   <p>We thus wish to attract the attention of parents to the fact that German women teachers are in demand, and that teaching offers their daughters a well paid career. Should the Germans be unwilling, or unable, to furnish the teachers, Americans will become suspicious and wonder why Germans are asking for German instruction.</p>
