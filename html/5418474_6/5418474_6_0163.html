   <p>The official birth registration of last year provides interesting information regarding the nationalities of Chicago's population. The statistics are hardly accurate if the general birthrate of the United States is 362 births per year of a population of 10,000, than Chicago with its 1,250,000 people should have 45,050 birth registrations, but there are only 23,021.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless the official birth registration proves conclusively that Chicago has an overwhelming European population, and that among all nationalities, the Germans take first place. Of the 23,021 babies born in 1891 in Chicago, 6,548 of these had a father, who was born in Germany, and 6,108 had a German-born mother. Accordingly 28% of all babies born in Chicago in 1891 had parents who were born in Germany.</p>
   <p>Remarkable as well as gratifying is the fact that the number of births of Irish parentage is only 1391, or 6% of the total. The Scandinavian countries are listed with 2673 births, or 111/2% of the total, and Poland with 1446 births, or 61/2%. This <span class="page-break">2</span>confirms again certain observations, namely that the Irish immigration to Chicago has remarkably declined compared with former years. This is gratifying inasmuch as it finally and gradually will relieve the city of Irish domination in public affairs. It is well to understand clearly that the German element of the population of Chicago is the numerially dominant part and could be the ruling element if it so desired. Of course, this would require a more active participation in public affairs, and a more consistant continuity in all matters which concern German-Americans. The German-Americans could carry out their plans in the administration of the city, if they acted unitedly. How about sticking together for an honest City Council, and an honest local government?</p>
