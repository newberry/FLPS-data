   <p>Robert G. Scheunemann died of a heart attack at his home, 3240 Lake Shore Drive, at the age of fifty-seven. His passing means a severe loss to his family, the large number of his friends, and the entire German population of Chicago. Mr. Scheunemann was born in Chicago. After acquiring a thorough education, he decided upon a commercial career, and became, in the course of time, one of the leading personalities in the insurance field.</p>
   <p>In the year 1901 he married Bertha Kohlsaat, daughter of the deceased John D. Kohlsaat, whose name is mentioned in Chicago's history. The very happy union resulted in the birth of a daughter, Patricia. From the very beginning Mr. Scheunemann took an active part in all German-American movements. He was a member of the Germania Club, and also belonged to other German-American societies. In the year 1922 he was elected vice-president of the German Society.</p>

   <p>His special favorite was the Deutschamerikanische Altenheim (German-American Home for the Aged) in Forest Park. He was the chairman of the executive committee for ten years. In this capacity he devoted his whole attention to this model institution of Chicago's Germans. Under his leadership, the large addition to the building was begun and completed. His interest in the Home and his extensive business experience deserve the credit for the fact that the institution survived the depression period without severe reverses. Because of his graciousness and tact, Mr. Scheunemann was always able to attract efficient co-workers into the management of the Altenheim. Between him and the different organizations which were active in behalf of the Altenheim, there was a relationship which was based upon complete confidence and sincere friendship.</p>
   <p>The funeral will take place tomorrow afternoon at one o'clock in the chapel of Graceland Cemetery.</p>
