   <p>Benjamin Marshal, Walden Shaw, and other property owners, in the two blocks between the Union and Northwestern depots, announced yesterday that the contract for the Lumber Merchants Exchange Building which is to be erected at Clinton and Adams Streets could have been signed today, but the interested parties are willing to postpone the matter to give the Government an opportunity to acquire the land for the Post office . . . . .</p>
   <p>It now appears that Eitel Brothers, proprietors of the Bismarck Hotel and the Marigold Gardens, planned to build a large twenty-one story hotel on the northwest corner of Canal and Monroe Streets at an estimated cost of eight million dollars. The building is to be connected with both depots by a subterranean passage, enabling travelers to arrive in one station, staying over night at the hotel, and continuing their journey at the next railroad line, without crossing the street. Robert Eitel said yesterday that his firm is also willing <span class="page-break">2</span>to drop the project if the Government wishes to use that area for a post office. But, of course, the matter must not be postponed indefinitely.</p>
