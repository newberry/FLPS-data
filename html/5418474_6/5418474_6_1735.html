   <p>When a few months ago, Hans Balatka gave his last concert in the North Side Turner Hall, he expressed hope for a beautiful future for music in Chicago. Formerly concerts were neglected because of circumstances and of an incomprehensible indifference of the public. Only after they had stopped, did people realize what they had lost and express the desire to have them organized anew. Their wish was put into execution. Mr. Clauder, a musician of talent, assembled the old members again and thus once more Sundays will be enlivened. The Turner Hall has thus once more become the center of attraction on the North Side.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's concert was well attended. The most pleasing number was Bilse's "Victoria Waltz." Mr. Clauder is anxious to furnish always something new and good. He needs, of course, the support of the public and it is to be hoped that it will not fail him.</p>
