   <p>Der Wirths verein (Tavern-keepers Union) held yesterday afternoon under the auspices of John Feldkamp in the Vorwarts (Forward) Turnhall a large meeting. Louis Schurichow proposed that 1200 invitations should be sent out for the Wirth (Tavern-keepers Union) Convention which will be held here the 21st of September.</p>
   <p>The program for that day will be regarding the Aldermen of the wards and their attitude towards our business. Remember that Cullerton and Curran from the 6th ward both are rather dangerous men and should not have the support of our organization.</p>
