   <p>It appears as if the Drys intend to await the outcome of the city council's deliberations and something definite may transpire tonight. After that, the Prohibitionists will work with greater energy to enforce recognition of the Sunday closing statute. Dry meetings were held in various parts of the city yesterday, where the evil was considered in all its phases and the saloons, of course, were depicted as the "original source of every vice." While the Drys display a feverish activity, the friends of personal liberty seem indifferent, and do not defend themselves against the fanatics.</p>
   <p>Although the Hotel Owners Association resolved at its meeting last Sunday that they will continue the sale of intoxicants on the seventh day, one noted, nevertheless, that the hotel bars of several hotels, such as the Sherman House, the Palmer House, Grand Pacific, and the Leland House were positively closed. In other hotels, all bar room doors, facing the street, remained locked.</p>
   <p>Whether "reformer" Frank Hall lived up to his threat to engage fifteen detectives to gather evidence about wide open saloons on the Sabbath day could not be ascertained yesterday. No doubt, warrants will be issued against all transgressors who were visited by his men.</p>
   <p>At 10 A.M., the Committee of Twelve, which was appointed at Brand's hall, last Friday, will interview Mayor Harrison to again obtain his cheap assurance that he, as City leader, is a friend of all respectable saloons, but that he cannot do much to halt the Drys. The committee of tavern owners consists of twelve gentlemen.</p>
   <p>The American Anti-Saloon Association met at the First Methodist Episcopal Church. . . .very few were present. . . .Rev. Parkhurst spoke very earnestly.</p>
   
   <p>He met a man recently, near Lincoln Park, who distributed whiskey-filled candy to school children. These little tidbits create a craving for alcohol, and eventually make drunkards out of the tiny tots. This fellow was employed by a saloonkeeper.</p>
   <p>No one was present at the meeting to contradict the erudite Reverend's fairy tale.</p>
   <p>Doctor Taylor assured the assembly that Mayor Harrison will, of course, do all in his power to protect little boys and girls from the pernicious saloon.</p>
   <p>The German Tavernkeepers, as Reverend Parkhurst so kindly admitted, are not the worst. He knows several who gave him the addresses of saloonkeepers who make it a regular business to sell alcoholic drinks to minors. Finally, a resolution was adopted. The city council was requested not to revoke the midnight closing ordinance.</p>
