   <p>The event, which the Republican Party press so loudly advertised, and which the leaders so longingly looked forward to, is over. Carl Schurz made his speech in favor of the Republican Party before at least three thousand people. How far the hopes have materialized which were attached to it, and whether the speaker succeeded with his arguments in convincing one or many or none of the numerous Tilden men who were present, cannot yet be said.</p>
   <p>Mr. Prussing, Jr. introduced Mr. Schurz shortly after eight, and Mr. Schurz began: - "My fellow countrymen! I did not come here to eulogize the Republican Party, nor to praise it as an embodiment of all wisdom and virtue, nor to tell you that, if she wins, the kingdom of heaven and, if she is conquered, the end of the world would be here.... The evils from which our country suffers are the prevailing corruption and the bad financial policies. I hardly think it is necessary to explain at length to an intelligent German audience why the return to the gold standard is necessary. I request you simply to glance at today's conditions. The times are bad, commerce and industry do not pay and hundreds of thousands have fallen into indigency.</p>
   <p>What is the reason for this? If you read the platform of the Democrats, and listen to the Democratic speakers, you might think that the Republican administration alone is to blame. It is an old story - when something goes wrong - and where the damage is caused by hailstones or grasshoppers, the governing party would still be held responsible for it. If you look around, you will notice that the whole world is in the same predicament.....</p>
   <p>Now there is no country in the world, the recuperative power of which is as great as that of America, and one would therefore think that we could overcome this industrial crisis quicker than Europe. How does it happen that it lasts so long this time? One of the reasons is the lack of confidence due to the instability of our money. Capital is notoriously timid, and when the capital value is subject to fluctuations then it is least inclined to take risks. There are probably some oldsters among us, who have lived through the crises of 1837 and 1857. Recovery did not come then until all the inferior paper money was swept out of commerce.</p>
   <p>Let us look into the Democratic platform. It starts with the accusation that the Republican Party, in the eleven years since the war, has not yet introduced payment in hard money. In that, it is right!</p>
   <p>I have been among the first to criticize the Republican Party for it. What right has the Democratic Party to complain? What has it contributed?</p>
   <p>In 1868, the Democratic Party made every attempt to jeopardize the credit of this country. In every election where this question came up, it was the rag money representative....</p>
   <p>What is the true essence of a platform? It consists in saying little with big words. I find here the same beautiful phrases as in every platform, for the past twenty years. Those beautiful phrases and promises appear to me like highly estimable old acquaintances in white neckties and elegant clothes but with suspiciously red noses...</p>
   
   <p>At least we may ask for stronger proofs. Those we are asked to see in the demand for the revocation of the resumption promise. The latter, as you know, is a promise to resume cash payments on January 1, 1879. I voted for this measure in the Senate, because it was the first promise, which Congress made in this respect, but I criticized it at the same time because it appeared to me to be insufficient......</p>
   <p>The recall of the resumption promise has always been the war-cry of the inflationists. I recently received a telegram from London, stating, - "If a recall of the resumption promise becomes a fact all United States papers in foreign countries will be under terrible pressure, and it will become almost impossible to dispose of bonds on European markets at favorable prices at all".</p>
   <p>The English bankers, who always have been known as competent financiers, and whose judgement is surely trustworthy, realize that the recall of the resumption law would be a victory for the inflationists........</p>
   <p>.....On the one hand, in the case of a Democratic victory, we would have a soft money majority in Congress, and a postponement of resumption ad Calendas Graecas.</p>
   
   <p>On the other hand, in case of a victory for the Republicans some sins of omission will have to be atoned for. The main thing is that the majority in Congress will be in favor of hard money.</p>
   <p>The German-American, like the American, has always fought for the honor of the nation. Shall he now surrender the fruits of this fight to the routed enemy? The Tilden-Republicans may do that, but the Hayes-Independents will not; this hand shall wither before it throws into the ballot-box a vote, which would harm the sacred purposes of this country."</p>
   <p>The financial question, however, is not the only reform we want. Corruption reigns everywhere and must be extirpated. It reigns in both Houses of Congress, in the Executive, in the Legislatures. If I may boast of one merit, it is that I was one of the first to attack it........</p>
   <p>Grant had no idea what his duties as President were. He regarded every office as his personal property, with which he might punish his enemies and reward his friends. And his friends were, as you well know, not always of the best kind.</p>
   
   <p>Even under Grant's completely unprincipled administration the corruption could not have attained such immense proportions, if there would have existed a better civil service....</p>
   <p>What is now to be done? Of course, we first have to rout the thieves. Not only must the thieves be driven out but the spoils system must be abolished...</p>
   <p>I care nothing for platforms, but value more the word of a single, honest man. By no means do I deny Mr. Tilden due credit for breaking the New York Canal Ring. Tilden surely will drive the corrupt employees from their offices, but also the good ones. On the other hand I am equally convinced that Hayes will drive out the dishonest officials, and will leave the good ones in office.</p>
   <p>When I now raise my voice for this man, I do so not because he was my favorite candidate. My favorite candidate was Bristow....</p>
