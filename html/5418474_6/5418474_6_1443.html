   <p>The run on the German Savings Bank continued yesterday and all the claims were paid promptly. The run on the German bank was different from the run which has taken place from time to time on other banks, in so far, as the people did not betray any anxiety. The business people never believed the rumors circulated concerning the bank and continued their financial transactions with the bank as usual. A German, Geo. Mentzel, withdrew yesterday his money from the National Commercial Bank to deposit it with the German Savings Bank. Also, yesterday, the clerk for the newly opened accounts had more to do than the one who was paying the claims.</p>
   <p>The origin of the rumor is still a mystery.</p>
