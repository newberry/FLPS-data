   <p>This year's concert tour of Thomas's orchestra in the Eastern States has been more successful than all the former art-journeys of this association of excellent artists. The performances in Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, Brookly, Rochester, Boston, Providence, Worcester and Akron were crowded, and the critics of the above cities gave unstinted praise to the artists of the organization. The great violinist Ysaye, who functioned as soloist in New York and Boston, took his place amongst the first violinists by his own volition and in Washington he volunteered as "concert-master" during the repetition of the Tannhaeuser Overture. In Philadelphia, New York and Boston, Joseph Hofmann, the young piano virtuoso acted as soloist; besides, at the New York concerts Nordica, and the bass singer Plancon appeared. During the homeward trip the orchestra almost came to grief. On the Nickel-Plate Road, near Buffalo, they experienced an accident, a collision of their special with a regular passenger train. Fortunately no one was injured, but the baggage car was badly damaged, several very valuable instruments, among them Bruno Steindl's Cello were splintered.</p>
