He has become well known after his extensive travels in America and Mexico. His main productions is landscape paintings. He is not very original, but very true to life in the details of his subjects. The pastel drawing of the chapel of the Graceland Cemetary, an extraordinarily impressive picture, has already found a buyer. The drawing of the Navy Pier is also one of his best pictures and both are exhibited at Kroch's. Here he did as well with the colors as the reproduction of the whole picture, an extremely fortunate grasp, it appears to be so realistic that one can imagine of actually standing on the pier while looking at this extraordinary picture.
