   <p>During the last six months the risk-rate was diminished by accepting insurance valuations of $700.00; a diminishing of premium notes amounting to $52.50, and an increase through net-receipts that produced $3,082.31.</p>

   <p>The expenditures of the large company have been very nominal during the preceding year, only $1,004.00 has been paid for actual damage by fire and a little more than $1,300.00 for current expenses. The net profit of $3,000.00 will be used for an initial fund, which is to be used for the erection of its own office building.</p>
   <p>Election results: Mathias Schmitz, President.</p>
   <p>The company received a petition, signed by fifty respected German citizens from <span class="page-break">\3</span>the Fullerton to Belmont, and Ashland to the Lake district, requesting the insurance firm to open a branch office. A committee of ten will take the matter under advisement.</p>
