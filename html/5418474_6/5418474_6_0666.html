   <p>From a report published in the Anzeiged Des Westens we note that Carl Schurz voluntarily went to the President with a copy of that issue of a previously mentioned newspaper which contained General Halleck's letter to the publication, and earnestly protested against this violation of the freedom of the press. Upon Mr. Schurz's protest, a telegram was sent to General Halleck (according to some, by the President himself, according to others, by Secretary of War Stanton) advising him to refrain from making such attacks on the press in the future. Bravo!</p>
