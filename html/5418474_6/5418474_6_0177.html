   <p>State's sovereign Fifer issued a proclamation lately requesting the children in the schools and the young men and women in colleges, seminaries and universities, to reserve April 22 for planting trees, shrubs, and vines with the aid of their teachers.</p>
   <p>In connection with this appeal, the Illinois State Horticultural Society publishes a drawn out explanation about the necessity and purpose of tree-planting. This is the way it approaches the matter:</p>
   <p>"This work will bear rich fruit to the living ones of to-day and provide beautiful and happy homes for our posterity.</p>
   <p>"In these homes there will live people who will ever hold in check the hordes of socialists and anarchists that crowd our cities and so seriously threaten the life of civil and religious institutions."</p>
   
   <p>We would be very grateful to the Illinois State Horticultural society for telling us what in the devils name has the planting of trees, shrubs and vines to do with socialism and Anarchism.</p>
   <p>Do these honorable gentlemen think that we shall multiply so rapidly that the present forests of the state of Illinois will be insufficient for the necessary amount of gallons?</p>
