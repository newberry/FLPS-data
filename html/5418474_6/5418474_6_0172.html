   <p>Social economists, doctors, humanitarians, all men of true, unspoiled science, declared themselves in favor of shortening working hours. The social economist wants to give surplus labor a chance to work; he intends to reach a closer harmony between producer and consumer. The doctor wants to improve the ever increasing physical and mental degeneration of the working class by creating a longer rest-period. The humanitarian claims it is not right that with all the technical advancement of our time, with steam and electricity pressed into service, men still should be working like slaves or animals.</p>
   <p>There exists only one person who, against the demands of the social economists, the doctors, and humanitarians, declares that the achievement of the eight-hour working day would be a nonsense,-nay, would constitute a crime. Who is this criminal? His name is Hermann Raster, and he is the chief editor of the Illinois Staats Zeitung, a paper which is still being read by people who claim to be intelligent and humanitarian.</p>

   <p>We resolve: Whoever does not want to identify himself as a criminal, should fight against this villainy.</p>
   <p>We declare everybody publicly a criminal, who fights the eight-hour-day movement in the same way as Raster did yesterday.</p>
