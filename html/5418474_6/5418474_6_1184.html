   <p>Mr. Koch, likewise, belongs to those German business men of Chicago, who have gained the full confidence of their fellow citizens, because they have been just in their dealings, using good judgment, and always acted according to the proverb: "Foresight is the mother of wisdom". More than a year ago Mr. Koch established his banking business at 158 Dearborn Street, next to the First National Bank. For many years he was a partner of another German bank. In his new sphere of activity he has had many financial successes. His great experience and extensive connections enable him to invest safely and profitably. He buys and sells bonds, stocks, and various commercial papers.</p>
