   <p>The eight-hour movement, started here last week by the furniture workers, proceeds rather slowly. The principal stumbling block is the wage question, and friction, for the present at least, has been avoided because the workers are willing to work eight hours for $1.60 instead of ten hours for $2.00. But, no doubt, ninety-five per cent of the workers regard the eight-hour day as a transition, and expect finally to earn as much money in eight hours as they formerly earned in a ten-hour workday. Just as much money, that is the main thing! That the workers earn only $1.60 now instead of $2.00 does not arouse them to enthusiasm. The fast that the men work two hours less, and therefore have two extra hours in which to spend money, while earning forty cents less, does not appeal. The workers' wives, in particular, will not be highly elated. It requires considerable self-denial.</p>

   <p>The workers may now consider two problems. The employers may well say, "We have enough orders on hand to give you ten hours' work per day and pay you $2,00, if you insist on working only eight hours for $1.60, then it will cause some inconvenience to us, because we must hire extra men and increase our force by twenty-five per cent. We do not like to do this, because we prefer our experienced men to new workers. But, if you insist, then we can, of course, divide a $200 payroll as readily among 125 people, so that each receives $1.60, as divide the $200 by 100, so that every employee obtains $2.00 per day."</p>
   <p>The other problem the workers face is the cry of agitators, who exclaim: "Stick to it, boys; even if you get only $1.60 now, that doesn't hurt much; after the movement becomes general, the infamous well-fattened gents will have to give you as much money for eight hours' work as they formerly paid for ten hours:"</p>

   <p>And those workers who really think--who do not readily accept the dicta of the socialistic penny-collecting preachers--realize that they are expected to disregard the proverb, "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush". Only one thing is certain, and that is the present loss; the future gain is entirely problematical. It is, of course, highly probable that business in general will improve in the Fall, so that the furniture manufacturers can pay twenty-five cents per hour. Figured on that basis, if the men work eight hours, they still earn only $2.00 per day, which represents no financial gain whatever; whereas, if they continue to work for ten hours at twenty-five cents per hour, that would represent a gain of fifty cents per day.</p>
   <p>If the workers consider their present status as a step toward the settling of the social question, then, most assuredly none of the "fat citizens" will deny the working class that pleasure. It is one of those pleasant self-deceptions which no one should deny.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>To recapitulate: Indications show that business will improve and that, in turn, will create a demand for labor, and, consequently, higher wages. If the workers then wish to work eight hours for $2.00, instead of ten hours for $2.50, then no one can object. In either case, wages will be regulated by the price of the manufactured product. Competition among employers to obtain help will automatically increase wages.</p>
   <p>Whether an increase in the hourly rate provides more money, or whether a decrease in hours without a reduction in salary can be obtained, makes no difference; both amount to the same thing.</p>
