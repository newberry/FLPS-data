   <p>The statements of the President's doctors, though exceedingly noncommittal, leave no doubt that they also have given up hope, and that blood poisoning is now slowly but surely doing its insidious work. Although the doctors strongly denounce the opinion of laymen, many people are convinced, nevertheless, that the man who so heroically comports himself is now nearing his end, rather in consequence of the treatment [of his wound] than of the actual injury. The prevailing attitude is that hundreds of persons who are alive and healthy today were at one time as seriously injured as Garfield and by the same kind of wound, and they did not have half the care [which the President has received]. It is therefore reasonable to assume that if Garfield had been treated like a common soldier, in view of the President's strong constitution, he would be well. But the hesitancy and aversion to creating pain by resorting to a necessary incision in the first few weeks proves disastrous now.</p>
   
   <p>Even laymen may form reliable conclusions by reading and comparing the bulletins issued by the doctors within the last fifty days, and in so doing they have become aware that during the first days after the injury the doctors appeared to be fully in the dark as far as the most essential facts were concerned. The path of the bullet could not be traced according to their reports, which means that they did not wish to probe the wound for fear of increasing the pain. This resulted in the most contradictory surmisals. Once it was said that the bullet had pierced the liver and was in the epigastric region near the navel; then it was asserted that it was six inches lower, and that it had been found to the right in the pubic region. Then came the sudden declaration that the bullet had never reached the liver but had broken the twelfth rib, had been deflected downward, and must be somewhere near the thighbone. This continued for weeks, and in the meantime nothing was done about the infection in this channel, in the childish hope that all the virulent matter would be obliging and drain out of the small aperture. Only when the patient was near death, twenty-one days after the injury, were Doctors Hamilton and Agnew called, and they did what should have been done one or two weeks before. They made an incision to drain the large abscess which had formed because of the ignorance and the irresolution of the first doctors who had treated the injury, and if this had been done earlier, the patient could have been saved.</p>
   <p>That even this incision was not deep enough was admitted by the doctors in last week's bulletin. It became apparent then that the infection was not 31/2 to 4 inches long, as the doctors had surmised, but that it had attained a length of 12 inches. On July 23, when the first incision was made, the penetration may not have been so deep, but since then matter has accumulated, has not been sufficiently well drained, and has infected the surrounding area. If the cavity had been fully exposed at the very beginning by making a proper incision--an operation which does not tax the skill even of a slightly experienced surgeon nowadays--then the cavity would not now have to be drained with a tube, and the infected part might have been cleansed and dried with charpic. [Translator's note: Charpic, a French word--linen fiber which in those days took the place of absorbent cotton or wound dressing.] This was the good old-fashioned treatment, and we know from experience that it was correct, since it worked. What a recommendation for the doctors, that after announcing for three weeks the healthy expulsion of pus, they now discover, by mere chance, that the infection has penetrated eight inches deeper! And the facts are shown by their own bulletins; one of them announces the startling discovery made after removing some hardened matter that the channel can be traced eight inches deeper than before! This discovery that for more than six weeks pus had been allowed to accumulate in the interior appears to those who are familiar with infections as the patient's doom.</p>
   <p>But the "physicians in charge" continued undismayed to issue half a dozen bulletins daily, signed with their names of course, wherein they emphasized the untruth that the patient was "constantly improving". If this had continued for a few more weeks, and death finally had made an end to it all, then these doctors would have assured us that the President was perfectly healthy--when he died.</p>
   
   <p>However, one cannot reproach the doctors for trying to bolster up the hope of the people as well as that of the injured man; but it is so plainly evident that these learned men actually believed the nonsense which they proclaimed! A doctor under certain conditons should mislead the relatives as well as the sick person in order to build up the patient's confidence, since the psychological effect is beneficial to the healing process. However, a doctor should not deceive himself, and though not all the six physicians deluded themselves in this case, three or four did, and Bliss in particular. In order especially to expose the latter, an English paper made the sarcastic remark:</p>
   <p>"If A equals B, then B equals A; therefore, if ignorance is bliss, then Bliss is ignorance."</p>
   <p>Another point in the treatment, or rather mistreatment, of the patient is much commented upon: the constant weakening of his system through insufficient food and the impairment of his digestion through a too liberal use of opiates. It is said, but we are not prone to give a verdict in this matter, that a flesh wound during the first stages does not give such a shock to the body that all nourishing food must be withheld. The Times said:</p>
   <p>"The patient wanted nourishing food but received slop instead."</p>
   <p>We may bank on this, that as soon as Garfield dies with the aid of his six doctors, the newspapers will vie with one another in proclaiming what we say here. All that we have written will be repeated countless times but more drastically, and also by physicians. The danger most to be dreaded arising from this controversy will be the possibility that the cur Guiteau may be saved thereby. Even if there are [State] supreme court decisions available which do not recognize it as an extenuating circumstance if an assaulted person does not die directly after the injury, these verdicts are not unanimously regarded as applicable to the District of Columbia, and there will be no lack of "lawyers" who will eagerly try to prove the opposite if money may be gained thereby, or if it may build up their reputations. Let us hope that Guiteau will not be defended by such men.</p>
