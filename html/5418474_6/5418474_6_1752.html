   <p>Mr. Florenz Ziegfield has partly attained the aim of his journey to Germany by hiring a singing teacher for his conservatory.</p>
   <p>We read in the Leipziger Tageblatt of June 4:- "Just as England has found through the Leipzig Conservatory a great number of able performers and teachers, so the fame of the School is also more and more penetrating America... At the newly opened, grandstyle Conservatory in Chicago the singer recently graduated from Leipzig. Mr. James Gill, from Paisley near Glasgow, Scotland, has been engaged to teach singing. This talented and well-trained artist should all the better be able to collaborate fruitfully with Mr. Ziegfield, as Mr. Ziegfield, too, is a former student of the Leipzig Music Academy.</p>
