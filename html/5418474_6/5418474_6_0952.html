   <p>The German Press society of Chicago held its twentieth general meeting yesterday at its Club Rooms in the Bismarck Hotel.</p>
   <p>According to an old custom, the former officers read their reports of activities during the past year. These reports gave evidence that the society has enjoyed a normal year. The membership is about the same and very little change has occurred in the financial standing of the Club since the last meeting.</p>
   <p>As customary, a banquet, prepared by the entertainment committee, was served after the general meeting.</p>
