   <p>A strong agitation is again at work to force the hand of our Senate and Congress towards the acceptance of woman Suffrage. This agitation is carried out particularly by a small group of women intellectuals and male university professors, who are stirring up the press and the public with unreasonable arguments on this subject. They claim for instance, that women all through ages of human history, have been slaves of men. Furthermore, they say, woken have been so accustomed to their inferior position in life, that now it is a hard task to point out a better destiny for her.</p>
   <p>These overzealous agitators apparently hate to admit, that the majority of our women are actually unprepared for the far-reaching responsibility of voting. Our women, like a lot of our men, must show first of all much more interest towards our community-affairs and state problems, before they know anything about constitutional rights and duties, which is the fundamental knowledge, of a self-conscious voter, man or women.</p>
