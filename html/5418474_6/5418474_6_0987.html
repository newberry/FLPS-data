   <p>After completion of his two-year service as doctor of the Imperial German Marine, he became assistant to Dr. Stelzner at Dresden, for the purpose of acquiring further experience in special branches. From there traveled to the United States, where he acted for a time as assistant to Dr. Schneider of Milwaukee, and then moved to Chicago. Within a very short time he succeeded in acquiring an extensive private practice, as a specialist in all diseases affecting the respiratory organs, which induced the Alexian Brothers Hospital to secure his valuable services. A profitable, pleasant future, was envisioned for him, when grim death suddenly tore his from the blessed field of his activity. May he rest in peace.</p>
