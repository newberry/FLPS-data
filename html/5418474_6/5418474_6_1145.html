   <p>Due to the steady growth of our business established in the year 1855 and out of consideration for our customers, we have reconstructed this institution into a State Bank &amp; Trust Company, to be henceforth known as the "Greenebaum Sons Bank &amp; Trust Company." This bank has fully complied with the legal banking requirements of Illinois. The bank has a capital of $1,500,000 .

We extend a cordial invitation to our customers to take advantage of the facilities offered by our new bank department.
