   <p>The reader will find in another column the quarterly statement of the German Savings Bank. The Fidelity, State, and M. F. &amp; M. have gone, but it remains. A new feature which will be most reassuring to depositors is the certificate of the Directors, including such men as Thomas Hoyne, Elias Greenebaum, Henry Greenebaum, etc., that they have examined the securities and satisfied themselves that everything is as it is represented to be. The statement shows that the liabilities are $700,000, and cash on hand and bonds $190,000, while the mortgages totalling $300,000 are stated to be selling easily at a premium.</p>
   <p>The remainder of the assets are stated to be equally good. The bank is paying 41/2% on deposits while others pay 4%. It can do this because it does not have to pay the Government tax of Â½ or 1% due from banks which do not allow over 4% interest.</p>
