   <p>The Chicago Arbeiterverein held a meeting last evening for the purpose of starting a national movement to acknowledge [General Franz] Sigel's deeds in behalf of the Union. The meeting was very well attended. Mr. Heinrich Greenbaum was elected chairman and Mr. Schulz secretary.</p>
   <p>Dr. Ernst Schmidt then made a long speech in which he explained that if German-Americans wish to offer an adequate expression for Sigel's unselfish devotion and endeavors, then a sword of honor will be insufficient, and that they will have to provide an independent and carefree existence for Sigel by way of national subscription.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wilhelm Rapp, Mr. Eduard Schlaeger, and Mr. Theodor Hieschler also spoke and voiced their approval of the recommendations made by Dr. Schmidt.</p>
