   <p>Chicago's music season opened yesterday with Lucie Westen's concert. The artist is well-known to our public, but even so we were astonished again by her accomplishments. Above all, one has to admire her versatility. She sang selections from Mozart operas and Korngold, old Italian, French, and modern American songs, two ballads, the grewsome, intensely dramatic "Fire Rider," by Hugo Wolf, and the charming, delicate "Elfin Song," by the same composer. She knew by intuition how to adapt her voice to the text, giving a unique and artistic touch to her songs.</p>
   <p>She has a splendid voice and can sing, but this is not all; the secret of her success seems to be in the way she combines text, music, and expression. It is here where she attains truly artistic creations.</p>
   <p>In yesterday's concert Miss Westen lived up to the expectations of the most exacting critics. Far from aiming at virtuosity through the imposing great masters, she gives us genuine artistic, refined selections,-art.</p>
