   <p>The present era is one of constant progress. As soon as a definite improvement in some line of human endeavor is announced, we hear that a new invention in the same field supersedes anything created before. There are no exceptions, and anyone may convince himself of this by observing our industrial status in general--and this applies particularly to the manufacture of pianos. What a difference between the narrow sound chambers of the old spinets of the beginning of the century and the sonorous pianos of today, or even the attempts of our piano manufacturers of twenty years ago! What far-reaching improvements, all calculated to develop a mellow and powerful tone! Modern piano builders have endeavored to produce more graceful, as well as stronger, instruments, able to resist temperature changes, and capable of meeting all demands of the musician.</p>
   <p>The changes in piano manufacture during the last twenty years represent no deviation from basic principles. Julius Bauer of Chicago, however, had a new idea, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>and today one expresses surprise that others had not thought of the same idea before. Mr. Bauer is an experienced piano manufacturer. He not only has sold pianos, but has had in stock nearly every conceivable musical instrument, during the last thirty years. He studied the structural details of all pianos and, in considering their various faults and advantages, he concluded that a wooden sound board produces the most resonant, powerful and flexible tone, and so it occurred to him, since wood gave all these advantages, to build a sound board based on the principles of a violin. His trials exceeded his expectations. The new Bauer piano has a wooden sound board, with no metal contacts anywhere, nor metal supports. In constructing the sound board, the same painstaking care for detail was given as the violinmakers of Cremona gave to their instruments. The violin-like resonance chamber developed a sonorous tone of great power, which proved superior even to a concert grand piano, and the entire method of construction provided great rigidity.</p>
   <p>Musicians were highly impressed, and, within a short time, the new Bauer piano became well known here and abroad. The best proof of its far-reaching reputation is the fact that conservatories in London, Paris, Dresden, St. Petersburg, Vienna, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>and Rome ordered Bauer pianos, as did consequently, a number of individuals.</p>
   <p>Anyone wishing to be convinced need only go to the company's display rooms at 182-84 Wabash Avenue. Visitors are welcome all day. An inspection will show that it has been possible to provide beauty of tone in a small, elegant body. The Bauer upright piano is highly decorative in appearance, and its design shows good taste.</p>
   <p>We ask the public to see this new creation, which fears no competition, and is unperturbed by older, medal-bedecked instruments, including the Knabe piano..... [Editor's note: I used my mother's Bauer upright piano during my entire musical education. She still has the piano, after 40 years, and it is as good and rich-toned as when I first used it]</p>
