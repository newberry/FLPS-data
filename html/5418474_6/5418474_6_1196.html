   <p>A. Loeb &amp; Bros. Messrs. Adolph and William Loeb conduct a very profitable banking business, exchange and depository, besides they have been very successful in property speculation. It certainly requires exceptional capacity and business tact to give proper attention to all these branches; but this firm knew how to solve its problems, since the success in all its departments has been most surprising, so much so in fact, that the new year justifies great aspirations.</p>
   <p>Few firms invested their money as securely in properties as these gentlemen have done. The constant increase in land values will bring them ample rewards for their investments. The company's standing is the surest guarantee for those who deal with them, that all agreements will be conplied with promptly and to the satisfaction of the customer. It is very gratifying that the Germans of this city are so well represented by such well known and respected business men as the Messrs. Loeb, who give the best evidence as to the persistent diligence and constant progress of the German immigrants.</p>
