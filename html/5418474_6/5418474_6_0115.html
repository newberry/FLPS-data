   <p>It appears that the freedom-loving elements of Chicago have finally been taught something by the "Drys." They realize the need of a strong organization, if they wish to defend themselves against the storm troops of their enemies, who represent the abolition of personal freedom and decent pleasures. And thus a number of broad-minded men founded the Chicago Liberal League, a bulwark to thwart the attacks of the Prohibitionists. This organization endeavors to obtain an administration for our cosmopolitan Chicago, which shall not abridge the rights of its inhabitants for the next two years.</p>
   <p>Whoever wishes to indulge in penitence and chastise his body, may do so to his heart's content, but if one has no such fearful sins on his conscience, and feels convinced that the Almighty may best be honored by enjoying earthly gifts on the dedicated day, then he should also be allowed to act unrestrictedly according to his belief.</p>
   <p>The founders of the League do not favor unbridled libertinage, nor do they <span class="page-break">\2</span>intend to entice undesirable elements to Chicago, but they resent any guardianship proceedings, and object to molestation if they wish to enjoy themselves on Sunday amid beer, good music, a theatrical performance, or a social dance.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Liberal League's headquarters are in the Metropolitan Building, Room 15, corner Randolph and LaSalle Street. The association is incorporated, the following names appearing: Edmond J. Stack, a lawyer living at 85 North 40th Avenue; Robert H. Cowdrey (possibly Cowdroy); Charles T. Essig, George Middendorf, Oscar F. Mayer, and Gustav Berkes. Edmond J. Stack was elected president, and Robert H. Cowdrey, secretary.</p>
   <p>The League intends to publish a weekly paper, The Liberal Advocate, and will, of course, play an important part in the impending Mayorality campaign, supporting only those candidates who give a definite guaranty that their official actions will not be inimical to the personal rights and conscience of the individual citizen.</p>
