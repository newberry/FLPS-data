   <p>Editorial about the abolition of the income tax. Editor applauds U. S. Senate for having voted 26.25 for the abolition. Reasons: Rich people able to evade it (Officials and employees have to pay it). Only 275,000 people paid the tax in 1870. Obviously, very many people with incomes over $1000 evaded it.</p>
   <p>Income tax has a depressing and demolishing influence, penalizes the spirit of enterprise and industrial success. Its abolition will be of advantage not only for those who had to pay it, but has the whole of the population.</p>
