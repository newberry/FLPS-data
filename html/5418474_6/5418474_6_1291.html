   <p>The Chicago Wirthsverein (Tavernkeepers' Association) held its regular session yesterday afternoon at Baum's Garden at 22nd Street and Cottage Grove Avenue. Mr. Feldkamp presided.</p>
   <p>The security bond of the treasurer, signed by Messrs. Charles W. Reese and Jacob Gastel, was submitted and then referred to the committee on legal affairs. The financial secretary did not present his bond.</p>
   <p>Mr. Miehle of the finance committee reported that it had investigated the accounting of the present as well as of the former secretary, Michael Wassermann, from September up to the time of his resignation, and found all statements correct. Mr. Miehle further declared that the parties who had been critical of the secretarial work without knowing anything about it deserved reprimand, according to the views of the committee.</p>
   <p>Although Adolph George submitted a written report, it was decided, on P. Mueller's motion, that the new and retiring finance committees, as well as their secretaries, should make a joint investigation, a second audit of the books, and give written reports at the next meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. Miehle said that it was about time for the members to decide whether a picnic should be given this year.</p>
   <p>Peter Mueller declared that the time had arrived when it was necessary to proceed against the "drys" in a more forceful manner than heretofore. Some of our aldermen who were so hypocritical prior to the election, professing to have liberal views, voted for a Sunday closing ordinance on May 19, he declared. He read the report about the debate at the council meeting and the result of the vote as published in the Illinois Staats-Zeitung. The nineteen aldermen who voted for that compulsory measure should be remembered, he said; also, the School Board members who had refused to lease real estate belonging to schools to saloonkeepers. The biographies of these gentlemen should be made available to club members, he asserted.</p>
   <p>Mr. Feldcamp made a few remarks about Alderman Cullerton's deceitfulness and received general acclaim.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Harry Rubens said that the snoopers Scott and La Berge had made considerable trouble, and that La Berge was in jail according to the newspapers. "These men are the troublemakers," he asserted.</p>
   <p>Mr. Feldkamp gave his reasons why tavernkeepers should be called upon to work and vote for Judge McAllister. The only matter concerning which McAllister could be criticized, he said, was his conduct in the Sullivan trial. Aside from that he had always proved himself to be an impartial, independent judge.</p>
   <p>The president declared that the poolroom license question was nearing a solution which would probably be satisfactorily concluded at the next session of the City Council. Mr. Rubens and he [Feldkamp], he said, had appeared before the committee on legal affairs.</p>
   <p>Then followed in lengthy discussion concerning a motion for a picnic. The motion was rejected.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of routine business the meeting was adjourned.</p>
   <p>The next session will be held at the North Side Turnhalle, on June 21.</p>
