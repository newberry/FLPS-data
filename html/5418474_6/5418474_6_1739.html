   <p>Mrs. Eugenie Pappenheim will appear tonight in a great concert in McCormick's Hall with the members of the Grand Opera Company. The unusually flattering reception granted to the German prima donna by the Chicago public, is a proof that the artist has made a great impression. Mrs. Pappenheim is superior to all the other prima donnas and is surpassed only by Lucia and even not by her in all the roles.</p>
   <p>Hans Balatks will conduct the orchestra. The low prices will enable the poorer classes to attend the concert.</p>
