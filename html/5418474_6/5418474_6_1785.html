   <p>Haino Isermann Died. An excellent German artist, a man who obtained a great reputation, an individual endowed with a profound love for creative art, died last night at his home, 18 Starr Street. Whilst the seventy year old sculptor sat at the table, drinking tea, death came suddenly, in the form of heart failure. For nearly a quarter century, the deceased has been intimately connected with art affairs, where he always acted as a leader.</p>
   <p>The sculptures of the City Hall and County Building, Board of Trade, and Central Music Hall are his works; there are many others. During his long artistic career in Chicago, he created numerous statues in marble, bronze and granite.</p>
   <p>Mr. Isermann was born in the former kingdom of Hanover; he emigrated to the United States, settling in Baltimore. He fought in the Civil War, and after his discharge from the army, moved to Chicago where he not only dedicated himself to the pursuit of his art but also obtained renown as a scientist and excellent lecturer. Three children remain to mourn his demise, Alida, Leon, and Mrs. C. H. Hitt, all of them residents of Chicago.</p>
