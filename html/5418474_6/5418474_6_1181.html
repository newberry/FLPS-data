   <p>The delegates of all German saloon and tavernkeeper's Organizations of Chicago had an important meeting last night at the Northside-Turnerhall. Mr. Rudolp Ambach, who presided over the meeting, pointed in his opening speech to the necessity of a close and dependable cooperation among German saloons and taverhkeepers, in order to fight successfully the steadily growing opposition against the saloon-business.</p>
