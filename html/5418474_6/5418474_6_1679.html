   <p>Carl Koellings "Concert Variations for Piano" were produced for the first time in the Turnhalle afternoon Concert yesterday. It was a very promising debut.</p>
   <p>Every passage of the tuneful work was enthusiastically acclaimed. Mr. Emil Liebling played brilliantly and the well trained Orchestra, under the baton of the Composer, assisted in a remarkable way. Mr. K. may well be proud of this new success.</p>
