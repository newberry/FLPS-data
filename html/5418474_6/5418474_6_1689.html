   <p>We heard, yesterday afternoon in the large auditorium an excellent concert given by Pref. Liesengang's Orchestra of expert musicians. The program included composition carefully selected, to satisfy every listener.</p>
   <p>Among the composers, whose work were presented, were Wagner, Offenbach, Suppe, and Straas. The selcists were Messts. Berth (cornet), and Carl Becker, (Violin) who were greatly acclaimed by lovers of good music.</p>
   <p>These concerts have greatly contributed to the education of the average person in music appreciation. Prof. Liesegang, for the good work he has done, is entitled to both the recognition and the support of our community.</p>
