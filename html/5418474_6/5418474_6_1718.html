   <p>The first concert given by the teachers of the new conservatory at the Athenaeum Hall was excellent; chamber music was featured. A large and select audience attended.</p>
   <p>The opening number was a delightful trio by Mozart, the melodies of which were beautifully effective and served to create a pleasant mood.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Koelling then sang an aria from "The Creation" by Haydn. Her excellent training showed to particular advantage in this aria; despite the announcement that she had a bad cold, her indisposition seemed hardly noticeable.</p>
   <p>Beethoven's "Trio in D Major" which followed, gave us a profound insight into the character of the great composer; it unfolded an episode in his life, and revealed the virile power with which he combated fate. The adagio movement is a musical drama. The gentlemen, Fuchs, Lewis, and Eichheim, were so thoroughly imbued with <span class="page-break">\2</span>the seriousness of their performance that one forgot the musicians and listened unreservedly to the themes of the noble composition.</p>
   <p>A charming aria by Handel, with flute (Mr. Oesterle) and cello (Mr. Eichheim), concluded the delightful concert. The voice in this selection competes with the flute in trills and presto passages.</p>
   <p>We hope that these concerts will answer a popular need in so far as our artistically inclined public is concerned, and we hope that these musical treats will continue.</p>
   <p>The program announces a second concert on Friday, at noon (admission is only twenty-five cents), when Mrs. Koelling will sing the great aria from "The Queen of the Night," as well as songs by Brahms and Lohmann.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Koelling, Lewis, and Eichheim will present trios by Kiet and Haydn.</p>
