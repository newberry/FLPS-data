   <p>For many years, the clothing factories have made their goods inside of the factory doors. This status has been given up by some clothing factories, who now are giving a part of their output to so called sweat-shops. The latter as a rule, are paying very low wages to their workers who, very often, have to labor in comparatively small and badly ventilated rooms.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately the Federal Government and individual States do not show any willingness to interfere with the described, deplorable conditions.</p>
   <p>In several instances, the Supreme Courts, by upholding the "Freedom of contracts," have given decisions in favor of these large clothing manufacturing autocrats.</p>
   <p>But we do believe, that the Chicago Health Department, for humanitarian and sanitary reasons, should step in this, and clean out these sweatshops, which have become a calamity.</p>
