   <p>Last evening, one of Chicago's largest and most enthusiastic gatherings of German-American citizens assembled in North Market Hall, and the spacious room was crowded to overflowing. A. C. Hesing called the meeting to order; John H. Muehlke was elected chairman, and Eduard Seckel was elected secretary. Caspar Butz was the first speaker, and after making a stirring address, he moved that a committee of five be appointed by the chair to draft resolutions. The chairman appointed C. Butz, H. Eschenburg, H. H. Bruns, Joseph Brosch, and L. Lamperts as members of the committee. This committee retired and later, through the chairman, C. Butz, it reported the following resolutions which were adopted amid thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>"In view of the great crisis in our national affairs, when the fate of the Republic trembles in the balance, a mass meeting composed chiefly of German-American citizens was held at North Market Hall in Chicago, and adopted the following resolutions:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>1) "That, while disclaiming every intention to resuscitate old and obsolete issues, and pledging to the Government of our choice our undivided support in the prosecution of the war against the black monster of secession, nevertheless, we, as free citizens of this Republic, claim our rights to voice our sentiments and opinions in regard to the carrying on of the war and the measures of this administration.</p>
   <p>2) "That, as every day it becomes more evident that this war is a struggle for life and death between two principles hostile to each other since the day of creation, we warn and remind the Government that the triumph of liberty can be final and lasting only if slavery is abolished.</p>
   <p>3) "That, in the Administration's measures for the suppression of the insurrection we have thus far seen nothing but indecision and vacillation, a desire to shirk the true issues of the contest and to decline a responsibility which the rulers of our great nation are expected to assume.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>4) "That, in the recent proclamation of General Fremont, which unfortunately, was mutilated by order of the President, we saw a harbinger of better days, and the surest means of bringing this war to a speedy close.</p>
   <p>5) "That, when, as if it were planned to add insult to injury, the idol of the Western Army, the man who created order in chaos, General John C. Fremont, was removed from his command just as he was about to reap the fruit of his efforts, we were loathe to believe the incredible news, and had to bow our heads in silence before a procedure so unparalleled in history and so detrimental to the best interests of our country.</p>
   <p>6) "That, after having carefully sifted the accusations made against General Fremont, we have found nothing but an ex parte statement of his enemies, not supported by the truth, devoid in many instances of even the semblance of truth, containing many long refuted charges, and bearing in every word the stamp of the accusers malignity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>7) "That, in our opinion, even if the charges against General Fremont had been proved by unquestionable evidence, the Government might have found means of correcting them other than by the removal of the leader who never was heard in self-defense, and whose only crime, in the opinion of the people, is that he obstructs the ambitions of other men.</p>
   <p>8) "That, since it has removed General Fremont, we have lost all confidence in the Administration, and that the people will hold our authorities responsible for the evil consequences resulting from their acts, and particularly from this most injudicious and unjust measure.</p>
   <p>9) "That, while thus expressing our grievances, we solemnly declare our unalterable devotion to our adopted country and to the glorious flag of freedom under the folds of which we found a new home. The citizens by adoption have already shown their zeal for the cause of liberty; but for liberty only, not for the schemes and compromises of designing politicians are they ready to fight to the bitter end, and for this, in the language of our forefathers, <span class="page-break">\5</span>they 'pledge their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor'.</p>
   <p>10) "That, we assure General Fremont of our unchanging love and admiration, and of our most sincere thanks for an approbation of the immortal services he rendered to the cause of science and the cause of his country, for the great energy and the self-sacrificing patriotism, with which he created the Army of the West, for the great human principles of his proclamation of emancipation, for the vigor and rapidity with which he, in spite of all the obstacles thrown in his way by the authorities at Washington, marched from St. Louis to Springfield, and cleared the state from the hordes of Rebels, and for the self-denying and truly republican civic spirit in which he received the blow aimed at him by the President."</p>
   <p>Mr. Lamperts offered a resolution censuring the Chicago Tribune for its stand on the Fremont controversy, but on motion of Mr. N. Eisendrath the motion was tabled; the reason offered for the rejecture being that it would be beneath the dignity of those assembled to pay any attention to such a small matter as the <span class="page-break">\6</span>above-named paper, after having declared their views on such important and momentous matters.</p>
   <p>It was moved to send a copy of the resolutions to President Lincoln through our representative in Congress, Honorable I. N. Arnold, but since a number of speakers remarked that Mr. Arnold was not a warm friend of General Hunter, it was considered unwise to request the services of Mr. Arnold in this matter.</p>
   <p>While the committee on resolutions was out, Sheriff Hesing, William Rapp, and T. Hielscher made truly eloquent speeches, and the meeting adjourned amid loud cheers for John C. Fremont, the next president of the United States.</p>
