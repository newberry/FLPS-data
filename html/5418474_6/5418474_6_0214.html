   <p>The furnituremakers' union published an appeal yesterday morning in the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, requesting that all union members shall only work eight hours in the future. The Illinois Staats-Zeitung sent several reporters to the leading furniture manufacturers to see to what extent the union's order was carried out, how the manufacturers react, and to ascertain the conditions under which the eight-hour day will be adopted. We append the result of our investigation:</p>
   <p>Sugg and Beiersdorff, whose factory is located at 408 South Canal Street, has complied with their workers' request, and the eight-hour day has been in force there since Monday.</p>
   <p>Meyer and Company, Cohn and Company, and other firms have also agreed to the eight-hour day.</p>
   <p>Naturally, there is a decrease in wages; workers earning formerly two dollars per day now receive only $1.60.</p>
   <p>Mr. Beiersdorff, speaking to our reporter, declared that he was willing to establish an eight-hour shift at the old wage rate three years ago, if two-thirds of the other western manufacturers would follow suit. Even at present, his firm is willing to pay the ten-hour wage rate for eight hours of work, if other local manufacturers, and those of Grand Rapids, Michigan, adopt that scale also.</p>
   <p>Mr. Burke of Grand Rapids, Michigan, furniture manufacturer, saw Mr. Beiersdorff yesterday, but no eight-hour workday was mentioned by Mr. Burke's employees. The factories in Michigan have attained prominence since the great Chicago fire, and if they keep up the old wage scale, Chicago manufacturers must follow suit. Most of Beiersdorff's workers are sensible, and realize that the firm, acting independently, cannot afford to pay a ten-hour wage for an eight-hour day, because heavy losses would follow. He would like to see his men earn much money, because, ultimately, that would increase his own profits.</p>
   
   <p>When questioned, Mr. Beiersdorff said that a furniture manufacturers' association has been in existence since 1871, but that salary questions had never been discussed by that body since it was founded, excepting to provide protection against bad debtors.</p>
   <p>The employees of W. W. Strong's factory, on West Randolph Street, struck on Monday for an eight-hour day, but returned to work Tuesday without having accomplished anything, according to Mr. Thayer, the manager.</p>
   <p>A. H. Andrews, of the firm of Andrews and Company, 211-213 Wabash Avenue, laughed heartily when our reporter asked him about the eight-hour movement and replied that his men would work twenty hours a day, if he gave them a chance, because their earnings would be proportionately greater. With the exception of three or four men, all do piece work, and earn good money. He does not care whether the men wish to work eight, seven, six, or even fewer, hours per day; he would not lose by such an arrangement, but his men would never think of such short hours. In 1873 it was necessary to discharge a few agitators, and, since that time, no substantial reduction has taken place. In July, 1877, his men would have shouldered muskets to fire on the strikers, if guns had been supplied for that purpose. After all, his workers are well off, and have been with the company for years. The firm employs about 125 men.</p>
   <p>Bamberger, Bloome and Company, 207-209 Wabash Avenue, do not employ union labor, and received no request to let their men work only eight hours per day. With the exception of the finishers, the men do piece work, and many even stay evenings to earn extra money. Mr. Bloome said he did not care if the men work only two or three hours a day.</p>
   <p>Deimel and Brothers, 205 Lake Street, were notified by a workers' committee on Monday morning, that the men would only work eight hours on Tuesday. The firm instructed the foreman to announce in the evening, that all workers who are not willing to work ten hours, need not report for work. On Tuesday, everybody came to work, and the company still works ten hours per day.</p>
   
   <p>H. and M. Neuberger, 80-82 Randolph Street, are working eight hours per day, with a proportionate wage reduction. Mr. Neuberger said he would like to see his men earn twenty-five dollars a week, because then he would make more money. The furniture workers want to establish the eight-hour system at present, even at a wage reduction, and in the Fall, when business is brisk, they intend to strike to obtain ten hours' pay for eight hours' work.</p>
   <p>Stotz and Woltz, 57-63 Illinois Street, started on an eight-hour schedule today, with a proportionate wage reduction. The owner said that he would like to let the men work ten hours a day, but finds it necessary to comply with the wishes of the workers. He called one of his employees, who declared that the furniture workers hope to obtain their former ten-hour wage for an eight-hour day in the Fall, if business shows signs of improvement. Beginning today he will, of course, earn only $1.60 instead of two dollars per day; but he is perfectly satisfied.</p>
   
   <p>The Illinois Furniture Company will work eight instead of ten hours per day with a proportionate reduction in wages.</p>
   <p>Iverbeck and Holts, manufacturers of beds, and other furniture, told our reporter that all their piece workers are working only eight hours a day at present, with a consequent thirty per cent reduction in output, and that the firm would be quite satisfied if all manufacturers would have to face the same issue; however, the management doubts that the men will be willing, in the long run, to decrease their wages.</p>
   <p>At Jacobson's factory, where upholstered articles, furniture and picture frames are manufactured, our reporter was informed that the piece workers tried the eight-hour workday for two days, then reconsidered the matter, and are now trying to work and earn as much as they can; in fact, they work as long as the shop is open. Mr. Jacobson said that good furniture workers are in demand, and none need be idle. A strike will hardly be considered, since most of the workers are piece workers, who know that they receive as much as they can be paid.</p>
   <p>A. W. Ovitt, manufacturer of tables, located at Lake and Peoria Streets, has had no experience with the eight-hour day, but doubts that the eight-hour system will prevail for any length of time in furniture manufacturing establishments. Furniture making is based on piece work, and requires considerable machinery. As the working period is diminished, the overhead increases, since space for the necessary equipment costs the employer just as much money, whether the worker works eight or ten hours, and, in all fairness, a man working only eight hours a day cannot expect as high a rate as the man who works ten hours.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ovitt does not expect a strike, since the men know only too well that a strike in city plants would induce manufacturers to move their plants into country districts, and that nothing would be gained by that.</p>
   <p>If the eight-hour day is to be established in furniture factories, all small concerns will face bankruptcy, because they cannot afford to curtail production, and, to his [Ovitt's] knowledge, there is not a single furniture manufacturer in the city who has space enough to hire additional men.</p>
