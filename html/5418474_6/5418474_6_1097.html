   <p>Karl Eitel's ambition was a soldiery career, he wanted to be an army officer, but a throat ailment precluded this.</p>
   <p>Following the invitation of his brother, the young man came to America in 1891, and taking advantage of the fact that the Chicago World's Fair was in operation, the brothers opened the first Bismarck hotel on Cottage Grove Avenue and Sixty-Third Street. The success of that venture is well known, and culminated in the opening of the present hotel in 1926. In a moment of joviality, Karl Eitel admitted that the two remained brothers, neighbors,brothers-in-law, and partners for many years.</p>
   <p>The name of the hotel was the means of bringing the brothers in contact with the old empire's chancellor on several occasions. One of Karl Eitel's most cherished memories was his visit to Bismarck in April, 1894.</p>
