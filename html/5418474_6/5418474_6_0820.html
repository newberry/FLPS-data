   <p>The Federal Government has a special department which deals with the transformation of arid lands into fertile soil. When the great drought invaded the Dakotas, Montana, Wyoming, and parts of other states, and when the loose subsoil began to move away and dust storms prevailed throughout the country, Washington knew then that forceful intervention on the part of the Government in behalf of the affected areas had become imperative. A representative of the Department was sent to these areas to ascertain how things were and what the outlook was for the future.</p>
   <p>This representative has now returned from his tour of inspection. His findings are, in effect, that the areas most affected by the drought, which comprise, mainly, large districts of the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Montana, had been transformed into a desert unsuitable for any human settlement. He is of the opinion that the Government should resettle the entire population of those areas into districts in which they would have at least a semblance of a chance to earn their living in agricultural pursuits. The representative further maintains that the land on which these people now live will never become arable again. This ground is dried out through and through; not a single blade of green can be seen on it and nothing will grow on it in the future.</p>
   <p>The inhabitants, however, are of a different opinion. They believe that the soil may be reclaimed and become fertile again. Which is the right viewpoint, is, of course, not to be decided at the writer's desk. The farmers who for many years have cultivated their produce there, have had practical experience which cannot be overlooked by anybody. On the other hand, the representative of the Federal Government has the advantage of scientific research on his side, together with a knowledge of certain facts which these farmers do not have. They do not seem to know that not only have their fields dried out; but numerous sources of water, even subterranean currents, have become dried up, perhaps for a long time, perhaps forever. Nor do they seem to know that the one-sided lack of diversification in their crops has taken from their fields all resistance to the elements; that their lands have become a pawn for the winds to play with; and, that it is but a question of a relatively short time until sand dunes begin to form, as is usually nature's way with deserts.</p>
   <p>The farmers have no confidence in the findings of the commissioner nor do they believe that the desert formation is, in part, their own fault; they distrust his superior insight. They do not want to go away but prefer to stay and carry on the hard and almost hopeless struggle with the sun and the wind instead of being resettled in other districts. The opinion that generally prevails is that the American farmer is less attached to his soil than the European. When one sees how frequently farmers sell their land and settle in other places a few hundred miles farther away, this opinion naturally appears to be well founded. The stubborn persistence of the farmers, impoverished by dry and dusty soil which affords no hope of ever producing even what they actually need to live on, and which will never be of any use to them, shows the American farmer from quite a different angle. It will be hard work, therefore, to persuade him to settle in other areas, much harder than they seem to think in Washington.</p>
   
   <p>It is strange to notice with what persistence a man may adhere to the soil into which he has put his labors, even when it no longer repays his efforts, and provides for him but insufficiently or else permits the elements to threaten destruction to him and his home. For thousands of years the Italian peasants who settled on the slopes of Vesuvius or Etna have been in constant danger of being buried by the next eruption of the volcano. This danger has, in the course of history, become a reality many times. Yet they would not abandon the soil which meant so much to them. The survivors of the catas-trophies rebuilt their villages soon afterwards, close by or even on top of the hardened lava masses. The City of Messina, soon after its destruction by the elements, rose like Phoenix from its ashes. This tendency of theirs to cling to the soil which they had tilled by the sweat of their brows has not been observed, until now, among immigrants to American lands. Do we see in it the development of a new and more intimate relation between the American farmer and the soil? Does it signify that his love for the soil has become deep rooted and made him a part of it?</p>
