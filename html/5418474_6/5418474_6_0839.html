   <p>In an article dealing with the outlook for agriculture and industry, the Alexander Hamilton Institute points to the close relationship between the two. In a graphic presentation of the agricultural and industrial production in the period from 1919 to 1932, it is shown that the two lines are nearly parallel. Whenever the value of industrial production rose above that of agricultural production, the price levels of the two types of products soon became parallel again.</p>
   <p>According to estimates made by the Department of Agriculture, farmers' incomes this year amounted to $5,240,000,000. This demonstrates a considerable recession as compared with last year, when the total was $6,955,000,000. In 1930 the income from agriculture was $9,506,000, and in 1929 it was $11,950,000. Accordingly, the income of the farmers has been consistently and almost <span class="page-break">\2</span>uniformly receding in the last four years. The recession amounted to 56.2 per cent.</p>
   <p>This recession, of course, is not to be understood as a decrease in the quantity of production, but rather as a reduction in prices. The market value of industrial production was lowered 60.3 per cent between 1929 to 1931, and so it coincides almost exactly with the downward trend of agricultural production. The fall in prices, however, amounted to only 25.1 per cent, whereas quantity production went down 47 per cent. This evidence also demonstrates the clear parallelism between the groups. One may make the out-right statement that industry had to bring its prices to an approximate level and its production to a real level in relation to the value of agricultural production.</p>
   <p>There are a number of signs indicating that for agricultural products, the period of sinking prices has now come to an end. Since last June the prices of agricultural products have been rising slowly. This increase in prices was neither general nor uniform; in a way, it was rather impeded by a number <span class="page-break">\3</span>of drawbacks. But the general tendency with regard to prices of agricultural products indicated a rise. There is a belief among experts that this tendency will continue next year, and the increase in income from agricultural products is estimated at 10 per cent.</p>
   <p>The index of values of industrial products stands, for the first time since the beginning of the depression, below that of agricultural production. From this, one may conclude with sufficient certainty that increases in value of the former will be greater next year than those of the latter. For there is no reason to assume that the process of levelling is not being reached. But one must not jump to the conclusion that the quantity of production will be much above that of the current year. It is quite possible that the increase in value to be expected with certainty will be realized by higher prices exclusively.</p>
   <p>At any rate, the data and evaluations, based as they are on reliable sources, make it clear once more that an improved situation in agriculture inevitably <span class="page-break">\4</span>precedes a general improvement in the economic situation. The experts have figured that next year the value of industrial products will be approximately 20 per cent higher than that of this year. This is by no means a satisfactory increase, as production will still lag behind that of 1931. People have become accustomed to the idea that a speedy return to prosperity is not to be expected. They must find satisfaction in the slow rise, for which there are now favorable indications.</p>
