   <p>Will S. Darley and Hermann G. Pfeifer, two Chicago youths, succeeded in interesting the Department of the Navy at Washington in their invention, a new explosive chemical, which they called "Mirex". Its peculiar advantage, which makes it highly desirable for marine battles, consists in the fact, that it can be exploded in the water, and solely by the pressure of the water, which is exerted on the material. And especially through the resistance of the elements, water, the explosive strength destructive results are increased. Darley and Pfeifer went to Washington last month but, because of their youth and being entirely unknown it was exceedingly difficult for them, to obtain an audience before the proper departments. Finally, however, they succeeded in inducing Commodore O'Neill, Chief of Navy-armaments, to send Inspector Cowles with the boat "Triton" to Indian Head, 20 miles below Washington. There, on the Potomac, they showed what they can do, and now, it is alleged, the Government has ordered further preparations for experiments, near Fort Sheridan, where the wonderful "Mirex" will be observed. If expectations are realized, then Darley and Pfeifer will not have to worry about food for the rest of their lives.</p>
