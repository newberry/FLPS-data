   <p>Having passed a second examination before Circuit Court Judge Barrett, thirty-four Germans and seventeen German-Austrians and Bohemians received their citizenship papers yesterday. The Austrians were required to abjure allegiance to Emperor Karl, and the Germans were required to abjure allegiance to Emperor Wilhelm. Mr. Stephan Schneider was one of those who were naturalized. [Translator's note: In the heading, Mr. Schneider's Christian name is given as "Josef".]</p>
   <p>He resides at 2016 Sedgwick Street and is the owner of the Schneider Ball Bearing Company, on Berteau Avenue. Nine years ago he emigrated from Silesia, Germany, and founded his company. He furnished England with war material during the entire time of the war.</p>

   <p>"It is my wish that the United States win every war," he said, "and I would have sent my son, had he not been but seventeen years old. During the war I employed forty-eight men, and now I have forty working for me. All my interests are centered in this country."</p>

After a short time, he built the three-story factory at Harrison Street and Clarence Avenue, and founded the United States Ball Bearing Company. He was president of the organization. A. A. Strom was vice-president, and Paul Schulte was secretary and treasurer.</p>

   <p>He has obtained eighty patents; one or more in every civilized country of the world, and twenty-two in America. In the monthly magazine published by the Illinois Manufacturers' Association, he is pictured as one of the captains of industry.....</p>
