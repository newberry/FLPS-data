   <p>Last night's chamber concert at Weber's Music Hall, played by the expert musicians August Spanuth, Adolph Rosenbecker and Fred Hess was again one of rare art and beauty. The three artists played opus 52 by Rubinstein, with masterly accomplishment, also Brahm's concerto for violin and violin cello, played by Rosenbecker and Hess, and the Beethoven sonata, played by Mr. Spanuth. Miss Emma Heckle assisted the trio by vocal solos from compositions by Brahms and Rubinstein. Miss Heckle who has a lovely voice found an appreciative audience.</p>
