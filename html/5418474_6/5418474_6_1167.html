   <p>Dr. Robert Wahl and Dr. Max Henius of the local Brewer's Academy have obtained a patent,for their discovery; the practical utilization of beer-yeast. This may prove a veritable Klondike for them and it can be exploited without danger and painful exertion. Through their process, it is claimed, that the yeast, which heretofore has always been considered a worthless by product, can be converted into a food product similar to "extract of beef" which it may replace. The beer-yeast, thrown away by the Chicago breweries, can produce 50,000 pounds annually of this new food product. The yeast, throughout the entire country, would suffice for one million pounds of beef-extract substitute.</p>
   <p>The patent of Wahl and Henius contains extensive claims, so that they are fully protected against possible infringements and competition.</p>
