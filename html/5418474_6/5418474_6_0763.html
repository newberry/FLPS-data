   <p>Although the majority of German women never have asked for suffrage, it is a fact that since woman suffrage has become a law in the State of Illinois, the interest for it has increased rapidly. The United Societies had arranged a meeting at the large Wicker-Park Hall yesterday, which was early and completely crowded by German women. They had come to hear speakers on this subject and to get more information about it. Mr. G. Landan, President of the United Society for Local Self-Government, explained the purpose and aims of this society and then turned the meeting over to Mrs. A. Felice. Her efforts in organizing the women are well recognized.</p>
