   <p>Emil Berla and the Vienna Operetta Company will move into the Globe Theater on Wabash Avenue and Hubbard Court. To-day will be the last matinee and evening performances, "The Cellar Master" at the Ziegfeld Theater. To-morrow the first matinee and evening show at the Globe Theater, where the jovial Viennese will sing their happy melodies. The "Cellar Master" with its splendid artists, Luise Barthel, Morena, and others, its lovely girls from Vienna, will surely show us, how delighted they are in their new surroundings.</p>
