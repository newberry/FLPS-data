   <p>p. 4.. The musical department of our Columbian (World's Fair) Exposition has much to contend with - first, the instruments which are used, then the programs and finally, the epxenses. In the beginning the attacks were motivated by business rivalry and plain jealousy.</p>
   <p>The music of the exposition is expensive; and if a commensurate educational benefit is not derived therefrom, then it is too costly. To give such a proof, however, is an exceedingly difficult task. If it is true, that the symphony concerts cost $1,200 per day, and that the daily receipts average only $300, then the question arises whether the exposition is here to regale a few with music or if the stockholders should be expected to keep their promises and to continue spending lavishly for delectable music which barely interests one-third of all the visitors.</p>
   <p>The administration closed the grounds again on Sunday, because there was not enough profit to pay for the amount of labor involved; but it was never said, nor will it ever be proven, that open Sundays produce a definite loss. However, the symphony is daily from $900 to $1,000 in the red and there is a justification for discontinuing the concerts.</p>
   <p>Obviously, it is not necessary to discontinue them altogether. Why not appropriate $1,200 once a week and give a free concert? It would mean an increased patronage for the "Fair," improve the musical appreciation of the masses and incidentally, save $6,000 per week. As a matter of fact, there has been too much classical music at the exposition. Let us try the weekly plan.</p>
   <p>The managers of the concerts may have been prompted by the most idealistic considerations, but experience teaches that the class which enjoys classical music is a small minority - everywhere.</p>
