   <p>The divorce problem reflects various colors, bright and dark ones, according to the different laws in the states of this great republic, which make divorce either easy or difficult to obtain. In the state of North Carolina the future looks very dark for those who desire to divorce their marriage partner, because divorce is illegitimate and divorce laws do not exist. On the other hand, the divorce laws of South Dakota and Oklahoma appear in the most promising and fancy rose colors for those tired of matrimony and their increase in population is, no doubt, partially due to these easy divorce laws. Between these extremes there are, as it were, all shades and hues, from a murky gray in the state of New York to the brighter colors in the Western Central states.</p>
   <p>The state of New York recognizes only adultery as a legitimate reason for divorce, but the guilty partner is forbidden to remarry. Some of the West Central states, on the contrary, recognize more than one-half dozen legitimate reasons for divorce. Just as the divorce laws in the states differ, so there is also a difference in recognized causes in each state.</p>

   <p>In spite of this, the possible reasons are not yet exhausted, and it may happen that a lady, anxious to divorce her husband for an apparently reasonable cause, can find no state in which her cause is recognized as legal. If we uphold the various divorce laws and recognize them as legal we should try to attain perfection in this because it is an infringement on the rights of woman to deny her the possibility of divorcing her husband for any reason of her own anywhere in this great republic. This reform is, of course, a matter for the jurists of our country, and one can truly assert that they are well aware of their task. Every new divorce law must be the result of a new recognized cause and there is no limit to recommending new and different causes for divorces.</p>
   <p>A certain judge in Missouri evidently discovered such a deficiency in the divorce laws and desired to call attention to it by granting a certain woman a divorce decree, because her husband was a poor man, who had to work for low wages and could not support her in a way that was satisfactory to her. Although the divorce laws in Missouri do not recognize poverty as a legal cause this judge granted her a decree, obviously assuming that a change or correction of the state laws was necessary. His intention was commendable, but the action of Judge Bland from the court of appeals frustated <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>it all, because he declared the divorce decree of the lower courts illegitimate, since no law in the state of Missouri recognizes poverty as a cause for divorce. This judge, apparently a dried-up book-worm, knows nothing of the requirements of an up-to-date American woman. Perhaps he did not have the courage to declare that the inability of a man to support his wife is sufficient reason for divorce, since he simply stated that Missouri has no such divorce laws. This deficiency in the divorce laws should be rectified in order to make it possible to say to woman, desiring divorces:</p>
   <p>"Take your choice, ladies, and do as you please." This would be the climax of the rights of woman.</p>
