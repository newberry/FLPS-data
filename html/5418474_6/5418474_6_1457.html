   <p>Book Store and Rental Library,</p>

   <p>[Translator's note: This advertisement was translated because of the reference to a rental library. From all appearances this was one of the first rental libraries in the city of Chicago, if not the first. After having exhausted all sources of research available at Newberry Library, I find no information that a rental library existed here prior to the year 1867. Probably Mr. Buehler had books on mechanics which were not to be had on the local market, but which were in great demand at the time, and found it more profitable to rent them for a consideration than to sell them.]</p>
