   <p>Based on his own sound judgment and constitutional right, President Grover Cleveland nominated Attorney A. Hornblower to become a member of the Federal Superior Court for the district New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.</p>

   <p>We know and understand, that the Senate as one compact, legal body can oppose and defy any decision of the President. But otherwise, we consider it an arrogance, if the Senate, stirred up by one Senator, is trying to <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>side in with local politics, in order to undermine the President's sound choice of a good man with a spotless name and clean record.</p>
