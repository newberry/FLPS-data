   <p>The Thirteenth Cavalry Regiment broke camp yesterday morning at 11 A.M. and left for St. Louis. The officers of the Regiment are Colonel J. W. Bell, Lieutenant Colonel Theobald Hartmann, and Major Lothar Lippert. [Names of other officers were omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Colonel Bell was born in Tennessee about forty-seven years ago. He was formerly a lawyer, and later became a clerk in the war Department. He was authorized to form a regiment under the condition that he unite with Lieutenant Colonel Hartmann.</p>
   <p>The latter is well known and greatly respected by the German citizens of Chicago. Mr. Theobald Hartmann was a member of the Bavarian Light Cavalry which fought at Zweibruecken during the Palatine Movement to establish a German constitutional government which should not be headed by a monarch, and he and his company which elected him to be its leader went over to the army of the people. During the <span class="page-break">\2</span>siege of Rastadt he was among the besieged, and after the capitulation of this fort he spent a number of years as a prisoner in the casemate of Rastadt.</p>
   <p>Major Lothar Lippert was a Bavarian officer and is a well educated soldier. As soon as the Rebellion broke out he rushed to arms and organized a company. But his efforts to be assigned to a regiment, [were fruitless] and, after spending three months in idleness at Camp Yates, near Springfield, where the soldiers passed the time making swords of wood in order to have at least something in their hand when they served as sentries, he became disgusted with the doings of Yates and Hoffmann (Translator's note: Yates was Governor of Illinois, and Hoffmann was Lieutenant Governor) and returned home. He was willing to join the Regiment of Hecker, but the same intriguers who were responsible for the removal of Knobelsdorf and Hecker would not permit men like Lippert and Thielemann to hold positions as army officers. Later, when Knobelsdorf organized the Northwestern Rifle Company, he immediately secured the services of Lippert, and we know from Mr. Knobelsdorf that he did not willingly consent to the procedure whereby Lippert was removed from the Rifle <span class="page-break">\3</span>Company. Dr. Wagner, Regimental Physician, was with Hecker's Regiment until a short time ago; he refused to remain after Hecker and his Regiment were so shamefully treated as a result of the machinations of infamous conspirators. The Hecker Boys will miss him very much, and Hartmann's Boys are to be congratulated upon securing his services. In the list of officers are many German names, among them that of Ernst Riedel, the jovial Cottage Grove Avenue saloonkeeper, who formerly was an officer in the Washington Cavalry. First Lieutenant R. G. Dyhrenfurth, son of the President of the Commercial School is also an officer in the Regiment. The former was a member of Schambeck's Cavalry and has endured all the hardships of the Virginia Campaign. Adjutant Werther hails from Posen and was an officer in the Prussian army.</p>
   <p>We have no doubt that all of the German officers of this Regiment will prove to be able and faithful soldiers and will contribute their part towards making the German name famous. We hope to hear of their deeds very soon.</p>
