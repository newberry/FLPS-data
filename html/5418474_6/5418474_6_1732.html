   <p>Yesterday's Sunday concert in the Turner Hall was well attended and the public listened with pleasure to the performance of the band under the direction of Mr. Jos. Clauder. As long as Mr. Clauder offers a selection of pieces similar to the one he chose yesterday he may rely on an attentive audience. The attempt to play classical or heavy concert music would be courting failure, to judge by the type of audience. Even Thomas found it difficult to lift his concerts in Central Park, New York, above the level of ordinary entertainment music. Mr. Clauder seems to be following the example of Thomas. What he produces is popular easily understood music.</p>
   <p>To be mentioned especially from yesterday's performance, is the overture to "Stradella." The audience otherwise always so noisy and restless kept perfectly quiet while it was played.</p>
