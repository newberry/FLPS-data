   <p>Even though the union meeting held at Bryan's Hall has been productive of no good whatever, every freedom-loving German is honor-bound to subscribe to the resolutions which were passed. These resolutions contain the principles that General John Fremont laid down in his proclamation. They have caused proslavery people much pain, and the Democratic committee has publicly denounced them and declared that no Democrat is obligated to support candidates who do not openly disavow these resolutions.</p>
   <p>These pro-slavers are led by W. C. Goudy, a candidate for the constitutional convention, and he did everything he possibly could to prevent the adoption of these resolutions. What liberal-minded German will vote for a pro-slavery man while our soldiers are shedding their blood and dying on the battlefields to overthrow the accursed slave barons? Not one.</p>
