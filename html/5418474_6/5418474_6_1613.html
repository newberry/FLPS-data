   <p>Since a German Theater Company took possession of the Auditorium, German Opera and German classical music are rapidly conquering Chicago. The Auditorium is crowded every night and the stormy applause for the German actors is a proof of the enthusiastic mood of the Chicago public. A well arranged program for the whole season is offering to the Chicago music-lovers the best productions of German master-composers, particularly Wagner. The actors and singers, filling the main-casts, are at their best and will contribute considerably to the fame of German opera-music. Particular praise must be given to the following German Opera Singers: E. Gruening, T. Fischer, Louise Mulder, Marie Maurer, O. Behrens, B. Mertens, P. Alvary and S. Demeter, for their first class achievements.</p>
