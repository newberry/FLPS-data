   <p>At the celebration of the eightieth birthday celebration, Mayor Roche presided. Mr. Kasson, from Iowa, was toastmaster, and a wonderful speech, extolling the services of Lincoln to his country.</p>
   <p>What were Lincoln's greatest achievements? Common opinion attributes to him, although erroneously from the historical point of view, the abolition of black slavery as one of the most important. For this he was revered by the people.</p>
   <p>If, therefore, Lincoln is celebrated on account of his supposed act of abolishing slavery, how can prominent plutocrats commemorate Lincoln's birthday so pompously? How can they pay homage to such a man when their own business concerns are established on a wage of slavery ten times worse than black slavery has ever been? How can they honor their worse enemy? The hypocrisy of the plutocrats accounts for this situation.</p>

   <p>What a sad morality our present one is! Great men of the past are honored, and monuments are erected to their memory, while the living heroes, the fighters for humanity, are put in jail.</p>
