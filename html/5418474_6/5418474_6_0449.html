   <p>William Jennings Bryan made a speech last Friday in Brooklyn in which he boasted that the present administration had done more for the world's peace than all the former ones. Perhaps he believes this nonsense himself. He may have contracted peace negotiations with Switzerland, Albania, Luxemburg and almost with Denmark, but we always have a had a good understanding with these nations, even without peace contracts. We would very much like to know what Mr. Bryan thinks of the possibility of a way with Switzerland?</p>
   <p>Bryan makes no mention of the bungling of the American Consulate service, nor about the dismissal of the capable officials of the Government and the appointment of hungry job hunters and incapable politicians.</p>
   <p>In the Bryan system efficiency does not count and the loot system has been introduced. He preaches peace but acts according to the principle: "To the victor belong the spoils".</p>
