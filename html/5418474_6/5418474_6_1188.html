   <p>The undersigned Germans of the North Side have formerly been active in such an enterprise and have now organized a bank, which is incorporated under the name: The German Credit-Bank. The bank is under strictest state supervision, and state auditors recheck the bank's financial condition. Besides, it is managed by an elected directorate. The German Credit Bank believes in, and fosters the principle of "Equal rights for all". One of its provisions stipulates, that each member cannot own more than one share, which prevents the concentration of power among a few. Its members share equally in its profits. As participation bonds are limited to $100.00 in value, and as only one is available to each holder, every small merchant will be enabled to become a member. The bank will be opened in a few days at Yondorf's Hall (facing Halsted Street, corner North Avenue). Subscriptions will be accepted at that address.</p>
