   <p>The Sunday concerts in the North Side Turner Hall are continuously gaining in popularity. Yesterday's concert was very well attended. The band played in a masterful manner. A remarkable accomplishment was Lumbye's "Traumbilder." The band proved its good schooling and Mr. Clauder his great ability in the performance of the "Tell Overture." The public did not spare its applause. The attention was frequently so intense that the tinkling of glasses and conversation stopped completely.</p>
