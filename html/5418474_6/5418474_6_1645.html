   <p>The Carl Wolfsohn evening at the small hall of the Auditorium was indeed rich in surprises. It was the last of a series of Trio-performances of this season. Mr. Wolfsohn gave an exclusive Beethoven program. His many friends, who give full recognition to his untiring efforts to make classical music popular in Chicago, and who know his predilection for the profoundest of the German composers, prepared a surprise for him by presenting to him a splendid picture of Beethoven drawn with chalk by Berthold Meyer. Mr. Wolfsohn appeared highly gratified, but he also did something unexpected and unusual. He had barely finished the A flat Major Sonata when he was recalled with applause. He replied with a lengthy address in which he expressed his heartfelt enthusiasm for Beethoven. He also related, how Germany endeavors to honor the great master. The house he lived in at Bonn has been bought, and constant efforts are made to perpetuate his memory. He then divulged a plan, whereby Beethoven shall also be honored in America. This should be done, in his opinion, by raising funds for a suitable monument in Lincoln Park. But this does not suffice! One should also collect enough money to maintain a good orchestra, which can render his, and other great composers works in a proper, dignified, and capable manner.</p>

   <p>According to his estimate, $100,000.00 would be enough for this purpose, temporarily, at least, and he begged the assembly to give this thought a cordial reception and to work for the realization of this plan. Subscription lists should be mailed everywhere and, at the same time, he asked permission to be the first to make a contribution. He offered $1,000.00 to the cause. His speech, was greeted with tumultuous applause. Surely, some committee or society will be organized which will bring Mr. Wolfsohn's plan into existence.</p>
   <p>The concert in itself was most enjoyable. The two Trios were played by Messrs. Wolfsohn, Marum and Hep in their customary artistic fashion, and Mr. Wolfsohn, as soloist, gave the well known A flat Major Sonata. Charles Knorr sang Adelaide with true musical sentiment. We will revert to this concert later.</p>
