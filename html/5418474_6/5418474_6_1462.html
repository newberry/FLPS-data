   <p>To the Editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung! An advertisement in your newspaper stated that the Chicago Employment Association, which has an office at 118 South Clark Street, wanted two hundred carpenters, and promised to secure employment for them at a wage of five dollars a day. I and two other carpenters went to the office of the Association, and after paying a fee of two dollars, we were sent to the C. R. Pool Company, in Memphis, Tennessee. Transportation cost us twelve dollars each. We traveled to Cairo via the Illinois Central Railroad (second class), thence to Memphis by steamer (second deck). Upon our arrival, we immediately went to the office of the C. R. Pool Company and were told that it neither needed nor had ordered any carpenters. Thus we were obliged to return to Chicago. We spent the money for our fares and paid the freight charges for transporting our tools, but did not attain our object. I therefore warn all workers against having <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>any dealings with the Chicago Employment Association.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Hermann Harms.</p>
