   <p>Can the four per cent interest rate on the rapidly absorbed United States Government bonds be regarded as a definite, future interest rate or an indication of money value in this country? That is, can it be regarded as an approximate measure, since national credit is usually safer than that of individuals or corporations? Does this prompt buying of Government bonds represent economic inactivity or reveal that the populace does not dare invest capital, its liquid funds, in private enterprises? Or, since we are confronted with our economic welfare, and since, perhaps, we have such a surplus amount of money, do we seek only a temporary outlet for our capital by buying four per cent bonds? Have we reached the point in our economic development where the land now enjoys a less fluctuating interest rate? Obviously, these are important economic questions, and the solution thereto must be of profound interest to the people. But these problems cannot be answered definitely by <span class="page-break">\2</span>a mere yes or no, since opposite opinions prevail among the agricultural and commercial interests. Therefore, the appended lines can be regarded only as a contribution to this economic wrangle.</p>
   <p>The history of economic conditions provides only a weak foundation whereby one might adjudge the current interest rate as an indication of a commercial nation's well-being. Interest data involving the Bank of England is interesting, though not reliable, in settling the question. One has seen within the last twenty years the greatest discrepancies in the interest rates of the Bank of England. The Peel Acts which regulate interest on funds, and the influence of the mighty London money clique, always exerted a paramount effect upon English interest rates. [Translator's note: Sir Robert Peel, first Lord of the Treasury, abolished the deficit in English revenues. In 1844 the Bank Charter Act, although thrice suspended at a desperate crisis, has ever since regulated the currency of England.] In England's economic history we find high as well as low interest rates during good times, and the same is true of poor years. During the crisis in 1857 the Bank of England changed its interest rate nine times: from 1858 to <span class="page-break">\3</span>1862, thirty-eight times; from 1863 to 1866, fifty-seven times; from 1867 to 1871, thirty-two times; from 1872 to 1874, fifty-one times; and, from 1875 to 1876, seventeen times.</p>
   <p>The older school of economy held that ground rent was the gauge of our general welfare, and that, therefore, it controlled the healthy interest rate of a nation. The newer science discarded this theory, claiming that the interest rate at which a country may borrow money is a truer index of a nation's financial status. The credit of a government depends upon its solvency and, inversely, the revenue of a government--with which it pays its creditors--is based upon the prosperity of the people. If the latter are well situated, so that commerce flourishes and industry hums, then the resultant increase of revenue from taxes and duties enriches the national treasury which, in turn, provides greater security for the governments' indebtedness. The interest rate, then, at which a government can float a loan is significant insofar as the financial situation is concerned, and the dividend, therefore, may be regarded as a rather reliable economic indicator. Actually, we enjoy cheap money, even though commercial rates only <span class="page-break">\4</span>approximate the national rate.</p>
   <p>The belief is justified that the many millions of people, who seek the four per cent issue, prove that the present money situation is not sufficiently clarified, and that a great lack of confidence makes Government bonds preferable to risking one's surplus capital in other enterprises. However, this surplus capital which one has been able to accumulate and which was added to this country's wealth through a favorable trade balance, does not show such definite preference for the four per cent U. S. bonds that one might assert he finds no favorable opportunities in other business channels here. Probably millions of U. S. bonds are subscribed to daily, but a large number are absorbed by the banks, which fact must be ascribed to their financial condition as well as to speculation. In selling the bonds, the banks not only receive a commission from the Treasury, but also obtain three month's interest.</p>
   <p>The public, however, does not invest its money exclusively in Government bonds. As proof one need but cite that the American public buys a considerable amount of <span class="page-break">\5</span>American paper which heretofore was absorbed only by foreign countries. One could cite also that the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad which formerly paid eight per cent on its bonds, can today sell six-per cent bearing issues, or that the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad paid only seven per cent to obtain capital instead of eight per cent as formerly, and its bonds bear only six per cent.</p>
   <p>We note that interest rates in the West--which were always higher than those in the East--are also--decreasing, so that mortgage rates on western lands dropped to seven per cent in many instances; heretofore, loans on these lands were quoted at ten per cent. This shows that capital feels sufficiently encouraged to seek investments beyond the four per cent Government bonds.</p>
   <p>Our economic position in itself is favorable, and aside from the trade balance, our industrial activity is no less propitious and promising; this becomes evident in the iron industry. The recent report of the secretary of the American Iron and Steel Company of Philadelphia gave a long, detailed, statistical account of industrial conditions in 1878, and in closing made the following remarks: "Last year <span class="page-break">\6</span>proved more profitable to the American iron industry than the two preceding years. There was a greater demand for iron and steel products, and prices remained at a fair level. Foreign competition diminished and, therefore, one of our industrial branches faces good prospects for the ensuing year." The iron industry usually gives a true picture of our manufacturing outlook as a whole.</p>
   <p>The sale of the four per cent U. S. bonds, regardless of an occasionally applied artificial stimulus, demonstrates that our economic condition improved, that we are satisfied with less interest, and that the nation has reached the phase where one can work with more stable interest rates, whereas fluctuating rates often overthrow long-time commercial computations or, at best, make them difficult. It is not a matter of suspicion which induces the people to invest capital in four per cent bonds; it is attributable to the fact that there is surplus money for which, thus far, we have not found adequate investment opportunities. (Editor's comment: We need hardly remind our readers that we have a different, less optimistic view than our collaborator. Whether his or our opinions will more nearly coincide with actuality, the future must show; but we sincerely hope our <span class="page-break">\7</span>correspondent will be right.) Expensive money [Translator's note: Money at a high interest rate] always proved a millstone in so far as economic revivals were concerned. However, it seems that we have passed the period of high-priced capital. We have reached the point in our economic development where one may have cheap money and a more stabilized interest rate, and in that we can perceive only an auspicious omen for our future.</p>
