   <p>Our recent article, wherein it was asserted that Mr. E. J. Lehmann, the wealthy owner of the "Fair" is suffering from a mental malady, was verified this morning by his wife, Mrs. Auguste Lehmann, at the Surrogate's Court, where she filed a petition for the appointment of an executor for the two and one half million dollar estate and she further petitioned not to have the matter unnecessarily postponed but to conduct an examination of her husband's unfortunate mental condition during the May-term of the Court.</p>
