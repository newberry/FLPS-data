   <p>Following the first lecture in the Lincoln Club, on the theme "Seriousness and Cheerfulness of the German-American Past", Dr. H. H. Maurer spoke yesterday evening in the same locality, about the Germans of '48 and their Influence upon the unrest in America in the year 1849 till the outbreak of the Civil war. The theme was not so simple and would have furnished sufficient material for several evenings, therefore the lecture appeared somewaht crowded; nevertheless it was perfectly clear.</p>
   <p>The speaker pointed out, that just as the French Revolution of 1793 prepared the German of 1848, in the same way has the German Revolution influenced the American unrest, and in the end led to the Civil War. Stirred by a tremendous idealism, about 700,000 Germans immigrated to America, all of whom felt inwardly, that they more or less had the call to bring liberty to the world, and who believed, that they also could upset every thing that was old in America and could create new conditions.</p>

   <p>But those "Greenhorns" found when landing in New York, very few like minded people. They thought it was sufficent, when they stood on street corners or in the saloons, to make enthusiastic and thundering speeches about liberty and equality. Instead they could observe that those belonging to their race were indifferent towards their ideals and ideas, preferred to drink their glass of beer in peace and to enjoy their lives. And so it came that the letters of the new immigrants of that time which were sent to Germany could not report success but only the amusing ways of the Americans. "At that time there was shown in New York in Barnum's circus, a mermaid," said Dr. Maurer to name an example, "and this mermaid attracted likewise ether objects, more interest of the immigrants than the carrying out of their high ideals."</p>
   <p>In spite of that, a few Germans succeeded in bringing their views before the members of their race, and the unrest of the years before the Civil War were, according to the speaker, nothing else than the consequences of the bacillers of the revolution, which were brought over by the German immigrants of that time.</p>

   <p>For this reason the Germans were ignored by other Americans. They could not understand them, used them, even at that time only as welcome "voting animals", but considered them as seditious persons and rioters, especially when it was rumored, that the Germans wanted to unite under Karl Schurz, and form a new party in the government. That in reality the Germans were only inspired by high ideals, was not understood by the colder thinking Anglo-Saxons. With a few characteristic examples of those times, elections which were always connected with riots, and which the speaker considers as small omen of a revolutionary mood in the country, Dr. Maurer closed his lecture, which was received with great applause by the audience.</p>
