   <p>Brand's Hall was filled last night by a large audience of art loving Germans, who had the pleasure of hearing the great German tenor, Anton Schott. His phenomenal voice still has the same strength and fine quality, which have conquered the world for him. He sang the following songs: Komm, wir wandeln zusammen ( Come, let us wander together), Tom, der Rhymer ( Tom, the Rhymer), Die beiden Grenadiere ( The Two Grenadiers) and others.</p>
   <p>A wild applause rewarded Mr. Schott's recitals. The listeners of the evening went home with the knowledge, to have heard one of the best German singers of the century.</p>
