   <p>After the bank was notified yesterday morning, that the Superior Court received the request of appointment of a court receiver for the institution, the Greenebaum Bank found it necessary to close its doors, at 11 A.M. The bank founded in 1869, enjoyed an excellent reputation and patronage until in 1873, when difficulties arose which it met in an admirable manner. The panic hardly touched it, but the failure of the State Savings Bank, and the excitement created by that, placed the Greenebaum Bank once more in grave danger. It emerged again victorious until the Central and Third National Banks, through their failures, created new fear and distrust, which reached a climax when the German National Bank closed its doors... The creditors will be paid is certain and that the confident promise of officials and share-holders, is a pledge.</p>
