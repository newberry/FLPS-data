   <p>Leo Braverman gave a violin concert yesterday evening in Kimball Hall. The not so very easy program of same gave him an excellent opportunity to prove his wonderful schooling and technique. Bravura pieces, like Bazzini's "Round of the Goblins", were played with great skill, but he seems less conconcerned with those compositions, which require a personal note of the artist, to obtain their full effects. With the "Hymn to the Sun" by Rimsky-Korsakow, he approached this ideal most. To the rich applause of a fairly large audience, he responded with additional numbers.</p>
   <p>A pillow, covered with gold decorations and electrically lighted, on the left of the stage, proved quite distracting and irritating to the sensitive listener. The eye is too closely related to the ear, not to be considered on such occasions.</p>
