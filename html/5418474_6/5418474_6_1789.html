   <p>Mr. Arthur Feudel has received a commission to paint two large panels for the new German Theater. The subjects, are to be the "Meeting of Marie Stuart, and Elizabeth" according to Schiller, and a scene from Shakespear's "Midsummer Night's Dream." A composition for the latter was seen in the artist's studio. It is cleverly composed and in a pleasing schemes of color and shows Titania and Bottom sleeping in the forest surrounded by fairies, following closely the text in the fourth act. Mr. Feudel's artistic ability and experience in decorative painting warrant the assertion that it would be difficult to have chosen an artist more fit to execute the work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Feudel is a native, of Germany, in which country he acquired his art education, but has for some time identified himself with the art interests of Chicago. It is probable that he will have the assistance of Mr. C. F. Van Saltza in the painting of the large canvass.</p>
