   <p>An audience of more than 3000 persons listened with great interest to yesterday's concert of the exquisite Thomas Orchestra at the Fair Building. The request for compositions by Wagner, Beethoven and Liszt deserve special mention. But we are inclined to believe, that it was not the majority of this audience, who appreciated such classical music, but a comparatively few who have the necessary musical education and understanding. The public at large still enjoys compositions by Offenbach, Souppe, etc. most. The program numbers were: The Trilogie from the Flying Dutchman, (The Spinning Song) and the Chorus of the Mariners, the Tannhauser Overture, the introduction and finale from Tristan and Isolde and the Ride of the Valkyries. This rich Wagnerian music was followed by Beethoven's Leonore No. 3, and then in contrast to this heavy and somber music, the orchestra turned to the beautiful Weber composition: Invitation to the Dance, after which we heard the exquisite Liszt Praludium. Next we heard the Lenoren symphony by Raff, Handels Largo with a violin obligato by Hermann Brand, Beethoven's Eight Symphony and Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2, <span class="page-break">2</span>It is almost needless to say, that this concert like all the rest, was executed with utmost precision.</p>
