   <p>The Lecture Course of Dr. Heinrich Kraeger.</p>
   <p>In the Club House of the Germania Maennerchor the series of lectures about German art of today was opened yesterday by Professor Dr. H. Kraeger of the Duessecdorf Academy of Art.</p>
   <p>Dr. Wever, the German Consul, opened the meeting with a short address in which he explained the reasons, that caused him to suggest this lecture tour. In America there is too little known about modern German art. Even in the American Universities there is a deplorable lack of knowledge about this territory, and therefore it is not only in the interest of German Art, but also of the Americans and especially the German elements among them, that here assistance is given. Kraeger's lectures will be valued as a welcome preparation for the travelling exhibition of German Art works, that will come to the United States during the winter and that is prepared at present by Mr. Kurtz, the director of the Art Gallery in Buffalo.</p>
