   <p>Mrs. Alma Gluck appeared yesterday after an absence of several years, in a concert at the Auditorium. The artist is acknowledged to be one of the greatest contemporary sopranos and proved again her power of attraction by filling the large hall of the Auditorium, although this is no easy task on such a beautiful fall afternoon.</p>
   <p>Mme. Gluck has become, since her last appearance in this city, the wife of the Russian Violin-virtuoso Zimbalist, which fact fully explains part of her program, being of a Russian character, including among others, compositions by Rachmaninoff and Rimsky-Korsakoff. The rest of the program must be considered quite conservative. Haydn was represented with three Arias from "The Creation", Mozart with "Admonition", Beethoven with a little-known song "The Kiss", also Schubert, Brahms, and Loewe were represented. The latter part was devoted to newer compositions. The audience was carried away by the rendering of Schubert's "The Mail", and Lowe's "Canzonetta".</p>
   <p>Mme. Gluck's voice is distinguished through its sweetness, which makes a great impression upon the listeners, who understand the difference between ordinary and <span class="page-break">2</span>artistic singing. The artist was accompanied in a very delicate manner on the piano, by Samuel Chotzinoff. The violin cello artist, Marie Rosanoff rendered a few numbers, among them "The Fountain" by Davidoff and a Hungarian Rhapsody by Liszt, transcribed by Popper.</p>
