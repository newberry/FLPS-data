   <p>There always has been in this country a strong movement, supported by numerous women organizations and reckless politicians, to give women still more rights and privileges, which gradually would crowd out the lead of men in the political field, industry, and business.</p>
   <p>According to the standpoint of some American women of intellectually high standing, nature built man stronger and larger than women. Therefore, they claim, man should concentrate more on physical work and leave the thinking to the physically weaker women.</p>
   <p>As a fact, this country does not need any particular encouragement, to raise women on a still higher social level. Women were scarce in America at the beginning of colonization and soon became the pets of the first settlements. While the country grew up with the development of agriculture, commerce and industry, the American women went along with increased privileges, which combined as "Feminism" are becoming to-day a danger, not alone to man, but also to the peace and safety of one social life. We believe, that women regardless of rights, belong in the household and kitchen, where they need also a lot of thinking.</p>
