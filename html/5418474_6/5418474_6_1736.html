   <p>Yesterday's presentation of the German Opera Company must have satisfied the most severe critics and must be considered as the climax of this year's musical season. The choice of the opera park was a happy one, because it gave Mrs. Mappenheim an opportunity to reveal not only her talent as a singer but her dramatic abilities as well. Her voice can hardly be surpassed and we believe that the majority of the public considers her to be superior to Lucca.</p>
   <p>Her main triumph was as Leonore, where she was magnificent as a singer and as a dramatic artist as well.</p>
   <p>The attendance was rather small and did not do justice to the artistic representation.</p>
