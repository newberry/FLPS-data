   <p>Last night's performance of "Lohengrin" did not come up to our expectation. With the exception of Miss Meisslinger's "Ortrud," and perhaps Mr. Pringle's impersonation of the king, the performance was far from satisfactory. Miss Meisslinger's conception of the role was excellent; she had the ability to bring out with dramatic fervor the demonic nature of "Ortrud." Emotionally, she was the only convincing member of the cast. Her every gesture was in perfect harmony with the particular situation. In Addition, nature endowed her with a queenly appearance, and thus she dominates the stage whenever her presence is required. She was superb in the scene before the church. It was she who saved last night's presentation of "Lohengrin."</p>

   <p>Mr. Pringle's interpretation of the king was also appreciated.</p>
   <p>The selection of Miss Strakosh for the role of "Elsa" was an unfortunate one, dramatically as well as vocally. Her voice lacked warmth and she over-estimated her artistic powers in the creation of "Elsa"...Ecstasy is an unknown thing to her, although not much artificial persuasion is required for the beautiful aria, "Lied an die Lufte." She is quite incapable of producing a tender note in her voice.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brozel, as "Lohengrin," chilled the audience to the same degree as did Miss Strakosh...Instead of exhibiting deep affection for each other, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the lovers chilled the audience through with their indifference. They acted as two parties who entered into a marriage contract for the sake of convenience, which chilled the audience to the very marrow. That "Telramund," impersonated by Mr. Homer Lind, did not come to his death until rather late in the opera, was regrettable in this instance. He had insufficient vocal training, his voice suffering from inflexibility. Wagner's demands on a singer are heavy; therefore only a highly trained artist should be selected as a character for his compositions.</p>
