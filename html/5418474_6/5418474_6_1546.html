   <p>Miss Marion Waterfall, who has appeared here publicly before, yesterday afternoon gave a concert in the Banner Blue Temple on the South Side, and introduced herself to the large audience. She is a brilliant songstress, a real artist, who possesses a powerful, beautifully sounding voice, which was demonstrated already in her first number, "Venetian Folk Songs".</p>
   <p>She was on the program with fourteen songs, among them Rachmaninoff's "In the Quiet of the Night", one song by Gretschaninow, and three songs by her teacher, Miss Marie E. Dreier. With these last numbers she was most successful, especially with "Chinese Cradle Song", "My Garden" and "Autumn Song". They are three charming compositions, distinguished by originality and melody richness. Mr. Harry Grimes, elocutionist, delighted the audience with some humorous pieces.</p>
