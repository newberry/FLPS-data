   <p>Through the injudiciousness of the Democratic Mayor, and the impertinence of a suddenly reformed saloonkeeper, whose infamous booze joint was properly closed, combined with the Sunday fanatics, Chicago's liberal attitude about the Sunday liquor question becomes an issue again. Be it known that the aforesaid pernicious, hypocritical, "Reformer" succeeded in obtaining the conviction of one of our foremost hotel proprietors. A thirty dollar fine was assessed against the Palmer House, because alcoholic drinks were sold there on Sunday.</p>
   <p>In connection with this, the Democratic corporation counsel makes the following surprising assertion: The opinion that it suffices to draw the shades and to keep the doors of saloons closed on Sundays, is humbug. The law prohibits the sale of intoxicants under any circumstances <span class="page-break">\2</span>on Sunday.</p>
   <p>Obviously, the man knows nothing about our City ordinance as outlined by our caption. It specifically permits tavern owners to sell strong drinks even on the seventh day, provided they refrain from opening doors and do not raise the shades. He is unaware of a precedent. Several years ago in La Salle, a central Illinoisian town, the Dry fanatics wanted to compel the Mayor to shut the beer emporiums on the Sabbath day and the court decided: "The Mayor cannot be forced to accede to such requests."</p>
   <p>It is very essential at present that we call attention to the chronological events involving the Hesing ordinance.</p>
   <p>After the Chicago holocaust, the citizens built an independent, fireproof <span class="page-break">\3</span>platform, allegorically speaking, and the city candidates won by an overwhelming majority. And thus that excellent editor of the Chicago Tribune, became our Mayor. In due time, our prohibition advocates, male and female, stormed his citadel to compel his acquiescence to the State Sunday closing law, and insisted that he apply its dictates to the community.</p>
   <p>After prolonged resistance, the liberally inclined Mayor became panic stricken; the fanatics threatened to prosecute him for malfeasance, because he deliberately ignored the State's mandates. Forthwith, he issued orders to the police. The persecution of recalcitrant saloon keepers commenced, and from small beginnings developed a hair-raising tyranny which showed no respect even for the most honorable citizens; the cudgel and prison ruled.</p>
   <p>And thus, in the summer of 1873, Chicago's Germans, combined with the non-Teutonic element, who resented such autocratic libertinage, followed the <span class="page-break">\4</span>banner of that active, talented organizer, Anton Caspar Hesing.</p>
   <p>In those years, the city, county, and other elections were held in November, all of them simultaneously. It was on Tuesday in November 1873, when the People's Party, a special political creation for this contingency, unfurled its banner in behalf of Sunday liberty. The Law and Order Organization upholding and featuring tyrannical, coercive statutes, was the opponent at the voting booths, but the proponents of freedom obtained a tremendous plurality.</p>
   <p>The new, broad minded city council thus enacted the ordinance which permits serving of spiritous drinks on the Day of Rest, if the saloon's curtains are lowered and the doors are closed. Usage, the vernaculism of the people which molds the language, associated this law with the <span class="page-break">\5</span>mighty leader, who instigated it, and thus it was given the appellation: "The Hesing Ordinance." And henceforth, all city administrations, Democratic, as well as Republican, zealously obeyed its paragraphs.</p>
   <p>The first Republican Mayor after its momentuous passage, Monroe Heath, solemnly promised to conduct his official acts in conformance with the Hesing ordinance, and courageously fulfilled his pledge, although the Drys, during the strike activities of 1877, vociferously demanded the closing of taverns on Sunday.</p>
   <p>Similarly, and with stinging sarcasm, Mayor Carter H. Harrison Sr., rejected the demands of the Prohibitionists and their female adherents to whom he quoted the law. The other Mayors also followed the spirit <span class="page-break">\6</span>of the Hesing ordinance.</p>
   <p>In the year 1891, the Drys made an attempt during the City elections in April to promote the candidacy of Elmer Washburn, the former police chief under the Medill administration, who enforced the dictatorial edicts of the Dry element, and thereby they suffered a calamitious debacle, whereas the liberal minded Republican,Hempstead Washburne, was elected. The remainder of the votes were given to the equally liberal, but dissenting Democrats Cregier, and C. H. Harrison, Sr.</p>
   <p>Fury and agitation continued in the prohibition camp, but their efforts were devoid of any success until the aforesaid man from the padlocked cabaret came to their rescue.</p>
