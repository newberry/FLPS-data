   <p>To the Editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>The terrible tobacco smoke which filled the Turner Hall from A to Z, was sufficient to so permeate our clothes that even today they still smell. Such a smoke drives any lady and any gentleman away from the concert. Is it not possible for the Germans to abstain a few hours from smoking for the sake of the ladies? No wonder so few ladies attend these concerts.</p>
   <p>The German public does not only want good music but also a decent recreation place - a recreation place where one listens to good music more on famille than en canaille, where one gladly brings one's wife and daughter. As the concerts,are conducted now, they certainly will not last.</p>
