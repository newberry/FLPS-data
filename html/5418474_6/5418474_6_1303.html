   <p>The Wirthsverein (Tavernkeeper's Association) held its regular meeting yesterday afternoon at the North Side Turnhalle, Mr. Feldkamp presiding. After the reading of the minutes....and the induction of new members, the report of the Committee on Legal Problems was submitted. It appears that the negotiations in Springfield are progressing favorably.</p>
   <p>An important question at issue is the license fee for pool tables. Shall the saloonkeepers pay the present tax before the new bill on pool tables, now before the City Council, becomes an ordinance? After a rather long debate, it was decided to send a committee to the incumbent as well as the next mayor, requesting that collection of the fee be deferred until the matter is settled by the Council.</p>
   <p>In regard to the security bonds which the Association officials must post, the trustees were requested to prepare the papers and have them ready at the next meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. Baum gave an accounting of funds collected for the Springfield negotiations; he reported that he still has $127.50 with which to pay bills.</p>
   <p>A lively debate ensued on the regulation of beer barrel measures, a matter brought to the fore even before the election but not acted upon at the time. It was explained that the administration protects itself by discarding all barrels which are over size. However, no attention is paid to the small barrels, although the officials are very observant and see to it that the tavernkeeper's quart measure is properly stamped. Since whisky, oil, and other fluid measures are definitely regulated, why not also the small beer barrels, which should have a capacity exactly one quarter that of a large barrel?</p>
   <p>Attorney Rubens remarked it would be preferable to ask the corporation counsel for an opinion, since the question is being asked in various quarters whether a small beer barrel is a measure or a container.</p>
   
   <p>A motion by Peter Mueller that a committee be sent to the next brewers' convention to ascertain to what extent the brewers are willing to comply with the just demands of the tavernkeepers was rejected. But the following resolution was passed: The Committee on Legal Problems should confer with the attorney and the latter should then see the City Council in an effort to secure a revision of the procedure in inspecting small barrels, either through the appointment of a special official, or by authorizing the oil inspector to act in the matter. After settling this matter, Adolph Mueller's resignation was read and accepted.</p>
   <p>The financial secretary complained that, regardless of his continued efforts, the bill for his revision of the books has not yet been ordered paid. His request was referred to the Finance Committee. After accepting and authorizing payment of several small bills, the meeting adjourned.</p>
