   <p>Among the large stores which brought to Milwaukee Avenue an unexpected prosperity, we must mention the W. A. Wieboldt firm's Department store. It is the largest store outside of State Street and represents an investment of one and a half million dollars. It unprecedented success is most noteworthy, when one considers the rapid stride of the organization... Mr. Wieboldt opened a dry goods store in a one story building at 942 N. Milwaukee Avenue, this was his beginning in 1883. The street was not paved at that time and the sidewalks were in a deplorable condition. Mr. Wieboldt formed a partnership with Mr. Carl Hansen and the store continued across the street, where it was known as the "Lion Store," a title which was copied by several small competitors. In 1897 the large well known store was destroyed by a fire. Within six months a larger and more dignified structure super-seded it, covering an area of 100 X 120 feet, four floors; it reached from Milwaukee to Bauwaus Street and its construction costs were $150,000.00.</p>

   <p>A few weeks ago, an addition was built which required an investment of $100,000.00...Its present extent is 250 x 300 feet...Modern improvements such as elevators, electric light, refrigeration for meats, etc. have all been provided. The secret of this astonishing development from an unpretentious dry goods store to one of the largest in the city is attributable to the policy of its experienced owners, who took cognizance of the different needs of the various nationalities who lives on the Northwest side, by giving the lowest prices and treating customers with exceptional courtesy.</p>
   <p>To realize this and to enable the sales-personel to converse readily with such a large foreign element, they hired employees who could speak Norwegian, Swedish, Bohemian, Danish and above all German and especially the latter, since this contingent contains their greatest number of customers.</p>
