   <p>Many readers will be interested to learn that our young Chicago composer Gustav Grube, who went to Germany to continue there his study of music, has been successful in Berlin. Most of his compositions were finally accepted by a music publisher, and some of his symphony-compositions are played at present by the Concert-house-Orchestra under its leader, Mr. Meyder. We are rejoicing with Mr. Grube for his remarkable success, and hope he always will remember his old hometown, Chicago.</p>
