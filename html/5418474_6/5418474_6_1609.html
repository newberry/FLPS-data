   <p>A highly talented artist, died yesterday at his home here. He was born September 29th,1830 at Naugard in Pommern. He became a lithographer, and immigrated to America in 1866 coming directly to Chicago which he called his second home. Hardly any time elapsed before he established one of the largest lithographic firms of its type in the West under the name of Ruehlow and Essroger. The great Chicago fire left him almost penniless but his spirit rose again and in a comparatively short time he rebuilt his business on a much larger scale, from which he retired ten years ago to devote his time to his favored occupation, painting. Among his collection of paintings there are several of Lincoln Park. One of his works is of more than usual interest, for it represents the christening of the present German Kaiser, in which Bismarck and Moltke are also visible. The copy of this painting, made by the artist himself, was brought to Chicago, but was destroyed during the great conflagration. The original is in the possession of the royal family.</p>
