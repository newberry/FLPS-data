   <p>Again an attempt is being made--this time by the city authorities--to abolish the loathsome and expensive division of Chicago into three towns. There is probably no other city which is in this ludicrous position, a clover leaf of village rulership within a city administration; with separate officials and individual charters. How often has London's division, due to its medieval character, been ridiculed: It is the greatest city on earth, yet it is only a loosely woven alliance of independent city and village communities interspersed with parishes, so that urban unity is represented only by a few administrative bodies appointed by the government. Chicago, on a smaller scale, gives us a counterpart, a patchwork of three independent towns not unlike the accumulating additions to century-old castles, where succeeding generations showed their handiwork. The medievalistic creations having no value, nor purpose, serve only as historical evidence--tradition. Aside from that the plan of this city is fraught with countless inconveniences.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>One might believe that the outmoded town constitution of Chicago could be abolished readily, effortlessly. Indeed not! There is the opposition: First, there is that army of ambitious political climbers who see in a successful town election the first rung in the ladder of future achievements in statecraft; then, there are the independent councils, nurtured under town government, who protest out of self-interest; and, finally, there is that great multitude of "honest Taxpayers" who think that the township officials whom they know as neighbors, relatives, friends, and as candidates for re-election, will give them lower assessments on taxable possessions. To them it would be cheaper to preserve the status quo than to rely on a sensibly created city administration which would encompass all the separate localities. The opposition created by these various motives proved insurmountable when attempts were made to eliminate these antiquated political divisions. Whether this reform can be achieved now is problematical.</p>
   <p>The enmity of those groups which profit by the present disorder, or which hope to derive some monetary gain therefrom, is not the sole obstacle in the way of <span class="page-break">3</span>the proposed innovation. A more formidable hurdle is probably presented by the crazy tax system of the State, which provides that tax rates for the city shall depend upon the lesser units in the State's structure, namely, the so-called towns. As the State needs but little capital--which can readily be raised from a small tax based upon an exceedingly low valuation of taxable property--there develops among the town and county assessors a strong rivalry in promoting low valuations.</p>
   <p>All the unlimited injustices resulting from such competitive efforts toward tax reductions were to be corrected, supposedly; by the Board of Equalization, a State department; but prolonged and sad experience throughout the years has demonstrated that--quite contrary to intentions--the Board has encouraged rather than alleviated the evil. The agricultural areas of the counties have benefited from this "equalization" at the expense of the populous cities, which have been burdened with disproportionate, unjust tax rates. Thus, it becomes quite understandable that the cities, confronted with the problem of self-defense, are only too willing to close an eye whenever town officials resort to deliberate <span class="page-break">4</span>undervaluation. An orderly, sensible, and approximately just property valuation by a combined city administration (in conformity to precedents in our city) would net much more for the State than the methods used by the town officials. However, if taxes were raised in this manner, Chicago would be in a worse predicament than before, which is not pleasant to contemplate.</p>
   <p>Consequently, injustice and stupidity work in each other's behalf, and reinforce each other. A clean slate can be obtained only by the abolition of direct State taxes, as we stated before in these columns. This would also eliminate the assessments by State departments, which are nothing but one great swindle, a fraud hatched up by the State and the State departments. By the elimination of the [direct] State tax the cities would be enabled to base their tax system on rational, healthy principles, and the controversy over the continuance of our crazy trinity [the division of Chicago into three towns] would be groundless.</p>
   <p>The abolition of the direct State tax would also enable us to come to some under-standing in regard to city and county distinctions. The present relationship is <span class="page-break">5</span>not only ludicrous but is the source of far-reaching foolishness and wickedness.</p>
   <p>No better proof of this can be cited than the present County and City Hall Building, that twin structure now in process of erection. Kraewinkel, which indulged in similar idiotic manifestations, has for centuries been regarded as a synonym for bureaucratic ignorance.</p>
   <p>Just consider the fact that Chicago's population and taxpayers represent five sixths of Cook County. The five sixths of the County's population build one half of the building with bluish-grey sandstone, which, after prolonged, damp weather will acquire the tint of a Slovalsian mouse trap peddler's felt trousers after he has worn them twenty years, while the six sixths of the citizens [entire County] build the other half of the structure with a yellowish-white limestone, to which time will impart the hue of a half-seasoned meerschaum pipe. Even after a century--if no conflagration destroys the building--it will remain as a monument to local stupidity; a mute witness testifying to future generations about the antiquated, complicated order of our [present] local government.</p>
   <span class="page-break">6</span>
   <p>To eliminate the wretched arguments between the County and Chicago, in other words, between the five sixths and the six sixths, we have but one solution: The separation of Chicago into a special county so that the city administration is also the county administration (in so far as the State is concerned). It was done in New York [City], likewise in St. Louis; sooner or later Chicago must follow.</p>
   <p>If necessary, parts of the towns of Lake View, Jefferson, Lake, and Hyde Park, which are already closely connected with the city by parks and are virtually suburbs, could be incorporated into the new county, just as New York acquired several towns of Westchester County. Chicago's area would then be considerably larger than the principality of Liechtenstein and at least ten times as large as the principality of Monaco. In so far as our inhabitants are concerned, Chicago would be twice as populous as the Duchy of Brunswick.</p>
   <p>Instead of being a three-village town in constant turmoil with the State and the County, it would acquire its rightful heritage and title, to which its commerce, its transportation, and its social status entitle it--a cosmopolitan city.</p>
