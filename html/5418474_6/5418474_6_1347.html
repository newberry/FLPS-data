   <p>As there still appear to be some people who believe that the Chicago Mining and Milling Company is a California corporation, regardless of statements to the contrary, we append the following explanation:</p>
   <p>Mr. [A. C.] Hesing originally intended to incorporate the company in California and steps were taken toward this end.</p>
   <p>Consultation with Chicago friends, however, induced Mr. Hesing to give up the plan, but in the meantime, permission had been granted to incorporate [the company] in California and newspapers reported it.</p>
   <p>The company, however, was never incorporated in California and instead the Chicago Mining and Milling Company was incorporated under the laws of Illinois on December 30, 1878. All the directors and stockholders live in Chicago or within its immediate vicinity. [Translator's note: In an earlier article, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>January 2, 1879, Illinois Staats-Zeitung, this statement appears: "Carl Soyer, who is a resident of that district [Arizona] and had studied metallurgy in Germany, gave Mr. Hesing two thousand dollars as an investment in the new enterprise."]</p>
   <p>Incidentally, the sale of bonds proceeds very satisfactorily and the organization's future appears to be assured.</p>
