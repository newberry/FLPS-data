   <p>Henry Greenbaum, chief of the well-known German bank, arrived yesterday from New York, and has immediately started the organization of a bank on the West Side. The firm hopes in a few days to be in full activity.</p>
   <p>The rumor that the sisters Lammlein, whose piano playing has been praised by the Illinois Staats Zeitung, had come to harm in the fire has fortunately proved to be unfounded. They escaped (losing all their jewelry and furnishings) out of their burning apartment in Ontario Street and fled into that part of the 12th Ward that was formerly known as Holstein. At present they are the guests of Mr. H. Greenbaum, at Hubbard and Wood Street.</p>
