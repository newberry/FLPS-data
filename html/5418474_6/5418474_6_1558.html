   <p>A not too large and artistically minded public was present, yesterday evening, at the Lincoln "Furnhalle" for the concert of Miss Elsie Luetcke. Miss Luetcke possesses not only a voice as clear as a bell and capable of modulation, but she also is a well trained pianist. Her performances yesterday received great applause. Of the song numbers we want to mention the aria from "Tannhauser" and the aria from "Cavalleria Rusticana", because they furnished the best proof of the strength of her vocal organs, and the artistic feeling. The fifteen year old cellist, W. C. Williams, surprised through his perfect execution, and was allowed to play some encores, for which he, as well as Miss Luetke, received great applause. The youthful dancer, Miss Harriet Haile, as also well received.</p>
