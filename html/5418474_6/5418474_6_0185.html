   <p>Criticism of the Chicago Times which declared that although the Depression is not as serious as the panic of 1873, we find ourselves in the midst of an industrial and commercial crisis. The Times attributed the depression to overproduction and speculation. The solution for the workingmen according to the latter lay in a return to the soil instead of remaining in the cities. The Arbeiter Zeitung is Sarcastic.</p>
   <p>"An excellant solution! The industrial workingmen will leave the production of their many years of labor to the big capitalist! Let the workingmen go as tramps and let themselves be exploited by the great landlords and only in this way can the economic system be righted."</p>
