   <p>We can almost believe that the white murderers in the South and Hayes are combined in one band to explain to the public in the North very clearly and distinctly how different General Grant was from the watersoup, Hayes: Under Grant's government, those infamous scoundrels never would have dared, to kick him in the face, as is done now by the Administration and tribunal authorities of South Carolina and also, by the red-shirted murder bands in Louisiana. He would have found the courage to keep those fellows down and bring them to reason, even if he had to call out an army of volunteers for that purpose!</p>
   <p>But under Hayes, we compalin to heaven! There they whine, speaking with kindness, praying and begging, but not striking, when striking should be a sacred official duty. The result naturally cannot be anything else, but more insolence from our Southerners... The union decreed laws, which guaranteed to every citizen of the United States in every single state, the right of free assembly and of voting. These laws are disregarded by the former slave-squired with a sneering laugh, and President Hayes is very sorry, but does not seem to be disturbed in his comfortable negligence! We cannot be surprised therefore if everyone, who will not throw away the gain of the bloody four years' Civil War, deeply from his chest utters a groan:</p>
