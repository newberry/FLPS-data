   <p>The Referendum, originating in Switserland, is brought again by certain newspapers to the attention of the public. As we all know, a Referendum is the people's last decision, put directly into the voter's hands, in regard to a law, regulation or any important matter, which the legislature refused to pass and preferring to.let the people have the last word about it.</p>
   <p>We have published our opinion about the Referendum years ago and still to-day believe that the American voters in general are not ripe for the Referendum. We will change our standpoint only, if we see, that the American public, with at least 90% of all voters, is taking a more active part in politics, to safeguard the selection of honest men for leading parts in public offices. As long as more than half of the voters are staying away from the polls, particularly at the primaries, the referendum would not represent the people's will, but the onesided decision of local politicians with their voting machinery.</p>
