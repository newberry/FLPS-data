   <p>The important firm of the Bros. Schonfeldt declared itself yesterday insolvent. This will be much of a surprise to the northsiders as they have witnessed just a few weeks ago the opening of this exquisite store which moved from its old location on Indiana Street to its beautiful new place in Brand's Hall. The firm was supposed to be in financial difficulties ever since the big fire. Messrs. Jacob and Benjamin S. Schonfeldt are the victims of that great tragedy. With a capital of only $5,000 they began anew, and with a good credit extended to them, they transacted a business of about $300,000 to $400,000 annually.</p>
