   <p>Twenty five years have passed since that day on which a number of musicians , here in Chicago, made the first attempt, to arrange concerts on Sunday afternoons during the winter months, and to arouse the interest of the public in them. Whenever an enterprise, calculated to benefit the German population of the city, needed support and practical assistance, the "Turngemeinde" never failed to demonstrate its intense zeal. Those twelve musicians under the direction of Christoph Romanus, pioneers in the field of Sunday concerts, recognized the "Turners" as willing and loyal allies.</p>
   <p>The members of the orchestra, the musical educators of audiences listening to their performances, nearly despaired on different occasions, of these listeners because of their indifference towards the concerts. Justifiable doubts arose in the minds of the musicians as to whether or not the influence of musical creations of the great masters was sufficiently effective upon the visitors to these public concerts to guarantee their continuity.</p>
   <p>Whoever has attended the concerts of the "Turnhalle" during recent years, and observed the steadily increasing interest towards the artistic value and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>superb achievements of the orchestra, is made aware of the part that the instigators of these well liked Sunday performances have achieved their aim, in spite of many obstacles and difficulties, and they have a just claim on the gratitude of friends of music.</p>
   <p>The unselfish musician, however, who assisted in the noble cause of educating concert audiences to a better understanding of music, will find his supreme reward in being aware that he has rendered his fellow beings a great favor, and that he contributed his share to the refining of their musical appreciation.</p>
   <p>The following is a brief outline of the Sunday concerts during the last twenty five years.</p>
   <p>After the band of the First Hecker regiment, the "Great Western Band", returned from the war in 1863, the "Turnhalle" on North Clark Street was dedicated on New Year's night of 1863, the mentioned band participating. On January 27, 1864, the first Sunday concert took place at the North Side "Turnhalle" under <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the bandmaster Christoph Romanus. The orchestra was composed of twelve men and the tickets were ten cents each.</p>
   <p>The beginning was very promising. On one of the first Sundays 2,000 tickets were sold. The "Turngemeinde" put forth great efforts. Out of its midst cashiers, waiters, and bartenders were engaged, who rendered their services free of charge.</p>
   <p>During the first few years while the performances were still inferior, and the English and Irish Americans who mingled with the concert audiences had not yet learned from the Germans how to behave in concert halls, disturbances were by no means rare. The appointed committee for order succeeded, however, in putting reason and respect into the noisy dullards. Later, as the performances of the orchestra reached a higher level, and as a better understanding of good music gradually developed in the public, greater devotion and attention. resulted.</p>
   <p>The last Sunday concert in the old hall took place on October 8, 1871. The devastating fire already had started and a part of the audience left before <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the close to see the ever increasing conflagration, suspecting, of course, no such great calamity.</p>
   <p>After the fire the Sunday concerts came into their own again in January, 1873.</p>
   <p>They were again held under the auspices of the "Turngemeinde", and, the orchestra, consisting of thirty men, was directed by F. Hoffmann. The larger the audiences grew, the more efforts were made to carefully select compositions, and give better performances by the orchestra.</p>
   <p>H. Balatka became the director of music after the resignation of F. Hoffmann. Perhaps due to Balatka's too great preference for classical symphonies, etc., the concerts were not as successful financially as was desired.</p>
   <p>During the next season J. Clauder directed the orchestra, and the interest of the public increased, again, in the concerts. Even greater success was achieved during 1876 and 1878 under the leadership of Mr. Loesch.</p>
   <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>
   <p>In 1879 Professor A. Rosenbecker conducted the concerts. He understood how to meet the different tastes of music lovers and was able to put the undertaking upon a safe and solid basis.</p>
