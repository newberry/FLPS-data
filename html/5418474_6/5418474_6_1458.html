   <p>Last Tuesday the toy, novelty, and fancy goods business of J. D. Weber, 184 Lake Street, was sold to C. Schweizer and Company. For years, this great enterprise has been favorably known to the public of Chicago and also to the farm population of Cook and Du Page counties, since the firm always has carried a large and varied stock of goods, has given its customers ideal service, and has sold its goods at very reasonable prices.</p>
   <p>The new owners have known the business for many years. Mr. Schweizer is an old employe of Weber's and has had extensive experience under other proprietors of similar stores; he is thus well qualified to carry on the business.</p>
   <p>The new proprietors will continue both branches, the wholesale as well as the retail, and one of the partners will soon make a trip to Europe to purchase the <span class="page-break">\2</span>most modern goods available on the market there.</p>
   <p>The firm is located at 184 Lake Street in a three-story building, where it displays a greater variety of merchandise than any other Chicago store dealing in the same line of merchandise.</p>
