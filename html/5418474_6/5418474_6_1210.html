   <p>The Chicago "Wirtsverein" (Association of Tavernkeepers) held a meeting yesterday afternoon at Jung's Hall, 106 Randolph Street. The problem of the day was the license question. The members, Peter Dalp, Philip Dieter, John Bauser, and Joseph Michle, were instructed to work out a petition, which would request the City Council to abolish the beer license of $150, and the additional liquor license of $500, and legalize instead a uniform license of a total amount of $500, to comprise the sale of beer and liquor combined.</p>
   <p>This petition will be submitted to the City Council as soon as possible by the attorney of the Wirtsverein.</p>
