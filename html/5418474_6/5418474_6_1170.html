   <p>In the presence of many guests and friends, the new "Deutsches Restaurant" under Kinsley's management was opened last night. The really elegant dining rooms show in architecture and decoration particular German characteristics.</p>
   <p>Even the oldtime German proverbs on the walls are not missing. The wooden cross-beam ceiling, the heavy-set bar with carved coats of arms and big colorful earthenware steins remind you of the old-time Beer-Halls. The business manager of this remarkable establishment is Mr. Ernest Kitz, assisted by Mr. Henry Menke.</p>
