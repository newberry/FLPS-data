   <p>An editorial under the caption "German-American churches and private schools," appeared in the issue of the 19th of this month in your paper. Its chief purpose was the criticism of two liberal gentlemen from Chicago, who, according to a report from Springfield, were opposed to free distribution of textbooks in our public schools. However, the accusation is so erroneous that I, as one of the liberal-minded gentlemen under attack, feel prompted to make a reply. The real facts are: Several improvement bills of our public schools were introduced in the Legislature when it convened. Among others was one designed to permit the School Committee's free distribution of text-books among pupils. The Turner District of Chicago, in conjunction with the Alliance of German Societies, and the Federation of Labor, regarded such legislation highly desirable, since similar laws have <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>been in effect in twenty-four states of the Union. This system has been in force in all big cities in the Eastern States, and has been submitted for serious consideration here. However, this happened long before an opposition to this plan developed. I, as chairman of the Alliance of German Associations, which represent two hundred societies, was commissioned to go to Springfield, and in conjunction with the representatives of the Chicago Turner District and the Federation of Labor, agitated in favor of the bill. Appearing before the school board, I restricted my arguments to the expediency of such law, as well as the right of the State to employ any suitable means by which an improvement in the public school system could be effected. Furthermore, my argument was, that these measures must be adopted for the sake of progress in our educational system, regardless of the stand of independent societies. Since this opposition is based primarily upon the argument that improvements of this type would be unfair to a great number of citizens whose conscience dictates them to send their children to parochial schools, I have raised my voice in defense <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of the State, which in my opinion must not consider the opposition's protests, since stagnation in the educational progress of our youngsters must not be tolerated. I also maintain, that the harmonious collaboration of our cosmopolitan public, is largely in response to our public school system. Mr. Leopold Saltiel, who represented the Turner Districts of Chicago, shared my ideas in this question. Then too, two liberally minded gentlemen were accused in the same editorial of having made insinuations against Catholics and Lutherans as well. This statement lacks any foundation whatever. The fact is that Mr. Saltiel and myself emphatically stressed the assistance extended to them by liberal societies, when the attempt had been made, contrary to existing laws, to introduce in parochial schools certain regulatory measures. I also advised that members of the societies thus attacked, have always defended the right of parents in regard to educational matters of their children. It was indeed not our intention to evoke a struggle for civilization, moreover, pure and noble motives only dictated our stand. It is our belief that free distribution of textbooks by the board of education would prove a blessing to the laborers, who as statistics show, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>have the largest families. It would also help the small taxpayer, blessed with many children, get some compensation for the taxes he pays. I will go still further and say, that if the public was invited to decide upon this affair, private schools would be included in the supply of free textbooks. Straining the relationship between open-minded Germans and parochial communities, is indeed remote from our thoughts. Thus is explained why the origin of this spiteful attack is cloaked by shadows not yet lifted. Why not appear unmasked? As a resident of Chicago for the last thirty years, I have been in constant touch with German people and German clubs, and whoever knows me, knows also of my deep-rooted interest in Germanism and its customs. My ideas have never been nativistic; moreover, I assure you, I never will be. Neither did Mr. Saltiel make any statement which would warrant nativistic inclinations. As I am of the opinion that many Germans would get a false impression of us, through the article referred to in your paper, I chose thus to clarify the affair.</p>

   <p>Publisher's remark.</p>
   <p>In connection with the article in question, it has been made clear that if the two liberal minded gentlemen made the statements of which they were accused, the criticism would fit the crime. The report from Springfield came to us via the America, a newspaper issued in St. Louis, which enjoys the distinction and the reputation of discretion and moderation. Our part was merely to protect these institutions against the alleged unjust attacks. However, it pleases us beyond expression, that the supposed attacks were groundless, according to Mr. Ingenthron.</p>
