   <p>Secretary of the Treasury Sherman converted the National debt from six percent bonds into a four percent issue, which has proved an exceedingly successful accomplishment--perhaps even too successful. Now we have the "common folk" who have lost all confidence in banks, and the rich snobs who are too cowardly and selfish to invest their money in commercial enterprises which would benefit the people, confidently spending their money to acquire four percent Government bonds. It is expected that by the end of January subscriptions will have been taken for one hundred million dollars worth of the four percent United States bonds. If the six percent issue is thus completely converted into four percent bonds, it will represent an annual interest reduction of two million dollars, a success which might easily make any finance minister conceited.</p>
   <p>But what of the source of this one hundred million dollars and what of its consequence? This wealth is derived from our own country, but a large portion, if not the entire amount, migrates to foreign shores, since the withdrawn six percent bonds which are to be redeemed with the proceeds of the four percent bonds are mostly owned by Europeans. According to the lowest estimate involving the six percent United States bonds of 1867, there are forty million [dollars] in Europe, while the highest estimate doubles this figure. The Europeans will not be inclined to accept the four percent bonds in lieu of the redeemed bonds and will demand payment in gold.</p>
   <p>Thus we would have no alternative but to send quantities of gold abroad. The precious metal would be supplied from the hoard which Mr. Sherman has so laboriously collected to support and equalize our paper money with bullion.</p>
   <p>But what will happen when our gold pile decreases to such an extent that it fails to represent sufficient security for the paper money?</p>
   <p>At present we experience no particular demand for the yellow metal; everyone believes that he can exchange paper money for coin at any time, but insistence upon gold would manifest itself instantly if doubt of the Treasury's ability to redeem paper should arise. Our anxiety to convert our six percent bonds into a four percent issue might easily bring about such a crisis; such a predicament would result from a hurried withdrawal of American gold by Europeans.</p>
   <p>It is apparent that Mr. Sherman should heed the proverb: Haste makes waste.</p>
   <p>Commerce between the United States and Europe has been favorable to this country for many years. The United States export is much greater than its import, and the surplus accruing there from did yeoman's work in paying old debts.</p>
   <p>But one must not expect too much of this surplus. After all, it is not so large that all of the six percent Government bonds which are in Europe can be redeemed, and the saving of interest obtained through the debt conversion does not represent such a great profit that it can fully compensate for the damage done when we are again confronted with a sudden exportation of gold.</p>
   <p>To repay obligations is commendable, but even good deeds can be overdone-- or as a sarcastic philosopher once said: "Overzealous virtue is vice!"</p>
   <p>By going slowly we may also attain the same goal--and with much greater security.</p>
