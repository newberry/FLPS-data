   <p>At the examination for German women teachers for the public schools which took place yesterday, were only nine women. Three of them did not understand one word of English, and two others were deficient in other regards. Only two seemed to be qualified. This is a sad situation and the German committee of the School Board is facing once more a lack of women teachers of the German language.</p>
