   <p>An event has taken place recently which is of great importance for the development of the German language here in Chicago, namely the enlargement of a German bookstore.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. Enderis, known for several years to our teachers as a German book dealer, has enlarged his store at 130 Lake Street to almost twice its former size. A visit to the friendly store proves that not only enlargement of room but of business as well has taken place. Mr. Enderis deserves credit for having built up a store which satisfies the most exacting bibliophile. Mr. Enderis has a contract with New York importers which enables him to receive the latest books. It is unnecessary to mention that he has also a great number of periodicals on hand. One must not underestimate the difficulties with which a German book dealer has to contend here. He must not only buy everything he receives from Europe, but he must also pay import taxes. He does not receive commissions as do the other book dealers in Europe.</p>

   <p>It is to be noticed that the guiding principle of Mr. Enderis was to make of his store not only a business but also an entertainment place for his visitors. There can be no greater entertainment for friends of literature of all nations than to browse through this rich collection of books.</p>
   <p>As is well-known, Mr. Enderis is also consul for Switzerland. He may well be proud of his store, which started from such small beginnings 18 years ago.</p>
