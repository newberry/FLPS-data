Born in Germany, he came to Chicago in 1871 where he was given employment as a baker, in which trade he was considered an expert. In later years he conducted the Olympia Hotel, 615 N. Wells Street, which was a meeting place of Germans of the lower North Side.</p>
   <p>One son, Melchior, and a daughter, Mrs. Mary Schafer, survive him. In addition to the Turgemeinde, the deceased belonged to a number of German societies.</p>
