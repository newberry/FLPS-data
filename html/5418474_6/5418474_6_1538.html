   <p>A whole chapter in the history of music might be devoted to the history of discovery of the great tenors. From Pamagno to Caruso, from Maurel to Jean de Reszke, extremely interesting stories could be told, which would sound fictitious. And if German tenors are concerned in the matter, who, in comparison with the golden throared Italians, are almost as scarce as white ravens, this story should therefore be so much more interesting.</p>
   <p>Whatever we read of Vogl, of Wachtl, Alvary and Burgstaller is as much an inalienable part of the history of music, as Spohr, Schumann and Bruckner. Yesterday, we had an opportunity to become acquainted with a voice, which, with its delightful beauty and great volume, can be well compared with the best. It had been heard here before, three years ago, when Albert Seibert with the other singers of the wonderful Kromer Troup, caused a great sensation, especially in German circles. But nevertheless, his voice has not been discovered yet, otherwise, the world at large would have taken notice of yesterday's performance.</p>
   <p>Albert Seibert possesses a voice the equal of which is seldom heard. It probably does not possess that soft charm which dazzles at the beginning, but with which one is easily bored because it is felt to be too soft and feminine, an error of most of the tenors. No, here is a full, manly organ with a soft baritone timbre, which powerfully climbs to its height; it is a through-and-through dramatic voice, a genuine heroic tenor and yet also in the lyric parts, full of deep feeling.</p>
   <p>At yesterday's performance, Seibert appeared mostly as ballad-singer in Schubert, Brahms and Strauss, three epochs of German songs, which he handles in an excellent manner. It was a four-sided Schubert to whom we listened-the plain and hearty in the "Love Message", the deep dejected of the "Winter Journey" in "Spring Dream", the yearning and stormy in "Pining in Spring", and finally, the dramatic in "The Double". The last named, as interpreted by the singer had a deep effect, proving what the only-too-soon-deceased maestro would have given the world, if fate had bestowed upon him a longer life.</p>
   <p>In all these songs, wonderful diction was displayed, making every word distinct, so that we could get intoxicated by the glorious German mother tongue, for which we are probably envied in our songs by the English and French.</p>
   
   <p>Only the Italian language, which is also rich in vocals, can compare with ours. Because of this superiority of the German songs, it was obvious why the English offerings, although just as beautifully sung, did not have the same effect. However, the artist was in his true element, in the two opera excerpts, the one from "Giaconda", and the great scene from the "Freischutz". The latter presented the resignation ("Through the woods, through the meadows") and despair ("Dark powers are pursuing me") of Max, in a charming manner.</p>
   <p>The final chapter is less pleasant. Two weeks ago when Paderewski played at the auditorium, his fellow countrymen of Chicago welcomed him with drums and trumpets, and filled the enormous concert auditorium to its capacity. Of the 600,000 Germans of Chicago, 599,950 did not appear yesterday, some probably attended the football game, and, including writer, there were only the proverbial seven Swabians, who greeted their countryman, although the concert had been well advertised.</p>
   <p>It is a path of thorns, which German artists must walk on account of the indifference of their countrymen. Most of them become famous only after their death. The disgraceful "Lohengrin" performance, which the Civic Opera offered the German people last winter, is still remembered. With a Seibert as "Lohengrin", the same would have been brilliant, even if the others had failed.</p>
   <p>Here is an opportunity and a duty of honor as well, for the German people of Chicago.</p>
