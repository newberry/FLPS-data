   <p>The family evening of the German Press Society in the Germania club house, joined the previous arrangements of the society in a worthy way. The entertainment committee again selected a choice program, which was carried out in a gay manner and found great approval with the large number of guests.</p>
   <p>The evening was ushered in buoyantly with the overture to the opera, "Mignon," by Dr. Christian Balatka, and one of his pupils Miss Fritzi Siebach, which they performed in a perfect manner. Dr. Balatka played later the phantasy from "Rigoletto," and the Schubert Serenade. Miss Siebach, who is a great credit to her teacher, not only undertook in a cheerful manner to accompany the two singers of the evening, but also performed several solos, which found well deserved and lively applause.</p>
   <p>Miss Irena Georgienskaja, formerly of the court opera in St. Petersburg, and Miss Irma Ferenczy, another favorite of the music loving public, and well known soprano singer, delighted the listeners by the excellent performance of a number of songs.</p>
   
   <p>A welcome variety in the program were the recitals of Mr. Jose Danner of the local German Theatre. Partly of a serious, but predominantly of a humorous nature, they contributed a great deal to the success of the evening.</p>
   <p>The president of the society, Mr. Karl Freitag, welcomed the guests, and expressed his satisfaction that they were present in such large numbers. Mr. Leopold Saltiel, acquitted himself of his official position as president of the amusement committee, in a spirited manner.</p>
