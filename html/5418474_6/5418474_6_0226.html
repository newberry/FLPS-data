   <p>Mayor Harrison has made up his mind to boost Chicago's real estate values--a good beginning--and he wants to attain the goal by economizing, which is also a laudable procedure.</p>
   <p>But economy has its limitations. The man, for instance, who does not have the roof of his house repaired because he wants to save money, and later finds it necessary to call a plasterer to patch the ceiling because the rain has damaged it, must realize that such economy is expensive as well as foolish. This would be on a par with the mayor's scheme whereby he saves expense in the fire department and, by so doing, causes the insurance companies to raise their rates.</p>
   <p>The mayor is mistaken if he believes that lowering of taxes is all that is necessary to increase property values. That might be an inducement for capitalists to invest money on a speculative basis, but one cannot see how the city will benefit in general, or property owners in particular; in that case, money would be diverted from those who cannot hold onto it, and would be hoarded by persons whose financial status enables them to keep their funds in idleness.</p>
   <p>Chicago's land values can reach a permanently higher level only if the population of the city is proportionate to the area. Chicago is large enough for twice the population we now have, and such an increase can be obtained only if the industrial interests are given consideration. High insurance rates, however, are a millstone around the neck of industry; they hinder its progress, and eventually will cause our factories to be moved elsewhere.</p>
   <p>Perhaps Harrison will realize the situation; if not, then he must learn by experience--and that will not benefit him in this instance.</p>
