   <p>Washington, D. C. - The report made by bank-examiner Washburn of Chicago, giving the results of his examination of the German National Bank of that city, which reached the comptroller of the currency the middle of last May, is now accessible, and is in substance as follows:</p>
   <p>The report covers the time from Dec, 6, 1877, when the bank suspended, to Dec. 24, 1878, when the receiver took charge. All the assets have either been traced into the hands of the receiver, or the journal entries have been found, which showed where they were charged to profit and loss, or used to discharge liabilities. Many of these entries, however, were so obscure that it could not be determined to what particular bill or asset the entry belonged, except through the assistance of some one connected with the bank who knew about the transactions.</p>
   <p>In relation to the amount due the bank from its late president, Henry Greenebaum, Mr. Washburn says that he reports merely more in detail than before; as the present examination develops nothing to change the character or amount of that indebtedness. He then proceeds to specify in detail the amount due from the president and the various private banking houses in which he was a partner. At the time the bank suspended, Henry Greenebaum individually owed $62,325, of which $40,000 was in bills receivable, one being a note for $25,000, and the other for $15,000. But for Mr, Greenebaum's explanation, the consideration for which the larger note was given, could not have been determined. With his assistance, however, the facts in this and other transactions were fully traced.</p>
   <p>After the suspension of the bank, Greenebaum was charged with an indorsement of Sarah Greenebaum's note for $7,800. He has paid since suspension, by real estate, compositions and sale of collaterals, $22,400, leaving his indebtedness Dec, 24, 1878, $47,700. The balance due from him was secured by collaterals stock of the German National Bank, Chicago Cutlery Co., and Staats-Zeitung, since sold by the receiver for $3,200 in cash.</p>
   <p>The firm of Henry Greenebaum &amp; Co., which was composed of Henry, Elias and David S. Greenebaum, owed the bank at the date of suspension $29,000. The way in which Henry Greenebaum &amp; Co. became responsible to the German National for the sum of $20,000 charged to them on Jan. 4, and Mar. 7, 1878, needs explanation.</p>
   <p>In relation to this transaction, Albert M. Day, second vice-president and an active manager in the affairs of this bank, says that on Nov. 30, 1877, Henry Greenebaum represented to him that Henry Greenebaum &amp; Co. had deposited in the Commercial National Bank of Chicago to the credit of the German National Bank a draft on New York for $20,000, and that Henry Greenebaum &amp; Co. desired a corresponding credit on the books of the German National Bank, which credit was accordingly made, and Henry Greenebaum &amp; Co. checked it out the same day. The individual ledger of the German National Bank shows that Henry Greenebaum &amp; Co. were both debited and credited with an item of $20,000 on this day, Nov. 30, 1877, but nothing to show what the item was.</p>
   <p>Mr. Day further states that he had no reason to suppose that the German National Bank was in any way responsible for the payment of the $20,000 draft deposited in the Commercial National until after the suspension of his own bank, when he checked on the Commercial National for his balance, $5,000, and was told that they had indorsed it on the $20,000 draft. Although Mr. Day knew in the meantime that the draft in question had been returned unpaid, he further states that he learned then for the first time that the draft was drawn in favor of Henry Greenebaum, president, and so indorsed.</p>
   <p>Mr. Day does not wish to be understood as saying that Mr. Greenebaum made these representations for any special purpose. The Commercial National Bank held the German National Bank for the amount of the draft, and the German National paid the same and charged it to Henry Greenebaum &amp; Co., as above mentioned, on Jan. 4, and Mar. 7, 1878.</p>
