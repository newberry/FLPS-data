   <p>The first of the popular series of Sunday afternoon concerts, under the auspices of the Chicago Turngemeinde, was given at the North Side Turner Hall by Rosenbecker's orchestra yesterday. Despite the heat, there was a large audience and the music was well received. The orchestra was at its best, and there were frequent calls for encores. Among the selections which received the most applause were Fr. Kucken's "Der Pratendent", and a fantasie from "The Prophet" of Meyerbeer.</p>
