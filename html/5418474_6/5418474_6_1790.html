   <p>A new picture, the wonderful, brilliant Cyclorama. "The Fire of Chicago" can be seen in the Panorama Building between Madison and Monroe Street on Michigan Avenue.</p>
   <p>Those who have not been in Chicago during October, 1871, can vistualize the immensity of the Fire Drama, by pondering over this descriptive masterpiece of Paul Wichabim, Duesseldorf (Germany).</p>
   <p>The total cost of the valuable paint tableau is $250,000 and belongs to an art Association. The center point of the picture is the place, where Fort Dearborn used to stand. All around the flaming fury can be seen, devouring and spreading. The Southern part of the city is already in ruins, while a sea of fire is rolling towards the North side.</p>
   <p>As we know, that fire catastrophe destroyed about 20,000 houses and made about 1,000,000 persons homeless.</p>
