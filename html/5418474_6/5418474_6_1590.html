   <p>Orchestra Hall, which is to be the eventual home of Thomas' Orchestra, will soon be completed. Theodore Thomas tested its acoustic qualities yesterday, and the trials have shown excellent results. It is to be hoped that auspicious prognostications will not change, after the hall is filled with an audience.</p>
