   <p>Among the various questions which the soldier who has been demobilized and who has re-entered civil life will have to answer, is the following: "What shall I do with my war insurance?" A decision which the Bureau of War Insurance published on last Saturday makes it easy to answer this question. According to this decision soldiers and sailors may (within five years) exchange their government insurance for policies similar to those which are issued by large private insurance companies. The new policies will not be issued until premium rates have been published. Although the rates have not yet been established, they will be considerably lower than those charged by private companies.</p>
   <p>According to a statement made by Colonel Lindsay, superintendent of the aforementioned Bureau, six kinds of policies will be available: regular <span class="page-break">2</span>life insurance policies, twenty [-year] premium life insurance policies, thirty [-year] premium policies, twenty-year endowment policies, thirty-year endowment policies, and policies maturing when the insured is sixty-two years old. All policies will contain the stipulation that in case the policyholder is totally disabled the government will pay him a certain sum every month, and will not require further payment of premiums. This insurance is virtually an old-age pension and disability insurance, and the men who served in the army or navy, and retain their government insurance, will have the best possible protection against poverty.</p>
   <p>From a recent publication we learn that the War Risk Insurance Bureau has written 4,440,000 policies, the total value of which is $39,232,000,000, an average of $8,756 per policy. The importance of this business is evident from a comparison with the business of private insurance companies, which wrote only $27,000,000,000 of insurance in the United States. The largest private company issued policies with a total value of only $316,000,000 last year, while the Federal Government issued policies with a total value <span class="page-break">3</span>of $356,000,000 last month, when applications were already on the decline. To date, the Government has allowed claims for payment of face value on 34,969 policies, totaling $294,720,000.</p>
   <p>It can be readily understood that our Government can offer more reasonable rates than private companies can, for the latter must pay large sums of money to solicitors and agents for obtaining new policyholders. Furthermore, it must be taken into account that the risk is decreased as the number of insured is increased. Finally we must remember that low premiums attract a great number of young people, who are better risks than elderly people. The American people would undoubtedly save billions of dollars through government insurance, which could be improved in some respects. Thus....an ideal, which is worth striving for, could be attained: perfect protection against the greatest cares in life within the means of every individual in our country.</p>
   <p>Attainment of this goal would be greatly facilitated if the Government would <span class="page-break">4</span>permit payment of premiums in weekly installments. Many policies lapse because the holder has failed to put aside the necessary money; the previous payments are then declared forfeited. Therefore some publications recommend that insurance stamps be pasted into a book which is to be left in the possession of the insured person, and that the amount designated on the stamp be deducted from the weekly wages of the insured by his employer. [Translator's note: The writer's description of the proposed method of collecting weekly insurance payments is very vague.] In this respect the Government could do much good. In this connection the fact should not be overlooked that the Government would come into possession of the vast sums which are flowing into the hands of private corporations. With this money available, the Government would be relieved of the necessity to borrow. Therefore everyone who holds a government insurance policy should keep the policy in force, in his own interest as well as in the interest of the nation.</p>
