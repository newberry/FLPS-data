   <p>A hearing was held yesterday, before the circuit judges, in the habeas corpus proceedings involving Lieutenant Frank Bielefeld of the Lehr- und Wehrverein (a communist organization), whereby the constitutionality of the militia law was to be tested. Only Judge Moran was absent. Judge Barnum presided.</p>
   <p>It was agreed that Bielefeld's violation of the militia law was to be admitted as a legal fact, so that the legality of the law could be questioned. Crawford, of the law department, gave the opening speech, wherein he referred to the rights of the state in general, and he mentioned facts from French history to prove his point. He said, in permitting the association to become an incorporated body, the state did not relinquish its own rights....</p>
   <p>Harry Rubens, Bielefeld's chief defense counsel, was the next speaker. He asserted that the militia law is a very peculiar statute. Nothing like it <span class="page-break">\2</span>exists anywhere in the country, except in Massachusetts.....The people carried arms before the founding of the Republic; this privilege is our heritage.....In England, an attempt was made to disarm the people by resorting to hunting laws....The right to carry arms is a political right. The founders of the Republic organized it....</p>
   <p>The judges postponed their decision.</p>
