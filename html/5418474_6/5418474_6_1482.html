   <p>The Abendpost succeeded in acquiring possession of a wonderful painting, which represents the loop-business district of Chicago. The artist had to take at first photographic pictures from eight different angles and finally accomplished his task by painting the combination-view on the roof of the Monadnock Building.</p>
   <p>The painting, made by a German artist is giving an impressive picture of the "Wonder City."</p>
   <p>There have been made 1100 copies of the original. These copies can be bought at 25 per copy in the office of the Abendpost.</p>
