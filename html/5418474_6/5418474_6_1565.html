   <p>The public response to the Kimball Hall concert last night was such that admission had to be denied many. The Chicago Zither Club and Campbell Mandolin and Guitar Club participated. The Zither Club is under Carl Baier, famous zither virtuoso, and the Campbell Club under S. A. Campbell. The opening number given by the combined clubs was a waltz by Strauss, "Roses from the South," and it was played so magnificently that success was assured from the very beginning. This selection was followed immediately with a mandolin and guitar duet played by the artists Campbell and Gardie. A group of impressive offerings came next, among them "Pictures of Hungary," a zither solo by Mr. Baier, and a mandolin solo by Mr. Campbell, as well as a duet for "bowed and struck"zither by Baier and Mueller, which deserve particular emphasis.</p>

   <p>A splendid accomplishment likewise was the repetition of "Little Serenade" (Spiegelberg), and "Whispering Flowers" (Plohberger), on four zithers, by Baier, Boschat, Hayes and Kirchner. Another equally pleasing rendition by the Campbell Mandolin and Guitar Club was the excerpts from the operettas "Adele," and "Berceuse De Jocelyn," in which Mr. Campbell played a mando-cello solo.</p>
   <p>Both clubs also excelled as separate units.</p>
