   <p>"After the tragedy the satire"--or, as in Shakespeare, in the midst of the drama one finds the farce. Garfield's mortal remains have not yet reached their final resting place, and we already perceive dissension about the corpse--an abhorrent experience, but it nevertheless has its comic side. The doctors of divinity as well as the exponents of medicine suffered shipwreck with their knowledge. The former sought to provide proof of the efficacy of prayer during the protracted illness of the departed President and came to grief with their wisdom because regardless of their wholesale prayers, Guiteau's bullet did its deadly work. But religious mania is ever unruffled, prepared for anything, and like the falling cat, always lands on its feet. Whoever wants to prove the power of prayer follows the tried system of gambling:</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>"Heads I win, tails you lose."</p>
   <p>If the desired results materialize, then it is due to the prayers; and if the opposite happens, then one applies the declaration:</p>
   <p>"God in his unfathomable wisdom decided otherwise, and what He decrees is best; not mine, but his will be done!" That is very nice; only one does not understand then why the good Lord was bothered with prayers in the first place. Since He knows what is best for man, regardless of man's wishes, why are we so urgent with our unwarranted and senseless presumptions? If His decisions are not only inscrutable and wise but also irrevocable, why then do we make the childish, nay, insolent attempt to change them? If the judgment of the Omniscient is inexorable, then every one just makes a fool of himself by resorting to praying and singing in order to revise the judicial opinion. Whatever happens may be called fate, the necessity imposed by nature, or predestination, and any resort to prayer or efforts to avert <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>the unavoidable must appear as ridiculous as Mrs. Partington's attempt to sweep back the sea with her broom.</p>
   <p>But while the preachers with their belief in the miraculous power of prayer are hard pressed, our medicine men find themselves in worse plight. They have made jackasses of themselves, by their own admission. For eleven long weeks they treated the unfortunate President on the assumption that the deadly bullet had been deflected downward from the eleventh rib and lodged on top of the pelvic bone; indeed, with their electric bullet-searching machine they discovered that the bullet was located exactly a few inches above the pubic bone. At the post-mortem examination they found that the bullet had not been deflected downward by a rib but had penetrated to the spine, grazed and partly splintered a vertebra, and then continued diagonally until it had permanently lodged a few inches below the heart. The injury to the spinal bone had caused suppuration and finally rupture of a blood vessel and death. According to this explanation the bullet was twelve <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>or fourteen inches away from the place where a half a dozen medical sages had claimed to have located it! And the wound which had been treated for weeks and regarded as the path of the bullet was therefore only a blind cyst!</p>
   <p>And though the doctors admit their stupidity in this instance, in diagnosing an abcess with its purulent matter as the path of a bullet, they claim immunity against any reproach on the pretext that the wound would have been deadly anyhow, and the sick man could not have lived even if they, the doctors, had been wiser. But now appear General Swaim and Dr. Boynton and make the fearful accusation that the post-morten statement is fraudulent:</p>
   <p>"The bullet never reached the vertebra nor splintered it, and it caused no rupture of a blood vessel; it pierced the peritoneum and then reached the abdominal cavity, remaining there with no injurious effects. As far as the bullet was concerned, the wounded man might have fully recovered; death was <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>caused solely by wrong treatment of the cyst, which caused blood poisoning."</p>
   <p>These grave accusations will doubtless lead to a bitter newspaper controversy in which the physicians will not only be regarded as dunces but for good measure will be denounced for giving perjured testimony. Such arguments will never be fully decided, for the dissension among doctors is just as hopeless as the divergent ideas of the clergy; they are very similar to the controversy raging between the rabbi and Father Jose at the Aula in Toledo.</p>
   <p>But the public will come to the conclusion that a diagnosis of what takes place within the body is mere guesswork, even when the most capable doctors are involved; that the highly eulogized "science" is a miserable thing in many instances; and that in cases like the foregoing both the doctors of divinity and the doctors of medicine are on a par and can be put in the same pot. Both faith and science fought ridiculously and futilely against the inexorable laws of nature, faith with its prayers and science with its pumps for extracting <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>pus, slop-soup, and whiskey clysters.</p>
   <p>Could Garfield have been saved by medical aid? The question is useless. The misfortune has happened; he is dead, and not the tears of millions nor the prayers of the pious nor the subsequent erudite explanations of doctors can revive him. He was not the first man to die with the aid of so and so many doctors, nor will he be the last. In one instance, however, the departed is more fortunate than his survivors--"he is forever removed from the unpleasant arguments and the cantankerous conduct which constitute the greater part of mankind's intellectual life"!</p>
