   <p>Der Oesterreichische Werkbund (Made in Austria Alliance), with which most Austrian artists and artisans of diverse vocations are affiliated, have again arranged an exposition through the intercession of Chicago friends of the association.</p>
   <p>Kroch's Bookstore on Lake and Michigan Avenue and the Art Institute are featuring two exhibitions which show exceptional artistic creations and exquisite taste in the selection of these articles. The articles are tempting, especially if one is endowed with a sense of beauty.</p>
   <p>Particularly so are the patterns in silver snd brass, enhanced with colored enamels and mother of pearl, which are enchanting to the visitor. Cigarette cases, ash-trays, brushes, looking-glasses, candleholders, and other items have been converted into works of art and are exceptionally well suited for presents. Painted silk, plastic objects in glazed stoneware, as well as <span class="page-break">2</span>phantastically shaped animals in brass, complete the exhibit. Anyone professing interest in Austrian art should see it.</p>
