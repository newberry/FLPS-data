   <p>Editorial praises highly a proclamation of a San Domingo patriot against annexation by the U. S. (The reprinted proclamation showers abuse on President Grant.) "The Yankee" appears, and justly so, to the neighboring Spanish-American nations as a brutal, arrogant and greedy conqueror. Justly, we say, because Texas and California furnish proof of the inability of the Anglo-Americans to respect the equal right of the Hispano-American individuality. The Americans have treated the Mexican greasers who stayed in those states with contempt and as foreigners with-out rights (in the land of their birth!)</p>
   <p>What advantage have they enjoyed of this "wonderful material progress?" The annexation of San Domingo would advance the U. S. a long way on the road of brutal conquest and dishonest dealing- that road on which it is true, Holland and England traveled to short-lived might and prosperity, but that made their sudden fall from the height appear only all the more humiliating.</p>
