   <p>Our fellow citizens do not seem to be over-enthusiastic about the music in the Chicago Grand Opera House; at least one of our reporters who heard the "Dawn of the Gods" last night, stated that the audience was small and the listeners looked bored.</p>
   <p>Aside from two or three "stars," the productions of the present guest-company are indeed anything else but excellent. We have heard most of Richard Wagner's operas in the Hamburger Municipal Theatre and must state that the local performances very weakly resemble the magnificence of those.</p>
   <p>Considering that the prices of seats are tremendously high - the best seat is three dollars, and a half way decent one amounts to one and a half dollars, -we do not find it strange when the house usually shows a certain emptiness.</p>
