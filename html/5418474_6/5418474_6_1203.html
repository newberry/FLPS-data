   <p>One of the best known German banking houses of our city, the firm of Foreman Bros., was founded by Gerhard Foreman, a well known, conscientious German, who later bequeathed the property to his sons. The year 1889 has been one of the most successful periods in the company's history and the results are indeed very gratifying. The brothers have shown considerable perspicacity, proper conduct and relentless energy in the management of their affairs. They continued the business which their highly respected father had built on such a solid foundation, and they may be well satisfied with their successful achievement, the reward of a difficult task, as they practice a little retrospection in regard to the past year. They maintain a regular banking business, accept deposits of any amount; buy and sell bonds, mercantile and other valuable papers; loan large sums of money on mortgages; so their financial connections and enterprises are very extensive.</p>
   
   <p>Their influence and importance can only be appreciated when one considers the great popularity which this firm enjoys. Of all nationalities the Germans, especially have shown them unlimited confidence, and none of their many customers have ever been disappointed by this large firm.</p>
