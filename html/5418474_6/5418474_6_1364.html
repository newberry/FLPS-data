There was not the slightest indication of a flurry, no rushing around to learn the news, no sacrificing of exchange to strengthen currency reserves. In fact, the suspension was long ago discounted. The condition of the institution had been thoroughly analysed and understood in banking and commercial circles, though among small tradespeople the news of the failure was decidedly unexpected, as they had labored under the impression that, as the bank had weathered the gale so far, it could not fail to make a port in safety.</p>
