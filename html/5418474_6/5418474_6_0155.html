   <p>Altgeld's speech, delivered at Joliet, last week, bristled with serious criticism of the Republican party and particularly of Governor Fifer. In that address especial stress was laid on the fact, that prisoners work at starvation wages, enrich contractors and give competition to labor at the behest of the present political powers. That he touched a sore spot is shown by the published reply of the prison commissioners.</p>
   <p>Yesterday evening, at Sterling, Judge Altgeld talked at a meeting where he used the answers of the commissioners for a topic. Above all he called attention to the astounding inaction of the commissioners who are silent and thereby admit his serious accusations as being the truth. We must therefore assume that they cannot disprove them... That the prison administration was converted into a political machine... working for Fifer's re-election, that many officials neglected their duties to do campaign work - was admitted and suffices as a basis for demanding a change in the administration.</p>
   <p>That many industries suffer more from this prison competition now, than they did six years ago, at the time the constitutional amendment was adopted <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>which prohibits the "hiring of prison labor" - that also is conceded, and proves either intentional malfeasance of office or incapacity. The "piece work - price plan" according to which the commissioners allegedly furnish convicts to contractors, is a clear violation of the law - which likewise has not been denied....</p>
   <p>"The most glaring incidents," continued the speaker, "are the commissioners' constant attempts to interfere with and prevent all remedial legislation. This, they also could not disprove; although they claim the laws could not be passed because of the legislature's inactivity... they 'could not proceed differently without incurring a loss for the state.'</p>
   <p>"Then," continued Altgeld, "they should have made place for more capable leaders. Senator Burke's bill, which was supported by Major McClaughry, offered the solution of the prison labor problem by providing for the employment of capable, experienced men in the administration and it would have become a law, like any similar provision, if the commissioners had not undermined it with their intrigues.... Nothing can excuse the commissioners who <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>flaunt the law, - ignore the mandates of the state and public, by continuing this system.</p>
   <p>"The commissioners claim that in 1886 at the time the constitutional amendment was passed, many contracts were still in force which would not expire until 1890-91-92; thereby they want us to believe, that there were only a few criminals during the Fifer regime who were outside the jurisdiction of these agreements; actually, the following were in force:</p>

   <p>At the beginning of 1890, almost 600 of the men ware not drafted by contract labor, towards the end of 1891, about 900.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The commissioners say that the contracts still in effect require the use of prison shops until their expiration in 1894. Sufficient room to provide working facilities for all the convicts was not available prior to the termination of the agreements. Altgeld replied thereto: "If there was room to employ 1,600 to 1,700 men under the hiring system, then there must be enough space to let half that number work now, without the contractor-patronage. The present 295 convicts who will labor until 1894, to benefit private individuals, cannot fill the entire prison.</p>
   <p>"As a matter of truth, haven't all the fellows worked, even after the termination of that covenant? Couldn't they do it just as well for the state? Or have the contractors a monopoly of all the shop-space, even if only a small number is under contract rule? With such excuses the commissioners only prove that they cannot justify their transgressions in this manner.</p>
   <p>"They assert, that the state does not possess enough machinery to employ the criminals and that it takes considerable money to procure it, and in the same breath they talk about Mr. Winterbotham's (spelt Winterbottom, in a <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>previous issue, Translator) 150 convicts who work in the cooperage, where the machines are worth less than $10,000; nor do they disclaim that 100 inmates produce 1,100 to 1,200 barrels per day.</p>
   <p>"Furthermore, they remark, that three years ago, in 1889, the commissioners approved a statute which provided the necessary equipment to manufacture twine with prison-labor; both houses, however, voted against it because of the high cost of machinery and material. In order to employ the usual number of convicts, an expenditure of more than $1,500,000 would be necessary.</p>
   <p>"Now," said Judge Altgeld, "Doesn't this sound as if this report had been made for the express purpose of scaring the legislature about the excessive expense?</p>
   <p>"Why was just "twine" put on the program? Why not any other subject, since this proved so costly? If Mr. Winterbotham can find employment for 150 men, with an investment of $10,000 in machinery, why would it not be practical to find divers vocations, where the total cost for mechanical items remains within a <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>$100,000 limit? There are many industrial establishments which have 1,500 men on the pay-roll, yet the entire value of plant, buildings, land and machinery, etc., is less than $200,000.</p>
   <p>"It is very significant, that the commissioners only considered the manufacture of twine and then, as an after thought added: It would of course require $1,500,000. Evidently, it was enough to frighten the legislature.</p>
   <p>"The commissioners deny that Mr. Winterbotham was given machinery which was worth $25,000; its value is less than $10,000 and it belongs to the state. This is contradicted by the findings of a prominent Republican, Mr. T. Johnson of Chicago, a cooper, who, as a delegate of the Coopers' Alliance went to Springfield to investigate matters, visited the penitentiary and interviewed the Governor as well as the commissioners.</p>
   <p>"During the Coopers' Convention of June 9, 1892, at the Grand Pacific Hotel, in the presence of barrel manufacturers from Michigan, Indiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Illinois, Mr. Johnson gave his report: The state <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>furnishes the entire equipment to the contractor which, according to my appraisal is worth anywhere from $25,000 to $40,000, all necessary buildings, so that the contractor need not pay insurance nor taxes of any kind."</p>
   <p>The Superintendent of the Cooperage department in the presence of Commissioner Jones, told Mr. Johnson that 100 men can produce 1,100 to 1,200 barrels with these improved machines. The commissioners claim that the institution has been self-supporting since 1886, because the convicts earn enough to pay all expenses. Let us peruse this: In 1881 the legislature appropriated $92,500 for the prison; $75,300 in 1883; $81,300 in 1885; $189,000 in 1887; and in 1889, $119,000; then $140,500 in 1891. This does not look very much like 'self-sufficiency'!</p>
   <p>.... "Commissioner Jones seems to be the leading spirit of the prison administration," concluded Mr. Altgeld. "It would therefore be very interesting to expose his conduct prior to the present state regime's sway! When the constitutional amendment was offered as a referendum to the people, the Republican ballots showed the words 'For' and 'Against', so, if a voter did not <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>scratch one, then his ballot was discarded, as far as this question was concerned.</p>
   <p>"Jones now also tried to induce the Democratic committee to word the ballots in the same manner, in order to void the amendment. But the Democrats refused, and only printed the word 'For' on the ballots; this brought about its adoption (the amendment) by a majority of 19,000. Immediately before the election, Jones influenced the Commissioners to close long-term deals, and again, before the governor could sign the new law.</p>
   <p>"Now, these contracts covered more convicts than were in prison at the time! Thus Jones agreed to furnish more working ffelons during the subsequent period than were available, after he knew that the law would pass. The governor, it seems, does not control the commissioners, they dictate to him."</p>
