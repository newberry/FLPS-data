   <p>One of the aims of the new German government is to establish a closer relationship between man and the soil on which he works, and to which he owes his existence. One may call this a fantastic idea; one may scoff at it as being romantic--the fact remains that essentially, it is a truly human and healthy sentiment. These efforts are not limited to Germany alone, but are taking place in a more or less different form in other countries as well. But in Germany, legislation has already been enacted on this question.</p>
   <p>It is undoubtedly true that man tends to deteriorate in a large city and becomes estranged from a more natural way of living. It has been pointed out repeatedly that voluntary birth control, which Theodore Roosevelt in his drastic manner once called race suicide, is a product of city life. The consequences are much more profound than are superficially evident. In the first place, the ratio between older and younger people is constantly changing in favor of the former, and that is neither a natural nor a pleasant prospect.</p>
   <p>Quite recently President Roosevelt, in one of his speeches, asked the youth of this country to return to the farms; but probably his appeal, too, will fall on deaf ears as have all the others that have previously been voiced. Why do people give up life in the country and go to the big city? It cannot be the so-called agricultural depression. In spite of the constant complaints of the farmers, they are still much better off than most factory workers and office employees.</p>
   <p>At least the farmer has a roof over his head, nor does he have to worry about his daily bread. If things are difficult for him, it merely means that he lacks those things which are generally considered luxuries. With the overwhelming majority of the city population, the struggle for shelter and food hardly ever ceases. In former years, the city dweller could find amusements and diversions much more easily and cheaply than the farmer; but the automobile, the movie, and the radio have changed all that. The farmer in an out-of-the-way backwoods region can listen to a symphony concert or to dance music, broadcast over the radio, just as the city dweller does, and the best movies can be seen in a little country town for less money than in New York or Chicago.</p>
   <p>These inventions have brought the farmer in close contact with the rest of the world, and the advantages the city dweller used to have, are gone. In comparison with life in a large city, with its air full of smoke and gasoline fumes, its crowded apartments, its worried and hectic way of living, country life seems to be the ideal life. Then what is it that attracts people to the cities in ever increasing numbers? That question is hard to answer. Perhaps we are justified in assuming that people nowadays have lost their appreciation of a calm, peaceful, and well-regulated existence. They want excitement and sensation, and a teeming metropolis can provide that far better than a farm or a little country town.</p>
