   <p>The Sunday concert in the North Side Turner Hall attracted a great crowd yesterday. The better class of Germans was well represented and paid a friendly tribute to the efforts of Mr. Clauder. But the audience was not only composed of Germans, as many Americans could also be found there. Seldom has an audience been so captivated by music, when eating and drinking was supposed to be the main entertainment. The potpourri from Weber's Freischutz held the people spellbound. Even an admirer of Wagner must have been forced to revise his opinion, that there was no German music previous to him, when he noticed the silence of this big crowd. There was not the least sound nor the slightest disturbance. The facial expressions betrayed the deep emotion with which people listened to the magic melodies of the German composer. Even the waiters whose steps otherwise were often so disturbing, were leaning motionless against <span class="page-break">\2</span>the columns until the last notes had died away. So spellbound was the audience, that almost a full minute elapsed before the applause rang out. Music talks to the German heart and even when he hears it for the first time on distant shores he comes under the spell of the melodies from his old fatherland.</p>
