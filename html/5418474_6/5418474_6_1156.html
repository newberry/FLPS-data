   <p>Through the demise of Heinrich Buschmeyer, who died at his home, 54 Beethoven Place, on Friday, we have lost another of our oldest citizens in Chicago. He had reached his 74th year.</p>
   <p>Heinrich Buschmeyer was born in Westfalen, Germany, and came to Chicago in 1854. He was a cabinetmaker and worked at his trade here, eventually founding a furniture factory which developed very successfully. Since 1886 he lived in well-deserved retirement. The deceased belonged to various lodges in former years and was one of the first "Druids."</p>
   <p>Mr. Buschmeyer married Mrs. Elisabeth Schmitz during his fifties. Aside from his widow, he is survived by a son, Heinrich, who likewise is active in the same vocation, and by two stepchildren.</p>
   <p>The funeral will be held at the home of the deceased, on Monday, at 2 o'clock <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>in the afternoon. Interment at Graceland cemetery.</p>
