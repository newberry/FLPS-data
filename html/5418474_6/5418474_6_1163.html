   <p>Among the German Lutheran population of Chicago and the middle West there is perhaps, not a more popular firm then Vocke and Doederlein.</p>
   <p>Both gentlemen deserve the full measure of confidence which is extended to them. Mr. H. Vocke was born in Hanover, Germany, and educated at the Capital University in Columbus, Ohio; he studied law and accepted a position as secretary of the German Consulate in this City. Afterwards he became lawyer for the German "Rundschau" in Chicago and was particularly active in recovering legacies in Germany for his clientele and in managing legacies and real estate property.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vocke succeeded in winning Mr. Doederlein as partner. Mr. Doederlein returned just recently from Leipzig, Germany, where he was sent by President Cleveland as the representative of the United States. He obtained his education at Concordia College, and the Theological Seminary of St. Louis, Missouri. During a very critical political period the German Rundschau was under his management. It is, indeed, regrettable that it is so difficult to obtain men of such high degree of culture and ability as representatives of our country, such as Mr. Doederlein. We need men of this type for foreign countries, particularly for Germany, the home of art and science.</p>
