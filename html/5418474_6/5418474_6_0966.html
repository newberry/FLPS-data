   <p>The family evening of the German Press Association, in its locality, the Chicago Lincoln Club, was a very pleasant affair. The program consisted in a bunco game, for which a number of pretty prizes were donated by the executive amusement committee, followed by entertainment.</p>
   <p>Mr. Martin Ballmann, president of the amusement committee, succeeded in securing the collaboration of a number of artists. Miss Marion Waterford and Miss Ruth Axe Brown, received great applause for their singing. Mr. Conrad A. Reinhold proved to be a great artist on the violin; Misses Maria Dreier and Olive Dryer played the piano, and Miss Dell Hinshaw and Mr. Leopold Saltiel, one of the association's members, presented some really interesting discourses.</p>
