   <p>Mr. Davis, manager of the Columbia Theatre, is advising us that all performances, as scheduled by the original season plan, will not be interrupted or interfered with by the sudden death of Leopold Damrosch. Mr. Walter Damrosch, son of the late orchestra leader, will keep up the work of his father and carry out all details of the program, as laid out by the dead leader for the Opera Company. Tickets can be bought in advance, as advertised in special announcements of the Staats-Zeitung.</p>
