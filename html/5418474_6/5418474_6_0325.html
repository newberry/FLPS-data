   <p>If the Civil Rights Bill fares no better in the Supreme Court of the United States than it did in the Federal District Court of Tennessee, then the Forty-third Congress spent much time and effort uselessly. According to an opinion rendered by H. H. Emmons, Federal Judge of the aforementioned District, and issued in the forum of instructions to a grand jury, the proposed law is only a worthless "scrap of paper".</p>
   <p>Judge Emmons argues thus:</p>
   <p>"The Federal Government has no authority to punish any offenses save those committed against federal statutes. It has nothing to do with crimes against life and property, or against the welfare of citizens. [Translator's note: The statement that the Federal Government "has nothing to do with crimes against the welfare of citizens" is erroneous.] The individual state above has jurisdiction <span class="page-break">\2</span>over such transgressions; only the individual state can define and punish them. For instance, admission to saloons, theaters, etc., is a matter which only the states, and not the Federal authorities, regulate by law. The National Government can define and protect only the national rights of citizens; and these rights are not numerous. Among these rights are the privilege of traveling from one state to another. The National Government also devises and executes laws relative to the protection of United States citizens while in foreign countries or at sea. However, the Federal Government has not even the right to hold elections, that function being entirely within the province of the states; nor has the Federal Government the right of granting any citizens admission to any state institutions. Thus, by abolishing slavery, the Federal Government merely placed the former slaves on the same level with the Negroes who live in the states where slavery never existed. In such states Negroes were prohibited by laws and legal opinions from exercising the right to vote, and nobody thought of demanding or expecting redress from the Federal authorities. The courts in <span class="page-break">\3</span>these states have also confirmed the right of owners of theaters and ships to refuse Negroes admission to their playhouses and boats.</p>
   <p>"Now, if the Federal Government had no authority to interfere with this exercise of the sovereignty of states in favor of those Negroes who never were slaves, it cannot have acquired such authority with reference to the former slaves merely by abolishing slavery. The Federal Government may protect the national rights of emancipated slaves, but has nothing to do with their state rights."</p>
   <p>In proof of his argument, Judge Emmons cites two very important decisions rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States on matters of race. The one was made in connection with a complaint made by the butchers of New Orleans against a law which forced them to have their slaughtering done by large slaughtering firms. The other decision was rendered when a lady appealed to the Supreme Court for admission to the bar. In both cases the Supreme Court decided that it had no jurisdiction, since neither the right which the butchers of New Orleans claimed, nor the authority to admit anyone to the bar of a state, were national rights. And yet, in the case of the butchers of New Orleans, the right of a citizen to follow an occupation, and to protect his property against a state <span class="page-break">\4</span>law which placed it in jeopardy, was at issue. Judge Emmons could have also cited the decision of the Supreme Court, granting the individual states the right to seize private property on which the Federal Government levies taxes, such as liquors, or to prohibit the sale of such property, or to destroy it.</p>
   <p>Judge Emmons concludes that the Civil Rights Bill is null and void because the Federal Government had no constitutional authority to enact it.</p>
   <p>In connection with this matter His Honor makes some remarks which prove that his interpretation of the law is not based on malice or ill will toward Negroes. He deplores the fact that the Negroes of the South were exposed to the abuse and persecution of their masters, and that there were no laws to punish the despicable scoundrels who murdered or drove away defensless and peaceful blacks. And he adds in a bitter tone that since Congress wanted to apply dubious means to protect Negroes, it would have done better to have protected their lives and their property instead of their "right" to view the bare legs of can-can ballerinas. He says:</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>"I cannot warm up to the right of Negroes to see the swinish indecent exposures of the bodies of ballet dancers who evidently are the chief attractions offered by the stage today. Had I answered that the Federal Government has a right to protect the citizens of a state, I would have chosen more important and more indispensable rights as objects for the protection of the Federal Government. We dislike and disapprove of making a farce of the use of Federal power; and we regret that this power cannot be applied to the protection of the life, homes, and properties of those peaceful and faithful workers who labor quietly and honestly for their wives and children and have no desire to have social intercourse with those people who frequent our theaters for the purpose of satisfying their craving for sensical indeceny."</p>
   <p>In general, Judge Emmons' opinions agree with those of Senator Carpenter, who also stated that the Civil Rights Bill is a violation of the constitutional authority of the Federal Government. Since several complaints have been made in lower courts on the basis of that contention, it will not be long before the Supreme <span class="page-break">\6</span>Court will have an opportunity to render a decision on the matter. If its decision agrees with that of Judge Emmons, the race question will be just where it was prior to the enactment of the Civil Rights Bill. Only when the prejudice of the whites has been removed, and the Negroes have progressed socially and mentally, will the two races live together peacefully. A civil rights law cannot affect the issue one way or the other.</p>
