   <p>After a life of restless activity dedicated to the beautifying and development of cosmopolitan Chicago, one of its greatest citizens, Charles H. Wacker, chairman of the Chicago Plan Commission, departed to the Great Beyond at the age of seventy-three.</p>
   <p>Although his demise was not unexpected, it nevertheless brought a vacancy in the ranks, and it will be difficult to replace him. Charles H. Wacker's life was monumental. He was a man of profound insight, a visionary of rare powers, a splendid example proving that Americans of German extraction are one of our most valued civic assets.</p>
   <p>In Charles H. Wacker the spiritual development of his progenitors asserted itself, and to this must be added a thorough education which proved highly valuable in later years. His father, Friedrich Wacker, starting life as a common farm-laborer, and later turning to the brewing business, became a great industrialist at the age of fifty-four.</p>
   <p>Charles E. Wacker was born on August 29, 1856, in Chicago.He studied here, then attended the Lake Forest Academy, and completed his education at the universities in Stuttgart and Genf, where he remained for three years. Extended journeys in Europe, Africa, and America broadened his views. [A half-tone is shown.]</p>
   <p>Upon returning to Chicago, he worked in a commission house until 1880, when his father made him a partner in his malting firm, then known as F. Wacker and Son. In 1882 Friedrich Wacker founded the Wacker and Birk Brewing and Malting Company; his son, Charles Wacker, becoming president of the corporation after his father's death in 1884. Charles Wacker was also president of the McAvoy Brewing Company for several years and president and director of the Chicago Heights Land Association, director of the Corn Exchange National Bank, Chicago Title and Trust Company, South Elevator Company, and other enterprises.</p>
   <p>As the youngest member of the Chicago World's Fair directorate, he first conceived the idea of beautifying Chicago on a large scale. Finally, when the Chicago Plan Commission became a reality under Mayor Fred Busse's administration, Wacker realized his goal. His forethought will make the name unforgettable for generations. The great network of boulevards and parks in the city, the improvements on the lake shore, the forest belt, and the first double-deck street bearing his name represent only a small part of his encompassing plans.</p>
   <p>A Life of Labor</p>
   <p>What Charles H. Wacker has done for his native city will never be fully known. No one is aware just how many days and nights he sacrificed without thought of remuneration or personal aggrandizement, all for but one cause, the beautification of his native environment, and in this quest he labored ceaselessly until declining health compelled him to resign from the Plan Commission.</p>
   <p>He died in his home, at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. He is survived by his wife, Ella T. Wacker; two sons, Frederick G. and Charles H. Jr., as well as a daughter, Mrs. Earl Zimmermann. Their bereavement is shared by countless acquaintances and intimate friends, his collaborators, and others who knew him for years, among the latter the members of the Swabian Club, which is proud of its departed honorary member; the Germania Club, the Chicago Gymnastic Association, and the Swabian Aid Society. The Chicago Song Club has lost its honary president, and it was here, at the funeral of conductor Boeppler, when Charles H. Wacker appeared for the last time among Chicago's Germans.</p>
   <p>Shunning displays, his funeral will be an unostentatious affair.</p>
