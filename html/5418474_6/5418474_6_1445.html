   <p>The new building that the Illinois Staats Zeitung is erecting at the north east corner of Fifth Avenue and Washington Street, is well advanced. The fourth floor will be finished this week; the niches for the statues of Guttenberg and Franklin above the third floor are already built. Alongside these statues the allegorical figures of art and science, trade and industry, Columbia and Germania, will adorn the cornice. Already the tasteful facade, though hardly half finished, arouses general admiration. Messrs. Bauer and Loebnitz are the architects. The lot on which the building stands has a Washington front of 40 ft., on Fifth Avenue of 110 ft. Besides a high basement the house will have six full stories, that is to say, fully 30,000 square feet of floor space, or three quarters of an acre. Part of this space will be rented.</p>
   
   <p>The building will be almost 100 ft. high. All rooms are to be steam-heated. A lifting machine (elevator) likewise worked by steam, will make intercourse with the upper stories as pleasant as possible.</p>
   <p>The cost of the building is estimated at $100,000. The lot cost $80,000. The Bullock press, that will be put into the basement, cost $21,000. This and other new paraphernalia of the printing press, stereotyping, book-binding, etc., added together will raise the total capital investment to about a quarter of a million dollars.</p>
