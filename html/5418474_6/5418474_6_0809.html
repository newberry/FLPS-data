   <p>Among the plans to reconstruct economic life which President Roosevelt intends to put into effect in the immediate future, the resettlement projects deserve special attention. Farmers from barren farms are going to be settled on fertile land; also, there seems to be an intention to resettle elsewhere those farmers who have given up their farms because of bad times or the burden of debts. It is to be done at government expense; unemployed persons are going to be placed in a position to become independent on lands to be allotted them. Fundamentally, all these plans must be approved. The objection that these resettlements are bound to increase the agricultural surplus, and thus render even more insecure the income of farmers, is not valid. Persons who are going to be resettled are not supposed to increase the amount of products on the market, but are rather to support their own families with the produce of their soil.</p>
   
   <p>This is quite possible (in parts of the country where the soil has not yet been cultivated) if the government fertilizes the land, builds houses, barns and stables and puts the necessary cattle and equipment at the disposal of the settlers. One of the main things, however, which on occasions of previous settlements has often been overlooked, is the careful sifting of the persons who apply. There will undoubtedly be many who will apply because the idea of coming into possession of a small farm, free and without effort, is alluring beyond measure. One may assume as self-evident that all who apply are in need. As to this, no mistake must be made. Persons able to help themselves have no right to claim government aid. However, the selection of applicants has only just begun and is far from being closed. Strict care is necessary, in order to settle only such persons who are actually able to cultivate the land in an orderly fashion, and who have a real interest in getting the utmost in produce for themselves. Anyone who has never worked on a farm should not be settled; it is risky, for he understands nothing of agriculture, and he may therefore not be expected to be successful. Former farmers or farm hands will constitute the best material and, where families with children are involved, the outlook for success is even brighter. At the present time, the number of hands available to do the work plays a great part in agriculture.</p>
   <p>It is not yet definitely known what requirements are to be made by the government from the settlers. It would be a mistake not to demand certain things from them as compensation. With most people, a gift is by no means regarded as valuable as the thing earned through work. It is not likely that the settlers will be asked ever to repay to the government the expenses and costs of resettlement. It must, however, be expected that, in the course of years, they could surrender at least a small portion of the produce of their land, so as not to feel that they are permanent receivers of a dole. They should get the conviction that they have attained something by their own efforts, and have become rooted in the soil. They should not regard their resettlement as a passing episode in their lives, but be proud of their holdings, which they can some day bequeath to their heirs. The whole work of resettlement would fall short of its purpose if the settlements should last only a few years, or until things are better and the settlers could abandon their farms again.</p>
   
   <p>The main strength of every people is lodged in its settled farmers. Our American farmers have, until recent years, made frequent use of their freedom of movement. Ask some old farmers where they have been living in the course of their lives, and, with some pride, they will tell you how many farms they have owned, one after the other, and then sold again. Formerly, the trend was generally toward the West, but today the direction is not so precise; but changes--many of them--are still being made. Many farmers look for another farm after they have cultivated one farm for some time, no matter whether they are successful or not. Those who are not successful hope for better luck elsewhere; the one who has laid aside a little fortune wants still more, and looks for a larger farm. Thus, they have no permanent home, take no roots in the soil, and show little interest in the modern progress of agriculture. The farmer who remains on his land is much more valuable to our economic life and to the state. It is to be hoped that the Federal Government, in carrying out its resettlement plans will pay close attention to this point.</p>
