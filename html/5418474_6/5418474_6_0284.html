   <p>The bill of Senator Bash, who intends to infuse at least a slightly humane spirit into the mortgage laws of Illinois--as far as the debtor is concerned--has aroused a storm of indignation from our leeches, the Shylocks and their legal representatives. However, others assert that what Mr. Bash intends to accomplish is nothing more than part and parcel of the past procedures of other states, especially of Massachusetts.</p>
   <p>The mortgage law of Massachusetts is based upon the assumption that the mortgagor who accepts a mortgage as security does so with his eyes open, and that he is as fully informed concerning the actual value of the property as the person who seeks the loan. If, subsequently, a considerable devaluation takes place, which is beyond the control of either, then, considering the circumstances, one party of the contract shall not sustain the entire loss, but both shall share it. In <span class="page-break">\2</span>other words, the mortgagor shall be satisfied with getting the property with-out exacting additional demands from the mortgagee, who already has lost his entire investment as far as the mortgage is concerned.</p>
   <p>But as long as it is customary for the debtor to sign a mortgage as well as a bond, the courts cannot very well deny the right to a legal action to collect in accordance with the bond; but, if the creditor takes such action, the mortgagee then has the right to redeem his mortgage-lapsed property. In other words, the creditor cannot obtain a clear title to the property.</p>
   <p>That is the law in Massachusetts, and is the identical procedure Mr. Bash desires to introduce in Illinois. No doubt the stipulations are sensible and just, at least in all cases where the mortgage represents a part of the unpaid purchase price. Different opinions might prevail where the creditor had advanced money on an ordinary note and accepted a mortgage as additional security, with no intention of obtaining possession of the property. In that case the creditor can have no objection if the property is returned to the <span class="page-break">\3</span>debtor after the latter has paid the debt. In such a case the creditor is interested only in the money he has lent, and not in the property itself.</p>
   <p>As an example, let us suppose that, during a real-estate boom, A converts several acres of what was potato land into "suburban lots" and sells them to B for $10,000, taking $5,000 in cash, the balance as a mortgage. Now, if the real-estate "soap-bubble" bursts before the mortgage becomes due, so that the acres are worth only $2,000, then it is eminently proper that the creditor should consider repossession of the land as payment in full, without exacting an additional three or four thousand dollars from the debtor, who already has lost every cent he has paid.</p>
   <p>During recent years hundreds of such cases were recorded. In every instance the debtor had to face bankruptcy, and no Portia appeared to prevent forfeiture of the coveted "pound of flesh". Also, within recent years a multitude of not overly prosperous people have suffered under mortgage laws which were enacted for the sole benefit of creditors.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>One still remembers the incident of the Bavarian Settlement; in fact, the memory is most vivid. A well-known real-estate agent sold building lots to a number of German workingmen, and finally--after cheating them by selling at excessive prices--he not only reacquired the property (with the buildings erected thereon during the interim) but also mercilessly collected the unpaid balances from the unfortunate debtors.</p>
   <p>Such atrocities were, and are, absolutely legal according to our present mortgage laws, and just as lawful as Shylock's demand for a pound of flesh. Bash's bill does not go as far as it should in eliminating the present evil. Nevertheless, the measure is worthy of recognition, and is a step in the right direction.</p>
   <p>As long as Mr. Bash is considering the subject, he might as well try to do even more by adopting still another clause of the Massachusetts law, the clause dealing with taxation of money represented by mortgages. One of the vilest and most despicable provisions of our State tax system stipulates that the mortgagee must pay the tax on the creditor's property. If I have property valued at $10,000, <span class="page-break">\5</span>and I owe $5,000 in a mortgage, then I actually only own one half of it, the creditor possessing the balance. Nevertheless, I must pay taxes on the entire $10,000--the creditor's $5,000 as well as my share. Of course, according to law, the creditor should pay an additional tax on the mortgage, since the latter constitutes personal property, but he ignores that. Of every $100,000 invested in mortgages, less than $1,000 is registered as personal property. Even though every mortgage-holder should pay his full taxes, it would not ameliorate the plight of the debtor; the State alone would benefit through such double taxation.</p>
   <p>In Massachusetts, the law provides that the debtor may deduct from his mortgage payment the amount of the tax on the creditor's share in the property, unless the contracting parties definitely have made an agreement to the contrary..... This is the only feasible way by which investors in mortgages can be made to pay a tax on their property, and the adoption of such a law would be highly desirable in Illinois.</p>
   <p>Our laws on mortgages are survivals of a period when the West lacked capital, <span class="page-break">\6</span>and when any capitalist who provided money, even at outrageously usurious rates, was regarded as a public benefactor. Any timid suggestion calculated to curb the selfish interests of capitalists met with the rejoinder, "For God's sake, don't drive away capital--it is badly needed here; after all, our State is of only recent origin!" But that time is past, and the basic design which our legislature has impressed upon our tax laws must be eradicated, so that no one can ever say again: "The debtor in Illinois has no rights which the creditor must respect."</p>
