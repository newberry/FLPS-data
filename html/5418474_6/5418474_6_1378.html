   <p>All those, who used to visit the old Toledo on Washington St. will be glad to learn that the brothers Kaltenbach have opened a new Restaurant which also bears the name Toledo.</p>
   <p>The new place is at 135-141 East Madison St. Its arrangement is most modern and elegant. An excellent musical program will be offered by the German Ladies Band under the direction of the famous artist Miss Bertha Neubers.</p>
   <p>The well known orchestrion, the greatest musical mechanical wonder of the world, will also play some new concert compositions.</p>
   <p>Thus the Toledo, which opens its doors tonight, will be a first class eating and entertainment place.</p>
