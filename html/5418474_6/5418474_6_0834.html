   <p>The committee on agriculture of the House of Representatives again has in mind a bill for the salvation of agriculture. At present public negotiations are being conducted before the committee. Most people coming before the committee are so-called farm politicians. Among them was one from Chicago by the name of C. B. Gregory, editor of a magazine, Prairie Farmer. What this gentleman had cooked up for the salvation of agriculture is quite remarkable.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gregory had figured out that farmers could be saved from impending peril, but not until the prices are legally established for wheat at 93.7 cents per bushel; for hogs, $7.67 per hundred pounds; for tobacco, 11 cents; and for cotton, 13.7 per pound. Our farmer friend had everything figured out down to the last detail. He intends to increase the price of hogs by imposing one-half cent in taxes on each pound of pork. To our regret, he fails to tell us how it <span class="page-break">2</span>would profit the farmer if the Federal Government is to receive a tribute of one-half cent for every pound of pork.</p>
   <p>The man has still another plan. He proposes that the land on which maize is grown should be reduced by 15 per cent. Every farmer who voluntarily withdraws his land from the production of maize should receive a remuneration of four dollars per year per acre. The Secretary of Agriculture should, in addition, be authorized to buy up large quantities of pork. At first it seems puzzling to some extent, for what would the Secretary of Agriculture want to do with all that pork? But the farmers' friend from Chicago knows the answer. He is going to sell the meat in such a manner that it would not enter into competition with other pork produced in the country.</p>
   <p>This provision is in itself apt to make the proposals appear senseless. Time and again attempts have been made to influence prices of agricultural products by legislative measures, and time and again this procedure turned out to be absolutely aimless and costly in the extreme. It is not possible to withdraw <span class="page-break">3</span>a part of production from the market by buying it up. As long as it is bought but not destroyed it remains a factor in the formation of prices. Whether it is sold in the domestic or foreign market, it is always going to have a bearing on prices. This again proved without peradventure how fatuous an experiment it is on the part of the farming authorities to stabilize the price of wheat.</p>
   <p>The establishment of prices depends upon natural factors. If it is not influenced artificially, then after a period of abnormal rising and falling of prices there always follows a period of balanced prices. That is how it always was and how it is going to be in the future. History shows as clearly as light that wars have been the strongest factor in the favor of high food prices, and in postwar times, prices relaxed again. The present period is nothing but a reaction to the period of abnormally high prices that prevailed during the war. This time there will likewise be a balancing, if bureaucracy does not again interfere disturbingly with its unholy attempts at setting artificial prices.</p>

   <p>Congressman William L. Nelson from Missouri has a plan for saving agriculture which is more definite, better, and cheaper. First, he wants the law which authorizes agricultural authorities to speculate in agricultural produce to be revoked. He further asks for a tariff revision which would make it possible for American farmers to export their products to other countries. As a further remedy, he recommends the reduction of interest rates on agricultural mortgages and the renewal of these mortgages for more extended periods.</p>
   <p>Nelson is in favor of abolishing all subsidies; he demands the reduction of all public expenditures, and along with it a reduction of taxes and a policy of "limited inflation aiming at the stabilization of an honest dollar". This suggestion has been made a few times in the last years, but it is extremely hazardous. For the time being it may be advantageous to the farmer, but for that part of the population which must buy farm products, especially the poorer classes of the population, it would have catastrophic effects. The best suggestion made by Congressman Nelson is the last one. This is its wording: "Let the farmer alone!" If the committee agrees to carry out this idea and to reduce <span class="page-break">5</span>taxes, it would render the farmers and the entire national economy an invaluable service.</p>
