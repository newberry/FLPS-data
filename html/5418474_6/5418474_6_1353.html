   <p>The Chicago Mining and Milling Company was founded to erect and operate ore crushers in the Globe District, central part of Arizona, as well as to exploit twenty mines, all of which give indications of great value. The Globe District was discovered only recently--two years ago. Within the confines of that territory [Globe District] there are the Silver Era, the Cox and Copelin, the Mexican, the Mc Morris, and the Stonewall Jackson mines, the richness <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of whose ore is already recognized in San Francisco. The property of the Chicago Mining and Milling Company is in close proximity to these mines and promises, in some parts, even better results. For example, the Julius Mine produced a higher grade ore than any of the mines mentioned above and, according to indications, the veins of the Julius Mine are fully as rich as any other in Arizona. This part of the state lacks neither wood nor water and is accessible by good roads throughout the year. After May 1, when the Southern Pacific Railroad, now being built, reaches this part of the country, the mines will be within fifty miles of a railroad.</p>
   <p>The discoverers of these mines in the Globe District are poor, plain people, suspicious of speculators, and are averse to yielding their hard-earned acquisitions to others without adequate remuneration. As they had no capital, they were not able to install ore crushers to convert their rich treasures into money, so, in order to supply this equipment, the Chicago Mining and Milling Company was organized. The projected reducing works will be <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>busy day and night as soon as we are able to treat the ore from the many mines in this vicinity; therefore, as soon as operations commence, the Company will have an income of about $200 per day. (The mill will have a capacity of 15 tons per day and the profit per ton amounts to $15.) The Chicago Mining and Milling Company intends to erect its stamping machinery before digging ore, so that the corporation will be able to defray its mining costs from its income [e.g., from reducing the ore of other mines @ $15 per ton].</p>
   <p>Of the 10,000 bonds of the Company, 4,000 will be sold at $25 each; the entire proceeds derived there from will be used for construction of the mill and to provide capital for its operation.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The information in the paragraphs omitted here, is contained in the January 2 issue of Illinois Staats-Zeitung.] These bonds may be procured through the bankers Wasmansdorff and Heinemann, 165 East Randolph <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Street. A prospectus and any other desired information may also be obtained there.</p>
   <p>We consider the bonds of the Chicago Mining and Milling Company an excellent investment and recommend them to our business associates and the public in general. In investigating the enterprise we convinced ourselves of its reliability as well as honesty of purpose and, as evidence of its local esteem, we may add that the first eighty bonds were subscribed to by a Mr. Carl Soyek, a resident of the Globe District for two years and a practical miner and metallurgist who studied in Germany. We also desire to call your attention to the fact that the Company, in compliance with the laws of Illinois, leaves its contracts in the custody of its bondholders.</p>
