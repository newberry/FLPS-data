   <p>Unfortunately we cannot delude ourselves any longer. Garfield's condition is not improving. The spark of life is feeble. If he has enough resistance to fight infection, then he may live, but this is improbable. To build up resistance, it would have been necessary above all for him to take food in a normal manner and to digest it properly. That is the bad feature. Giving food by injection is a poor substitute for nature and almost as ominous as the prescription for muck, which doctors generally use as a last resort, when there is no more hope. It may be all right for the doctor to show optimism up to the very last, and to regard even a slightly favorable symptom as highly encouraging, but to the unbiased observer who has had some slight experience with infection, it appears to be hoping against hope.</p>
   <p>Suppose that these apprehensions materialize, and that Garfield dies, then <span class="page-break">2</span>the next thing would be the punishment of Guiteau. If the people throughout the land could take the law into their own hands, act as jury, or resort to lynching, then the question would be settled quickly. The bestial creature would dangle on a rope before he could say a prayer. But unfortunately the matter cannot be settled so quickly.</p>
   <p>If it is at all possible to find jurors, twelve ignoramuses who have heard nothing about the affair, then all the technicalities and schemes known to our disreputable lawyer will be employed to save the criminal from the gallows.</p>
   <p>The defense will try to prove two points: first that Guiteau is insane, in other words, that he was irresponsible at the time when he committed the deed. If that argument cannot be sustained, then it will be shown that Garfield did not die of the injury, the bullet, but of wrong treatment given by the physician.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>With respect to the second point, weeks, even months, may elapse before the futile argument is settled. Experts and laymen will be questioned. Among the latter, people will appear in court who have been wounded as seriously as Garfield and have managed to survive because they had only one doctor instead of half a dozen, since these injured persons were just plain people or ordinary soldiers and not presidents. We also are inclined to believe that in the case of the President's injury too many cooks spoiled the broth, and that if he had been a common man, he would have been well by this time instead of being at the point of death. And this view will probably be shared by thousands of people.</p>
   <p>But even if we assume that this fact could be established, then we still have this to consider. Attempted murder is not mitigated by the possibility that the victim might have been saved. On this point, we have definite supreme court decisions handed down in Maryland, and they apply to the District of <span class="page-break">4</span>Columbia. In those verdicts it was emphasized that any one who mortally injured another must be regarded as a murderer if the act was premeditated, even if the victim died much later, and if the possibility existed that better medical treatment might have saved the wounded person's life.</p>
   <p>Thus one might say, "This disposeth of Mr. Guiteau" [Translator's note: Quoted sentence is printed in English] , just as [Carl]Schurz read the manifesto to Jacob Mueller, in Cleveland, sometime in May, 1876, and declared: "This disposeth of Mr. Hayes". However, this disposition of Mr. Mayes did not prevent his disposer from accepting later a place in Hayes's cabinet and helping to find nice berths for all the rascals who had helped to count the man into the White House.</p>
   <p>The friends of the conniving Leo [Translator's note: This refers to Leo Hartmann, a European diplomat involved in Russian affairs] show us, nevertheless, that the end justifies the means. The motive of Guiteau was to <span class="page-break">5</span>make Arthur president, etc., and the assassin undoubtedly expected that if Arthur obtained the presidency, then the latter, as a matter of gratitude, would protect Guiteau from any punishment. Well, in monarchies it has happened occasionally that an aspirant to the crown who has reached his goal through the act of an assassin, has treated the latter leniently. But in this case matters are likely to end differently. If Arthur should become president through Garfield's death, then self-preservation would make it imperative for the new executive and his associates to have Guiteau hanged; for if the beast lived, then the crime and the condoners of it could never efface the guilt involving Arthur and the "Stalwarts". There would not be enough water in the ocean to cleanse them. Whatever one may think about the motives, those upon whom Guiteau relies for help would necessarily be the first to deliver him to the gallows, if that is at all possible under our lamentable and despicable legal system. If they fail in that, they will always be branded as the murderers of Garfield.</p>
