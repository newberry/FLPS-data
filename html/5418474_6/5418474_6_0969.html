   <p>Before the members of the German Teachers' Association, director Max Griebsch gives a lecture.</p>
   <p>The great esteem which Mr. Max Griebsch, director of the Milwaukee Teachers' Seminar enjoys among the German Teachers of Chicago, was proven by the large appearance of the members of the German Teachers' Association in the Bismarck Hotel yesterday afternoon.</p>
   <p>In his extremely essential and appealing lecture on the influence and worth of the German language and German pedagogy in the development of the American public, schools, Mr. Griebsch was able to say many nice things, and the wish, expressed by Mr. Schmidhofer, that this lecture should be printed and placed in the hands of all German teachers, was shared by all those present. How, under the guidance of immigrated German pedagogues in the years following the Civil War, German private schools had been developed, to whom many men and women even today owe their thorough education, speaks highly of same; furthermore, how the churches, with great sacrifices, founded and supported German schools, the speaker pointed out, but he lamented that, with the initiation of the German system in the American public schools, the interest of Germans in the private schools ceased, till there are only few left of those excellent institutes. The speaker further mentioned that the almost lost interest of Americans in the German language has lately reawakened, and that the study in the high schools brought about the adoption of it in the public schools, which is mainly due to the better understanding of its value on the part of the high school teachers.</p>
   <p>The literature of the German language is an uninterrupted chain of material for every age, from the fable for the child's mind, to the highest classical work that delights the mature.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Schmidhofer thanked the speaker in the name of those present for the enjoyable and instructive lecture, and the member of the school board, Mr. Kruetgen, wished the association progress and success, and assured the teachers of his great interest and ready assistance.</p>
