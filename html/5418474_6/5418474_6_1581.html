   <p>Miss Pauline Meyer, a native of Chicago, gave her first public recital as pianist at the Music Hall yesterday. She studied under Koelling and Wolfsohn here, and under Godowski and Luetschg abroad. Her technique is astonishing, and her qualifications to do justice to musical masterpieces are also some of her assets. Her performance of the rarely heard sonata in C-Dur, Opus 24, by Weber, was exact in every detail. That her technique is above the average, she demonstrated best when playing the Scherzo and Rondo of Beethoven's D-Dur sonata. Miss Meyer has a thorough knowledge of music, also the distinctive characteristics of the indispensable artistic temperament. When playing Chopin, it became evident that she has much intensive study before her in order to make her success on the concert stage certain.</p>
