   <p>The proverb: "Competition is the soul of business," can be very well applied to professional musicians also. Chicago's music lovers have become aware of their good fortune in the person of Mr. Liesegang that splendid orchestra leader whose perseverance has created greater understanding and enthusiasm for better music among the concert going public. The capacity audiences attending the concerts at Brand Halle are a splendid testimony that the task has been accomplished. Yesterday's concert was an outstanding one of the present season; a distinguished audience acknowledged a distinguished conductor and his orchestra. With the exception of Liszt's Rhapsody No. 2, it was an all Wagner program.... At the conclusion of the concert the applause was so persistent that the orchestra was compelled to give an encore.</p>
