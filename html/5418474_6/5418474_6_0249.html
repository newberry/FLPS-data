   <p>We are glad to report that the Socialist soldier clubs have good sense, and that they realize that a deliberate flaunting of the law and disobedience to constituted authority are likely to bring about a clash which the Socialists cannot avoid, and, in such an encounter the results might be disastrous to the Socialists themselves.</p>
   <p>Instead of appearing tomorrow in full numbers and armed, the Socialists preferred to exclude all reporters, and yesterday selected ten men, under command of Socialist Lieutenant Bielefeldt, who marched from the Turnhalle Vorwaerts (Forward Turner Hall) unto the street to provide a test case, so that the constitutionality of the militia law might be questioned. The militia law, as will be remembered, prohibits the existence of armed, military societies not connected with the state militia.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant Callahan, of the Twelfth Street police station, waited at the Turnhalle for the return of ten armed communists, or rather, agreed with <span class="page-break">\2</span>Lieutenant Bielefeldt, leader of the ten men, that Bielefeldt should consider himself under arrest, and appear at the Madison Street police station in the morning.</p>
   <p>Bielefeldt, conforming to the agreement, went to the police station in the morning, saw Judge Walsh, and asked for a change of venue, so that the case was entered on Judge Morrisson's court calendar for four o'clock in the afternoon. Bielefeldt gave bond of one hundred dollars. The charge is violation of the militia law.</p>
   <p>The program was that Bielefeldt should plead guilty, go to jail and have the case transferred to the criminal court, where Attorney Rubens would ask for a habeas corpus in order to bring the affair to a rapid conclusion.</p>
   <p>But matters took a different turn; the city officials were not satisfied with that arrangement. The arrest of only one person did not appear to be sufficient to regard the incident as noncompliance with the law, and therefore the whole affair was postponed until Monday, so that all participants might be present.</p>
