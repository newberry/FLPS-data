   <p>A year ago the German Savings Bank was born, and so vigorous has it proved to be that it has grown like no other savings bank either here or elsewhere. It has left its New York namesakes - that is to say - in their first stages of development far behind it, both in number of depositors and in the sum-total of deposits.</p>
   <p>The deposits amounted to:</p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <td>$141,005</td>
     <td>on</td>
     <td>November 1, 1870</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>274,231</td>
     <td>"</td>
     <td>February 1, 1871</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>346,702</td>
     <td>"</td>
     <td>May 1, 1871</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>504,537</td>
     <td>"</td>
     <td>August 1, 1871</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>that is to say, to more than half a million, and what is no less important, they were contributed by 2,780 depositors. The German Savings Bank in New York had after nine months of its existence only 1,900 depositors, and $232,000 deposited.</p>
   <p>Such a success proves that the enterprise is built on names that inspire unusual confidence, and also proves the extraordinary business experience of Mr. Henry Greenebaum, who has been able to win as shareholders and <span class="page-break">2</span>directors men who know how to gain recognition for the new bank in the widest circles.</p>
