   <p>p. 4.. A critic of the Frankfurter Zeitung, (Newspaper of Frankfurt, Germany,) visited our World's Fair and in his article about one music program at the Festival Hall, given in honor of Infanta Eulalia (of Spain) expressed himself as follows: "The orchestra of 140 members, under the direction of Theodore Thomas, played so superbly, that one forgot the Atlantic Ocean which separates us from the good music of our fatherland."</p>
   <p>The same authority gives the following encomiums about a concert at the music hall of the Exposition: "The Thomas orchestra played Schumann selections. The high light was the A-Minor Concerto for piano and orchestra. The renowned and honored pianist, Mrs. Fanny Bloomfield-Zeisler of Chicago played her score with artistic perfection and such emotion that the public responded with tempestuous approval, though the same composition was heard only a few weeks ago, when Paderewski played it.</p>
   <p>What an agreeable surprise to discover our musical Chicago at the World's Fair!</p>
