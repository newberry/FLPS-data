   <p>The offerings by Chicago's musical organizations are just as versatile as those offered by the musical centers of Europe, keeping pace in quality also. Identified as such in first place is the Thomas Symphony Orchestra, performing every Friday afternoon, and repeating the program Saturday night, all through the winter season. The large attendance, and the impossibility to comply with the demand for admission tickets, led to the plan for an additional weekly concert. This orchestra was founded by the late Mr. Theodor Thomas, now under the able leadership of Frederick Stock, a young musician of extraordinary talent. The organization is composed of Chicago musicians of great ability, to a large extent, and the fact alone that they are members of the Thomas Orchestra is proof that they are artists.</p>
   <p>Appearing as soloists with the orchestra occasionally are such stars in the musical firmament as: Josef Hofmann, Mischa Elmann, Mme. Schumann-Heink, and many other vocalists and instrumentalists of world fame.</p>
   <p>Another very popular orchestra bears the name of Mr. Martin Ballmann, the former distinguished flutist of the Thomas orchestra. This organization has endeared itself to the Germans as well as the American population of the city, which frequents the Sunday afternoon concerts. It is arranged by the Chicago Turn Community and presented at the North Side Turner Hall.</p>
   <p>Numerous famed artists, among whom are pianists, violinists, vocalists, and others, are heard frequently in concert or recital halls, carrying away with them the plaudits of their audiences, and the rich remuneration of their contracts. The higher type of choral singing is cultivated by the Mendelssohn and the Apollo Musical Societies, also by the recently founded Chicago Singing Society.....The operatic attempts up to last year were rather modest. In one or two weeks of guest performances by the New York Opera Company the admission prices were enormously high. Neither were the presentations always up to one's expectation. These were the principal factors leading to the creation of Chicago's own opera company, which opened its first season in the Auditorium Theatre last winter. The wide interest and the excellent success have proven that Chicagoans appreciate the opera, and are willing to support its own opera during a ten week winter season. The management of the company is entrusted to Mr. Andreas Dippel, while its musical director is Mr. Cleofonte Campanini. Soloists, orchestra, choir, and scenery, are above any criticism. The repertoire of the past season consisted of works by French and Italian composers, but none by the German, much to the consternation of the large German population of our city. However, Mr. Dippel indicated that German composers will be included in the repertoire of the coming season. Chamber music is well represented by the Beethoven Trio, and other superior organizations of this city.</p>
   <p>Musical colleges are numerous in Chicago, the best known, however, is the Chicago Musical College, founded by Doctor Florenz Ziegfeld more than forty years ago. This institution has gained a national reputation. There is also the equally reputable American Conservatory of Music, directed by Doctor Hattstaedt, the Cosmopolitan School of Music, and the Institute for Dramatic Art, each one equipped with an excellent staff of instructors.</p>
   <p>Most prominent in musical circles are, of course, the German people. That nation is well represented by artists in concert halls, in theatres, and as teachers of music. The cultivation and perpetuation of the German song is the pleasant duty of our singing societies.</p>
   <p>The founding of the Chicago Singing Society in the autumn of 1909 was the most important event in the history of German choir societies. And it was greatly appreciated by the public of our city. The two hundred members of this organization are singers with excellently trained voices. They can, therefore, arrange programs of musical masterpieces, because the usual difficulties encountered are no longer a barrier to them. Highly praise-worthy is also the humanitarian side of this association, upon which principle the organization has been built, namely; the furtherance of German charitable and benevolent institutions. The proceeds derived from concerts are turned over to these types of institutions, and thus far, the German Old People's Home, and the German Hospital have been mentioned as beneficiaries.....No better conductor could have been selected for this fine organization than Mr. W. Boeppler; he is the right man in the right place.....</p>
   <p>The German drama however, does not have the expected response and cooperation from the public, a fact for which manifold explanations are offered. However, one thing is certain, namely; the various managements of that institution have committed error after error, quite void of the ability to eliminate the cause. The history of the German drama in Chicago began in the year 1850, or thereabouts, when the German Male Chorus produced a play occasionally..... The German drama was finally permanently established in a theatre at Clybourn Avenue, near Division Street. Having been destroyed by the fire of 1871, it re-opened at the Vorwaerts Turn Hall in 1872. Performances were also given at the Globe Theatre, under the direction of Alexander Wurster and Gustav Ostermann. The first mentioned management gave elegant presentations in all parts of the city, but collapsed in the attempt to install performances every day of the week.</p>
   <p>A new company headed by Emil Hoechster was successfully operating at the McVicker Theatre all through the 1880-81 season. During the ensuing period 1882-87, managers have changed quite frequently. Wurster was the first at its helm, succeeded by Georg Isenstein and Julius Collmer, and again alternately by Isenstein and Isenstein &amp; Selig, with no marked success, either financially or from the artistic standpoint. To redeem the German drama, Director Selig combined with the management of the Pabst Theatre of Milwaukee, and thus became dependable to a certain extent upon the German Theatre of that city. Sunday performances were then given by the Wachsner company in Chicago, from September to April, inclusively. And all went smoothly and serene during the life-time of Mr. Wachsner. Superior presentations with superb artists were offered, and the classical, as well as the modern works, composed a very interesting repertoire.....However, upon the sudden death of Wachsner, the Germans of Chicago again lost interest in the drama until the plan for continuance had to be abandoned.....The company, deserving highest praise, gave its farewell performance April last. Their excellent work will remain a pleasant memory for years to come....The fact that the German element of Chicago is not sufficiently interested in the maintenance of their own theatre, is, of course, a blot not easily removed in the promotion of art. But another eager promoter of drama has come forward, leasing the Criterion Theater for his future presentations. He is Director Max Hanisch, who has the best wishes of every theater-goer toward his undertaking.....</p>
