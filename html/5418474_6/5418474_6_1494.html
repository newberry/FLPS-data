   <p>Our old home has given quite a number of well known musicians to our adopted country, among them, the musical director Joseph Koestner, who to many friends of radio music has not been a stranger. Maybe not quite as well known as Walter Damrosch, whom even the schoolchildren of this country know well by his name and his language, because they heard him many times when he made his pleasant musical explanations during the children's hour. They also know him by his pictures. A picture of him shown sitting at the piano, appeared lately in this paper.</p>
   <p>Today another music master should be remembered: Joseph Koestner, who as a very small boy liked to tinkle on his father's piano.</p>
   <p>This piano stood in Willersdorf, where little Joseph was born and received his first musical education. His was a musical family: father Koestner was a music teacher and organist; the mother a virtuoso on the zither, and <span class="page-break">2</span>the uncle no less than Felix Mottle whom everybody knew in Munich, if he ever passed the State Opera house.</p>
   <p>At the age of four years little Joseph received his first instructions on the piano from his father, at the age of six, he was the proud possessor of his first violin. Then came twelve years of serious studies at the Leipsic Conservatory, a hard time for the young artist, because after the death of his father, he had to help support his family. Later he became acquainted with Otto Lohse. This brought to him welcome opportunity to get a knowledge of the operatic department. Further he became acquainted with our Frederic Stock, through whom Koestner, who in the meantime had become a well-known virtuoso, got in touch with Claire Dix, that world renowned singer, who engaged him to be her piano accompanist on her concert tours. Still later he was engaged as concert master for the Balaban &amp; Katz theatres. Soon he became the National Broadcasting Company Orchestra's musical director. He is one of those on whom the Germans can look with pride as on a man who has made a name for himself in the musical world.</p>
