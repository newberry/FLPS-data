   <p>A limited number of shares, par value $100, fully paid and nonassessable, may be procured at $25 [per share] from the undersigned, in order to obtain the necessary working capital.</p>
   <p>The Company owns twenty-two silver mines in the Globe District, Arizona, the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>richest silver district in the world. Mr. A. C. Hesing personally investigated the mines and convinced himself of their value. He will be pleased to give any information that is desired.</p>
   <p>The contracts for the ore-crusher and smelting works, as well as all necessary machinery, were given to Fraser and Chalmers of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The equipment is being built under the personal supervision of the Company's engineer, Mr. Weberling, and will be sent to Globe City as soon as it is completed. A large quantity of rich ore has already been mined and is ready for the smelting works. The reports from the mines show beyond doubt that the stock will pay large dividends within a short time, and will reach the par-value level. Information and a prospectus may be obtained from Wasmansdorff and Heinemann, 165 East Randolph Street.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. C. Hesing has ore samples of all the mines at his office, Room 33, Staats-Zeitung Building, and the display may be inspected at any time.</p>
