   <p>The owners of various music halls in the North Side have been given a severe blow by the edict of Inspector Max Heidelmeyer. The new police ruling demands a cessation of musical offerings, and ladies without escorts will not be tolerated. The order was enforced yesterday evening at 8 o'clock, the usual time when music halls on Wells and Clark Streets are filled. The owners of the places were indignant and refused to comply when detectives Wally and Sederberg informed them of the ruling. When threatened with arrest, however, they acceded but declared that they will protest to Mayor Harrison. All women seated at tables and drinking without the "protection" of an escort, were compelled to brave the inclement weather, and their chagrin was heightened by the additional commands of the inspector, who had instructed the police to arrest all "single" ladies who congregate at street corners.</p>

   <p>Inspector Heidelmeyer asserted that the beer gardens in Lakeview, where respectable citizens gather to enjoy music, will not be affected by the order, but the tavern-keepers whose establishments have an unsavory reputation, cannot expect mercy.</p>
   <p>One music hall proprietor considered the affair as unimportant. Last year similar efforts were on the calendar, but the Mayor issues new licenses, regardless of such interferences.</p>
