   <p>We have already published a survey of the proposed changes in the charter of Chicago which have been made by certain interests. We cannot but wish that this agitation were more general in character, and that the bills which we published in outline, could be printed in full and submitted to the public, so that public opinion, the deciding judge, could have opportunity for expression.</p>
   <p>In the final analysis the people of Chicago are the ones who are most interested in the nature of the changes, and no alterations should be made without their express consent. Such a procedure would make it clear that the changes were undertaken for the benefit of the whole city, rather than only in the interest of certain individuals.</p>
