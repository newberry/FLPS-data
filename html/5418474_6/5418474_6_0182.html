   <p>One of the saddest sights of social misery in the modern big cities manifests itself in the presence of thousands of little newsboys who can be noticed wherever there is some heavier traffic.</p>
   <p>Anyone unused to city life will be surprised at the large number of these little boys who represent the middleman between the press and public.</p>
   <p>The products of the capitalistic press would not yield such big profits, some even could not exist without those little children who are forced to sacrifice their youth and health while their more lucky contemporaries have a chance to go to school and prepare for a better future as well as enjoy their life while studying.</p>
   <p>The real newsboys are at the same time bootblacks encountering heavy competition in this line - you can see four to five on every street corner in a business district.</p>
   <p>Their esprit de corps and honesty is extremely high. The most dangerous aspect of the business of a newsboy is the climbing up and down of the cable cars while in motion. Accidents happen frequently and no time is lost to bring these orphans to <span class="page-break">\2</span>the morgue or to the county hospital for study purposes. If he should survive, there is another cripple on the street trying the same business. Hundreds of cripples are thus thrown yearly on the streets.</p>
   <p>Although no statistics are available it is certain that two-thirds of all news-boys are morally going to the dogs and if they should not be lucky in securing a job as an errand boy in some business by the age of fifteen or sixteen the majority end either in the reform schools or jails.</p>
