   <p>A good German bookstore with a sufficient capital to secure a good number of the most recent publications to enable the German reading public to keep abreast with the trends of modern German literature, has been a need long felt here in Chicago. The bookstore of Floto and Meininger seems to be on the way to fill this need. Good German bookstores are essential to the development of the German population in this city. We wish the best success to the enterprise of Floto and Meininger.</p>
