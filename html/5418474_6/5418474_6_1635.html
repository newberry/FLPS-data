   <p>The first number was played by the violinist, E. Schmidt, and his brilliant performance was enthusiastically applauded. According to the statements of his friends, the artist was a student of the great Joachim for three years. He will certainly become famous with his art...</p>
   <p>The audience also became acquainted with E. Harford, a great singer, who recently finished her studies in Leipzig, Germany. Her alto voice is exceedingly rich and well modulated and she masters it completely. She sings with deep emotion, and therefore, affects the hearers overwhelmingly.</p>
