   <p>The Wirthsverein (Tavern Keepers' Association) met yesterday afternoon and was finally called to order at 2:45 P. M. by Mr. Feldkamp, the chairman. The minutes of the last session were read.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wassermann objected to the acceptance of the report of the last session, because it is stated therein that he still has $7.47 which has not been paid to the treasurer. For this reason Wassermann asks for another inspection of the books. Mr. Wassermann's motion was approved and the report was accepted as read, with the exception of the aforementioned item.</p>
   <p>Several gentlemen became members of the Association.....</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Schmidt was requested to turn in his collections but he declared that he lost the book and was not able to obtain a single cent.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wassermann said the proper business procedure would be to submit the matter to the committee on legal affairs for an investigation and made a motion accordingly. Adolph Mueller dissented. Mr. Wassermann's motion was almost unanimously accepted.</p>
   <p>The committee on legal affairs was then asked to give its report and the following statement was made: The bill for abolition of pool licenses was presented to the City Council by Alderman Jonas and referred to the committee on licenses; Mr. [Harry] Rubens [the association's attorney] drafted the bills about pool playing involving minors, two different measures, and brought them to the attention of the City Council's legal board.</p>
   
   <p>Peter Mueller favored energetic proceedings against the pool license ordinance and moved that the tavern keepers not pay license fees until further action has been taken.</p>
   <p>Mr. Baum moved that such a resolution be published in the German and English language papers. A. Mueller was opposed to it. Peter Mueller's motion was accepted.</p>
   <p>Mr. Feldkamp then addressed the assembly. He said that it was regrettable that the Association's attorney spoke against the nomination of Judge Kaufmann as justice of the peace.</p>
   <p>P. Mueller: "Judge Kaufmann always proved a supporter of our interests and therefore it appears incredible that Mr. Rubens should have expressed himself so thoughtlessly and in a manner contrary to the intentions of the Association!"</p>
   <p>Mr. Langenhagen moved that the committee on legal matters be instructed to look into the affair. The motion was accepted and the president requested the committee to take prompt action.</p>
   <p>The Report of the Election Committee</p>
   <p>The first session of the committee was held at 247 West Randolph Street. A delegation of three gentlemen, Messrs. B. Baum, L. Schwuchow, and John Feldkamp, was nominated to interview the three mayoral candidates and ask the following questions:</p>
   <p>1) If you are elected mayor of Chicago, would you revoke a saloonkeeper's license, if the latter is accused of having transgressed the law in regard to the sale of intoxicants to minors and it is disclosed subsequently that such a defendant has not intentionally disregarded the legal provisions?</p>
   <p>2) Would you allow the Sunday ordinance to pass?</p>
   <p>3) Would you favor the twelve o'clock closing provision?</p>
   <p>Besides, it was decided to nominate three committees to interview all the aldermen.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Baum and Joe Miehle were selected for the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth wards.</p>
   <p>Messrs. Feldkamp and Schwuchow will see the aldermen of the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth wards.</p>
   <p>For the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Sixteenth, Seventeenth, and Eighteenth wards Messrs. A. Mueller and A. Engelhardt were chosen.</p>
   <p>The report further stated that the respective committees had performed their labors properly, obtained statements from Wright and Harrison, as well as the various aldermanic candidates, and the Association may now decide whether a complete report of the various candidates' answers is now in order. The question was asked why the committee did not seek to ascertain the views of Dr. Ernst Schmidt, the Socialist candidate for mayor. The committee replied that it considered such an interview superfluous, as Dr. Schmidt, is "all right" in so far as the aforesaid problems and human values are concerned.</p>
   <p>The next step was to decide whom the Association should recommend as mayoral candidate.</p>
   <p>Peter Mueller declared himself in favor of Dr. E. Schmidt, even before it was decided whether the replies of the various candidates should be given to the assembly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bruder, the secretary, declared previously, however, that a complete report of the interviews should not be expected, because the meetings proved to be very voluble affairs and he was not able to record all that was said, but Harrison gave ample answers, and while Wright gave candid, satisfying replies, he refused to commit himself in writing.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wassermann's motion, supported by Schwuchow, advocated that the report of the mayoral candidates should be accepted without being read, and that every member should vote according to his own discretion. Mr. Cortes objected; he wanted to know what the candidates had to say.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wassermann's motion was voted on and was accepted by a large majority, chiefly because it justified the assertion that it would be an endless affair if the various members were to give their personal views about each candidate.</p>
   <p>The chairman, however, did not refrain from expressing his regrets, as it appeared to him that the Association does not care to have a lucid under-standing in such an important matter.</p>
   <p>A rather lively scene ensued when Mr. Schwuchow raised a point of order and told the president that no debate can be tolerated after a motion is accepted, and that the Association, not the chairman, decides the issues.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Engelhardt moved that the report about the aldermen [aldermanic opinions] should also be accepted without discussion.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wassermann objected strenuously and declared that everything possible should be done to eliminate all aldermanic candidates who are inimical to the interests of the Wirthsverein. It is the duty of the Association to preserve its interests, he said, and therefore he offered an amendment to the motion, that "we shall declare our opposition unequivocally" to all candidates who are shown by the committee's report to be unsatisfactory.</p>
   <p>Dixon's candidacy--for alderman of the First Ward-met with serious opposition, and P. Mueller's suggestion to put the name on the black list was approved.</p>
   <p>Mr. Baum spoke against Ballard, candidate in the Second Ward, and the name was stricken.</p>
   <p>No objections were raised against the aldermanic candidates in the Third and Fourth wards.</p>
   <p>In the Fifth and Sixth wards all candidates seem satisfactory, while Gardner is objected to by the Wirthsverein. (Mr. Gardner withdrew, and Mr. Schmelz was nominated instead.)</p>
   <p>The Eighth and Ninth wards gave no cause for disapproval.</p>
   <p>The Temperance advocate, Lorenz of the Tenth Ward, is not to be given aid.</p>
   <p>The candidates in the Eleventh and Twelfth wards deserve the support of the Association.</p>
   <p>Thompson of the Thirteenth Ward was relegated to the black list, while the candidates of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth wards met with the approval of the Wirthsverein.</p>
   <p>Schweisthal of the Sixteenth Ward and Barrett of the Seventeenth Ward must be fought. The Eighteenth Ward nominated good candidates.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wassermann moved that the saloonkeepers hold a meeting, prior to the election, in all wards having undesirable candidates, to determine ways and means of combating them.</p>
   <p>Mr. Philipp Maas suggested that an appeal incorporating the aforesaid idea be published in the newspapers.</p>
   <p>A. Mueller in a fervent speech elaborated on the scheme and advocated the printing of posters, circulars and so forth; that the money earmarked for election purposes should be used to defray the expense.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wassermann's motion did not pass.</p>
   <p>A. Mueller's motion to publicize in the Tribune, Times, and the German papers the names of all candidates on the black list, was accepted.</p>
   <p>A. Mueller made a motion, which was accepted, that a publicity committee of seven members be appointed. The old election committee was chosen for the purpose.</p>
   <p>Another motion specified that the money ($200) still in the possession of Mr. Baum, be transferred to the publicity committee. A prolonged argument ensued, but finally the measure was adopted.</p>
   
   <p>The newspaper question became an issue once more and it was definitely decided that the committee was to proceed according to its own discretion, and write the announcements, including the black list.</p>
   <p>Peter Mueller made a short address favoring the Socialist candidate for corporation counsel, Harry Rubens, and declared that the gentleman deserved the support of the Association.</p>
   <p>After it had considered several other matters, of minor importance, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
