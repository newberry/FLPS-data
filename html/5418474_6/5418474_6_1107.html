   <p>At his home, 423 Wellington St., Hermann W. Arnold died yesterday at the ripe old age of 82 years. He was one of the oldest settlers of Chicago and had always taken an active part in the meat industry. He was the founder of the well known wholesale packing firm of Arnold Bros. on W. Randolph St.</p>
   <p>A stroke ended his life, and brought him relief from pain and suffering. He fell out of bed last Friday and suffered a double fracture of the hips.</p>
   <p>Mr. Arnold was born in Guden, near Berlin on June 20, 1844. As a lad, he learned the butcher business there. When scarcely 15 years old, he emigrated to America. He was for a time a butcher in Mendota, Ill., but came to Chicago in 1859. A few years later he founded, with his brothers, Adolph and Theodore, the wholesale butcher business, which grew rapidly and became one of the best known in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In the year 1870 he married Christine Muller. Of this very happy union one son was born, Adolph Arnold, who is now managing the large business.</p>
   
   <p>The deceased took a great interest in the German element. He promoted all German efforts and belonged to a number of societies like the Orpheus Men's Chorus, the Suabian club and the Lessing Lodge of the Free Masons.</p>
   <p>The funeral will take place tomorrow afternoon, 2 o'clock, from St. Paul's church, Orchard St. and Kemper Pl. to Graceland cemetery. Pastor Rudolph John will preach the funeral sermon.</p>
