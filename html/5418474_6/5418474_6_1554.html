   <p>The Muewzer trio, Hans Muewzer, violin, Hans Koelbel cello, and Rudolf Wagner, piano, opened yesterday in the Kimball Hall, its 1924-25 season, before a fairly large audience. The artistic success was again extraordinarily large. Not only were the laymen among the audience enthused, but also the numerous professional musicians, music-critics, etc., were highly satisfied.</p>
   <p>The program contained only three numbers, but to overcome these three, was a giants task. Two still living composers were heard, Bossi and Graener, of whom the former is not very well known here, the latter is fully unknown, and last Cesar Frank. The concert was opened with Bossi's Trio Sinfonico, a serious work, a miniature symphony of great volume.</p>
