   <p>Throughout the enormous establishment of "The Fair", department store owned by E. J. Lehmann and Company, an excellent spring exhibition has dazzled the eyes of every visitor. The store was gorgeously decorated with flowers and plants of every description, which were placed on sale, Wednesday, at a very much reduced price. The kind hearted, spirited E. J. Lehmann donated the sum derived from this sale to the "Altenheim" (Old People's Home) by sending to the Treasurer, Mr. Buhler, the identical money obtained for the purchases, the gift amounting to $426.73. Great appreciation was expressed to Mr. Lehmann by the Board of Directors of the "Altenheim" of which E. J. Lehmann is a member. Every German can be proud of a citizen ever ready to help where charity is needed.</p>
