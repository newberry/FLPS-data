   <p>Last Saturday, November 19, the German Art Society celebrated its fall festival in the Oriental Room of the Knickerbocker Hotel. The attendance was good, and the jovial atmosphere held the guests together until the early morning hours.</p>
   <p>The committee, under the leadership of Herr Wilhelm Heidke, planned the festival to the smallest detail, all in an effort to make the evening as pleasant as possible for the guests. Among the guests were Vice-Consul Strack, from the German Consulate General, and Herr Schoebel of the Austrian Consulate, both of whom escorted their wives.</p>
   <p>The introductory feature of the evening was particularily beautiful. Surrounded by eight society ladies attired in colorful autumn costumes, the crown of harvest was brought in. The dances, performed by pupils from Madame Ludwig's Dancing School were excellent, especially the Shawl Dance, by Miss Betty Jane Gray, and the Carioca.</p>
   <p>All in all, there was reason to be satisfied with the evening; it was a gratifying introduction into the winter season.</p>
