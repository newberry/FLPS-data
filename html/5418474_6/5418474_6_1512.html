   <p>Leo Fall's operetta "The Jolly Peasant" proved to be a great success.</p>
   <p>"The Jolly Peasant," music by Leo Fall and libretto by Victor Leon, was presented yesterday, afternoon and evening. This piece is too well known for anything to be said about it. However, the music, under the direction of Waldemar Christoph, was well executed.</p>
