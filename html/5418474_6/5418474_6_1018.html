   <p>In De Berges Hall, 625 N. Clark Street, five young German Dentists celebrated the successful termination of their examination at the German American Dental College, An introductory piano selection by Mr. Beseler was followed by Dr. Brunhoff, one of the docents, who gave a lecture about the developments of Dentistry whereupon Dr. George Schaller awarded the diplomas. Dr. Guttmann of Breslan delivered the farewell address, in which he gave great credit to his excellent teachers. Mr. Guttmann leaves our city somewhat reluctantly, since he made many friends; besides, he is greatful for the education he obtained here.</p>
   <p>Several, very appropriate speeches, songs and music gave added spice to the dinner which followed. Student jokes, humorous songs, recitations of serious and jovial nature, terminated the festive celebration.</p>
