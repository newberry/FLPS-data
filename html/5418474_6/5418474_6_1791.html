   <p>A work of art which has been ordered by a well known citizen for the grave of a beloved relative is now nearing completion at the sculptural establishment of Mr. Franz Engelmann. It is a statue of St. Elizabeth, larger than life-size. The clay model which has just been finished, shows the Saint as the regent, a splendid figure of aristocratic bearing, holding a loaf of bread in one hand and with the other gathering the folds of her dress which contains a profusion of roses.. The expression of the lovely face and the mild pious eyes is indeed devine, the figure and the enshrouding drapery with its folds, the work of a master. Mr. Engelmann will become well-known as a result of this achievement, which will be executed in white Massachusetts granited by Mr. E. Burkhardt. It is to be mounted on a nine foot substructure, hewn from grey granite. Beyond doubt, it will be the most beautiful and artistic monument that ever graced a grave in Chicago Of course, the artist is not a novice, he is a pupil of the well-known German Sculptor, Prof. Karl Kauer, and of Prof. Volz of Karlsruhe. Mr. Engelmann was awarded the first Student prize, in recognition for his plans and sketches of mausoleum for a family at Mannheim. He came to America 1Â½ years ago, and modelled the statue "The Emigrant" for a New York building, then the "Goddess of Liberty", a 14 ft. Figure for the Capitol of Texas. He is now located in Chicago.... his studio and workshop are at the S. W. Corner of State and Monroe Streets.</p>
