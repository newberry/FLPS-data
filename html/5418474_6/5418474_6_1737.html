   <p>The second act of Weber(s "Freischutz" will be given tonight in Hooley's Opera House, with Mrs. Pappenheim as Agathe. She will also appear as Leonore in the second and fourth acts of "Troubadour". The sale of tickets was very good yesterday. This proves, that the public although still resentful due to the lack of consideration shown last Friday, does not wish nevertheless to miss the wonderful singing of Mrs. Pappenheim. Today's representation promises to be a very excellent one indeed.</p>
