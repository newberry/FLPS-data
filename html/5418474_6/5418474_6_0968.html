   <p>After a long life of blessed activity, Pastor Ferdinand Doederlein died at the age of eighty one years and six months. The deceased, born in Bavaria, descended from an old ecclesiastical family. His great grandfather baptized him eighty one years ago. After completing his gymnasium and university studies the young preacher came to America. He devoted his first activity to the Indians, and took over a congregation in Missouri where he married Miss Magdalene Nitschke, the daughter of the first teacher of languages at the first academy of the Missouri Synod. Several years afterward he received a call to the Trinity congregation in Chicago as preacher. Having done a great deal to benefit the congregation he left this post after eleven years to take over a congregation in Homewood, Illinois. Five years ago he suffered a stroke, and as the climate there did not agree with him he resigned, and returned to Chicago where he became an assistant Pastor of his son in law, Dietz, in the Concordia congregation.</p>
