   <p>The Well-Known Veteran of German Songa Dies in Bridgman.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karl von Wolfskeel, veteran of German songs in America, an able musician and well-known society leader, died after a long and severe illness at his country estate in Bridgman, Michigan, at the age of 63 years. Although the news of the death of this popular and esteemed conductor did not come as a surprise, it nevertheless affected the Chicago singers, among whom he had been a prominent figure for more than a quarter of a century. Karl von Wolfskeel was born in Munich, Germany, where he attended school and started on a military career, which he later gave up to devote himself entirely to music. After finishing his musical studies, he came to America and settled in Chicago, where, after becoming a music teacher, he was active as a leader of singing societies.</p>
   <p>He twirled the baton at the Ariou Men's Chorus for 28 years, until his illness compelled him to retire. He was also the leader of the following singing societies: Mozart Men's Chorus, Concordia Liedertafel, The Bakers Singing <span class="page-break">2</span>Society, Harlem Men's Chorus of Forest Park, Singing section of the German War veterans Society of Chicago; conductor of the women choir Lyra, Edelweiss-Northside, Pollymnia, and the Harlem Women Choir of Forest Park. At the Northwest and North-American Singers union he was similarly well known and popular, not only for his musical talent but also for his personality, not to mention his manly intervention in behalf of German singing, which won him many friends.</p>
   <p>His widow and a son survive him. Karl von Wolfskeel had also many friends in Masonic circles, being a member of the circle himself.</p>
