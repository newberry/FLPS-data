   <p>The Supreme Court has delivered a decision which is indeed a very regrettable one. The case in question had reference to the liability of a railroad company for an employee, who through the carelessness of another worker was very badly injured.</p>
   <p>A fireman of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, received injuries through the neglect of the engineer. In such cases the laws of Ohio provide that an employee can sue for damages. Some other states have similar laws, as, for instance, Indiana, Colorado, Georgia, and others, but, until now, we do not have such a law in all states, nor have we a federal liability act.</p>
   <p>Since the defendant in this case is a Maryland corporation, a federal court in Ohio proceeded with the lawsuit, and advised the jury to decide in favor of the plaintiff, if his injury was sustained by neglect or carelessness of another employee, under whose supervision the injured was placed. This is the law in Ohio, where the injury occurred.</p>
   <p>Now, the Supreme Court steps in and declares that according to a decision of fifty years ago, the court is not obliged to follow a local interpretation of the law if the case concerns a thing or property not permanently located at any one place, as, for instance, real estate property, which is permanent. The Supreme Court stated also that this decision is based upon national law, which has not been amended. Judge Brewer, who read the decision, continued: "This court adhered steadily to the opinion that the relation of a railroad company to its employee is a matter of federal and not of state laws, and if we investigate the nature of things, we will arrive at the conclusion that this interpretation is right. The huge business of transportation managed by the railroad companies of today is indeed an interstate affair, irrespective of what it may have been formerly. Is it possible that a railroad company then is subject to different laws of the different states through which it passes, in regard to its rights, liabilities, and duties toward their employees?..... The case in question is subject to federal laws and this court is not required to uphold the decisions of the courts of the states."</p>
   <p>Fortunately, this is not an unanimous opinion of the Supreme Court. Chief Justice Fuller and Judge Field deviated in their decisions. The former pointed out that this decision over emphasizes the non-liability of the railroads; and the latter declared that the general law is simply that which the individual judge at the time thinks it should be..... He also considered as indefensible, the opinion that the fireman subjected himself voluntarily to the neglect of another by accepting this job. The fireman is obliged to obey orders. What would happen if he were at liberty to leave the train, whenever he thought that the orders of the engineer and of the conductor were wrong?</p>
   <p>It is deplorable that the majority of the judges agreed with Mr. Brewer, and not with Mr. Field, because it furnishes a fresh impetus to the general opinion that the Supreme Court is inclined to be against labor, and in favor of monopolies and corporations. Although the Supreme Court upholds the power of the State otherwise, as, for instance, the prohibition laws, it nullifies the same, when railroad companies are the beneficiaries.</p>
   <p>The railroad employee is entitled to the protection of his life and health against the carelessness of his fellow-worker.</p>
   <p>If this decision of the Supreme Court cannot be repealed, then it becomes imperative that Congress make a law which holds the railroad companies responsible for the neglect of their employees..... It is now clear that the laws of the states are useless for the protection of railroad employees; therefore, it is the sacred duty of Congress to make immediate provision for their protection.</p>
