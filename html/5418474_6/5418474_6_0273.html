   <p>Mayor Harrison promised to be the best mayor Chicago ever had. If he is serious, he must consider the just demands of the people, whether they live in palaces or hovels. Our fellow citizens who cannot afford bathing facilities in their own homes, now demand the right to perform their ablutions in the lake. For the sake of propriety as well as morality, and in order that elegant ladies who might be looking from their homes near the shore may not be offended by the sight of naked men and youngsters, the people now demand that bathhouses be erected which may be used free of charge.</p>
   <p>The former City Council denied an appropriation for constructing bathhouses, because a Socialist favored the measure. Several aldermen informed the writer that the overwhelming defeat of the bill was solely because Stauber sponsored it but that need not prevent the mayor from building bathhouses on our beaches. During the years 1873 and 1874, the City Council set aside two thousand dollars <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>a year, hence a total of four thousand dollars, for bathhouses.</p>
   <p>Tax collections during these same years were gathered with difficulty; the poor landowners paid, but the wealthy resorted to litigation, and obtained a revocation of the total tax levy. Now, tax levies have been upheld on the strength of a recent law, and a steady flow of money enters the city coffers.</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison need only declare that four thousand dollars of the tax money received for the years 1873 and 1874 shall be used to construct bathhouses, and no law can prevent him from doing this. After all, he would only act in conformance to public sentiment.</p>
