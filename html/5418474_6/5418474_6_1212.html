   <p>The Chicago Inn-keepers Society met last night at Prager's Hall. The function of President fell to Mr. Berger. The meeting was well attended. After the regular business routine Mr. Harry Rubens was again appointed attorney for the Society. Thereafter, the "high license" question was brought up for discussion. It was proposed to join the Citizens Society, but this did not meet with approval. Carl Herzog proposed to appoint a committee of five persons whose duty it would be to agitate for the retention of present license fee. This was accepted and Messrs. Joseph Mickle, Carl Herzog, John Feldkamp, John Rheinwald and Cornelius Hau appointed members of the committee. It was suggested that inn-keepers provide their customers with printed orders for liquors which shall be used in case a minor was sent for it. Joseph Mickle proposed to discuss the increasing price of beer.</p>
   <p>Some maintained, and some denied, that it was due to an anti-German feeling on the part of some of the brewers. No definite action was decided upon. Mr. Oster proposed in conclusion not to pay over $8.00 per barrel of beer, which was unanimously accepted.</p>
