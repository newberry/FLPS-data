   <p>In the Epworth Hotel, corner of 59th Street and Monroe Avenue, the first session of the 23rd German Teacher's Day took place. Already in the morning the delegates, about 150, arrived from all parts of the country. The most represented were the cities; Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Dayton, Springfield, Illinois, Newark, N.Y., New York and St. Louis. The meeting was opened with a greeting address by Mr. Martin Schmidthofer, the President of the local committee. He excused first the local organization, for the poor preparations for the reception of the visiting teachers, and pointed then to the importance of these German-American Teacher Days which proves all the more necessary, as in several cities like St. Paul, Cleveland and right here in Chicago the nativitism current becomes overwhelming. After Mr. W. H. Weik of Cincinnati, President of the Teacher's Alliance spoke for a firm co-operation of the German teachers abd opposition to nativism.</p>
