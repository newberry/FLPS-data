   <p>"Nothing succeeds like success" can be appropriately applied to the Women's Congress which was concluded yesterday, and which was a success in every respect. It was aimed to portray, in a large frame, an entire picture of the various endeavors of women, and to bring together the most eminent and outstanding representatives of women's movements from every part of the world. The congress succeeded in this aim. It was planned by women, managed by women and carried on to its final success by women. The whole affair furnished the irrefutable evidence that women are capable of planning and executing great things.</p>
   
   <p>Whatever may be our attitude toward the desire of women for political equality with men, we can not deny them the recognition that they devote themselves fully and willingly to the task they have undertaken, and that their activities in many fields of endeavor are a blessing and a benefit to humanity. Again, it must be admitted that the lectures and addresses given at the Congress were evidences of expert knowledge and high learning, equal in every respect to similar public utterances and speeches by men.</p>
   <p>It cannot be derogatory to their general recognition, if women often expand their activities into certain realms, although they should not do so, according to the opinions of many. In this respect they only imitate men.</p>
   <p>Unquestionably the hearts of the old pioneers of universal suffrage, such as S. B. Anthony, C. Stanton, L. Howe, etc., would beat faster, if they could see these gigantic meetings -- look back upon a half century of struggles, and behold what has been achieved already. They shall not be envied in their triumphs, on the contrary, they, as well as all women who have contributed to the success of this Congress deserve credit for this achievement. Congratulations for their success is also extended to them by those who do not agree with all of their aims and cannot cooperate in all of their endeavors.</p>
