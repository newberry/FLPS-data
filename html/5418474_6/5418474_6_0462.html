   <p>In every civilized country the press is recognized as a power and she reacts correspondingly... It is an undeniable fact that the press in this country of unlimited possibilities, unlimited liberty and unlimited means, evidences a spirit of progress, adventure and courage. It does not fail to assert its power daily and boasts of its superior wisdom and virtue over all the presses of other countries...However, to the keen observer it seems that all these characteristics and virtues find a partial expression only.</p>
   <p>Whole pages are sacrificed daily to sport news...Munder cases, scandals, suicides, divorce cases, robberies, prize awards for dogs, cats, etc. fill the pages of the press. No labor or expense is spared to report with almost painful exactitude the many details of a crime or divorce. The more sensational the better. In this respect the greatness of the press is limited indeed. And when it comes to certain essentials, the great power of the press can not even <span class="page-break">\2</span>be noticed. It is for instance almost silent, respecting the Pan-American Congress now being held at Buenos Aires. Hardly a word is said about the resolution, the delegates of Chile and Brazil desire to introduce, to make the Monroe Doctrine authoritative for all American republics. No sacrifice would be too great for such a happy solution, but the press is silent about these things.</p>
