   <p>Last Thursday evening a local unit of the Verein fuer Naturheilkunde (Society for Natural Healing) was founded at 157 Cornell Street.</p>
   <p>This Society intends to teach its members, by means of instructive lectures, the method of natural healing. In this way, the members are able to help themselves in the event of an emergency, and are not forced to succumb to the destructive influences of the patent-medicine humbug.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hermann Loewe, well-known pioneer in natural therapy, is at the head of this enterprise. He was elected president by the twenty-eight present members.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that medicines often cause harm instead of effecting cures, many people, especially workers, have become interested in natural healing as the cheapest and best way to cure sickness. The society has a membership in Germany of eighteen thousand members.</p>
