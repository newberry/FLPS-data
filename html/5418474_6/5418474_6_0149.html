   <p>The most disgusting manifestation of intolerance of recent times in the United States is the temporary closing of the World's Fair on Sundays. A comparatively small minority of the nation, in most cases members of wealthy families, had the audacity to demand the closing of the Fair on the only day, on which the mass of the working people can visit the World's Fair. Despicable hypocrisy and fear of English-American clericalism moved Congress to meet these demands in violation of the clear precepts of the Constitution.</p>
   <p>Another shocking exhibition of intolerance is the endeavor of the nationalistic movement to outlaw, or deprive of their rights, the immigrants as well as the naturalized citizens, and the first of all, the Catholics.</p>
   <p>Honor and self-preservation require all immigrants, as well as all the friends of liberty and equality to combat together this sinister element. The history of the old know-nothingism is evidence that such movements do not limit their attacks to one church only. Soon they will direct their attacks against all the immigrants.</p>

   <p>Two German Methodist preachers at the recent conference of German Methodists, one of whom is a professor at a Methodist seminary, requested that Catholics should be outlawed, as well as Jews and atheists. Some German Catholic periodicals likewise are assailing decent secular newspapers and Jews.</p>
   <p>Many German Methodists condemn the disgraceful conduct of the previously mentioned Methodist preachers. Likewise do many German Catholics criticize the intolerance of some of the Catholic periodicals.</p>
   <p>However, all these instigations to racial and religious hatred work hand in hand with the persecution-mania of the nativists. How can anyone, who denies equality and liberty, claim these very things for himself?</p>
