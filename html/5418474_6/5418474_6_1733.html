   <p>To the Editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>The remarks made recently by a "music and family friend" could only have been inspired by malice, or he would not have attacked the recently resumed concerts. Had his intention been to correct improprieties he could have spoken to those in charge. But no, he speaks instead of rival concerts, to which the better class Germans would go. Who belongs to this better class of Germans, if, like our "music friend," it looks down with such contempt on the visitors to the Turner Hall concerts. It is not the intention of the Turngemeinde to give drawing room concerts but popular concerts as is clearly indicated by the low 10 cents admission fee. The smoking is done by the better class of Germans, who stayed away from concerts as long as smoking was forbidden. The Turngemeinde will always insist on decency in its members and will try to preserve the good name of its halls.   -- Jos. Kaufmann, Member of the Chicago Turngemeinde</p>
