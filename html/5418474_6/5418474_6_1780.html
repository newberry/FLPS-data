   <p>The thousands, who walked through the spacious halls of the new addition of the Art Institute, can mention with pride their participation and special enjoyment.</p>
   <p>The exhibition of painting and sculpture, are speaking evidences of the fact, that art in America is represented in a dignified manner, and that the public demonstrates extraordinary interest in the achievements of their artistic fellow citizen. As the city of Chicago has a paramount right to be proud of her rising artists so the Germans, with identical right, can be proud to participate in the pleasure of their fellow country-men in the obtained prices for their objects of art.</p>
   <p>Emil R. Zettler received for his figure "Job", the Potter Palmer Gold medal, and also a cash prize of $1,000.00.</p>
   <p>The Norman Wait Harris-Silber medal with the addition of $500.00 cash price, was awarded to Frederic C. Frieseke for the picture "The Hammock".</p>
   <p>The Martin B. Cahn prize of $100.00 cash, was awarded to Walter Ufer for his "The Solemn Pledge, Taos Indianes".</p>
   
   <p>Honorable mention was given William H. Singer Jr., and Pauline Palmer.</p>
   <p>It is not meant to be inferred, that the objects of art of other artists, especially those of Chicago, are not worthy of admiration. On the contrary, not only are there among the pictures and sculpture, beautiful objects to be found, but especially among the sculpture, which has quite a number of charming works, brought with considerable expense to this exhibition. The Institute placed them in a highly artistic and superb illumination, to the delight of the visitors.</p>
