   <p>The far-reaching decision made by the Supreme Court with respect to the NRA has evoked lively discussions about the rights and prerogatives of that court of justice. Some people contend that the Supreme Court no longer fits in with our times, and that its powers are too great, since it is possible for the nine members of that court to oppose the desires and wishes of the entire nation. This is essentially correct, but this power is anchored in the Constitution, and it may be taken from the Court only by an amendment to the Constitution. Whether this is desirable is rather doubtful.</p>
   <p>When the people are whipped by skillful and unscrupulous agitators, the majority is likely to form decisions that may later turn out to be dangerous. The Supreme Court constitutes a rampart against such decisions, and history teaches us that such a rampart is needed. Under certain circumstances, it may have an unpleasant effect, but it imparts a steadiness and uniformity to our political life as a whole, and that is of inestimable value.</p>
   <p>Others declare that the Court should have not only judicial but also advisory functions--that it should be its duty to inform the administration and Congress as to whether certain bills pending are or are not contrary to the Constitution. This idea occurred to many before, almost a century and a half ago. Such a proposal was submitted to the Constitutional Convention of 1787, but it was not accepted.</p>
   <p>James Madison, whom history describes as father of the Constitution, went even further. He suggested that the Supreme Court, as well as the President, be empowered to veto laws passed by Congress. Should the President or the Supreme Court veto a bill, then Congress should have the right to pass it over the veto by a two-thirds majority vote. In case the President and the Supreme Court should both veto a bill, then a three-fourths majority vote would have been required to enact it into law.</p>
   
   <p>Three states voted in favor of accepting this resolution, eight against it; with that its fate was sealed. Randolph, one of the most prominent of the delegates to the Convention, proposed the creation of a revising committee, to consist of the President and some of the members of the Supreme Court, which should decide as to the constitutionality of an act before it became a law. This resolution met with no favor on the part of the delegates. The majority of the Convention was of the opinion that the Supreme Court should by no means be dragged into the politics of the day, and there is no doubt but that this attitude was correct.</p>
   <p>The weakness of the procedure now in force is that the Supreme Court does not decide directly whether or not a law is constitutional. It waits until an actual case is submitted to it. When, someone has been convicted of having violated a law, he may appeal to a higher court, and so on through still higher courts up to the Supreme Court. This procedure is, of course, too cumber some, and for this reason it is likely to encounter such phenomena as invalidation of the National Recovery Act, which has been in force for two years.</p>
