   <p>While the Democratic Representatives in Washington are anxiously waiting for President Hayes to prohibit soldiers from being near polling places, the Democrats have nevertheless found the time to eliminate one of the main demands of the Socialists. By a vote of 103 to 52, the House passed a resolution to proceed with the agenda and to table the eight-hour law enforcement clause. A motion to reconsider was denied, and so the matter is finished.</p>
   <p>This is not very encouraging for those Socialists who believed that many of their demands would pass with Democratic help. The Socialists will now find out that the Democrats are always willing to obtain votes from any source, but are not inclined to give any favors in return.</p>
   <p>Aside from this lesson, the Socialists will now find that they are desirable to the Democrats only as unpaid helpers, but not as associates. This congressional <span class="page-break">2</span>decision merely expresses the attitude on our economy which has been held by the average person during the last five or six years. The people are convinced that during depressions, when tens of thousands are out of work, it would be impossible, as well as foolish, to prevent ambitious persons from earning a livelihood when an opportunity presents itself. What honest worker who must support a wife or child will refuse to work--if he can only obtain employment by working ten hours a day? Will he refuse because the eight-hour principle is involved? And particularly in the spring of the year, when thousands of urban workers--such as painters, decorators, etc.--gladly work twelve and fourteen hours a day because jobs for them are available only in certain seasons.</p>
   <p>The idea of placing all laborers and all trades into one class by a legal decree which specifies the number of working hours is foolish, and every honest worker who believes in an honest day's work shares that opinion.</p>
   <p>The more capable and independent workers will not be governed by specified working hours. If an able worker can earn as much in four hours as he needs <span class="page-break">3</span>to support his family and if he does not care to save anything, then he simply works less than eight hours; if he has the endurance and the ambition, he will work longer than eight hours, but regardless of the actual amount of time involved, such a worker will try to earn all he can during his actual work period.</p>
   <p>To fix the number of hours a man may work is only feasible when the work to be performed is not influenced very much by individual capacity, as when a man attends a machine--hence, factory work and other strictly mechanical work. But mankind does not consist entirely of factory workers! Of course, the Manchester school of economy, on the basis of an analysis of modern industrialism, has regarded humanity during the last several decades as a mass of factory owners and factory workers, of capitalists and proletarians; and out of this conception; Socialism developed in Europe. Socialism intended to regulate all human activities on a factory basis; among other things, it called for a definite work period (eight hours in America, ten hours in Germany and Switzerland), which was regarded as "a legal right," a "humanitarian issue," and so forth. But in America, where almost two thirds of the population live on farms which are not <span class="page-break">4</span>amenable to factory methods, and where the remaining one third of the inhabitants are guided entirely by money-making considerations, any limitation of hours has proved a failure.</p>
   <p>Of course, not all the attempts to introduce an eight-hour law were rejected. Everything is tried in America, because a trial is believed to be preferable to a mere theory. And, therefore, we have eight-hour laws also. But their practical application is limited to a few cases, as when a controversy arises over the collection of unpaid salaries; in that event the courts recognize eight hours as a work day. But the actual hours of work and the wage rate prevailing in a given establishment are left entirely to the employer and employee. Our laws have never insisted that an employer shall pay just as much for eight hours of work as for ten hours. And the House has followed this principle in the present case, and has declined to enact an enforcement clause for the eight-hour law.</p>
   <p>One cannot deny, however, that with the introduction of steam power and other <span class="page-break">5</span>great natural forces now serving humanity, all strenuous human labor will be lessened eventually, and more time will become available for leisure. The tendency to utilize power as much as possible led to the point where ten hours was regarded as a day's work in America--at a time when people in Europe still worked ten and fourteen hours out of every twenty--four--and it is not improbable that the work period will be further shortened. But this result cannot be obtained by law; it must come of its own accord. Furthermore, the limited work period will only be applicable where the nature of the work permits, such as in factory production and in certain trades. In other lines, particularly in agricultural, professional, and artistic endeavors, all such restrictions will be of no value whatsoever.</p>
