   <p>The Socialist Society has always been fighting against child Labor in any form, or for any child under 14 years. If human beings were not so avaricious for money it would not have been necessary to go to law to protect children against early work. The school is the place for a child, and if the parents are kept responsible they are there.</p>
   <p>The schools should have additional rooms for teaching the children a little about different trades. A strict system should be applied to keep up these rules.</p>
