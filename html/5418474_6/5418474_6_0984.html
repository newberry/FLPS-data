   <p>Last Wednesday, at the home of Miss Ehlich, no. 89 Evergreen Avenue, a meeting of ladies, German teachers was in progress, for the special purpose of founding a Club of German teachers. Its object is: The discussion of school affairs and German social solidarity. Since nearly all English teachers are members of Clubs it is about time, that the German ladies create such an institution for members of their profession.</p>
