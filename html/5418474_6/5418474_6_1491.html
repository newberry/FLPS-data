   <p>The German Old People's Home has again shown its great popularity among Chicagoans of German descent. The benefit performance given for this model institution last evening at the Civic Opera House was well attended in spite of the inclement weather. It was a performance which brought back memories of the golden age of the German Theater in Chicago. An operetta of the good old days was given, Karl Zeller's "Vogelhaendler" (Fowler). Everyone is familiar with it, and yet enjoys listening to it again and again.</p>
   <p>The performance was well rehearsed, for which Curt Benisch, the stage director, and Otto Bandsburger, the conductor, deserve full credit. The orchestra was brilliant, and had sufficient volume to fill the hall which was meant primarily for grand opera. The chorus was considerably larger than is usual in performances of this sort and, although it was made up for the most part <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>of amateurs, sang surprisingly well. The scenery and costumes were rich and in good taste.</p>
   <p>All this made up an effective setting for the players of the more important roles. The players fitted their parts. In the title role Georg Trabert again made his appearance before the Chicago public. This artist well knows how to use his strong and beautiful voice; he had a good role, and he completely exhausted its possibilities. His leading lady, Ilse Marvenga, sang brilliantly as Briefchristl, and revealed a sparkling temperament, repeatedly introducing a rather lively tempo into the action.</p>
   <p>Lucie Westen played the part of the Princess. Upon her first appearance she was greeted by the audience as an old favorite. Her magnificent voice showed to good advantage, and in her acting she combined much humor with a touch of royal dignity. Angelo Lippich must also have enjoyed the welcome with which his always loyal public greeted his return. He gave a grotesque version of the Kindermann role and extemporized freely, giving the text a charming freshness.</p>

   <p>In the same manner Anna Mueller-Kaeuffl played the role of the Baroness Adelaide, and it was those scenes which she played with the merriest humor that were rewarded with repeated outbursts of laughter and applause. Max Bratt, a seasoned artist who can always carry the audience with him, played and sang the role of the eternally broke Stanislaus with taste and understanding. His duet with Ilse Marvenga was one of the high points of the evening. Raymond Koch and Erich Neumann, as the two professors, followed the old tradition and played the parts as straight comedy. They received enthusiastic applause. Curt Benisch was very effective as the village tyrant. He played the part with full-bodied humor.</p>
   <p>The second and third acts opened with ballets, which were danced brilliantly by Madame Ludwig's artists. Toni Gadetz, who played for a clog dance of the Verein Gamsgebirg showed himself to be a master of the zither. Time was made for these insertions by leaving out some of the play toward the end of the third act. Mr. William Klein, who was business manager of the performance, thanked the audience in the name of the Old People's Home for attending the performance in such numbers.</p>
