   <p>The German Press Association invited its members and friends to a family evening, at the Germania club, yesterday evening. And it was a family evening in the strictest sense of the word. A few pleasant hours were spent in excellent company.</p>
   <p>The entertainment committee had arranged a splendid program. The new president, Mr. Leopold Saltiel, discharged his office, as a "conferencier" excellently. After the association's president, Mr. Karl Freitag, welcomed the guests heartily, Professor Dr. Carl Bauer of the Elmhurst Seminary made a short, well received speech, in the course of which he pointed to the friendly relations between the hosts and the residents of the German suburb, Elmhurst, and expressed hopes, that this friendly relation would be strengthened and developed in the future.</p>
   <p>Pastor Kuhn of Elmhurst spoke of how the members of the press association during their visit last summer, were so cordially received and feted.</p>
   <p>Entertainment was offered by Messrs. C. Baumheier and S. Heller, the former <span class="page-break">2</span>proving to be an artist on the cello, and the applause he received after the performance of several compositions, was well merited. Mr. Heller possesses a powerful baritone voice and can well compete with any professional singer. He also was greatly applauded. The piano accompaniment was taken over by Mr. Karl Thoene in an excellent manner.</p>
   <p>That yesterday evening proved such a great success, can mostly be ascribed to Mr. Kurt Benisch, the well known character comedian, with his performance which he accompanied on a musical instrument. The audience also greatly enjoyed Mr. Joseph Fallbacher's two humorous lectures.</p>
