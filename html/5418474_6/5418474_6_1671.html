   <p>The Nenendorff Opera Company acquired as the new "Miradillo," Mr. Ph. Bronson, an excellent actor and singer. He has a wonderfully strong voice. In his first appearance, the young artist was honored with enthusiastic encores.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wolkenstein, whom many Chicagoans remember from the German Theatre, took over, for the first time the role of the "Pascha." It was not a faultless debut, still a very promising one. Mr. Wolkenstein, or, as he calls himself now, Mr. Stone, is very amusing and hopes soon to excell his predecessor.</p>
