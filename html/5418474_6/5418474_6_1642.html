   <p>The lease by the German Opera-House company of the eighty-foot lot on Randolph street, adjoining the Borden Block, has been formally closed. The property is owned by the Bartlett estate and is leased to Franz Amberg, the President of the Opera-House company. The lease is for ninety-nine years, at an annual rental of $17,500. As there is plenty of capital ready to take ninety-nine year leased property on a 5 per cent basis, this may be said to safely place a valuation of #350,000 on the property. This is at the rate of $4,375 a foot for the Randolph street frontage. The property is 180 feet deep. William A. Galbraith sold it in 1885 to Francis Bartlett for $175,000, just half its present valuation. A building twelve stories high, of steel and stone to cost some $450,000, will be erected.</p>
