   <p>Like wild fire the news spread that Greenebaum's bank was bankrupt. From 10 a. m. until 3 p. m. the run was pretty brisk. Around 2 p. m., not less than 200 people were standing in line in order to take out their money. Upon the German National Bank the run had very little influence.</p>
   <p>The directors of the savings bank were all at their post as soon as the rumor was spread. There are indications that the rumor was originated maliciously. At any rate the savings bank is fully able to face the run.</p>
