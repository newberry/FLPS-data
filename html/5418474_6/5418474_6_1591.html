   <p>The composer of the "Kimball March" is Miss Clara Schleiffarth, the daughter of the highly productive composer George Schleiffarth. Mr. Schleiffarth has been employed by the Kimball Company for many years.</p>
   <p>[The piano score is published in its entirety, nearly a whole page of the newspaper being devoted to it. The introduction is in the key of F, starting and ending on F; hence, only one flat should be affixed at the beginning of the staff. The publication, however, shows two flats. The March is in the key of B flat, the trio in E flat; 6/8 time throughout. Trans.]</p>
