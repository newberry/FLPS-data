   <p>No one knows better than does the present President of the United States, that the form of government of which he is the administrative head, is far from perfect. No one has been more eloquent than he in declaring the advisability of altering it in a number of important, indeed essential, features. In one particular, President Wilson was accustomed, long before the Presidency came his way, to heap condmenation upon the system which he is now administering, namely, irresponsibility to the people. "We talk of a popular government, but we have never tried a popular government, "President Wilson when a prefessor used to tell us; and he would point to the fact, that a Congress elected in November of one year, ordinarily met for the first time in December, thirteen months later.</p>
   <p>But what especially impressed President Wilson, the student of government, is the fact that the Chief Executive of the Union is during his term of office, responsible to no one. In the whole range of governmental system there is to be found no such functionary as the American President. Neither a ruler nor <span class="page-break">\2</span>the minister of a ruler and yet both. Wielding the prestige of a sovereign without enjoying the transcendent prerogatives of sovereignity. At the same time exercising the authority of a Prime Minister without being restrained by responsibility to representatives of the people.</p>
   <p>President Wilson, whose ambition for the Presidency was awakened by reading reports of the British Parliament, has always applauded the idea that the President's Cabinet should be made responsible to Congress, like the British Ministry. He has net, however, proposed such a step since becoming President. Indeed, the plan would be difficult to graft upon the American system. The Cabinet might resign if an Administration measure were defeated in Congress but in what position would that leave the President?</p>
   <p>The fact of the matter is that we are muddling along under a government system that was exceedingly ill thought out, and we have simply to make the best of it through the exercise of such genius as we fondly persuade ourselves we possess, and such common sense as we are actually masters of. What is practically important, however, is the fact not that the people are forbidden to criticize the President, but that they are powerless to restrain him.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>For instance, while the President may not technically declare war, nothing is more certain than that he can actually bring about war. He can assume positions, he can issue state papers, he can pursue, during months of critical gravity, a course of conduct towards foreign governments of which the country may not approve and of which it may be kept in ignorance.</p>
   <p>This has been the case during the last twelve months. The conduct of the foreign relations of the United States has been carried on by President Woedrow Wilson acting practically alone. It is a testimony to the high character of the President, but it is no credit to the intelligence of the country, that this has been endured, especially, is it a testimony to the incompleteness and inefficiency of our constitutional processes. In a truly democratic country every act of the Department of Foreign Affairs would be challenged by the oppositon party. Thus the administrative head of the nation should have had the benefit of advice and criticism, and the country should in a large measure, have been preserved from the danger of secret international intrigues or ill-advised international sympathies. It is, of course, necessary that diplomatic affairs should be carried on by individuals especially charged with the duty. It is not necessary that they should be handed over to the unassisted <span class="page-break">\4</span>wisdom, or the unchecked stupidity, of one man.</p>
   <p>No man is wise enough to direct, of his own will and without reference to the understanding, wisdom, or desires of the people, the foreign relations of a nation like the United States.</p>
   <p>President Woodrew Wilson is a man of exceptional talent, and high character, but President Wilsen is not above human errors. Wisdom will not die with his, he after is numbered among the mortals. Moreover, with all his ability and character there are certain quite special limitations which sit ipon President Wilson's fitness to handle alone a crisis such as we are passing through.</p>
   <p>He is not an authority on international law; nor could he pretend to any particular knowledge of international relations, historical or contemporaneous, save such as may have come to him while in office. He is not a student of the map. He is not a traveled man. He has never written, nor spoken, so far as can be remembered on the political affairs of other nations.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Except as to one nation, only.</p>
   <p>President Wilson's one passion is English political history. The lives of English political worthies have been his life long study. His ideals of political organization and conduct are drawn from England. He has a keen love for English literature. Whenever he has had a chance, he has spent a vacation in England, whose scenery he delights in, enshrining as it does all the literary and historical associations which furbish and adorn his mind, and whose people he sincerely admires. This, of course, is natural and laudable in one whose mother was born in England and all four of whose grandparents were British subjects.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, President Wilson never has been in Germany. He has no knowledge of the German language. He is unfamiliar with the literature of Germany; he has not drunk at its fountains of philosophy; he has not heard its songs nor listened to its stories. The events and figures of German history are for him dim shadows in the pantomine of time.</p>
   <p>Not that there is anything in the least reprehensible in this, but it explains <span class="page-break">\6</span>a good deal, and it renders it all the more necessary that, in presence of a controversy between English and German ideas, President Wilson should take pains to secure from others the knowledge, which he does not himself possess. It is the most serious criticism upon President Wilson, that he has never shown a disposition to surround himself with high class men. This was the best founded of the charges against him when was head of Princeton University. His Cabinet is a cabinet of nobodies. As a gathering of political curiosities it might be notable, a council of national direction it is contemptible. There is not a single man whom the country's judgment called to his seat. There is not in it a single man who apart from his office, would be listened to with any special respect in a gathering of a dozen average men of affairs, anywhere. Moreover, two of the cabinet's ten members were born subjects of the King of England. Lacking competent permanent advisers, did the President seek extraordinary advice in a great emergency? In the presence of crisis, the like of which has faced few Presidents, has he summoned the greatest and best of the nation to council? Has he done what Lincoln did when the clouds of 1862 grew black? What has the Premier of Britain been doing? Would prudence not dictate to any head of a nation at such a time, the gathering about him of representatives of the wisdom of the people? But no; for days after the Lusitania <span class="page-break">\7</span>tragedy President Wilson cut himself off from all human contact and communication. The circumstantial narrative of the isolation during that fatal week of a self sufficient man, while a nation of a hundred million waited upon his decision, was given out by his secretaries with apparent pride in the Olympian detachment of their master.</p>
   <p>The isolation was not temporary, it was characteristic. It is the permanent condition in which President Wilson lives. The very office of the Presidency renders its holder almost hopelessly out of touch with popular sentiment. Never was a President so cut off from knowledge of the people's thoughts as is this graduate of the college cloister, whose admirers' chief delight is to picture him as an enigma and a superior being. But President Wilson is far more of a man than his friends would make him out. He is neither an enigma nor a superior being. He is a sorely troubled man. He is, unfortunately, one of those many men who, through no fault of their own, go through life without acquiring friends. He has rarely had the good fortune to be well advised, has become skeptical of advice and indisposed to ask it. It is true that no living sovereign would have dared shut himself up to decide alone uncounseled, the vast issue of peace or war involving two hemispheres. President Wilson was not contemptuous of advise, <span class="page-break">\8</span>he was not accustomed to advise and did not know where to turn for it.</p>
   <p>Fortune has now opened to President Wilson a rare opportunity. A kind providence has saved the country from the immediate catastrophe which his dangerous policy has invited. A respite has come to the German crisis. With a magnanimity which few expected from it, the German government has taken toward the President's expectations a position of high generosity and friendliness. It accedes to them freely and fully. At the same time, without stipulation, it suggests that the United States make to England representations parallel to those to which it has acceded.</p>
   <p>The suggestion is just. It throws upon the United States Government a duty which should be immediately set about in the most generous measure of good faith.</p>
   <p>The president now has another opportunity to at last take counsel of the wisdom of the people, that wisdom he has so often eloquently apostrophized, but with which he has done so little to acquaint himself. If he will consult it <span class="page-break">\9</span>he will learn that it demands the vindication against England also of our violated dignity, the assertion now against England of the right of American citizens to sail the seas with lawful cargoes, a right which for a year has been trampled upon by the British Government, not as an impulsive war measure, but with calculation and persistency, viciously and contemptuously.</p>
