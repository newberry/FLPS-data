   <p>The above firm intends to erect a magnificent edifice on its property, the S. E. corner of State and Madison Streets. Louis H. Sullivan, the architect, has completed the plans. As the illustration shows, this new creation promises to be one of the most beautiful additions to the business district. The building will be ten stories high. The skeleton frame is to be constructed entirely of steel, encased by fireproof material. The first two stories on the street front contain huge plate-glass sections, framed in highly ornamental bronze, which virtually form one immense show window. The upper stories are faced with dazzling-white marble. For the window enclosures (lintels, etc.) artistic ornaments with frames made of mahogany are specified. The same expensive wood covers the interior walls in panel form. Twentyfour elevators are included in the plan. That all the other details appear most elegant and modern, is quite evident from the brief description.</p>
