   <p>The Music Teachers' Convention was resumed, yesterday, with many speakers on the program......Hans Balatka delivered a very interesting lecture at the afternoon session, on: "What is the Outlook for the Organizing of a Permanent Orchestra for Chicago?" Mr. Balatka's creative work in the field of music is known throughout America and he is one of the leading musicians of this country. He said: "In contrast to the speakers preceding me who spoke of singing lessons, technique in piano playing, and philosophy of the fine arts, I wish to speak of musical local history, and of the creations of our musical pioneers. The first move for an orchestra in Chicago was made in 1853-1854, when Julius Dyrhenfurth brought with him twelve men from New York, giving Chicago a regular concert season during that winter.</p>

   <p>Through lack of interest shown by the Chicago public, the company was forced to dissolve at the end of the season. Shortly afterwards, some of our music enthusiasts invited C. Bergmann, former conductor of the recently dissolved Germania Orchestra of Boston, to come to Chicago putting great hopes in his ability to form a society of musicians. But this project failed to be realized. It was in 1885 when under H. Ahner, a former member of the Germania Orchestra, the first orchestra concerts were given in Chicago. They continued this work through several seasons when they also were forced to dissolve for lack of financial support. This was the indirect cause of Mr. Ahner's death...........In 1860 I was requested to direct Mozart's Requiem at the Holy Name Cathedral which performance was repeated at Bryan Hall. This great success inspired a large number of music lovers to form a Philharmonic Society which then worked for several years with a marked success.</p>

   <p>The new Crosby's opera house and the Italian operas performed there dealt again a death blow to our orchestra concerts and the Philharmonic Society. Not discouraged by these adverse conditions I decided to become the leader of my own orchestra, when, in the middle of the third season I found that I had sacrificed $2,000 of my own money, thus becoming convinced that Chicago was not interested in the concerts. The "Great Fire" and the business depression of 1873 -1876 added only to the indifference towards symphonic music. Another attempt was made in 1879 to reorganize the Philharmonic Society, but in vain. One reason why all attempts to give Chicago orchestra music failed is because there is a lack of appreciation. The second reason is the inefficacy of conductors and their friends.</p>
   <p>What I mean to say is, that the conductor of a singing society is not a fit person to conduct the performance of difficult compositions. Contrary to the belief of Europeans we have here exceedingly well trained musicians, who are well qualified to be members of any orchestra. How is it possible, then, that Chicago in spite of the high class professional musicians can not call a permanent orchestra its own?</p>

   <p>The answer is simple: "Because an orchestra is not wanted." There are rumors that Chicago will have symphony concerts during the winter season. Let them come here, they will find numerous tombstones under which the ashes of many ambitious undertakings repose and if this does not scare them, then we say, "Come along, you gentlemen. In this little musical cemetery is always room for one more, just as it is in an omnibus; always room for one more passenger."</p>
