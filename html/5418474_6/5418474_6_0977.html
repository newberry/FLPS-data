   <p>The last meeting of the German teachers convention took place, this morning, in the Fine Arts Building, S.Michigan Ave., where the Chicago University rented the 7th floor and gave the use of a large room, with several smaller ones. It was opened by the Federal President, B. Abrams. The first speech was: "The Position of the German Language in the General Elementary Schools" and was given by Seminary Director Max Griebsch of Milwaukee. After a short historical development of the German educational institutions, the speaker compared the course of development in the American Elementary School, with the ones of Germany. He came to the conclusion that the American school system was superior, because it was a general educational institution for all pupils, while the children in Germany, of the better classes, received their preparatory instruction in special classes. The second speaker was Mr.E.O.Schoenrich, Baltimore. His theme was: "A very much neglected Factor of the Principles of American Teaching and Education". The goal of school education should not only be to provide the children with a certain amount of knowledge, the right way to think, and to enable them to further develop themselves educationally, after leaving school, but the highest goal should be to awaken and develop their sense of duty, and conscience, and <span class="page-break">2</span>with them, all qualifications for the formation of a solid and form character. And to educate the children to become Americans, worthy of their great fatherland. This sense of duty, indicating a higher will, guarantees the public respect or law in state and country while disobedience in school, and home, leads to disorder and crimes, to the general disadvantage of good citizenship. Mr. H. Wildmann Cleveland, read the yearly report of the Committee for the Culture of German. What common goal should the German lessons have amongst the different school systems? The Committee of Resolutions made the following report: Referring to the teachers seminary and its union publication "Pedagogical Monthly Magazine":</p>
