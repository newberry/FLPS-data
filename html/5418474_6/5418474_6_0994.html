   <p>Our noted German doctor and city bacteriologists, Dr. Adolph Gehrmann, is busy at present in making a sufficient quantity of Professor Beyring's Serum against Diphtheria.</p>
   <p>A new laboratory for medical and chemical studies has been built in the City Hall, to accomodate our staff of city doctors and chemists, who are carrying out the important task of guarding the health of our population, particularly of our children. Contagious diseases are becoming increasingly a danger to the welfare of our growing city population and therefore deserve all possible attention by capable physicians, regardless of expenses and human efforts.</p>
