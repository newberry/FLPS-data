   <p>The Chicago Tribune published, yesterday, an article full of irony about the meeting of the saloon keepers, last Saturday, and claims that the German newspapers will have no report on it, because no reporters were there. The readers of the Westen have read all about the meeting. We are also happy that our trick has been so successful. The reporters of the Chicago Tribune do not understand any language except English, and a very poor English at that. At German meetings they are accustomed to annoy the German reporters by endless questions and thus prevents them from working. To avoid those pests, the German reporters seated themselves in the middle of the audience instead of at the reporters' table. If the Tribune wishes to give correct reports regarding German doings, it should hire some German reporters. It will have to be done sometimes.</p>
