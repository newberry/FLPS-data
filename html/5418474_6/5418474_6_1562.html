   <p>Frederick Stock, former conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, will be an American citizen in ninety days. Yesterday he made his application for citizenship in the presence of Mr. Frederick J. Wessel and Mr. Henry C. Voegeli, business managers of the Orchestra.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stock, who was born in Juelich, in the Rhineland, Germany, temporarily relinquished the leadership of the Orchestra last fall to avoid misunderstanding and friction. But soon he will again fill the relinquished position, and he will resume the post, Mr. Wessel explained yesterday, at the general request of concert patrons. Meanwhile Eric De Lamarter has been leading the Orchestra.</p>
