   <p>"Democracy" means "rule by the people". In a representative democracy, such as exists in the United States, the people are the source of all power; but this power is exercised by representatives of the people. Thus the rule of the people and their general political activity is limited to electing their representatives; only in special cases, and through the initiative and referendum, do the people exercise direct rule. Thus, only those citizens who participate in the elections have part in the rule. Only those who cast their vote not only in regular elections, but also in primary elections, use the full power to which they are entitled under our democratic form of government. And that is the duty of every loyal citizen of our democratic republic! For a democracy can succeed only to the extent to which its citizens exercise their authority. The smaller the number is of those who vote in the primary <span class="page-break">2</span>elections, the easier it is for groups, factions, and organizations which are formed to gain special, selfish objectives, to effect the nomination of their representative. Thus the danger is greater that, in the regular election, men will be chosen who will be guided less by the welfare of the people and more by the desires of the group or faction which was instrumental in nominating and electing them; in short, there is danger that rule by the people will be supplanted by rule by faction. The more general the participation of citizens in all elections is, the stronger and more successful the democracy.</p>
   <p>These are old truths, and to hear them repeated may be very monotonous to some, and cause remarks of disapproval. That makes no difference. These truths cannot be stated too often; for the participation of our citizens in elections, especially in the primaries, is generally very unsatisfactory. As a rule hardly 75 per cant of the electorate votes, at some primaries only 50 per cent. And since a great number among these 75 or 50 per cent are influenced and led by special factions, it is very fortunate that our country fares as well as it does.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The citizens who are not organized and have no special interests at heart, have not the influence and power to which they are entitled. Our country, state, and city are not completely ruled by the people. The people know this or, at least, surmise it. It is strongly felt by certain of our citizens, who consider themselves threatened and harmed, and deprived of the representation to which their number and their commercial or social status entitle them. They have a strong desire that this matter be remedied, that something be done to effect a better representation.</p>
   <p>The only question is, how? People answer: "Through organization, through union." But the people who make this recommendation forget that when people organize or unite, they are under suspicion of pursuing selfish interests, interests that are contrary to, or, at least, not conducive to the welfare of the community, and thus give cause to, or, excuse for, opposition and persecution. Today everybody knows, or should know, that any society which is <span class="page-break">4</span>organized for the purpose of gaining or exercising political influence, would only engender or intensify hatred and enmity, and thus would have just the opposite of the desired effect. Everybody must understand that it is not only considered to be disloyal to organize such societies, but it really is disloyal to do so. Therefore it is entirely out of order. Nor are such organizations necessary to assure these people the share of authority to which they have a right.</p>
   <p>Nothing is necessary save a conscientious participation in all elections, if possible, by one hundred per cent of the voters, in the primaries as well as in the regular elections. Let there be "loyal" voting, according to every-body's best knowledge, according to conscience. And as a preliminary condition, let everyone register! Nothing else is necessary. And nothing else can effect the desired change, the influence, the representation in the government of the people.</p>
   <span class="page-break">5</span>
   <p>The greater the number of people of certain classes that register, the more consideration will be accorded their just demands; for they who seek public office will be especially concerned about obtaining their votes....</p>
   <p>Our primary laws and our primary system are worthless; they are about as poor as they could be. But that fact does not relieve the citizen of the duty to vote in the primaries--that is, if he wishes to exercise his rights as a citizen. Nobody should object to being called a Democrat or a Republican for two years, even though it is not pleasant. In this way one can have a say in the selection of at least one candidate. In the regular election one can vote for whomsoever one wishes--for Republicans, for instance, even if one voted for a Democrat in the primary, in case the Democratic primary did not result as one desired. The main thing is to register and vote, vote in the primary, as well as in the regular election.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow, Tuesday, February 4, is the only registration day for the primary <span class="page-break">6</span>election to be held February 25, and for the regular election to be held April 1, and these are very important elections. No one who fails to register can vote or have anything to say in our democracy, or claim any consideration.</p>
