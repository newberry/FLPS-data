   <p>The U-Boat question, the German declaration that all armed merchantmen are auxiliary cruisers in fact, and as such may be sunk forthwith, is recognized by our Administration in Washington, and creates another difficulty for the British. This endangers England unless she takes adequate defensive measures. An attempt must be made to divert the attention from the Anglo-American controversy. The public must be impressively hoodwinked by portraying the colossal German danger in gaudy colors. And for that purpose, we fetch the Monroe Doctrine, proclaiming to the population that extraordinary plans have been promulgated by Germany in wanton disregard of the Monroe principles. This conniving of the Empire consists in obtaining land, a sort of foothold in the various republics of the Western hemisphere. The horrible proof, all the evidence, is now carefully guarded by the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs. Then further assurance will be given, that the said Committee prevents publications at present to preclude improper effects upon public opinion; the Senators seek secrecy since it is essential. There is the Nicaraguan agreement, which was to be investigated in an open session, but a preponderous majority opposed it; likewise, the proposed Columbian and Haitian understanding is to be tried behind sound-proof walls. And then we give a detailed account of all the transgressions against the Monroe document, which Germany is supposed to have so deliberately ignored.</p>
   <p>The five cardinal sins are: Germany stands accused (1) of having intended to obtain a sphere of influence in Nicaragua through the purchase of an interoceanic canal route and by the acquisition of grants for a coaling station; (2) of having tried to buy land in the Republic of Colombia by securing a franchise for a transcontinental artificial waterway and the purchase of plantations, as well as a harbor for a fleet near Cartagenas; (3) of having attained a profound influence in Paraguay through her reorganization of the army of that republic and her intention to do the same in Chile; (4) of having found an entering wedge in Haiti by controlling the customs collections and the building of a fleet station at Mole St. Nicholas; and (5) of having come into control of St. Thomas Island, or approximately so, through a lease, a manipulation with Denmark, which provides an exceedingly valuable base of strategic importance. The war caused Germany to give up her intentions and tendencies temporarily, but she will prosecute the matter with renewed vigor as soon as peace permits.</p>
   <p>If it is so then it is so, everything including the supposition that Germany will resume her schemes after the war. Yet America can offer little objection. America will have no legal grounds to interfere with the devious agreements of the Southern republics and Germany, nor may the United States dictate to Paraguay and Chile "Thou shalt not have German officers to instruct thy military forces," or insist that the Republic of Colombia desist from fulfilling its covenant with Germany, thereby effectually precluding the future canal-building program and the fleet anchorage; likewise, it cannot compel Denmark to revoke its lease relationship with Germany.</p>
   <p>This right is not applicable under the Monroe Doctrine nor is the adage "America for Americans" suitable. Be it then, that other European countries, England, France, etc., which possess territories in Central and South America, relinquish their holdings or be kicked out, particularly England! After that is accomplished and all our American republics unite in concerted action, that no European power shall have property claims upon this continent, then only would the United States be justified in protesting against Germany, and if that eventuality were realized, then the Empire will gladly refrain from its aspirations here, and feel mighty satisfied with the bargain. Nothing that Germany contemplates is contrary to the Monroe stipulation as it was originally drafted; not as Roosevelt expounded it, foisting a strange, impossible conception upon it which, as we are all well aware of, consists in our being morally bound to protect England's, the Motherland's American hoardings against any encroachment. It appears unthinkable that this monstrous obligation should be upheld even after the war has joined the forces of oblivion.</p>
   <p>If England is not expelled from America, then it will be considered good and expedient to break its monopoly after the conflict, and the friendly concessions to Germany may then proceed unimpaired.</p>
   <p>That dawns upon the pro-Britishers in Washington. Decidedly they are aware that the Rooseveltian Monroe Doctrine, which is calculated to uphold English predominance, does not interest our South American neighbors. This, precisely, is the motive that prompts the secret session in Washington. To withhold an outbreak of popular resentment against Germanism is "piffle." The closed chambers wherein the South American contracts are being perused, is the customary standard system of intimidating us with the old tomfoolery.</p>
   <p>The basic thought of the Monroe Doctrine is after all America for Americans.</p>
   
   <p>The first step to achieve its realization would be to throw out England, starting in South and Central America, then finishing the goal in Canada. After this attainment throw Germany out, if she shows inclinations to gobble up American soil.</p>
