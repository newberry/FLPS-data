   <p>The American Parliament, known to us as a special derivation of the English variety, toboggans down hill, so rapidly, that it must eventually require replacement unless we assume that the people merely elect their lawmakers for the purpose, that the latter batter their skulls and break each others' necks, there is little to report that is of intrinsic value at the present time. We have a Congress and 42 legislatures. All these corporate bodies formulate, in exceptional cases, only a half dozen laws yearly, which are of proven public benefit. Most of their time is frittered away by ludicrous party fights or by injuring the common welfare. It is an undisputable axiom, that the inhabitants of each state breathe with relief and the entire nation is pleased, when Congress adjourns.</p>
   <p>Can the decadence of an institution, once hailed as the triumph of the people over lordly-rulers, be shown any plainer? Since both major parties are about equally balanced, none has a deciding majority. etc. One would naturally assume that this eliminates tyranny. Who concocts such logic does not know the greatest republic and wisest population on earth. With us, the above <span class="page-break">2</span>quoted conditions, absolutely paralize congressional law-making activities.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the self-adulating Americans will themselves question eventually whether the present system is adequate.</p>
