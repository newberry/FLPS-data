   <p>The local committee held a meeting last night in Niehoff's Bank to decide on the plans for the proper celebration of the 19th German-American Teacher's Day, on July 9th.</p>
   <p>Mr. Eberhardt, temporary chairman, called the meeting to order and gave the following explanations:</p>
   <p>"As known to you all, the 19th German-American Educator's Day had been scheduled for Indianapolis and not for Chicago. Conditions have made it desirable to celebrate the North-American Educator's Day here.</p>
   <p>"The local Germans now have the best local opportunity openly to state their views on their mother tongue and on the German customs prevailing in this country.</p>

   <p>"The German language, which exemplifies the value of our old culture, should be preserved for the benefit of the younger generations of this country.</p>
   <p>"It is, therefore, the duty, not only of every member of this committee, but also of every intelligent German of this city, to contribute to the success of this celebration."</p>
