   <p>A number of teachers met yesterday in the "Deutsche Gesellschaft" in order to receive the report of the Constitutional Committee of the German-American Teachers Association. On some paragraphs extensive debates ensued. The conception of "German-American" particularly caused difficulties. With one minor change the Constitution was adopted. The Messrs Roos, Hansen, Schutz, Kindinger, Henschel and Chronik were elected provisory members of the board. They themselves named Mr. Hansen, President; Mr. Roos, Vice-President; Kindinger, Secretary; Schutt, Treasurer; Dr. Chronik, Librarian; and Henschel Auditor.</p>
