   <p>In last night's session of the convention, which was attended by a large audience, Mr. Raab spoke about "The obligations of the German-Americans and of the German teachers towards the public schools."</p>
   <p>The speaker announced at the beginning, that he holds Bourgeois' views of the land of the free (America) and presupposed a similar attitude on the side of his audience.</p>
   <p>He then said: "Whoever sincerely strives for the purging of our public life, whoever loves genuine popular government and desires the preservation of our freedom, cannot sit idle and live only for himself, and bury himself in his business or his art. The corruption in high and low places, in positions of confidence or in private life, can only be prevented by the vigilance of us all."</p>
   <p>Then Mr. Raab named the teachers to master the language of the country, because he said, "Language is the man".</p>
   <p>Regarding German knownothingism the speaker expressed himself as follows:</p>
   
   <p>"We brought our social views and customs from the old fatherland, and have been thrown amongst a people whose history was built on different lines. We demand that they respect our specific German views before we have taken the trouble to get acquainted with the viewpoints of our native fellow citizen. So we have started the clamour of American knownothingism, and quite often forget, that on our side exists about an equal amount of German knownothingism.</p>
   <p>The educated American acknowledges willingly what is great and good and does not make any distinction from where he receives that which will serve progress, if there is one class amongst them who would exclude the more liberal views of the old world, you will, without doubt, have observed, how the influence of this element slowly disappears, and how the majority is not susceptible to the influence of the narrow minded and fanatic."</p>
