   <p>p. 8.. Our capable Chicago singer who achieved many a triumph on the renowned stages of the old fatherland, returned a few weeks ago to his Chicago home. He is still the same modest, unassuming and yet vivacious and contented man he has always been.</p>
   <p>Many gaudy colored Chinese paper lanterns gave a festive appearance to his mother-in-law's garden, where many friends of the famous singer congregated to bid him farewell and wish him God speed for his impending European trip.... Mr. Coith, Vice-president of the Germania Male Chorus, and its musical director, Mr. Schoenefeld, many Germans and well known singers, intoned the sentimental melody, "O, That We Must Part."</p>
   <p>As always, Cordes proved again his genuine, inborn artistic temperament, which precludes any vestige of conceit. Tenors are often victims of vanity, the too frequent result of intense admiration. Cordes will enjoy his successes, and his future victories, but once he has reached the apex of his glory, his gratitude for those who prepared his path will always remain unchanged. To fully appreciate that, one should have heard him yesterday, as he paid such a glowing tribute to his first teachers.</p>
   <p>Biography.</p>
   <p>About nine years ago, when Mr. Cordes was a member of the Sinai-Gemeinde, Mr. Koelling who was the organist at that time, recognized his talents. He induced Mrs. Koelling, who had studied with such eminent European masters, as J. Stockhausen, and Lamperti, and who later became a renowned teacher in Hamburg, to take an interest in the young man. She gave him instructions for three years, and treated him almost as a son.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Koelling and her friend Mr. Noak predicted a great future for him and aroused the interest of the community in his behalf. The Germania also became interested in him, whereupon Cordes continued his operatic studies in Germany.</p>
   <p>Julius Cordes, who is 31 years old, was born in Hamburg and came to the United States at the age of fifteen. He remained in New York for two years and then went to Chicago, where he remained until he started his European journey, five years ago. In Frankfurt, A. M. he became a student of Hoch's conservatory, where Dr. Franz Kruekl immediately recognized a tenor in the former barytone.</p>
   <p>Dr. Gustave Gunz awakened his dormant dramatic talents and thus the concert singer became a member of the opera. He made his first appearance at the city theater in Rostock. Encouraged by his success, he appeared during a winter season at the Municipal Theater in Mainz at a modest salary. The summers he spent at Frankfurt where he continued his studies.</p>
   <p>During the last two winter seasons he was the leading tenor at the City's Theater of Strassburg, which may be regarded as the beginning of his reputation. This resulted in an engagement at the Koeln (Cologne) Municipal Theater for three years..... (Other artists, not connected with Cordes, are now mentioned but omitted here. Translator) Cordes has studied and sang more than 100 tenor parts, Ravoul (Hugenotten) Arnold (Tell).... etc. In regard to the Wagner Operas, he now masters the part of Stolzing in the "Meister-Singer"; at present he is studying "Lohengrin," which he may sing during the next season at Koeln.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. Cordes has a host of Chicago friends and through his family he is intimately connected with our city. His wife, Dorothea, is a daughter of Mr. Sievert, an old Chicago settler. Since his marriage in 1885, she has always fostered his ambitions and encouraged his artistic proclivities....</p>
