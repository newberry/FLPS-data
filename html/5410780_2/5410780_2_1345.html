   <p>p.4.........The Cemetery Association for members of the Danish Brotherhood conducted its yearly stockholder's meeting last Monday. The president's report stated that the association had paid over$1300.00 on its cemetery lot at Mount Olive Cemetery. The debt is now only a little over $400.00.</p>
   <p>The association has progressed during the last year. There are still quite a few unsold lots, and an option is held on additional 5000 square feet, bordering the property now owned by the association.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that the plans concerning the erection of a beautiful and imposing monument, on the association's cemetery lot will be brought to an early completion.</p>
