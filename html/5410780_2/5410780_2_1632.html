   <p>About thirty years ago, twelve ladies from the Danish colony started the society for the Danish Old People's Home.</p>
   <p>A few of these ladies are still active in the society. Among them are: Mrs. C. H. Hanson, Mrs. Louis Hansen, and Mrs. Olaf Hansen. We call your attention to the fact that there were other ladies active in the society but unfortunately, most of them have died.</p>
   <p>Mrs. C. H. Hanson has been the president of the Danish Old People's Home for more then fifteen years, and has done much to organize and make this enterprise a success.</p>

   <p>It took about twelve years before the society had collected enough finances to build its own home, and in all these years Mrs. C. H. Hanson has done more than her share of the work.</p>
