   <p>p.2..........The Danish delicacies which Mr. Wm. Morgensen, the packer, started to import a few months ago have made such a "hit," that the supply can hardly keep up with the demand. These delicacies are now carried not only by most grocery and delicatessen stores in the Scandinavian neighborhoods, but also by the great department stores downtown. These concerns have for years handled Mr. Morgensen's packing products, a fact that greatly facilitates his introduction of the Danish merchandise, which, by the way recommends itself by its superior quality. It tastes better than the ordinary American canned goods, and is comparatively low priced.</p>
   <p>Encouraged by his success in Chicago, Mr. Morgensen is in the near future going to St. Paul and Minneapolis to introduce the Danish delicacies to the public of those cities.</p>
