   <p>On behalf of the Scandinavian people, I beg to inform you, that the editor of Scandinaven or its aesthetic theatre and literary importer, make fools of the public, the actors, and the playrights. A short time ago there was an announcement regarding A.B.C. Scandinaven made it a farce by saying how deep and clever the author of the A.B.C. was to write such a wonderful book. But before Christmas a stage show was played. It's name was Newlywed, by "Bjornson"; Scandinavian critics stated that he saw the same show at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen, but that there was no comparison; the Chicago amateurs were far above the Royal theatre. Chicago actors played in a much more refined and delicate style, etc. That is the kind of criticism Scandinaven dares print when it is well-known, too, that the Chicago actors are only amateurs, trying to bring a little joy to their countrymen in Chicago, That is the thanks Scandinaven is giving them, comparing them with star professional actors.</p>
