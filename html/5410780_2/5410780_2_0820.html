The railings of the galleries were draped in the Danish colors, as was also the entrance to the Hall.</p>
   <p>The program opened with an overture and was followed by other musical numbers by Mr. O. Nielsen's Orchestra, Miss Irene Kastler gave a violin solo which was warmly applauded; she had to give an encore. Mr. H. Nicoll sang two bass solos. Then the curtain rose for a duologue, "Through a Materimonial Bureau" played by Mr. G. Johnson and Miss Agnes Antonsen. The two were repeatedly applauded, and Miss Antonsen was presented with a bouquet of flowers.</p>

   <p>The second part of the program consisted of a farce in one act, "Paa Tredie Sal," by Henry Lindemann. The players were amateurs with the exception of the author, Actor Lindemann, who was playing the role of the photographer. Every player did his or her best in the designated roles, and the play was a success....</p>
   <p>Late in the evening coffee, Danish sandwiches, tea, and ice cream were served in the minor hall which was tastefully decorated in Japanese style. The ladies of the societies acted as hostesses and waitresses. Dressed in Japanese costumes they rendered an excellent service to a pleased public.</p>
