   <p>A large and appreciative audience filled Trinitatis Church last Sunday for Dupont-Hansen's concert.</p>
   <p>The carefully selected program included Danish concert music, represented by Gade and Dupont-Hansen's own compositions. Solo numbers were beautifully rendered by Mr. Rubardt, full-toned baritone and Mrs. Bartholdy, light, clear soprano.</p>
   <p>Mr. Dupont-Hansen can not be too highly praised for his work in arranging this type of concerts and his direction of the church choir, which this time performed better than ever before.</p>
   <p>The capacity house is a proof of the Danish public's appreciation, and should encourage him to carry on.</p>
