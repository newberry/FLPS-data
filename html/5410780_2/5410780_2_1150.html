   <p>The literary state bacteriologist, J. Christian Bay, of Des Moines, says in Dannevirke: "Sat sapienti, because Peter Nansen's books are so widely read."</p>
   <p>(Peter Nansen had a leading position with our greatest publishing house in Copenhagen, Gyldendal. He wrote several well-written books that were much read and discussed by the upper ten in Copenhagen. These books and plays were of the French type and about sex-life among the well-to-do classes. He has not made a lasting impression in the history of Danish literature.)</p>
