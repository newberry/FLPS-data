   <p>A report by the Society for a Danish Old People's Home in Chicago states that since the Society started, in 1891, it has collect about $10,000 and has secured a lot worth $1,500. As the colony, therefore, expects a home to be built, the Society is calling a meeting to elect a building committee. This committee will consist of three women and two men, who are to secure plans for the building and ascertain its cost. Their report will be discussed at three successive meetings. The final decision will be made at the January meeting of the Society.</p>
