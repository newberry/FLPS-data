   <p>Mr. Georg Dupont-Hansen will celebrate his thirtieth anniversary as an organist in the Danish Trinity Lutheran Church this year. This is unbelievable because, despite his greying hair, Dupont-Hansen appears as young and enthusiastic as he did thirty years ago.</p>
   <p>Many changes have taken place within the Trinity congregation during that period. Ministers have come and gone, old members have passed away, and new one have taken their places, but Dupont-Hansen has remained on his job at the organ.</p>
   <p>Some persons may say that the organ player himself is not important; rather that the music is the important issue; but this attitude should not be taken toward church music, and it is particularly unfair to Dupont-Hansen. It is a well-recognized fact that the musical aspect of the services in Danish churches has been greatly neglected until recently. In the old country the <span class="page-break">2</span>presence of an organ in the church was a rarity. Usually the local school-master led the singing, and in many instances his knowledge of music was rather incomplete. But this was not true of the Church of England, for there the musical portion of the church service has been upheld as a fundamental tradition since time immemorial. Recently, churchgoers in Denmark have come to realize the importance of music, with the result that a number of churches have been equipped with organs.</p>
   <p>Over here, of course, we had to begin in a very modest way. It was not always within the means of a small congregation to purchase an organ, and we accepted this state of affairs philosophically, because we were accustomed to doing so. Of the many Danish churches in America now equipped with organs, Trinity Lutheran Church is recognized as outstanding for its excellent music--thanks to the efforts and performances of Georg Dupont-Hansen. It was he who awakened our appreciation of music, and it is he who deserves credit for the installation of Trinity Church's beautiful organ.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>The influence which Dupont-Hensen's music has had on Danish congregations elsewhere in the United States is far from negligible.</p>
   <p>Georg Dupont-Hansen was born in Chicago, and is a member of a musical family. He is, as we all know, totally blind, having lost his sight in an accident during his early youth. After regaining his health, except for his eyesight, Dupont-Hansen went to Denmark, where he received an excellent musical training. He studied under such masters as August Winding, piano; G. Attrup, organ; and Osea Rosenhoff, musical theory and composition.</p>
   <p>Properly trained, and possessing great musical knowledge, Dupont-Hansen returned to Chicago ready for work. He has displayed considerable ability as a composer, although he has had little time to develop this talent. He has dedicated himself almost exclusively to playing the organ and directing choirs in Danish churches. This work is and always has been poorly paid, which is the price one must pay when one limits himself to employment by people of his own nationality in this country. This is the destiny of our church workers, <span class="page-break">4</span>many whom possess outstanding ability; they must remain amateurs because we do not appreciate their work, and because our contributions are not sufficient to support them financially. Be they authors, musicians, or artists they are always willing to give their best for our benefit, and yet must earn their living by hard work during their spare time. Such is the tradition of a generation of immigrants--apparently it is unchangeable. Georg Dupont-Hansen earned his living mainly by working as a music teacher.</p>
   <p>Despite physical and economic handicaps, Dupont-Hansen succeeded in completing a great work in 1917, consisting of an edition of melodies for the Dansk Folkesamfunds Songbook (Book of Danish Folk Songs). It has been called the best edition of Danish folk melodies ever published in America, and is appreciated in Denmark too.</p>
   <p>As a composer Dupont-Hansen has produced three cantatas--a Christmas cantata, a church cantata, and one composed for the dedication of the Danish Children's Home in Chicago. Dupont-Hansen is the author of three compositions for the <span class="page-break">5</span>piano, published in Copenhagen, and "Theme with Variations," published in Leipzig, Germany. Other compositions of his which should be mentioned are "Moonshine on the Ocean," which is very popular on both sides of the Atlantic, and "Nirvanna," very popular in America.</p>
   <p>During all these years, Dupont-Hansen has been working patiently as a music teacher, and his pupils can be counted by the thousands. His taste for good music has been of great help to many who have thereby learned appreciation of music. He has a very pleasing personality and is intensely interested in what is going on around him, though deprived of the all-important use of his eyes. Consequently he has been able to gather young and old people to sing in choirs, etc. Despite the fact that the crowds have never been large in our small churches, if we were to consider the time which he has spent in this work, the number of persons who have responded to Dupont-Hansen's musical influence would be great.</p>
   <p>Even though these choirs are not well known outside of Danish circles they must <span class="page-break">6</span>be regarded as among the best Danish choirs in Chicago, because they are composed of young voices which respond more readily to good instruction.</p>
   <p>We can safely predict that Danish music and songs will live longer in this country than any of the other folklore and tradition brought with us from our native land. This is true not only because they are genuine cultural aspects, but also because a few energetic musicians like Georg Dupont-Hansen have dedicated themselves to the work of preserving that inheritance and conveying it to the younger generations.</p>
   <p>No doubt Dupont-Hansen could have become better known and had a much greater field of activity had he gone outside Danish circles, but he preferred to stay among the Danes. As a result, his work is valued and respected in every part of the United States where Danish music and songs are popular.</p>
