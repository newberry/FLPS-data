   <p>De Skandinaviske Socialdemokraters Sygeforening (The Scandinavian Social-Democratic Sick Benefit Society) now has three hundred members. There has been much talk of a hall of their own, but nothing has come of it as yet. A few ladies presented the Society with a Socialist banner, of red with a gold letter, at a festival in Finstad's Hall March 16. The committee was made up of Mrs. S. Huseby, Mrs. Lauritz Olesen, and Mrs. C. Svendson. The president, Mr. John Schmidt, thanked them on behalf of the society. Lauritz Olesen, S. Huseby, and L. N. Schmidt also spoke during the evening.</p>
