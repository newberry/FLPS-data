   <p>A mass meeting was held at Skandia Hall on January 25 for an open discussion of the affairs of the Danish Old People's Home. Not more than two hundred were present, mostly ladies. Mrs. Catharine Toft, the president of the Society for a Danish Old People's Home, told the audience that the society now had $15,000 in cash and a lot. This is enough to build on, but they also have to take care of the running expenses. The Society now has two hundred women members each of whom pays three dollars a year. It has now been decided to let the men join the society on the same terms. If they can secure five hundred new members the Danish colony will be able to meet all the expenses of the Old People's Home and the committee could start to build.</p>
   <p>That evening only fifty or sixty men joined, among them such well-known men as Consul C. H. Hansen, Dr. Max Henius, Henry L. Hertz, and Senator Niels Juul.</p>
