   <p>p.2.col.4........The second and greatest triumph was scored by Julie Rosenberg last night at Walhalla Hall. As in her previous appearance she again held her audience spellboand with a program of folk songs sung as only Rosenberg can sing them. Her remarks about the origin of folk-songs and their place in Danish history and culture were a revelation to her listeners and placed the "Folk Song" on a vastly higher plane, in their estimation, that this music had hitherto attained.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Rosenberg is making an extension tour of the West and will appear again in Chicago recitals upon her return. "Standing Room Only" signs will be required at all her future Chicago appearances and Chicagoans (Danish and otherwise) would not be at all displeased to have her make Chicago her home.</p>
