   <p>p.4.col.3....Mr. Henry Nielsen, former president and veteran member of "Harmonien," Danish male chorus,passed away at the Norwegian Deaconess Hospital on Saturday, Nov. 6th. Mr. Nielsen had been ailing for some time though he did not enter the hospital until the day of his death. "Harmonien" will miss this faithful member whose long service in the organization was an example and an inspiration to the younger members.</p>
   <p>Although the death of Mr. Nielsen was so unexpected,and the funeral arranged on such short notice,"Harmonien," in its characteristically prompt manner,assembled its complete membership and attended the funeral in a body,and sang a final sad farewell to this departed brother. May the memory of him never grow dim.</p>
