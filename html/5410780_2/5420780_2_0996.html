   <p>The Danish national song by Adam Gottlieb Oehlenschlager has been translated by Alfred G. Anderson, as follows:</p>
   <p>I know a lovely land,</p>
   <p>Sublime with spreading beeches</p>
   <p>Along the Baltic strand.</p>
   <p>Its rolling hills and valleys all</p>
   <p>Proclaim the name of Denmark,</p>
   <p>"And it is Freya's hall."</p>
   <p>Here sat in Odin's day</p>
   <p>The champions in armor</p>
   <p>When resting from the fray.</p>
   <p>Eftsoon they conquered hostile ground;</p>
   <p>Their bones now rest serenely</p>
   <p>Where boulders mark the mound.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>Behold that country sheen!</p>
   <p>Blue belts and fjords embracing</p>
   <p>Soft slopes of sylvan green;</p>
   <p>And noble women, comely maids,</p>
   <p>Strong men and sturdy younglings</p>
   <p>Make up the Danish race.</p>
