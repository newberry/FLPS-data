   <p>The pedestal for the Hans Christian Andersen monument was made by Andersen's Granite Company, St. Cloud, Minnesota. When it was transported from the factory to the station and across a bridge, one of the wheels broke through, and the great block of granite weighing ten thousand tons went down sixty feet. The damage to the bridge was estimated at about five hundred dollars.</p>
