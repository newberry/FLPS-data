   <p>On May 1 the Wahl-Henius Institute occupied its new building on the corner of Fullerton [sic] and Clinton Streets. It is a fine five-story building, which houses the brewing school and the laboratory. The brewing school is open every year from October to April.</p>
   <p>During the latter part of the eighties Max Henius and Robert Wahl started their Scientific Station for Brewing in a few rooms in a building on West Chicago Avenue. Later they moved to larger quarters and rented a building on the corner of South Water and Lake Streets. They are now publishers of the great American Brewer's Review. They have a private laboratory for the testing of beer and wine. In 1903 the Institute made 10,653 such tests for different brewers.</p>
   <p>The following Danes have been employed by the Institute: Professor Aug. Schmidt, Professor N. Hjelte Clausen and Aage Raavad. Martin Lauritzen is the engineer of the big building.</p>
