   <p>The society for the Danish Old People's Home has just published its 10th annual report, in which its president, Mrs. Wm. Nelson, announces that plans for a new and larger home are being made. A committee has been appointed for the purpose of raising the necessary funds, and the prospects of success are excellent.</p>
   <p>An expansion is highly desirable, since there are a great number of worthy applicants that cannot be accommodated in the home under present conditions.</p>
   <p>However, when building a new and larger home, the society also has to consider ways and means of maintaining it after it is built. To that end, it has been conducting a drive for more members, and last year saw an increase of 52, bringing the total, as of Jan. 1, 1913, to 310.</p>

   <p>Its goal is to have 1,200 members on the books three years hence, when the 25th anniversary of its founding will be observed.</p>
   <p>At the present time the society's net assets amount to $36,768.</p>
