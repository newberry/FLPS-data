   <p>The financial result of the Hans Christian Andersen Jubilee for the benefit of the Danish Children's Home is estimated to be about $6,000. At the present moment $2,302.13 has already been paid in. The Home already has $4,000, and as the Home will cost $15,000, there will still be four or five thousand dollars to raise if the new Home is to be free from debt. The committee decided to rest for a while before an attempt was made to raise the last few thousand dollars.</p>
