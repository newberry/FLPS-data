   <p>No sooner has Chcicago's art-loving public finished admiring the Scandinavian painters' exhibit than attention is called to another artist who occupies a high place in the musical world, namely, Thorvald Otterstrom, the Danish pianist and composer, who now for a number of years has made his home in Chicago.</p>
   <p>His latest composition, "Eligi, Korol and Fuga," was presented for the first time at the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's Concerts last Friday and Saturday before a large and enthusiastic audience.</p>
   <p>In this work, which requires a full orchestra and organ, the composer has employed the most exclusive and noble form of composition, Canon and Fuga, and has thus a rich opportunity to demonstrate his supreme technique, <span class="page-break">2</span>which, however, is not permitted to overshadow the purely musical aspect of the composition. It is from beginning to end characterized by a thoroughly natural modulation and development of the theme, possessing the beauty of harmony and musical coloration which is so often missing in modern composition.</p>
   <p>The presentation of this work, which is typically Scandinavian in character, became a musical event of the first order. The composer was rewarded with thundering applause and had to appear on the stage several times. American music criticsagree on placing him in the front rank among the great composers of our generation.</p>
   <p>Mr. Otterstrom was born in Copenhagen, where he also received his early musical training. Later he studied in St. Petersburg, and came to Chicago in 1898.</p>
