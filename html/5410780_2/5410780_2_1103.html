   <p>During the latter part of July, 1895, some editors were invited to a meeting of the Norwegian-Danish press in St. Paul. The purpose of the meeting was to guard the interests of the Norwegian-Danish press in the United States, to further co-operation and united action in business affairs, and, finally, to create a friendly, congenial relationship among its members.</p>
   <p>Nothing came of the meeting. Most of the papers, both Danish and Norwegian, held aloof.</p>
