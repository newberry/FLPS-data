   <p>Another monument has been added to the magnificent galaxy in bronze that is the pride of Lincoln Park. Hans Christian Andersen did not, like Goethe, soand the depths of the human mind; neither did he, like Schiller, stir the patriotic emotions of the national heart; nor did he, like Linne, open new pathways in science. But he understood the young mind and heart as no other writer before or since, and as long, as the cradle rocks, his memory will be kept green, budding afresh with every rising generation in every land. He is the most cosmopolitan of all the story and fairy-tale tellers the world has produced, and it is eminently fitting that a monument in his honor should be placed in the shady park of the most cosmopolitan of all cities.</p>
   <p>The monument is a fine tribute to the genius of the sculptor and a credit to the patriotism of the Danes of Chicago.</p>
