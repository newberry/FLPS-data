   <p>Harmonien's Concert last Saturday in Schoenhofen's Hall drew a full house and, as always when this Chicago's oldest Danish singing society invites the patronage of the public, it gave full value. The program was rich and varied selected with excellent, even artistic taste.</p>
   <p>The concert opened with "You, Danish Man" and Abt's "Sunset," which were followed by "In Vocal Combat," "The Heather Flower," "Denmark," the aria of "The Barber of Seville," and numerous other Danish and foreign compositions. We will not attempt to point out any outstanding performances; they were all tops, and the audience demonstrated its joyful appreciation.</p>
   <p>We hope that the concert was also a financial success.</p>
