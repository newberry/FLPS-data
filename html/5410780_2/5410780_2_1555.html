   <p>Our energetic ladies braved the bad weather on Tag-day and collected $10,500. Congratulations! Danish Children's Home received of this amount $3,064.72 which exceeded expectations.</p>
   <p>We should all join with thanks and apprecation for the work so unselfishly performed by our ladies every year, and that concerns Mrs. Jens Eriksen in particular who has supervised this work now seven years in succession.</p>
   <p>Wednesday, Oct. 28, there will be a social gathering in Trinity Church with a light luncheon and various kinds of entertainment, all in commemoration of the event.</p>
