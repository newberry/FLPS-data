   <p>The new high school which is being erected at 114th Street and Stewart Avenue, at a cost of $700,000 is to be named Christian Fenger High School by decision of the Chicago Board of Education</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly our countryman on the School Board, Dr. P. C. Clemensen, has been instrumental in causing the Board to pay this tribute to the memory of the famous Danish-Chicagoan.</p>
   <p>Another public school is already named for another Dane, the author and poet H. C. Andersen.</p>
