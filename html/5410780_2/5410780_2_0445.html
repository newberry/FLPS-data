   <p>Bartholdy and Schwartz, 340 Milwaukee Avenue, is a very large hardware store which carries a large stock of stoves and a full line of building tools and equipment. As business grew Mr. Bartholdy took in Mr. Schwartz as a partner, and today all Danes and Scandinavians deal there. Both men are considered very good businessmen.</p>
   <p>H. S. Paulsen and Bros, are always up to date with their stoves. They are well known by the Danes and Scandinavians.</p>
   <p>Hearlev and Johnson, 94 Milwaukee Avenue, have a large business in goods which they manufacture themselves. To give you an idea, four thousand boxes of paper collars are made each week. Trunks and travelling bags are made the same way at 126 West Indiana Street.</p>

   <p>H. L. Dahl, 150 South Clark Street, is doing a tremendous tailoring business with rich Americans, but he is always glad to have a countryman of his come in and patronize him.</p>
   <p>N. Bruun, 282 West Indiana Avenue, is the owner of a drugstore. His drug store is a landmark for the Danes and we are proud of him. His skill as a druggist and his personality and warm heart for the poor have insured his success.</p>
