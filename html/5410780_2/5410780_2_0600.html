   <p>p.2..............Just as Sweden and Norway already have been represented at the Chicago Art Gallery, respectively by a portrait by Farn and a river scene by Thoulow, Denmark is now also represented by two paintings by Danish artists, namely a beautiful and artistically treated still-life by the famous Danish New York painter Emil Carlsen, and a painting of Prazza Sam Marco in Venice, sparkling in white fairyland sunshine by the Danish New-Yorker P. C. Johansen.</p>
   <p>In the gallery is also a half figure portrait of Emil Carlsen, painted by Kenyon Cox. It is terrible. Emil Carlsen with his genial and highly expressive, almost savage physiagnomy, is depicted as a kindly looking, trembling elderly man. Mr. Carlsen ought to demand that it be removed.</p>
