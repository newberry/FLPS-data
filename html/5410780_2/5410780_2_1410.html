   <p>Lodge No. 17 of the Danish Brotherhood observed the 30th anniversary of its founding last Sunday in its own home, which it now owns outright, the final bond retirement having recently been completed.</p>
   <p>Animated speeches for the lodge and the Brotherhood, for America and Denmark, and for the ladies, were delivered and enthusiastically applauded, as were many other less formal talks. The poetical form of expression was not lacking, as several songs had been written for the occasion.</p>
   <p>The food and dance music could not have been better, and it was altogether a memorable affair.</p>
