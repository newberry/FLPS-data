   <p>To the Publishers, Editors and Readers of Scandinavian-American Newspapers:-</p>
   <p>While much progress has been made in recent years toward the suppression of fraudulent advertisements yet this evil unfortunately still flourishes, even in its coarsest and worst forms, in many Scandinavian newspapers. Because of this unwelcome fact, the Scandinavian Medical Society of Chicago, finds itself in duty bound once more publicly to express the appreciation, on the part of its members, of those newspapers that keep their columns free from fraudulent medical advertisements and endeavor conscientiously, as best they can, to lessen the evil effects of humbug and quackery in every form.</p>
   <p>The Society also takes this occasion again to inform the public of the fact that advertised medicines do not possess the wonderful virtues claimed for them. Deception and fraud are their special characteristics and their main sources of existence. Many of the most widely advertised preparations have been found to contain alcohol and other habit-forming <span class="page-break">2</span>drugs, in spite of claims to the contrary.</p>
   <p>It is, however, upon a solemn warning directed to parents and the friends of youth and innocence against the so-called "advertisement for men" that particular stress is put at this time for the reason given below. The chief subject of this, the blackest of all frauds, is not to cure a disease but for the purposes of systematic and relentless extortion to create, and maintain a condition of morbid fearfulness, amounting often to actual disease, the unfortunate and pitiful victims of which we physicians know only too well, because we see them so frequently. Newspapers carrying advertisements of the "for men" class should be excluded from the home, and prevented from contaminating our youth conscientiously as if they carried contagious diseases.</p>
   <p>As stated, advertisements of this kind at present appear in many Scanding vian-American newspapers the publishers of which, contrary to the dictates of conscience, thereby, voluntarily promote the sacrifice of human health in the interest of a traffic so low and so degarding that, lock at it as we <span class="page-break">3</span>may, to be associated therewith now means loss of respect and good opinion among fellow men.</p>
   <p>The war upon the harmful medical advertisements must be continued with sustained and increasing vigor. Recognizing fully the peculiar responsibility of physicians in the matter, the Scandinavian-American Medical Society calls on its members as individuals to consider the important question, how each within his own sphere may render the most effective service in this cause; and as an organized body the Society will maintain a permanent committee on "Fraudulent Medical Advertisements" whose duty it shall be to collect and disseminate material for the information and instruction of the public; to cooperate and advise with others and to use all legitimate and proper means within its power to stop the humbug and quackery that prey upon the people.</p>
