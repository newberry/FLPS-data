   <p>Our Danish-American composer Carl Busch has composed a cantata for the opening of the Danish-American National Park in Rebild Hills, Denmark. The title of the new composition is "The Brown Heath." The cantata was played for the first time in "Tivoli," in Copenhagen, by the Students' Orchestra, under the direction of the composer. The Chicago Danes again have reason to feel proud.</p>
