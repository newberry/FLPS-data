   <p>St. Stefan's Youth Society presented the musical comedy "Estetic Feeling" last Sunday in the Grand Boulevard Hall, which was filled to capacity.</p>
   <p>The society's dramatic talent had worked hard to make the performance a success, and both the actors and the audience were amply rewarded.</p>
   <p>The play was followed by a ball, and it was altogether an enjoyable affair.</p>
