   <p>The three Danish singing societies--the Harmonien [Harmony], the Danish Workers' Singing Society, and the Magneten--have, after many meetings and much discussion, consolidated into one large chorus. The societies will have separate business meetings, separate affairs, and separate halls. But concerts, etc., will be together. Otto Clausen has been appointed director for the three societies.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: This arrangement lasted only a short while. The Harmonien was the first to withdraw. The Magneten later disbanded.]</p>
