   <p>Old M. Volquartz, who has lived in Chicago for more than a generation, will observe his eightieth birthday next Sunday, June 11th. In the joyous days of his youth the popular Chicago veteran was the foremost actor in Danish dramatic circles in Chicago. He experienced his greatest triumph as von Budding in,"The Neighbors" in 1869, on which occassion Henry L. Hertz also won honors as Klint, the young student. Numberless times Mr. Volquartz has entertained the Danish colony with his dramatic rhetorical talents, so it is only fitting that the colony now wants to reciprocate by arranging a celebration, in honor of the octogenarian, in Trinitatis Church, next Sunday.</p>
