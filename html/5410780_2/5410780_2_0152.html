   <p>Hope is considered by many as life's greatest asset, and indeed, none will deny that life without hope would soon become intolerable. Yet too much hope has the same effect on man as the quinine has on headache, both are dope.</p>
   <p>The American workingman, credited with having more privileges than his brother worker in Europe, surely has had his share. Close observation shows that the so-called privileges are indeed very limited.</p>
   <p>It is stated in our Constitution that our country is "for and by the people." However, the present labor situation, with its chaos and vast army of unemployed, should convince even the most optimistic among the workers that this constitutional phrase is pure and simple "bunk."</p>

   <p>Our so-called prosperity has come to an end. Multitudes of American workers, the wealth builders of the nation, who blindly believed and hoped that the industrial leaders would take good care of them, now suddenly find themselves destitute, and in many cases belonging to an unorganized, and hence, unprotected group.</p>
   <p>Absolutely devoid of any representation or backing, these faithful American workers might eventually degrade into hoboes, criminals, or racketeers. It is deplorable that only too late are they beginning to realize that their hopes have been nothing but futile hallucinations.</p>
   <p>It is apparent then that their only salvation lies in the realization that action, and not hope, is the main factor in life. The workingmen must convert their hopes into reality.</p>
