   <p>p.4...The Danish accompanist, T. Fredriksen, a graduate of the Copenhagen Conservatory of Music, who recently arrived in this country, is at present in Chicago, as an instructor at Drake's School of Music, Auditorium Building, Wabash Ave.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fredricksen was present at Ebenezer Church, Rockwell St. and Wabansia Ave. last Sunday and played a couple of solo numbers on the organ, much to the pleasure of the congregation.</p>
   <p>Surely, the Danish colony in Chicago has gained a valuable addition in this distinguished artist.</p>
   <p>His home is at the North Cape Building, 2623 W. North Ave., where he receives pupils for instruction in piano, organ and violin.</p>
