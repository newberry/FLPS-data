   <p>The opening day of the Chicago Danish Theater was a grand success now that it has become a permanent institution in the Danish colony. The house was packed, as is always the case when our artists are playing in any of the Scandinavian plays.</p>
   <p>The play produced was "First Violin" by Gustav Wied. Five plays for the coming season are now being rehearsed, and will be produced in the near future. The title role of "Miss Mimi" will be played by Gudrun Jacosen.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the Danish theater will have a very successful season.</p>
