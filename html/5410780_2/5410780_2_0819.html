   <p>Hejmdal, a Danish singing society in Chicago, had a meeting December 18, 1900, in which it was decided to send out an appeal to all Danish singing societies in American to join together in one united Danish singing association.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavian Singing Association was dissolved a couple of years ago, and since that time the Danish Singers have missed an organization that will help them to get together at great national festivals and thus show everyone what the Danish choruses can do when they work together. Everyone interested is asked to write to Hejmdal, 3658 Armour Avenue, Chicago.</p>
