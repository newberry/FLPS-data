   <p>The Danish poet, Holger Drachmann, is leaving Chicago May 14. Eleven hundred tickets were sold for the festival in the poem's honor, and he was paid $400. The festival was not the success expected, and the lack of success is all due to the usual envy within the Danish colony in Chicago. Many were angry because they were not placed on one of the many committees. Den Pioneer worked against it, and especially the paper's local manager, Carl Antonsen.</p>
   <p>The South Side, or Walhalla, had under consideration an evening for Holder Drachmann on May 24, but they were kind enough not to make this public until after the meeting in Central Music Hall. The result was, however, that many South Siders stayed away, and now they will not have a chance to see the poet. But a great deal of work was done by Peter Roer, Max Henius, and D.M. Frederiksen, who share in the success of the memorial evening at Central Music Hall, when the Danes met Denmark's greatest livings poet.</p>
