   <p>A very successful Christmas celebration was held at the Danish Home for the Aged. All the inmates, now a total of 31, were filled with a radiant Christmas spirit when the ladies of the house committee and other executives arrived to spend the evening with them. The managers, Mr. and Mrs. J. Ensen decorated the dining room and lounge, in honor of the occasion, and a small Christmas tree was placed on a table. The presents for the old people were placed around it. About 6: p. m. dinner was ready, and everyone went to the brightly lighted and beautifully decorated dining room and sat down at the well-set table. The dinner consisted of goose, turkey, Aeblekage (Danish apple-cake) and other good food, all of which was well cooked.</p>

   <p>Many pretty speeches about the home, the executives and the inmates were made. Everyone added something to the festivities, and many of the inmates spoke, sang or recited. Mrs. Erika Hansen delighted the party with her merry songs.</p>
   <p>After dinner everyone went over to the old Home, where hours were spent with music and song. Later they all gathered around the Christmas tree and presents were given to the inmates.</p>
   <p>Among those who helped to make the party a success were, Mrs. E. Holm, who played well known Danish melodies, and Miss Alpha Henriksen, who sang some beautiful songs. We want to thank our friends, who sent gifts and who, one way or another, helped make this Christmas party a success.</p>
