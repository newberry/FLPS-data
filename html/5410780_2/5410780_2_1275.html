   <p>Sunday afternoon, Jan. 7, the Danish Workers' Singing Society held a shooting match at Jacobsen's Hall. A large number of members and friends participated, and bombarded the birds with unfailing accuracy. The only mishap that occurred was a couple of wild bullets, going through a glass door.</p>
   <p>The manager of Jacobsen's Hall, the strong blacksmith Chris Nielsen, whose hand is still steady after years of tending bar, was the day's best marksman and his victory won him a fine smoking set.</p>
   <p>Supper was served from baskets brought along by the ladies, and as a finishing touch, the crowd danced to Scheel's music.</p>
