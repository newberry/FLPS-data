   <p>The lodges of the Danish Brotherhood in Chicago had their consolidated picnic at Elliott Park June 19. About two thousand participated. Supreme President H. H. Vogt spoke for the Brotherhood; Consul Geo. Bech for America, and Chas. Wilde for Denmark. There was singing by Magneten, and a wrestling match between Aage Rye, from Sparta, and Carl Olsen, from Freja. The former won. In another match John Simonsen lost to "Bull" Olsen. Mr. H. Thuesen is the president of the arrangements committee. It looks as if there will be a deficit of one hundred fifty or two hundred dollars.</p>
