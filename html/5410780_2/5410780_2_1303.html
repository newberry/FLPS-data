   <p>The wrestling match between Bech Olsen, Champion of Denmark, and his opponent last Friday drew a crowd of thirty-five hundred to Tatter Hall. The fight was a great disappointment. Bech Olsen fought in a black tricot but Rooney was naked to the belt and had been rubbed with oil. Half an hour before the fight the lights went out; the electric cable had been cut. The financial end of the fight had not been settled and a lot of time was wasted with some dirty Jews before it was settled. Bech Olsen agreed not to use a certain hold. The result was that the fight was declared a draw. Nobody made any money. The big Dane had been cheated once more.</p>
   <p>Mr. Larsen was severely critized because he had used the name of the Athletic Club on the program, and the fact is that the Club has not been active for several months. It is very doubtful if the Club will be able to continue its existence.</p>
