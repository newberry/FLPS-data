   <p>p.l...............Miss Gerda Henius, daughter of Dr. Max Henius, performed last Friday at a private dramatic audition at Fiegfeldts Theatre. This performance put the finishing touch to her one and one-half years course at Gillmore's College.</p>
   <p>First nine pairs of pupils were picked for a dramatic audition, and among these, the three most promising pairs, among which was Miss Henius were selected. All three pairs played the same main roles in a Russian revolutionistic drama, written by Mr. Gillmore. Miss Henius was unquestionably the Prima Donna among the pupils, and the judging committee, on which was the famous actress, Ethel Barrymore, awarded her the highest prize, the diamond medal.</p>
