   <p>Revyen has been socialistically inclined ever since it was started. On account of the election which has just taken place, the editor states the position of his paper in the following words:</p>
   <p>"This paper believes in socialism, but also that socialism will be realized through democracy by a gradual process. The Republican party is our capitalistic party, the party that stands for private greed and public hypocrasy; the only chance for the Democrats is to take the directly opposite stand, not in big words, but with a big heart and a good will, and with action at the first given opportunity. Then, when it represents real democracy, the way will be as clear for the Democratic party here as in other places."</p>
