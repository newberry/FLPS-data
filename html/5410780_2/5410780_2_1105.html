   <p>A reader of the paper asks the editor to publish the paper half in English so our children can read some of it. Our young folks cannot read Scandinavian. We older people like to read the Scandinavian languages. Try for a while to give as a paper half in English and half in Danish or Norwegian; or else we shall have to give up either the English papers or the Scandinavian papers.</p>
   <p>(This is a policy the Scandinavian papers have looked upon as very dangerous; but as the years go by and we do not get any new Scandinavian emigration to speak of, we will have to do this very thing if we want our Scandinavian press; to live a little longer here in the U.S.A.) J.E.</p>
