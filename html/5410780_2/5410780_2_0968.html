   <p>page 2 column 5... A Danish reading club" Tylvten" (The Twelve) has existed for many years consisting mostly of members from the Young Peoples' Society on the West Side.</p>
   <p>But as the membership is limited to 12, a new reading club has been started under the name of "Kritiken," which also has only 12 members. The membership fee is very small, but all the books are sold by auction after they have circulated among the members; and for the money the club buys new Danish literature.</p>
