   <p>It is a recognized fact that the extant English translations of Scandinavian and German hymns generally bear the stamp of amateurism. Therefore, in order to improve the English editions of our national hymnals and songbooks, a committee representing the major religious denominations among Danish churches has been hard at work during the last four years revising the original translations so that this aspect of our native culture shall not be misrepresented.</p>
   <p>We have in our churches several men who possess sufficient poetic ability to produce something of value. For instance, the Reverend Mr. Aaberg of Dwight and the Reverend Mr. Poulsen of Chicago have both produced excellent translations. The Reverend A. T. Dorf is also a member of the committee.</p>
   <p>In the near future the two main organizations among Danish churches will publish a Danish hymnal, printed in good English, which will show the results <span class="page-break">2</span> achieved by this committee.</p>
