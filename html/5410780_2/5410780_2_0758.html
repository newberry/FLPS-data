   <p>The singing society Harmonien gathered its members for a big smoker last Tuesday night, as sort of a prelude for the trip to Racine.</p>
   <p>Editors Myrup and Kirkegaard from Racine, Senator Juul, and other prominent Danes were there as guests and speakers.</p>
   <p>Choir songs and solos by the society's old and new voices, which seem to be getting better right along, kept everybody in high spirits.</p>
