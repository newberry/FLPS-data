   <p>The Dania Society invites the public to buy the bonds it has issued in connection with the new building to be erected for the society at 1653-55 N. Kedzie Avenue. The sale of bonds, priced at $100 each, is not limited to members only. The interest on the bonds is 6% and they are redeemable within 10 years through a sinking fund, into which a definite portion of the fees paid by members will be diverted. The total amount represented by the bonds is $20,000, a sum which is secured by a first mortgage of $28,500 on the building and grounds.</p>
   <p>The new building will provide a center long needed by the Danes in this part of the city, but the bonds will also constitute a high-class investment.</p>
