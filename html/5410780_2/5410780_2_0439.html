   <p>A new power cable has been invented by a well-known Dane, R. Rasmussen. It has been tried out by the Cable Car Company and found to be a great improvement over the old underground cable.</p>
   <p>This new cable is housed in a "box" on the surface between the rails, thus facilitating the repairing of the cable in case of a break.</p>
   <p>Several other improvements over the old system are to be found, among them being better control of speed, easier stopping, less wear and tear, and higher degree of safety.</p>
   <p>No doubt this new cable will soon be in use throughout Chicago.</p>
