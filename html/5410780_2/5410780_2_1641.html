   <p>The Danish Society for a Home for the Aged was organized twenty-three years ago at the suggestion of the late Mrs. Emma Thorsen. Twelve women discussed the plan, and later formed the Society. The old Home was built in 1902, with facilities for eighteen inmates. The place became too small, and the late Mrs. C. H. Ronne suggested the building of a larger home. The financial committee for the new Home consists of Lauritz Olesen, William Mogensen, William Henriksen, J. Jensen, G. Toft and Mrs. William Nelson. The architects are John Christensen and William Mogensen.</p>
