   <p>Dania celebrated its Thirty-ninth anniversary November 23. About one hundred were present. The upstairs apartment, where the janitor used to live, has been taken over by the society. Here there is now a room for reading, playing, and conversation. The society is thinking of fixing up the attic as some kind of a gymnasium. It has already secured the equipment, from the old bicycle club.</p>
   <p>The president, Mr. Carl Nielsen, gave the welcoming address. A prologue by Volkmar Johnsen was read. Songs were written [for the occasion] by Harald Henrichsen and Louis Hansen. Henry L. Hertz was toastmaster. The official speakers were: P. J. Noer for Denmark; Fritz Frantzen for Dania; D. M. Frederiksen for America, and Orckenholt for the ladies.</p>
   <p>At the same occasion the Danish artist, Wm. Jensen, donated to the society a painting he himself had painted of the late George Hoffmann.</p>
