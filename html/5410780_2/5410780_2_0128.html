   <p>With all due respect and sympathy for Colonel Lindbergh and his wife in their deep grief, we cannot help but reflect upon the innocent children who by the thousand are slaughtered in cold blood in China right now. Are there no tears for them? But why go so far away, when right under our eyes, in our own land of plenty, daily, children are deprived of the necessities vital to human health and sustenance. What about the hordes here who die of malnutrition and cold? Why doesn't the Press rally to their aid; why is the nation not concerned about their tragedy, and that of their parents who cannot help them?</p>
