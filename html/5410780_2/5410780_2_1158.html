   <p>An afternoon in Denmark is a beautiful educational film which will be shown in Orchestra Hall Sunday December 20. At the same occasion Danish-American Athletic Club will give a gym exhibition, and composer, George Dupont Hansen, will play the organ. All of this is available to you for one dollar only, and the profit goes to pay for the new addition to Danish Old Peoples Home.</p>
   <p>We admit that this exhibition comes rather soon after the great bazaar held for the same purpose; but the film is available at no other time, and the building committee is eager to have these bills paid before entering a new fiscal year. The affair is the first, last and only one to be sponsored by this committee.</p>
   <p>As Christmas draws near our thoughts turn back to the time we lived in Denmark, and what would be more natural than to go on an imaginary journey through the land of our fathers and refresh our memories? In addition the film provides an opportunity to show the younger generation what Denmark loks like. The text of the film will be in English.</p>
