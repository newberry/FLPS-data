   <p>On election day, April 7, Chicago's women will for the first time have an opportunity to exercise their newly acquired right to vote, and express their opinion about the management of our city's affairs, which are now in a deplorable state due to the incompetence of the old parties, and it is evident that no appreciable improvement may be expected from that direction.</p>
   <p>We are particularly concerned about the transportation problem. The present and previous administrations have done their utmost to accommodate the big downtown business houses and the surface lines companies, who are shoveling in money without regard for the comfort and interests of the public, and the development of the outlying districts. This also goes for the "comprehensive" subway proposed by Mayor Harrison, which ought to be voted down by a crushing majority.</p>

   <p>The only sound solution of the traction problem is municipal ownership, for which the voters have expressed preference three times already; but each time they have been cheated out of their rights, and the only guarantee that they will not be cheated gain is the election to the City Council of at least a few Socialistic candidates on whose program municipal ownership is one of the main planks.</p>
   <p>Among the many Socialistic candidates who merit the confidence of the voters, we will particularly call attention to William E. Rodriguez of the strongly Scandinavian 15th ward, where, at the last election, William E. Cunnea received twice as many votes as any of the opposing candidates. Even the capitalistic Municipal Voters' League has seen fit to grant him favorable mention, and the Tribune concedes that he looks like a winner.</p>
   <p>In the 27th ward, which also has a large Scandinavian population, John C. Kennedy is waging a promising campaign, and in the 28th the Norwegian <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>John Evans is battling for our cause.</p>
   <p>Vote for these men or the other Socialistic candidates in the various wards and against the proposed subway.</p>
