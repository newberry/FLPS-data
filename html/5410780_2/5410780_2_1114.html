   <p>On behalf of the Scandinavian people, I wish to inform you that the editor of Scandinaven, or the reporter who serves as its dramatic and literary critic, makes fools of the public, the actors, and the playwrights. A short time ago there was an announcement regarding A.B.C. Scandinaven made it a farce by saying how deep and clever the author of the A.B.C. was to write such a wonderful book. And before Christmas there was a performance of a play, "Newlywed," by Bjornson. The Scandinaven critic stated that he saw the same play at the Royal Theater in Copenhagen, but that there was no comparison; the Chicago amateurs were far above the Royal Theater. Chicago actors played in a much more refined and delicate style, etc.</p>
   <p>That is the kind of criticism Scandinaven dares print, when it is well known that the Chicago actors are only amateurs, trying to bring a little joy to their countrymen in Chicago. That is the thanks Scandinaven is giving them, comparing them with star professional actors!</p>
