   <p>Dr. Max Henuis on behalf of two hundred Danish-Americans on September 1st, purchased for 20,000 Kroner a piece of heather in Rebild Hills. The park is to be given to the Danish state and must never be cultivated; it takes in 1,000 acres of land. On the deed will be written the name of all persons who sent money for this purpose to consul C. H. Hansen, Chicago.</p>
   <p>Rebild Park is half an hour's ride by railroad south of Aalborg and 15 minutes' walk from Skorping station.</p>
