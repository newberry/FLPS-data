   <p>p.4......The Farce, Concert and Hall arranged by the singing society "Harmonien", last Saturday night proved to be such an attraction that a great number of people obtained "standing room only." The good old chummy spirit ruled from start to finish, even though "King Siam" did not quite come up to expectations. The comedy contained an abundance of songs, cleverly written, but lacking the pep and sophistication necessary to put them over with a bang.</p>
   <p>The gayest part of the night started after the performance, when Hans Nielsen's Orchestra struck up for dancing. The bar and Mr. Samuelsen's cold buffet enjoyed constant patronage, and it was very nearly daylight when the affair broke up.</p>
