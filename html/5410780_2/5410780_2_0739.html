   <p>The Danish Worker's Singing Society competed in a singing contest last Monday in North Chicago, in which seventeen singing societies, representing as many nationalities, participated.</p>
   <p>Among the larger societies the German Wagner took first prize and the Norwegian Bjorgvin took second prize, while among the smaller ones the Danish singers were awarded first prize, a beautiful cup.</p>
   <p>The Danes became even more popular when it was discovered that Mayor M. Christensen, of North Chicago, is a Dane. He delivered a speech in which he complimented his countrymen on their singing.</p>
   <p>North Chicago is supposedly "dry" but arrangements had been made so that the singers did not have to go thirsty, and they spent a very pleasant day in Mayor Christensen's town.</p>
