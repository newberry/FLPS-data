   <p>John Gelert's Haymarket Statue is to be moved to Union Park as it is in the way where it now stands. The statue is regarded as a poor piece of art, and The Chronicle proposes that it be sent to the junk shop. It must be said in defense of Mr. Gelert that he had planned a real piece of art, but the committee wanted just a policeman.</p>
   <p>Mr. Gelert is a well-known Danish sculptor who lived for many years in Chicago.</p>
