   <p>Dansk Tidende (Danish Times.), the new "intellectual paper," is a beautiful-looking sheet, the front page is fine, and the entire paper is well illustrated.</p>
   <p>The publisher, H. Franck-Philipsen, a well-known chemist and inventor, has lots of cash and lots of ambition; so we feel that the paper will survive.</p>
   <p>The editor-in-chief, Kristian Baun, is a well-known author, educator, poet, botanist, and entomologist. Mr. Baun can write Ph. D., D. D., and D. S. after his name; so the editorship is in good hands.</p>
   <p>The first issues of the new journal were the best papers that we have seen in Chicago, without exception.</p>
