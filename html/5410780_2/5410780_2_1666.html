   <p>p.3, col.2.... The Danish Old Peoples Home Society will celebrate its 20th anniversary on March 12th when, if nothing unforseen occurs, several of the original members, still active in the support of the home, will meet to reminisce and plan. The president's annual report states - "For twenty years we have conducted this haven for the aged and the changes in management personnel have been many, the ideals remain the same. Friendly support and cooperation have carried the home thru good times and bad and the future looks very bright. The home, at present is caring for twenty aged people, and the total expense during 1910 were $2,573.00. We are not in debt."</p>
