   <p>We emphatically challenge your statement, made while discussing a sales tax, that the best-qualified men in the State are unable to devise any better method for raising the necessary funds for the relief of the needy.</p>
   <p>On the contrary, any really qualified and unbiased person will unhesitatingly admit that a tax assessed according to the schedule presented by this paper some time ago (a graduated income tax) would answer the purpose admirably. Furthermore, at every step, from low-income to high-income groups, it would conform to the one and only equitable and defensible taxation principle: namely, ability to pay.</p>
   <p>A sales tax is diametrically opposed to this principle, since it bears proportionately harder on people of small means than on those of considerable means. It is a subterfuge, cumbersome, irritating, depression-breeding, unjust, and therefore undemocratic tax!</p>
