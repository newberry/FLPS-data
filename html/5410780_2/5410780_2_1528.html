   <p>The Danish Aid and Relief Society asks the colony for contributions so that the society may be able to help many Danes in the city with money, food and clothing. The society meets every second and fourth Thursday of the month in Dania Hall, 251 W. Chicago Avenue. The membership fee is $3 a year. Besides the board there is an investigating committee of four, which visits any person or home that needs help.</p>
