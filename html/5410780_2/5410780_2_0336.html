   <p>Our countryman, Mr. Harry Reck, has been named president of the new Laramie State Bank.</p>
   <p>In 1898 he was with the Farmers' National Bank of Denmark; in 1903 he was connected with the British Bank of North America, in their main office in London, and later in several branches in Canada. He then returned to Denmark and worked in The Farmers' Bank until 1918, when he came to America. In 1922, he became the cashier of the Howard Avenue Trust and Savings Bank.</p>
   <p>His international banking experience has certainly been extensive.</p>
