   <p>Ole Nielsen enjoyed a full house and an appreciative audience for his concert last Sunday in Walhalla Hall.</p>
   <p>As usual the orchestra consisted of very able musicians and the concert program was selected with discriminating taste; the assisting soloists deserve the highest praise.</p>
   <p>The ball which followed the concert was of course very enjoyable, and we don't have to tell you that "the Ring" took good care of the culinary part of the program.</p>
