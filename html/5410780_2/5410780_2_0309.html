   <p>The Danish surgeon, Dr. Valdemar Pleth, is receiving a great deal of publicity on account of an unusual operation. The Chicago Daily News of last Monday devoted an entire column to his fine operation.</p>
   <p>A painter, John Grant, had been drinking so much wood alcohol that he finally became totally blind. Many doctors, and even the Chicago Medical Society, had given him up. But Dr. Pleth performed a skillful and dangerous operation on the optic nerve. It is almost certain that the patient will regain his sight. The Chicago College of Physicians and Surgeons is now taking care of the patient. Dr. Pleth is treating him with X rays.</p>
