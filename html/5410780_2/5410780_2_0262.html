   <p>Congressman Niels Juul wishes to announce that he still lives in Chicago, and not in Washington, D. C. The Congress, to which Mr. Juul was elected, opens March 4, but does not function before Fall, unless the President calls an extra session. While the Congressman is in Washington, his associates, Roy A. Juul and Herbert Juul, will continue his large practice in the Y. M. C. A. Building, 19 South LaSalle Street, Chicago.</p>
