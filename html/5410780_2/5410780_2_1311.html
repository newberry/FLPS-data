   <p>A new club is to be started under the name of "Skandinavisk Diskussionsklub Fremad". Its aim is to spread culture and information among Scandinavian workers. There will be lectures on science, economics, history, politics and literature. The club also asks all persons to donate to the library books which they no longer need.</p>
