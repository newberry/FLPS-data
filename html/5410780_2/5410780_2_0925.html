   <p>Magneten gave a very enjoyable and successful evening of entertainment last Sunday in Bjorgvin's Hall, with the presentation of the two plays, "The Two Deaf-Mutes" and "Peter's Masterpiece."</p>
   <p>The singing society's best dramatic talent was in the firing line, and in spite of many imperfections, the actors were generously applauded by the capacity house; in fact so enthusiastic was the response that Magneten's dramatic department was encouraged to replot the performance in the near future, probably in the new Dania Hall.</p>
   <p>Hans Schmidt's dance orchestra was excellent as usual, and Magneten's ladies had arranged a very tasty buffet supper.</p>
   <p>The ivory president's club donated by Viego Jensen was won by lodge No. 18, <span class="page-break">2</span>and netted a nice little sum for the building fund.</p>
