   <p>"The Relatives" was played last Saturday night at Federation Hall by the South Side Danish Youth Society and attracted almost a capacity crowd.</p>
   <p>The good old "Fano" comedy, which never seems to become worn out, went over well, however, perfect justice was not done to some of the songs,but the audience was well satisfied with the performance and applauded generously.</p>
