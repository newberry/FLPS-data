   <p>During the course of its existence Harmonien has had three meeting places. It first met at Schoenhofen Hall, then at Metropolitan Hall on California Avenue, and, finally, at Bjorgvin Hall, at 1639 North Artesian Avenue. This building was bought in 1922 for the sum of $7,500.</p>
   <p>The Society lost the building during the depression, and now rents the hall from the receivers. After 1922 the name of the hall was changed from Bjorgvin Hall to Harmonien's Hall.</p>
