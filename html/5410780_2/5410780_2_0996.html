   <p>p.2.... We had, recently, the pleasure of receiving John Volk's poems in Danish and English, some of them in the original tongue and others in translation. The book contains about one hundred poems, written during a period of forty years, from the first Danish Flag Festival in New York in 1864, up to the present time. Some of the poems, written for special occasions, are of interest as contributions to Danish-American cultural history; many of them are entertaining and humorous, others are fine literary pearls, reflecting the poet's warm and deep feeling. Technically, the author seems to handle both Danish and English with great mastery.</p>
   <p>All in all, the contents of this book are so good and rich that it merits a more beautiful binding than that in which it is now issued.</p>
