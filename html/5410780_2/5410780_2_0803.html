   <p>The fight inside the Danish singing society Hejmdal goes on. The passive members met and decided not to accept the invitation of the Young People's Home on the South Side to practice singing in their rooms free of charge.</p>
   <p>Another meeting was called at Walhalla Hall, but this time only active members were present. It was decided to accept the generous offer of the Young People's Society; a new board was elected. Walhalla had offered to give the singing society free rooms, but as this was only for the passive members, it was voted down.</p>
   <p>Professor N. Petersen was elected director of the chorus. It costs only twenty-five cents per month to be a member of the society.</p>
