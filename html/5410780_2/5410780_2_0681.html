   <p>The affiliated Danish choir, which was the source of so much enjoyment during the week of Opera Singer Johs Fonss's visit should be congratulated,especially for its performance at the University of Chicago. The impression these vocalists made on their audience, particularly on the young students and the specially invited guests will constitute a cultural contribution on the part of Danes in America.</p>
   <p>The marvelous choir under the direction of Marinus Poulsen and Joel Mosberg deserves our appreciation and thanks.</p>
   <p>So much for the song, but we feel obliged to criticise their behavior a little.</p>
   <p>We would say that 95% of the singers stood erect and attentive while singing, and thus represented their nationality in a worthy manner, but a few, presumably the <span class="page-break">2</span>last recruits, stood as if they had just alighted from an express, their eyes scanning over the audience, as though they were trying to locate somebody; some actually stood with their hands in their pockets.</p>
   <p>We hope this will never happen again. If these offenders of stage etiquette had a chance to see themselves in a mirror, they would have learned something.</p>
   <p>We would not ask for or expect too much of our obliging singers but we believe their appearance would be greatly improved if they uniformly wore tuxedos when staging their performances.</p>
