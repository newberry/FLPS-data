Finstad &amp; Johnson Co., who in 1899 leased the building at Randolph &amp; Wabash and established the "Perfecto" restaurant renewed their lease for another ten years at an annual rental of $18,000.00. The capacity of "Perfecto" will be doubled as the second floor, included in the new lease, will house a new and enlarged kitchen and private dining rooms. This popular eating place will continue under the able management of Mr. Torbjorn Fossum who has made "Perfecto" and the Finstad &amp; Johnson,"The Tavern", 163 Washington St. two of the most favorably known restaurants not only in Chicago but in the mid-west. These two restaurants are examples of the thoroughness and stability of Danish-American industry.</p>
