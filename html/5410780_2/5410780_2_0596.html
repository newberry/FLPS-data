   <p>Mrs.Valborg Nielsen, who now has an art shop at 2158 Lincoln Ave.,has, as in earlier years,imported paintings of renowned Danish artists such as Viggo Johansen; Brendekilde, Frederik Jacobsen, and others.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Nielsen herself, a graduate from the Art Institute in Copenhagen, has paintings of her own on exhibition, both oil paintings and pen sketches. There are some beautiful miniatures as low as from 75 cents and up to a few dollars, frequently a mere fraction of what the same pieces would have cost downtown.</p>
   <p>We recommend to our readers a visit to Mrs. Nielsens' Art Shop. Advertisement telling about the shop will be found elsewhere in the paper.</p>
