   <p>Fritz, Frantzen, and Jorgensen, Rasmussen, two Danish bookstores, are merging into one firm. Its name will be Fritz, Frantzen, &amp; Co., and the store will be at the old location of Fritz, Frantzen, at 96 Milwaukee Avenue.</p>
   <p>This merger is a wonderful thing for the Scandinavian people. Mr. Frantzen has been in the book business for many years, and is known as an expert in his field. Jorgensen and Rasmussen, in the short time they have been in business, have shown what youth, energy, and honesty can do. We are sure that this new firm will be one of the best businesses of its kind.</p>
