   <p>p. 4.- The oldest Danish society in Chicago, Dania, now 36 years old, has recently declined somewhat. But at its last meeting it was resolved from March 31st to cancel the initiation fee of $4. All you had to do to join the society was to bring a doctor's certificate that you were in good health, pay the membership dues for three months and the funeral assessment. It was expected that many new members would join our oldest and finest society, which also owns a very fine Danish library.</p>
