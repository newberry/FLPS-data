   <p>Mr. Th. Otterstrom, who last year justified his fame as a ranking composer at a concert given by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, won new laurels last Sunday when his latest composition, a violin sonata, was presented before a large and distinguished audience at the Fine Arts Theatre.</p>
   <p>The composition was played with perfect techinque by the well-known and popular violinist Ludwig Becker, with piano accompaniment by the composer.</p>
   <p>Of the sonata's four parts, the third, built around an Indian motif, merits special mention, on account of its strange beauty.</p>
   <p>The composition was received with unmixed enthusiasm, and Mr. Otterstrom took the bow several times.</p>
