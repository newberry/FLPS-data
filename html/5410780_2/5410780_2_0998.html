   <p>J. Christian Bay of Des Moines, Iowa, has written his first book which was printed in Denmark. Its title was: "Hvad Gud har sammenfojet-". "Sore Amtstidende" writes about it: "It does not contain one bit of talent, only a lot of talk and false sentiments."</p>
   <p>(Mr. J. Christian Bay is now the chief-librarian of Crerar Library here in Chicago. And to-day he himself smiles at this youthful effort of his. Mr. Bay has since written many a book well worth reading.)</p>
