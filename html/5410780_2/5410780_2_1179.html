   <p>Dr. Robert Wahl and Dr. Max Henius have organized the American Brewing Academy. The School will teach practical, analytical, and theoretical brewing methods.</p>
   <p>The semester opened with eighteen students, all of whom are Germans. The first semester's work will be in German, but in the future all work will be English.</p>
   <p>All the Breweries have free access to the well equipped laboratories, and it is hoped that they will utilize them.</p>
