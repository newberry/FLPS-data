   <p>The Danish National Festival was a complete success this year. More than ten thousand Danes attended. On the Midway we saw such figures as Professor La Brie, Tyroler Ferdinand and his brown-eyed daughter, and Julie Westerman and Master Jakel [familiar characters from Danish fairs and amusement resorts].</p>
   <p>Three large orchestras furnished the music, and a chorus of one hundred small girls entertained in the concert hall. The Harmonien Chorus, the Danish Workers' Singing Society, and the Magneten Chorus did the vocal honors of the day. The main speakers were, Chief Justice Harry Olson [Swede], Carl Antonsen, Senator Niels Juul, Henry L. Hertz, and Christian Baun.</p>
