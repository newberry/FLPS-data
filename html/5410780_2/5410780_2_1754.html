   <p>The concert for the benefit of the national committee's relief fund was given last Sunday in Walhalla Hall, which was filled to capacity. It was a pleasant surprise to see so many West Side Danes. In fact, had the South Side, where the hall is located, been as well represented, the house would have been too small.</p>
   <p>The four great singing societies, the Women's Singing Society Illinois, the Workers' Singing Society, Harmonien, and Magneten participated. The program in itself was fine, as was its execution, but we wish to point out that for an exclusively Danish concert of this kind it should be possible to find a place on the program for more than one Danish composition; that is all there was. In our opinion Danish music should predominate on such an occasion. There is such a wealth of <span class="page-break">2</span>Danish tonal art, both old and modern, that the only difficulty might be in making a choice. We hope this mistake will not be repeated next year.</p>
   <p>All the singers and others who donated their services deserve our hearty thanks.</p>
   <p>The concert netted several hundred dollars, enabling the committee to bring help and Christmas cheer to many unfortunate Danish homes.</p>
