   <p>On April 20, last year, Chief Librarian J. Charles Bay gave a lecture on the subject "The Danish Folk High Schools" at Jacksonville, Florida, to a meeting sponsored by "The Conference for Education of the South." Besides giving an outline of the history of the Danish Folk High Schools, Charles Bay explained their aims, purposes, and scope of activity and closed as follows: "Some of the patterns, some of the fitness, may possibly appeal to us, as we attempt to solve the problems of our own country life."</p>
   <p>The lecture is now available in a pamphlet.</p>
