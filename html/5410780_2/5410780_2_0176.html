   <p>This paper supports a movement for the closing of all clothing stores Wednesday and Friday at 6 P.M.</p>
   <p>The next step will be for them to close on Sundays, also. Sunday closing is already the case with all department, furniture, and jewelry stores on Milwaukee Avenue. The movement for closing on Sundays is rapidly gaining among grocers and butchers on the whole Northwest Side.</p>
   <p>This will give many people more rest and recreation. This is in harmony with the democratic principle of shortening the working hours of the laboring class.</p>
