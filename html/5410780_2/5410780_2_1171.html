   <p>p. 2.. Our well known, industrious Mr. Rolandsen, director of the Crown Theatre, has just received a series of the latest and best motion pictures from Denmark, the first of which will be shown tomorrow.</p>
   <p>Denmark is among the leaders in this industry. Clever authors create exciting plots and intrigues, acted by the finest players. Many well known faces from the Copenhagen stage can be seen during the next few weeks at Mr. Rolandsen's theater. There is a change of program every week.</p>
