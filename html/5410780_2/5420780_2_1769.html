   <p>The report from the committee struggling to free Niels Kjar (leading Danish-American communist), is as follows: The resolutions sent to Scandinavian organizations, by the committee, in most cases, were adopted by acclamation.</p>
   <p>Many organizations had protested that they would have nothing to do with politics, but later decided that this was not a political issue, and voted for the resolutions.</p>
   <p>Niels Kjar, sends his thanks, through a number of newspapers, to the forty Danish and many other societies that adopted the various resolutions.</p>
   <p>The Danish National Committee went into action wholeheartedly.</p>
