   <p>At a meeting last week, the Danish Peace Committee passed the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"We, the Danish citizens of Chicago, desire to place on record our deep sorrow that so horrible a war should occur in our day of advanced civilization.</p>
   <p>"We earnestly hope and pray that the war may come to an end and that the sacrifice of life and the suffering of women and children may soon be over.</p>
   <p>"While we are citizens of this great Republic and are fully mindful of <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>our allegiance and devotion to our adopted country, Denmark's position in the hour of Europe's catastrophe, moves our hearts and memories, and we pray and hope that she may not be drawn into war.</p>
   <p>"Inasmuch as today's civilization, its progress in knowledge, and desire to protect humanity have been insufficient to save us from universal war, we believe the world will soon be ready to listen to complete disarmament plans, and we urge Congress to propose a compact among all nations to that effect.</p>
   <p>"We heartily commend the enlightened stand of President Woodrow Wilson, who, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>while offering his service as mediator to the belligerents, counsels calm neutrality and more devoted citizenship on the part of all classes of Americans."</p>
