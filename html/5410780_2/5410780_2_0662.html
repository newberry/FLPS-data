   <p>Mr. Oscar C. Tofte, secretary since 1892 of the Danmark Singing Society, of North Troy, New York, insists that the Danish-American press is wrong in stating that Harmonien is the oldest singing society in America.</p>
   <p>The Denmark Singing Society was founded in 1885, or one year before Harmonien. Danmark celebrated its fiftieth anniversary in 1935. It still has fifty-three active and passive members, of whom five have been in the Society since 1885.</p>
