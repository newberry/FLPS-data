   <p>The Children's Benefit league is sponsoring a tag day, Oct. 15, for the benefit of needy children. The Danish Children's home also belongs to the league, and last year received $1,500 from the proceeds of the tag day. This year 120 Danish women will be stationed at certain intersections, the location of which we are not in a position to announce, but there will be ample opportunity for Danish men and women to make their contributions for the benefit of Danish children, as well as for children of other nationalities.</p>
