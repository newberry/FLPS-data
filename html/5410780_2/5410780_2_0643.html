   <p>The Review called 'Den kaere Familie" and "Rejsen til Mars" was played twice on March 21, in Bjorgvin Hall. The first part, written by Geo.Andrea, was very funny, the second part was written by Mr. Johansen. An operette: "Lille Nitouche" was also played; it is a favorite with the colony. The music was arranged by Mrs. Agnes Mathisen. There is no doubt that the day will give a nice profit to the sponsors.</p>
