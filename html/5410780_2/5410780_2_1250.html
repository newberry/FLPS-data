   <p>The Danish Rifle Club observed the 23rd anniversary of its founding last Saturday with a banquet in Metropolitan Hall.</p>
   <p>The attendance was unexpectedly large, and last-minute arrangements had to be made in order to accommodate the many members and friends who wished to help the club pass this milestone.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers were the champion sharpshooter Westergaard and the track star Christensen of the Danish-American Athletic Club, who suggested a merger of the two organizations. The club's honorary member, the battle-scarred professional boxer "Battling" Nelson, was accorded an ovation fit for a king when he addressed the gathering and recounted a few humorous episodes from his fighting career.</p>
   <p>Good sportsmanship and joviality characterized the celebration, which continued into the wee hours.</p>
