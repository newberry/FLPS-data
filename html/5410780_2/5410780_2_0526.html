   <p>Mr. Thorvald Federeksen came from Denmark to Chicago a few months ago, and has recently been appointed teacher of music composition at the well-known Drake School of Music at the Auditorium. He is also teaching piano and organ privately. A collection of Mr. Fredereksen's compositions, consisting mainly of children's songs, will be published in English soon.</p>
   <p>Mr. Fredereksen has considerable experience as a chorus conductor and is going to conduct a course in sight reading and harmony. He plans to use the Belgian-Finnish method which was used very successfully in Denmark. By this method, the student, with no previous musical knowledge has learned to sing from notes without difficulty. Mr. Fredereksen has studied this new system of vocal training under the tutelage of Professor Nebelung, and is of the opinion that it will be met with enthusiasm in this country. He hopes that both <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>individuals and singing societies will take advantage of the new course.</p>
