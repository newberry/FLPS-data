   <p>At the meeting of the Danish National Committee, held last Monday night, the subject of finances was brought up for discussion. The profit from our annual festival appeared to be $2,456.01. From this sum, $1,000 was donated to the Aid and Relief Fund, $300 to the Danish Old People's Home, and $500 to the Danish Children's Home. The remaining $456.01 were added to the Guarantee Fund, which now amounts to $1,863.</p>
   <p>The National Committee sponsored a collection for the benefit of the suffering inhabitants of the flooded districts in Southern Illinois; $628.50 was collected and turned over to Mayor Dever's Flood Relief Fund.</p>
   <p>The Danish National Committee's Aid and Relief Fund, which was organized for the benefit of Danish people in need, spent a total of $2,076.15 during the last year. It has a balance of $3,403 on hand, besides the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>thousand dollars donated annually by the National Committee; but the calls for help seem to increase in number.</p>
