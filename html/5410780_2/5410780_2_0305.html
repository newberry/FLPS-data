   <p>p.3.....The young Danish physician, P. C. Clemsen, who at one time was assistant to Dr. C. Fenger, and who at the present time is a lecturer in anatomy at Northwestern University Medical School, recently delivered a lecture before the Chicago Medical Society on Dr. Finsen's light cure method. This lecture with illustrations and a picture of Dr. Finsen, was later published in the "Journal of the American Medical Association," and has now been released in pamphlet form.</p>
   <p>The thesis, which has been approved by Dr. Finsen, is undoubtly the most illuminating exposition of his method, as yet presented in this country. In the near future, the method will be introduced for practical use in America. According to "Dannebrog," several American doctors have recently visited Copenhagen, among them being the Stewart brothers, who have made a thorough study of the light institute, and are going to conduct a similar institute in Chicago.</p>
