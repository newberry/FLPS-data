   <p>p.2... As a result of his article in Twentieth Century Magazine, "Judicial Usurpation," which was also discussed in Revyen, our countryman Otto Christensen has received a short letter from Theodore Roosevelt, in which the ex-president compliments him on the interesting article and intimates that he will comment on it in the near future.</p>
   <p>Whether this comment will be published in Revyen, Twentieth Century Magazine, or The Outlook, Mr. Roosevelt did not say; probably in the latter publication, of which he is associate editor.</p>
