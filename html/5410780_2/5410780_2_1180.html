   <p>Miss Olivia Olson called a meeting last Friday at the Workingmen's Hall in regard to the question of opening Scandinavian schools, or at least one school for the progressive youth. The meeting was not as well attended as it should have been. Every one seemed to be interested and promised their support to Miss Olivia Olson. The school should be free so as to help keep the young people off the streets. The students must be taught things not taught in the public schools.</p>
   <p>Ways of securing money to rent rooms and to pay for gas and heat will be taken up at the next meeting. It is believed that teachers can be secured without charge, and that they would be glad to donate a few hours a week to a project of this type.</p>
