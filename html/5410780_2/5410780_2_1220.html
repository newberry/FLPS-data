The meeting was arranged by the mortgage committee of the Danish Old Peoples Home in co-operation with many Danish societies. Mr. Riis brought a greeting from the Danish King and told about his recent trip to Denmark. The editor of Revyen did not like all this talk about the old king of Denmark.</p>
