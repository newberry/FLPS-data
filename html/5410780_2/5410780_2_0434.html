   <p>The old Danish hotel Dannevirke on Milwaukee Avenue will soon go out of existence. The hotel was bought in 1873 or 1874 by Mr. C. Hansen, who previously had a hotel with the same name on West Kinzie Street. During the World's Columbian Exposition he was offered $10,000 for the establishment, and shortly after Mr. Hansen's death his wife was offered $2,500.</p>
   <p>The neighborhood has changed. At one time there were many Scandinavians there, but more and more Jews and Southern Europeans have moved in.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Hansen has sold all the furniture, and has moved to Rockwell Street, where she has opened a boardinghouse for her old friends.</p>
