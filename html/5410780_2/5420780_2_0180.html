   <p>The eminent scholar, Dr. J. Franklin Jameson, director of the department of historical research of the Carnegie Institution, is another example of a native American who is doing his best to assist in the well-organized and widespread attempt to discredit the sacred historical work of the American nation, and bring our country under the influence and control of a foreign power.</p>
   <p>We do not doubt the scientific ability of the learned doctor, but we have very serious doubts as to his patriotism. He has recently discovered in a Paris library a book by a French traveler who visited the colonies in 1765. By quoting from this book, Dr. Jameson endeavors to destroy the historical fact that Patrick Henry delivered a patriotic speech in the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1765, which was the real beginning of the <span class="page-break">2</span>American opposition against George III, at least in a public way.</p>
   <p>But what flimsy evidence for a scientist to use! We take from our shelves William Wirt's "Life of Patrick Henry", from which we read:</p>
   <p>"It was in the midst of this magnificent debate, while he was discoursing on the tyranny of the obnoxious act, that he exclaimed in a voice of thunder and with the look of a god, "Caesar had his Brutus; Charles I, his Cromwell; and George III --.' 'Treason,Treason', echoed from every part of the House. It was one of those trying moments which are decisive of character. Henry faltered not an instant, but rising to a loftier attitude and fixing on the Speaker an eye of the most determined fire, he finished his sentence with the firmest emphasis, 'may profit by their example. If this be treason, make the most of it.' "</p>
   <p>What the French traveler, whose name does not appear in his book, and whom nobody knows, says, we shall not quote in extenso, but the gist of it is <span class="page-break">3</span>that Henry almost went down on his knees and begged the Speaker and the House to forgive him for the unwarranted expression, and that he vehemently affirmed his allegiance to George III. It is more important to quote The Advocate of Peace, a Washington paper, which is endowed with funds from the Carnegie Institution. In bringing the discovery before its readers, it writes the following introduction:</p>
   <p>"New evidence has just been brought to public attention which tends to show that Patrick Henry did not rise to a loftier attitude, fix on the Speaker an eye of the most determined fire, and say, 'and George III may profit by their example. If this be treason, make the most of it,' but something quite to the contrary. Indeed, he is now pictured as asking pardon on that occasion for mentioning Caesar and Charles I in connection with George III. The document just brought to light, which reveals Henry as most loyal to His Majesty George III, has all the appearance of a discovery of real importance.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>"It will be something of a sad blow for the many who have been brought up under the glow of that alleged defiance, but the new evidence is very convincing. It now looks as if we must expunge that oft-quoted speech from our history, and eliminate at least the climax of it from our erstwhile patriotic prepossessions."</p>
   <p>It is not possible that a man of the least scientific ability can seriously entertain such a preposterous idea. It must be a piece of propaganda for some un-American cause. Every nation has its lore, if its ancestry reaches back into the gray mist of antiquity. But we are a young nation, and history on American soil only dates back to the beginning of the seventeenth century. Our history is, therefore, clear to everybody except propagandists.</p>
   <p>The travelers of the eighteenth century were, as a rule, very inaccurate in their statements. And there is no sound reason why an anonymous French writer should be accorded the preference to William Wirt, who was an American historian of repute and trustworthiness. Even in our day, European travelers <span class="page-break">5</span>race through our country and divert their own countrymen with narratives that teem with falsehoods. And probably that French writer did not even know English enough to understand intelligently what he heard.</p>
   <p>It is true William Wirt was not present in the House of Burgesses when Henry delivered his ever-memorable speech, but he names sources, such as the eminent John Tyler, Thomas Jefferson, and Paul Carrington. We know nothing about the unnamed French author, but we do know the three great patriots who were all present.</p>
   <p>And other good evidence is Henry himself. The whole speech is in most intimate accord with his fiery nature. But it is not only Patrick Henry, but every patriot of the American Revolution and the Revolution itself, that some Americans wish to discredit in order to exonerate English from all wrongdoing.</p>
   <p>It is disgusting to see native Americans enlisted in such an unworthy <span class="page-break">6</span>cause. We Americans of foreign birth, however, will always be ready to support the United States, the American nation, the American Constitution, and our sacred traditions, regardless of what others may do, but there is sufficient reason to ask: Whither are we drifting?</p>
