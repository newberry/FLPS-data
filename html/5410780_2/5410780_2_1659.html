   <p>The Danish Old Peoples' Home Society enjoyed ideal weather and a large attendance last Sunday for its excursion to its Home in Norwood Park.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Agnes Mathiesen's concert on the veranda was so enjoyable that we would like to suggest that more of the same kind be given on Sundays during the summer season.</p>
   <p>Most of the residents of the Home were up and about, dressed in their finest togs, and enjoying themselves among friends and countrymen, while some were confined to bed and received visitors in their rooms.</p>
