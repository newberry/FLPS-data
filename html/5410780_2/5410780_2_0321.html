   <p>Being a doctor is possibly the hardest task in life. Ingratitude is generally felt toward the doctors, especially if the patient dies.</p>
   <p>Last Monday two Scandinavian doctors were appointed senior physicians on the County Hospital staff by the County Board. They are Dr. Fenger and Dr. S. D. n, both graduates of the University of Copenhagen.</p>
   <p>It is a victory for the Scandinavians that their doctors are being given public appointments, based on their skill. There is no salary, but there is honor and opportunity.</p>
