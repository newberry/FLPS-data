   <p>The plan to lease Dania Hall to the city of Chicago for use as a municipal court during the rebuilding of the old police station at Chicago Avenue and May Street has been abandoned. The city comptroller, who is on the warpath with Chief Justice Olson, has refused to sign the lease, the terms of which had been agreed upon. The net result of the transaction is a loss to Dania of a number of potential rentals that were cancelled or turned down under the impression that the deal with the city would go through.</p>
