   <p>The delegates of the Danish societies in Chicago met to decide whether they wanted to participate in the dedication after the vice-consul, C. M. Koedt, decided to place Hans Christian Andersen's status in Lincoln Park, although most of the delegates had voted for Humboldt Park. A vote was taken (only fourteen of the twenty--six societies had sent delegates). Nine voted for participating in the unveiling of the statue.</p>
