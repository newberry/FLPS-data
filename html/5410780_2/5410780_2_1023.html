   <p>"Jylland Mellem Tvende Have" has been translated by Alfred G. Andersen and given the title "Song of Jutland." The translation is good, and is as follows:</p>
   <p>Jutland, ocean-skirted haven,</p>
   <p>Is a runestave 'tween the seas,</p>
   <p>Dolmens are the runes engraven</p>
   <p>Deep among the forests trees</p>
   <p>And upon the ample floor</p>
   <p>Of the mirage-haunted mow.</p>
   <p>Jutland! Thou art Denmark's mother:</p>
   <p>Heights where forest stillness bides;</p>
   <p>Westward, piled on one another,</p>
   <p>Rugged down the mountain sides.</p>
   <p>Baltic wave and North Sea meet</p>
   <p>O'er the sand at Skaen's feet.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>On the moor, nigh past believing,</p>
   <p>See yourself this virgin ground,</p>
   <p>Heather-decked and softly heaving,</p>
   <p>Blossom strewed for miles around.</p>
   <p>Hurry hither! Come before</p>
   <p>Grainfields drape the dwindling moor.</p>
   <p>Jutland, ocean-skirted haven,</p>
   <p>Is a runestave 'tween the seas:</p>
   <p>Cairns with love of foretime laden,</p>
   <p>Roots of future growth and peace.</p>
   <p>East and west the breakers roar</p>
   <p>A tune to the Jutland shore.</p>
   <p>Hans Christian Anderson.</p>
