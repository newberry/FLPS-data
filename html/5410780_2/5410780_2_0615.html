   <p>An expectant audience filled the Garrick Theater last night. The occasion was the first appearance of Adam Poulsen from the National Theater of Copenhagen. He played the lead in "Ambosius". An epilogue had been written by the Danish American author, L. C. Nielsen. The epilogue was read by Carl Antonsen. Then the orchestra played the Overture from "Elverhoj", and the play was on. Poulsen's acting was superb. Mrs. Nahalie Poulsen, his wife, played the role of Abigal. The rest of the cast was of Chicago professionals. The casting was as follows: N. Lind as the Baron, Ove Knudsen as "Junke Nils", William Bang as Peder Deyer, doubling as Pastor Soren, Mrs. Gudrun Jacobsen as the Chambermaid was outstanding, and last Magrethe Herman as the countess was also worth mentioning.</p>
   <p>It is a great honor for our local talent to appear with Adam Poulsen.</p>
