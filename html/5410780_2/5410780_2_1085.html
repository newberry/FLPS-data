   <p>There has recently been a change at the Chicago office of the Danish Pioneer, Omaha, Nebraska. The general agent, Rene, and the correspondent, Carl Antonsen, were fired or retired.</p>
   <p>In their stead P. Thornum was appointed as general agent and A. C. Neilsen as correspondent.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: There has always been much jealousy between the Pioneer and Revyen. The Pioneer, which has eight pages and is written mostly for the farmers of the Middle West, has a whole page with news from the Danish colony in Chicago.]</p>
