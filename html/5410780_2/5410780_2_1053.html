   <p>Twenty years ago, April 20, 1895, the first issue of Revyen (The Review), was published. The Revyen was a continuation of Volkmar Johnsen's humorous paper Ha Ha, and the first issue of the Revyen became volume two, number five.</p>
   <p>Revyen's first number contained much diversified material. It had articles about: "Terror" the remedy for killing bed bugs and other pests, and the company formed by C. Momberg, Jens Jensen (the king), Fernand Andrea, and Robert Petersen to market this product. An article about P. Nissen, who went over Niagara Falls in a special made boat, but later lost his (crazy) life, trying to roll across Lake Michigan in a cube or ball made of canvas.</p>
   <p>The advertisers in the first issue were: Dr. Svenning Dahl, Dr. Waldemar Pleth, Dr. Theodor Nielsen, Dentist Friis, and the William <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Gerner Piano Company.</p>
   <p>In the following issues we will have a column, "Twenty Years Ago", in which we will give our readers an idea of what happened at that time</p>
