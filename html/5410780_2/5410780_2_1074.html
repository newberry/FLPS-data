   <p>Revyen is interested in socialism, but does not wish to join any particular socialist party. Revyen does not like the Republican party, which it considers merely a capitalistic party. In 1896 the paper supported the Democrats, because it thought that this party would help the workingmen, but the last four years have shown that there is really no difference between the two major parties in American politics; they both stand for capitalism.</p>
   <p>Revyen is for reform. It fully understands that much has to happen and many years will pass before the laboring class gets the majority of votes in the United States. Revyen wishes to work for the economic independence of the common people; any reform that will bring us nearer to this goal has the paper's full support.</p>
