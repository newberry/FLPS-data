   <p>Harmonien gave its annual spring concert and ball last Saturday in Schoenhofen's Hall. To start with, there were many empty seats, but later on the house became well filled.</p>
   <p>Miss Alpha Henriksen, with her excellent singing, strengthened her hold on her already devoted public. She mastered the great aria of "The Troubadour" with great aplomb and rendered a number of small romantic songs, among them "April Morn," and Grieg's "I Love You," with genuine charm and feeling.</p>
   <p>The society is enjoying a steady growth in membership, stimulated by the planned excursion to the San Francisco fair in 1915. For this concert it was therefore able to muster a choir of some fifty voices, in spite of the fact that some of the active singers were unable to attend. In addition, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>some new-comers are still in training. Mr. Mosberg, the director, has developed a choir which ranks among the best, and which renders the great classics, as well as the less elaborate numbers, with rare skill and beauty.</p>
   <p>It is enough to say that Hans Schmidt's orchestra furnished the best possible concert and dance music.</p>
