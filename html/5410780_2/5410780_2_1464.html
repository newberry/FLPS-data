   <p>L. Hoffenblad, who has worked for the Danish Sisterhood of America twenty-five years--and he was Supreme Secretary for twenty-three years--was given a fine diamond ring by all the lodges.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hoffenblad and J. C. Eskesen helped the sisters over the crucial period in 1885. Dagmar Lodge No. 4 had just been started, and Hoffenblad was its first treasurer. He wrote to several lodges of the Danish Brotherhood, with the result that within a very short time eleven lodges of the Sisterhood were started.</p>
