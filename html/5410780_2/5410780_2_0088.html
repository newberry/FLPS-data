   <p>"Mr. Roosevelt's foreign policy (in regard to Germany and Mexico) as revealed in these two statements, is to run a gigantic bluff. The moment anyone calls that bluff, we shall have war. All the devices that diplomacy has devised to give time for the cooling of passions and the gaining of wisdom are swept aside, and the world's business is put back on the basis of a poker game in a frontier saloon, a gambling bluff with the six-shooter as referee."</p>
