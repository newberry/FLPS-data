   <p>A concert given by Trinity's Young People's Orchestra last Friday night turned out to be a success. The basement hall was packed to capacity, and the programme was excellently arranged, with Opera Singer Paul Bai and little Phyllis Dahue as soloists. The latter revealed unquestionable dramatic talent, and was irresistible in her elocution. Of Paul Bai's presentations "The Three Comrades" was received with actual enthusiasm. In this song his artistry came to its full expression, and the audience called for several da capo numbers. Young Mr. Glen Holtan played several rather difficult arrangements on the piano. But the crowning hit of the evening was "Desert Caravan" played by the orchestra with astonishing skill. With the various instruments clearly distinguishable the musicians managed to convey an actual oriental atmosphere to the audience. As a closing number the orchestra played a selection of patriotic melodies.</p>
   <p>Mr. John Andersen, young energetic leader and conductor of the orchestra, deserves appreciation for his work of promoting good music.</p>
