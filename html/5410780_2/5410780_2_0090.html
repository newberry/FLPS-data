   <p>The Navy of the United States cost seventy million dollars last year, and this year the Secretary of the Navy will demand and get one hundred million dollars. This is a great deal of money to cast into the sea. It would be much better to use the money for sick people, the old, and for the education of our poor children in the slum districts. All forms of militarism are unproductive and inhuman in the long run, and a disgrace to modern civilization.</p>
