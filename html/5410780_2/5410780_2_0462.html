   <p>The American-Scandinavian Review for May-June contained an article concerning our notable compatriot, Jens Jensen, who, perhaps, is the leading landscape architect of the world, and a philosopher and poet of outdoor planning, besides being an artist in his field.</p>
   <p>This is mentioned because Jens Jensens' plans always seem to harmonize with the surroundings, and give expression for excellent ideas. His fight against corrupt politics in the Park System are mentioned also.</p>
   <p>This grand, fighting Dane came from Dybbol in Schleswig thirty-six years ago, and started as an ordinary worker in the Chicago parks, and is now hailed by both American and European critics as a really great creative landscape <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>architect. But more than this his wonderful gardens and his contributions to this country have been revealing the individual, personal beauty of America herself, and inspiring thousands of people a hitherto unrealized appreciation and understanding of nature.</p>
