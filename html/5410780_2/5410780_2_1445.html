   <p>A large and distinguished public attended the Danish Odd Fellows' very successful evening of entertainment last Saturday in Walhalla Hall.</p>
   <p>The high spot of the evening was a number built around the theme "A Night in Venice," and which reached its climax when a gondola, with Mr. Olaf Christensen as gondolier, was paraded around the hall under a rain of confetti and ribbons in all the colors of the rainbow.</p>
   <p>The famous Weber Quartet, one of the best in the city, rendered a number of beautiful songs, and was rewarded with thundering applause.</p>
   <p>King Jensen's delicious fish dinner, trimmed with a variety of Italian delicacies, contributed to everybody's well-being, and who did not want to dance when Ole Nielse struck up the band.</p>
   <p>The Danish Odd Fellow Lodge is making steady progress, and now has a membership of 230.</p>
