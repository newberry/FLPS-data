   <p>The Ebenezer Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church has arranged a great Danish song festival in the German Lutheran Church on Paulina Street between North and Milwaukee Avenues on Sunday, October 14. This church has a seating capacity of two thousand. Choirs from Racine, Kenosha, and Chicago will sing. The profit from the concert will go to a sanatorium in Brush, Colorado, an institution supported by the Danish Lutheran Church and well worth giving a helping hand.</p>
