   <p>Foreign in language, but American in spirit; This may be said not only of the Danish Times, but with few, if any, exceptions of all newspapers printed in the United States in languages other than English.</p>
   <p>The remarkably efficient and patriotic work of foreign language publications in Chicago during the War is of recent memory, and it must ever stand as one of the proud pages in the history of Chicago journalism. The press of Chicago, and particularly that element of it which, with broad vision, studies the evolution, is slowly creating an American people out of seeds from the ends of the world and will welcome the advent of this newspaper. It will not only keep the Danish born of the middle west in touch with events and problems of peculiar interest to themselves, but through them it will go far to enrich American civilization with the culture, art, sentiment, and aspirations, which may be borrowed from Danish history and Danish life.</p>

   <p>I believe there are more than twenty or perhaps thirty foreign language papers in Chicago. Each of them is a force in the rapid development of Americanism, each is a chemical in the great melting pot. Their responsibility is great for they are moulding the thought of millions of potential or actual Americans, in whose hands are the destinies of our new nation.</p>
   <p>In the life of a newspaper covering a quarter of a century, I, too, have been a reader of foreign language newspapers, for I have been in lands where the English tongue was distinctly foreign. China, for instance, or Korea.</p>
   <p>The Russians and the Japanese were at War fifteen years ago, and my work as a correspondent carried me to the little coolie city of Chefoo, in the province of Shantung, sixty miles across the gulf of pichili, from the then Russian fortress of Port Arthur.</p>
   <p>There were few people in Chefoo who claimed the English tongue as their own, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>but we had to have our newspaper, and as always happens, there came a man to supply it. The Chefoo Daily News was a four page paper, but it had cable dispatches, which kept us in touch with our own people and at the same time served to encourage and solidify the handful of us who were so far adrift.</p>
   <p>I spent a month in Seoul, the capital of Korea, and then, too, a daring publisher gave us what to the orientals was a foreign language newspaper. This publication ran afoul of the Japanese government. The editor rather favored the Russian side of the argument and was a person who spoke and wrote his mind. Therefore, he was in jail for a while. I mention this only because in this free country your paper may voice the opinion of its readers, and remain at large under a constitution which guarantees the freedom of the press.</p>
   <p>The immigrant in the United States brings with him knowledge of what was best and most beneficial in the politics of the fatherland, and very often and enthusiasm for those of his adopted country. The Dane comes with political <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>views gained in one of the most liberal and democratic countries in the world, his home country. It is well that he should have a newspaper which will preserve and renew these views for the benefit of the great democracy in which he now finds himself.</p>
   <p>The importance of his attitude may best be gleaned, perhaps, from the fact that it is the custom of the President of the United States to keep in touch with the editorial sentiment of the foreign language papers. Secretaries read these papers, and a digest is prepared for the President. Occasionally an entire editorial, or a news article, if unusual, or of great importance, is presented to him. This is only natural. To be President of all the people, it is necessary to keep in touch with the sentiment of all the people.</p>
   <p>Under the new management of the Danish Times and the Review (Revyen), the Danish people of Chicago will exert a stronger influence in shaping the policy of the government under which they have chosen to live, for they have a mouthpiece through which they may be heard collectivly. Through correspondents <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>in Europe they may enjoy news of the arts, poetry, industry, agriculture, politics, and administration of the home country.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Franck-Philipson is well-known to newspapermen of Chicago, and was a director of the Press club during the year I was honored with the presidency. Kristian Baun, the editor, whose magic pen is known throughout the world, will be the greatest contribution on the staff of Danish Times.</p>
