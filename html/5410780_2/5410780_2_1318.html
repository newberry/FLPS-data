   <p>The Danish Athletic Club Danevirkes Marked will have its big nine-day meet from January 6 to January 15. Everyone should come to Danevirkes meet; it will be the greatest treat you ever had. The program is an excellent one. We cannot describe it in full. If you come you will think you are back in Copenhagen in the Pleasure Grove of the Danish Parks. Vaudeville, merry-go-rounds, Danish restaurants, imported Danish beer, etc., will be found there.</p>
