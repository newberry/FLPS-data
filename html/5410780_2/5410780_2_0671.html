   <p>Every immigrant that ever landed on the shores of this, our great adopted country, brought with him a sacred gift from the mother-land, namely song.</p>
   <p>A gift that, like Aladding's Lamo. brings back to us the sweetest memories from childhood with mother's lullaby, memories from youth and growing manhood, memories of a nightingale's song on s moonlit night, memories of the great traditions of the mother-land, and memories from field and fjord.</p>
   <p>We are not all singers, but we all possess that wonderful gift. Deep down in our hearts it is stored away and when we near those songs of yore it creeps up and brings out the emotions, and with a tear in our eye we welcome the flood of memories. Through this deeper meaning we learn to understand and appreciate all that the mother-land has done for us in preparing us to become good and useful citizens of this, our new country.</p>
   <p>The Danish Singers' League has arranged a program to be sung on "Denmark's Day" on the World's Fair Grounds on June 21st. In this program we find a beautiful selection of old Danish songs that we all know and love, such as <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>"I Denmark er jeg fodt," "Der er et yndigt Land," "Den visne Viol," "Hedeblomsten," "Wit fagre Hjem," and the more impressive works "Nordens Folkeand" and "Volmerslaget," and other American and Danish songs.</p>
   <p>The Danish Singers League held its first big Singers' festival in Chicago in 1922 with a concert in Orchestra Hall, assisted by Reinald Werrenrath as soloist, and Chicago Symphony Orchestra, directed by Carl Busch. Since that time we have held some very successful Singers Festivals in Kenosha, Detroit and Chicago. The Danish Singers League embraces the following Singing Societies;</p>

   <p>Take with you greetings from</p>
