   <p>Sunday, February 17, a series of Sunday concerts was started in Scandia Hall by a large union orchestra, under the leadership of M. Pedersen. There will also be a chance to dance a little if anyone wants to do so.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: These Sunday concerts proved a great success.]</p>
