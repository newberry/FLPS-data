   <p>The Dolls' Hospital, the manager of which is our compatriot, Theo Priis, has, during the few years become one of the popular, even necessary institutions of the Northwest Side. Mr. Priis is a master in his art and no child brings her doll to him in vain, whether it be the head, the arms, or the legs that need mending, or whether there be some other thing the matter with the dear dolly, Mr. Priis also sells new dolls, carrying a larger supply of large and small dolls than any other house in Chicago.</p>
