   <p>Den Danske Sangbog (The Danish Song-Book) is the title of a new song-book published by composer N. K. Madsen-Stensgaard. It differs from others by including short biographies of Nordic poets and composers. young and old. The arrangement appears to be fair, particularily to the composers who hitherto have been sort of neglected as far as publicity is concerned. The idea, we are sure, will appeal to the music loving public, even though we must admit that the songs have been selected rather uncritically. There is a total of 135 songs of the traditional kinds--morning, evening and patriotic songs, songs for children, Christmas, liberty, etc.</p>
   <p>The book is sold by M. R. Ackerman, 364 Milwaukee Ave., Chicago.</p>
