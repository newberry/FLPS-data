   <p>A meeting was called March 12 to start a Danish athletic club. After some discussion the name decided on was the Den Damske Gymnastik- og Athlet-Klub (The Danish Gymnastics and Athletic Club). A. J. Lassen is president; C. Termansen, vice-president; P. Buhl, treasurer; and H. S. Hagerup, secretary.</p>
   <p>The new society has nineteen members. All the effects from the old athletic club are at the disposal of the new club and also thirty-three dollars which was never used. The entrance fee is one dollar but this is lowered to fifty cents until April 1, in order that as many new members as possible may be secured.</p>
