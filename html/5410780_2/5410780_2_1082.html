   <p>With this issue Revyen appears in a new form. The paper is increased from 15 by 10 inches to 22 by 16 inches. It has four pages with seven columns on each page. The reading matter has increased 125 percent. Revyen is now No. 2 among the Danish weeklies in America, all church papers excepted. Editor is sure that Revyen will soon be No. 1.</p>
   <p>Note. There are no copies of Revyen for the months, May, June, July, August, September and October of 1899. The last issue we have is April 29, 1899 and the next one is Nov. 4, 1899. The apparent reason being that the former volumes of Revyen went from April 1st to one year to March 31st of the next year. The new size of the paper started with November 1899, so no one thought of having the few numbers in between bound.</p>
