   <p>Chicago had a tag day for the children October 17. It was arranged by the Children's Benefit League, which is made up of thirty-one different societies, each of which is given its own district. The money collected amounts to about $1,500 or $2,000 for each society.</p>
   <p>The Norwegian Children's Home received its share this year, but the Danish Children's Home did not accomplish enough to participate. It is hoped that the Danish Children's Home will share in next year's collection.</p>
