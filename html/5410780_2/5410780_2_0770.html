   <p>The singing society Magneten had a very lively meeting July 21. Three of the singers proposed that the constitution be changed so that non-members of the Danish Brotherhood might sing in the chorus, since the director of the chorus finds it difficult to secure sufficient material, and the lodges do not seem to give the chorus sufficient support. Then someone proposed that the singing society be dissolved, but that can not be done unless a special meeting is called for this purpose. A new meeting will be held at Jacobsen's Hall on July 27.</p>
