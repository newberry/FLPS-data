   <p>Although classes in gymnastics have not been very successful among Chicago Scandinavians, last fall a gymnasium was started by the Dansk Ungdomshjem (Danish Young People's Home), at 615 Davis Street. The leader is L. Jensen.</p>
   <p>The hall is very suitable for this purpose. The monthly dues are only fifteen cents, and there are classes for both men and women.</p>
