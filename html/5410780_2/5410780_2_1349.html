   <p>The Hans Christian Andersen monument was finally dedicated on September 26. Twelve hundred persons started from downtown, mostly Danes from the South Side. When they arrived at the park the crowd had grown to ten thousand persons. Everything went according to schedule, except that Mr. Carr could not come, due to a political engagement somewhere else.</p>
   <p>Niels Juul was master of ceremonies for the day. The best speeches were made by Reverend Dan and Judge Gibbons. Consul A. Petersen, who had given one thousand dollars toward this permanent memorial, also spoke, but in such a low tone that nobody could hear.</p>
