   <p>The well-announced tea party given by the women of the 110th Place School, which was held last week at the home of Mrs. C. Kostelyk, may be called a financial success. More than $77 was taken in for the building of a new school. When we plan a yearly meeting of three hundred members, just about thirty "Big Brothers" will attend. But when the women meet, there is nearly a one-hundred per cent attendance, which goes to show that mother is always the one on whose heart the question of Christian education presses the most.</p>
