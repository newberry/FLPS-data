   <p>P. 1.- In conjunction with the Hudson-Fulton celebrations in New York, the Dutch Chamber of Commerce in America has published a book depicting "The Dutch in New Netherland and the United States." It gives in short the main historical facts of the Dutch colonization in America, mainly those of Hudson's time in the East.</p>
   <p>The book is easy to read. It is well annotated, gorgeously bound and printed on good paper. It is worthy of a place on the bookshelves of every Dutch family.</p>
