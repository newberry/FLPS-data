   <p>Old Dutch art! Rembrandt. Frans Hals. Jan Steen. Wermeer. Gerard Down. Joseph Isreals of our century and others. Who does not know these names? What Dutchman is not proud to mention and hear those names mentioned? Masters in the art of reproducing life on canvas.' Yet there are few of us, who know much about the masters other than their names and very fer of the names of their works. We are conservative and do not bring forward the good that we possess in old Netherlands and in her history. Do not fail to hear the moving picture illustrated lecture of Dr. W. Martin, Director of the museum at the Hague and teacher of history of art at the University at Leyden.</p>
   <p>Dr. Martin on the 30th of this month, will lecture in the Dutch language on the West side of Chicago. Read the announcement in this number.</p>
