   <p>It would be impossible for us to recommend a candidate for alderman for every ward, for the reason that a great number of them are not inhabited by the Dutch, with the exception perhaps of a few families.</p>
   <p>In those wards where the Dutch are well represented, we recommend the candidates listed below, it being taken for granted that the fight will be between Republicans and Democrats, because the minor parties have no chance to succeed.</p>

   <p>Although several of our papers are for keeping politics out of the City Council, we feel it our duty to point out that the election of a Republican is more desired than that of a Democrat, provided, of course, that both candidates have the same abilities for the office.</p>
   <p>For the 33rd Ward we make no recommendations, since the situation in this ward is sufficiently known. Through the machinations of some Dutchmen, our countryman Mr. Zylstra, the Republican nominee a capable, upright, and sincere man, was defeated despite the great majority of votes he received at the primary election.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Things being what they are, we are giving both candidates the opportunity to have their say in this paper. Farther than that we cannot go. Let everyone vote according to his own conscience.</p>
