   <p>We wish to draw the attention of our readers to the advertisement of the above mentioned society, which is on page 8 of this number. The society in the 28 years of its existence, has made wonderful progress. With a capital of $39,000.00, and a membership of 11,500, it is the strongest proof that the Dutch are capable to do things, when they so desire.</p>
   <p>It is worth-while to listen to the story of those, who have laid the foundation of this mighty organization; how they had to fight antipathy as well as mistrust.</p>
