   <p>About three weeks ago, the Dutch-Anti-Saloon-League, held a public meeting at the Church building of the Christian Reformed Community of Douglas Park, on which occasion Dr. Walkotten of Roseland made a well constructed speech on "The saloon and the family".</p>
   <p>The report of that meeting sent to us, got lost, but we are mentioning it just the same, even if it is a little late, as an evidence, that the anti-saloon movement is gradually growing.</p>
