   <p>That our Dutch voters show very little sympathy, when one of our countrymen is running for nomination for a certain political job, was proven by the results in the 33rd, ward, where our Dutch candidate Mr. Ed. W. Jager, was defeated.</p>
   <p>If the Hollanders in that ward had not supported the political machine, but had cast their votes for Mr. Jager, then the result would have been entirely different.</p>
   <p>In the 30th, ward our countryman Henry Van Houten, was nominated for a Alderman, but this ward is so strongly Democratic, that hope of victory is nill. The Democratic party nominated the present Alderman Michael McInerney.</p>
