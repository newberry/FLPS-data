   <p>Absolute neutral education for us in unthinkable. It is education without a soul. A teacher who must smother his convictions, whatever they may be, before a class, cannot teach efficiently. And to cleanse the teachings in our public schools of Darwinism by law would, we fear, bear very little lasting fruit. Yet we can not ignore our public school education. As citizens, we are equally responsible. The character of our people is moulded by this education as Christian citizens. We must strive therefore to cleanse our schools as much as possible of corrupt elements. Who knows but what the eyes of the thinking part of the American Christians may be opened through Bryan's protest to the necessity of absolute Christian education at Christian schools?</p>
