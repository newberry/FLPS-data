   <p>I had just settled down for a comfortable evening, last Wednesday, when my eye happened to alight upon an item in Onze Toekomst telling about a debate between the Chicago Christian High School and the Grand Rapids Christian High School to be staged at the Second Christian Reformed Church of Englewood. Distances are so long in Chicago and the fire-side was so attractive, that I somewhat dreaded venturing out. But my previous visits to the school had aroused my interest to such an extent, that my conscience would not permit me to stay home.</p>
   <p>I made the trip to listen in to the debate. I got there a little early and overheard some of the boys and girls talking about a basket ball game of the evening before with Pullman Technological School in which, as the girls put it,"our boys licked them, 22 to 6!"</p>
   <p>The High School youngsters seemed quite happy about it. The debate was on the question whether or not the Philippines should be given their complete <span class="page-break">\2</span>and immediate independence. The Chairman of the evening was the Reverend Brat. The judges were Dr. Heyboer, Mr. Bere and Mr. Van Heyningen.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Christian High School was represented by its affirmative team composed of Henrietta Geerdes, Henry Stob, and Peter de Vries, while Howard Westing, Reinard Harkema and Melvin Minnema debated negative for Grand Rapids. What a contest it was. The debaters rolled out six-syllabled words as easily as I could use words of one syllable. They waxed eloquent about the justice or injustice of further retention, about the social, political and economic conditions, that did or did not permit of independence. And the Chicago debaters won by a unanimous decision of the judges, 3 to 0!</p>
   <p>I had enjoyed the evening so much, that I could not resist the temptation of going again the next evening to hear Chicago debate the Holland Christian High School representatives on the same topic at the Fourth Church of Chicago. There Mr. George Ottenhoff ably acted as Chairman. The Rev. Bel, Dr. Jonker and Mr. Flokstra served as judges. This time Henry Stob, John Rottier and Peter de Vries of the local High School met Edwin Heeringa, Betty van Vliet <span class="page-break">\3</span>and Edward Fisscher of the Holland Christian High School. Again they went at it tooth and nail. The boys seemed able and willing to settle the whole problem of the Philippine Independence once and for all. My only regret was that the members of Congress were not in the audience, so that they might receive some light on this momentous issue. After what seemed to be an interminable time the Chairman announced the decision of the judges. And again Chicago won 3 to O! As I left the building I heard one of the students say, "Our's is a nice school, our's is!" Meanwhile the negative team of Chicago was making a tour to Holland and Grand Rapids. Helen Zwiers, Anna Geerdes and Robert van Kampen made the trip to foreign fields to meet the affirmative teams of Holland and Grand Rapids. At Holland our team vanquished their opponents by a 3 to O vote. That made three unanimous decisions for Chicago. The next evening, however, they met a 2 to 1 defeat at the hands of Grand Rapids.</p>
   <p>It certainly was a great week for the Chicago Christian High School.</p>

   <p>Due credit must be given to the debaters, to the entire school and, more especially, to the English department for the marvelous showing that was made. The High School has been signally blessed. The community has been shown, that in the Chicago Christian High School it has a school in which it may well take pride.</p>
   <p>One of the Board members informs me that the Ladies Auxiliary has presented a gift of $4,000.00 to the building fund of the High School. The ladies have undertaken a noble task and are zealously carrying it out. They too deserve credit for what they are doing for the High School.</p>
