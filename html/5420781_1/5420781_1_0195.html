   <p>Last Wednesday, the cornerstone of the new Christian school on 15th street between Ashland and Paulina, was laid with fitting ceremonies. The festivities began at two o'clock in the afternoon. Before a large throng of interested people, Mr. H. Jacobsma, who functioned as master of ceremonies, opened the meeting and requested the singing of Psalm 105:5, after which he requested Dr. P. Moerdyke to lead in prayer. After the opening formalities, the Rev. H. Harmeling spoke masterfully before the meeting on the topic "The positive confession of God is necessary in the teaching of children". Following this the chair was given to Mr. A. Bulthuis, who with a few proper remarks laid the cornerstone of the new building, after which the meeting sang loud and clear Psalm 100:4, now the chair was given to Dr. P. Moerdyke, who made a beautiful speech in the English language, and his topic was: "Christiam instruction a necessity for good citizenship". The last speaker on the program was the Rev. C. De Leeun, who spoke about Christian instruction and the knowledge, which speech was outstanding through its simplicity and clearness, after which Rev. E. Breen led the meeting in a prayer of thanks to God. The Christian school on our West Side has progressed remarkably during its existence. It can boast now of 225 pupils with the following instructive personnel: Mr. H. Jacobsma, Mr. H. Van Dellen, Miss Jenney Van Wesep and Miss Katie Venema. The new school building will be built at a cost of $8,000.</p>
