   <p>The Society of the Roseland School for Christian Instruction on 104th Street held its annual meeting on Thursday evening, October 13. The attendance was encouraging, and the meeting was very important in the history of the school. The introductory address stated that the board had decided, on account of the great number of children in the lowest grade, to open a sixth schoolroom. Therefore the school is in a flourishing condition. The reports of the secretary and of the treasurer, especially that concerning the supply funds, reveal the progress of the school.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the reports the financial condition of the Society was discussed. Eleven volunteers tendered their services to pay off the mortgage on the school building within five years.</p>
   <p>The Reverend William Stuart gave a splendid address on "Ons Ideaal" (Our Ideal).</p>
   
   <p>The election did not result in any changes in the board.</p>
