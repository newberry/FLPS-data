   <p>The Chicago Christian High School still has a number of bonds for sale. If you like an opportunity to experience the three things, which make an investment a source of luck, then we advise you, unconditionally, to buy, those bonds. They offer good interest, namely six per cent, which is twice that offered by any bank. Furthermore they are a well insured and safe investment, which not only have a good lawful security, but more than that, have a righteous security from the entire society for Christian High School Education. And what is even more important, they offer the rest giving satisfaction, that while your money earns good interest in a safe investment, it is in the service of God's kingdom for the well being of his children. The Chicago Christian High School is in its ninth year of successful work. Next September it will need eight or nine teachers, and will have about 225 students. The work that is being done is of inestimable value for the spiritual and timely well being of our children, and is one of the bulwarks against the enemies who try every way to destroy God's kingdom and his truth. In case you are able to invest and can help, write or send a check to Mr. B. Ottenhoff, 7110 S. Halsted Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
