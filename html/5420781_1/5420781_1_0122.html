   <p>The alumni of the 110th Place Christian School worked out a beautiful program for the evening of February 11. Eighty former pupils came to listen to recitations and readings of the little ones, who are now in the first grade, and of those who were there twenty years ago.</p>
   <p>C. M. Myroup is president of the alumni. The alumni have done much good for this school in the last two years.</p>
   <p>May they continue in the good work.</p>
