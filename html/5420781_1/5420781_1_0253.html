   <p>The meeting held last Wednesday, March 15th, by the Dutch Society "Excelsior", was well attended.</p>
   <p>The big hall, too large to carry the voices of most of the speakers, was crowded. The presentations and dialogues were well rendered, though hampered by bad acoustics.</p>
   <p>The band "Harmonie", under the leadership of conductor G. Ottenhoff, played well, and has a right to special mention.</p>
