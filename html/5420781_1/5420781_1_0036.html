   <p>In the carrying out of my various duties, I occasionally have to make use of the surface lines to convey me from place to place. It was on one of these excursions, that I chanced to meet an acquaintance and naturally we began to chat about this, that, and the other thing. After having come to a rather definite agreement about the state of the weather, and having disposed of such major problems as the conditions of the roads and the quality of the street car service, we drifted to less important topics. One statement of my fellow passenger struck me with much force. He said rather boastingly: "I ain't done no readin' since I was tooken' out of the sevent' grade and set to work." He intimated, upon further questioning, that now he sometimes managed to glance over the headlines of the newspapers, but that further "learnin' was not for him." I sympathized with the man. I have myself been unable to get the education I desired. But due to the sacrifices and idealism of my parents I have been able to secure, at least, some training, meager though it may be. I sympathized with my companion for I could realize, in a small way, what he missed. He was blind <span class="page-break">2</span>to so many beautiful things in nature; his mind was closed to so many truths of God's revelation; he was compelled to live almost on bread and water alone. The most tragic of all was, that he felt that his condition could not be bettered, that he was past the "learning" stage. For today it is more true than ever before, that is never too late to learn. To be sure, circumstances do not permit everyone to attend our schools and colleges, but there are so many agencies existing to-day that enable one to acquaint himself with the arts and sciences during his leisure hours. Our sturdy fore-fathers, though they were hard-pressed with the care and toil of eking out a bare existence, yet found time to acquaint themselves thoroughly with the best that was in religious literature. And now the working day is shorter and the opportunities for advancement are much greater. There are the bookshops selling books and periodicals for prices within reach of us all.</p>
   <p>There are the libraries with their priceless store open to all, so that "he who runs may read." There are the correspondence courses, sponsored by institutions of every kind. There are the night schools offering courses on every imaginable <span class="page-break">3</span>subject. These opportunities are open to all who wish to take advantage of them, quite different from the class systems that exist in European countries and are, most fortunately, almost non-existent here. I think it is our duty to make use of the many opportunities offered us to train our God-given minds. We should not permit the field of our intellect to lie dormant. It is encouraging to notice, that among the thousands who make use of the evening schools of our city, there are also a few of our young men and young women. But can not we ourselves do something along this line? The Union of Christian Schools is planning to give correspondence courses dealing with normal training. Why should this work not be extended? Our Mission Training School has for some years now, offered evening classes on various subjects aiming at preparations for missionary work, and may are taking these courses. That is a step in the right direction. Sometime ago I overheard one of the Christian High School teachers (I think it was the Professor of Science) speak of having evening classes in the high school building on whatever subjects might be in demand. And why not? The building is there; the equipment is there; and I am sure that the teachers would be willing to add to their present heavy load - <span class="page-break">4</span>one or two evening classes per week. If the plan is worthwhile it could be carried out now. Perhaps the new Principal, when he has had sufficient time to acquaint himself completely with local conditions, can take this up with the faculty and the Board..For we all must do our share in helping those who, though they have been prevented by circumstances previously, are now doing their best to better themselves intellectually so that they may assume a more influential position in the complex life of which they form a part.</p>
