   <p>Our Dutch friend, Miss Agness Bloemsma, one of the daughters of Mr. P. Bloemsma, President of the Society "Eendracht Maakt Macht," (In union there is strength) is one of the six fortunate girls, who won in the contest published by the Chicago Examiner.</p>
   <p>The winners will make a trip to Europe at the expense of the above mentioned newspaper. They will visit Plymouth, London, Brussels, Cologne, Wiesbaden, Heidelberg, and Munchen, and later attend the Passion-Play at Oberammergau. From there they will go to Lucerne, Paris and Versailles.</p>
   <p>These six girls are entrusted to the care of Dr. Helen R. Kellogg. They will sail on the steamer "General Grant," and return on the S. S. "Blucher," about the 1st of September.</p>
   <p>Our Dutch friend expresses her sincere thanks to all those, who have helped her win, especially the gentlemen: J. Jasper, A. Gent, C. B. Koop, B. Zechandelaar, and H. Wolterding, also to the partners and assistants of Chas. A. Stevens and Brothers, where she was employed as a telephone operator.</p>
