   <p>It is not alone the thrill idols (as the moving pictures were titled recently by a sister newspaper) who are worshipped by the idol worshippers who attend the movies, but the persons who are being photographed, who pose for the plays, that are really the personifications of this new and general idol worship. Actors and actresses who play the main roles for the movies, the stars, receive unbelievably large salaries. They live as kings and queens and as such they are honored by the public. Charles Chaplin, an English-Jewish boy, raised at the footlights, has, by making faces and being funny, within a short time made a fortune in this country, and has won a place in the hearts of most of our school children. And not along in America, but also in Europe. Last year he made a trip to the Old Country. Nowhere could he go but the people awarmed around him to do him honor. Mary Pickford, the brightest of the film stars, a small bundle of humanity less than five feat in height, during a visit in Paris was carried on the people's shoulders and in all the capitals of Europe was hailed as "Our Mary" and her husband, her second, as "Our Doug." All these and other celluloid stars, with hundreds of others in the making, live in a so-called colony at Hollywood, near Los Angeles, California.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>That, that was made public from Hollywood recently is all but good. As we said before, these people receive fabulous salaries. And they are strong legs, which can carry riches.</p>
   <p>Now as far as that goes, Hollywood houses a weak-legged battalion. Scandalous drinking, petting, parties, harem plays, eastern opium evenings and nights and all forms of scandal and vice take place there. Life as it is portrayed on the screen is to a large extent a reflection of what really takes place in Hollywood.</p>
   <p>You may have read of the party last Labor Day, which was held in one of the hotels, that culminated in a scandalous murder, in which the fat idiot, Arbuckle was involved and for which he is still held. You may also have read of the murder of one of the film directors, Taylor, a man with a shady past, some weeks ago. Free love reigns in Hollywood, which was proved by the letters of important film actresses, found in the room of the murdered man, addressed to him during his life.</p>
   <p>Most of these prayed-to idols were married and divorced once or oftener, but practice, almost without exception, the things of which they point out the <span class="page-break">\3</span>danger to the public, on the films. Oh yes! The films must teach the public. This they do by portraying the forbidden fruit in all its splendor. Bad money makes crooked that which is straight. Also, in the film world, the saying is that money has all the sins. If one of the stars violates the law then money also covers this sin and no more is heard from it. The earlier mentioned Mary Pickford lives with her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, to whom she was married after having obtained an unlawful divorce from her former husband, Owen Moore, in a palace that is fit for a king; sunken and perfumed baths, hanging gardens, a swimming pool and a complete assortment of bathing costumes to accommodate a hundred guests, make life there somewhat bearable.</p>
   <p>The film industry is one of the most important in our country. It is very little less important than the automobile industry. The movie habit, that is, the regular attendance to the idol temples, is as habit forming as the use of opium or morphine, more general, and is no less damaging to spiritual and moral life.</p>
   <p>Naturally, sometimes they produce as bait a very innocent play to come in the good graces of the more scrupulous and conservative public. Race relations play a most important role in the moving pictures, be it sometimes in the more, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and sometimes in the less-concealed form. The film producers protest their innocence by saying: "The public wants it." But they themselves have created the bad taste of every decent person, not to say Christians, for these pictures.</p>
   <p>The film producers and distributors, fearful about the protest of a part of the public, are not disposed to lose this gold mine and have coaxed one of our cabinet members, with a salary of $150,000, out of the cabinet with the intent, as they say, to clean the movies. But not only that, the film producing millionairas, mostly Jews, realize how a man of political influence and prestige, like Will Hayes, can protect their industry against laws and enforcements which are unprofitable for them.</p>
   <p>A warning against the movies in their present state is in order, because many of our young boys and girls are regular patrons of the moves. The danger, dear reader, young and old, is greater than many of us realize. To sum it all up: The regular attendance of the movies is a detriment to home life. The company that one meets in the movies is not upbuilding for our youth, to say the least. No difference is made. Everyone is welcome - gamblers, robbers, and all other undesirables as well as honorable citizens who go to see the movies and to spend their money. The plays are not true to life and that which is true is only the sinful part. False emotions are awakened. When <span class="page-break">\5</span>conscience is being worked upon and it cannot be satisfied, such is damaging to character. For example: Pity is awakened with an imaginative person possibly mistreated by the state; children neglected by irresponsible parents; a woman fooled by her husband or another man, and so forth. Too often they see such plays, that when in actual life a person comes in contact with such a case the feeling of pity is deadened to such an exteat that the offering of help or the seeking for lightening of suffering is left behind. The plays are so produced as to prod desire and in a sly way facilitate the unlawful accomplishment of those desires. (This is said plain enough, we think but it is necessary). The devalopment of the brain become dull rather than sharpened by the plays, so that earnest thinking and common reasoning become lost. The movies are based on gain in the first place. Large attendance brings the most money. To gain large attendance they have to know how to reach the public. And this, as the film producers have laarned, can best be done by giving plays which are right on the edge, or a little over. Gain - that's what it is for. With higher motives they can't be bothered. Much more of the shady side of this shady industry could be summed up. Let this, however, be enough to warn parents and children.</p>
   <p>Be on your guard, parents. The devil has one of his strongest bulwarks in the movies. You may condemn the dance hall and tolerate the movies for your <span class="page-break">\6</span>children, but the movies approve of the dance hall and is there pictured so interesting that for many youths the longing to also go there is irresistible.</p>
   <p>We repeat once more that the discover of moving pictures and prodection is nice and may be put to good uge. But the movies as we know them nowadays we disapprove of in the strougest of terms. We condemn them with the dance hall and the saloon on the same line. </p>
