   <p>On the evening of April 16, our 110th Street School had a very interesting meeting. The parents gathered to spend an enjoyable evening. An interesting program was presented. Teacher Ballast gave a fine speech in which he explained the difference between the free and the states, and the parochial and the sectarian schools. Mrs. Wiebalda, accompanied on the piano by J. Van der Ark, sang a few songs, in a clear and audible voice....Mrs. A. Bennema and Mrs. D. Verploeg sang a pretty duet and their lovely voices literally filled the hall...The collection which was taken up for the benefit of the school amounted to $23.50.</p>
