(c) Affirming our faith in the Democratic form of Government, we declare ourselves against all autocratic encroachments and anarchistic propaganda.</p>
   <p>Our Platform.</p>
   <p>1. We especially declare ourselves to be in favor of laws and the enforcements of laws against: (a) Public profanity either by word of mouth or in writing. (b) Public Sabbath breaking. (c) Houses of prostitution, immoral writings, scandalous portraits in newspapers, magazines, movies or on postcards; immoral <span class="page-break">2</span>plays in theatres, comedies, etc. (d) Laxness in our courts in cases of divorce, murders, holdups, etc. (e) Swindle and bribery by our public servants; usurping of trade, and hasty unnecessary strikes before attempts at conciliation are made.</p>
   <p>2. We demand ability and honesty in every public service and honesty in all dealings with the public. ( b) We demand protection against unnecessary strikes which are a detriment to the public and for that reason propose that all differences, which may come between employers and employees, and which have a bearing on public life, such as public mediums of transportation, be laid before commissions of arbitration instituted and controlled by the City, State, or Federal Government. (d) We recognize the duty of the parents to teach their children and demand that the parents be not limited in their rights to teach the children according to their own conscience and to teach as they will in as far as this is not against the well-being of the State, and if the teachings answer to a certain given standard. (e) We demand that only the teaching of the number of children who attend the public schools, shall be paid for by taxation.</p>
