   <p>In a much appreciated article on a reconstructed future a protest was made against the following lines which were under the heading of, "Roseland News: Thompson and a Wet Chicago". This line can do no damage if it means defense of the saloon. We also hesitated to take up this heading, but we thought that more joy would be expressed over the total result of the election, than simply over the victory of the "wets". Further, this sentence must be taken ironically or probably even sarcastically, for Thompson is known as an enemy of the saloon, and the keepers of the saloon fought him tooth and nail while his adversaries counted on their support...Sweitzer as mayor was supported by the saloons but was not trusted by the people.</p>
   <p>We expect from Thompson that he will continue his fight against the saloon. This is our interpretation, although the heading was a little dangerous.</p>
