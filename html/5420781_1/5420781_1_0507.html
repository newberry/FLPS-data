   <p>As was advertised in Onze Toekomst a meeting of the voting members of the Zelf Hulp [Burial Society] will be held next Tuesday night in Handel Hall on Randolph Street. It is a special meeting called for the double purpose of deciding whether the death payment shall be increased and whether the staff of office workers shall be enlarged, since the work of the secretary has been steadily increasing, until now it has proved too much for one person to handle.</p>
   <p>The members will undoubtedly remember that at the regular meeting of February, 1907, it was decided that these matters should be discussed at a special meeting. This meeting was held in May, 1907, but the members showed little interest and there were not enough members present to make a legal decision.</p>
   <p>Since that time the matter has not been discussed. Last winter, at the <span class="page-break">2</span>general meeting, the people were so noisy that no particular subject could be discussed at length. A committee was appointed to revise the regulations, but it was evident that the people present did not know what was going on, and that this committee could do no more than bring in proposals for the revised bill. These proposals can be discussed only at the general meeting in February, 1909, and the revisions cannot be approved until they are voted on in a special meeting.</p>
   <p>In view of all this a special meeting is necessary to adjust the discrepancies of the meeting of May, 1907.</p>
   <p>The advisability of increasing the death payment was discussed some time ago; therefore we deem it unnecessary to review the arguments pro and con. We are of the opinion that an increase is necessary. It is best to decide this matter once and for all, so that no business is left undone or half finished.</p>
   <span class="page-break">3</span>
   <p>We suggest that the payment for adults be not less than one hundred and fifty dollars, and a proportionate amount for children. The present payment is much too small to be of real help to our people in case of death.</p>
