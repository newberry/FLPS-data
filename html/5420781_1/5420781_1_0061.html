   <p>Most of our newspapers have reproduced the article on the administration of the Chicago division of the General Dutch League, concerning a Chair for Dutch language, history and literature at the University of Chicago. This proves that the efforts to secure such a Chair of learning, are appreciated and that the idea is supported. Among the papers which have copied the article, we notice the Pella Weekly, The Wachter, De Vrye Hollander, De Gids, of Grand Rapids, and De Grondwet. The Gids, of Grand Rapids, a Christian weekly, dedicated to family, community and State, and undoubtedly one of the best edited Dutch newspapers in America, published the article with the following recommendations:</p>
   <p>A CHAIR OF LEARNING IN DUTCH</p>
   <p>We may recall, however, that a couple of years ago, tremendous efforts were exerted in this direction. The Chicago Division of the General Dutch League <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>sponsored this plan. Although it was unsuccessful at first, yet, it was not discarded by the trustees of the University of Chicago, and has once more come to the fore.</p>
   <p>Now, however, conditions are much more favorable. The article concerning this matter, which we have copied from Onze Toekomst, can be read elsewhere in this paper. We supported these efforts two years ago, and we have not changed our opinion in the least. Our old Fatherland, with its glorious past and its present prosperity deserves a chair of learning for the aforementioned courses, at a university in our land. We know that in many circles, the importance of the Netherlands in the world's history is not known; "The Dutchman" is often talked about with contempt. It is even so in circles of Hollanders, who apparently do not know any better. The educated circles of America know better as may be distinctly perceived at the University of Chicago. Otherwise such a plan would have been ridiculed. Also those among us who are familiar with the works of Campbell and of Griffis, know better. We, here in Grand Rapids, still remember the work <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>of Dr. Griffis. We do not know of any possible objections, especially when a man, like Dr. T. De Vries could occupy that Chair. It is natural that we would like nothing better, than to see this position always occupied in the future by a true Calvinist. Then, such a "Chair," could wield a great influence upon our Christian people. Whereas, the spiritual influence would be negligible if ever an unbeliever were to fill this Chair. Our people would not let themselves be swayed by such a professor, unless their faith becomes considerably weakened. The plan seems, to us, to be and excellent one. We hope that the necessary money, may soon be available. The rich life of Netherland's language; the significance of the principles of Christian freedom, and the treasures of Dutch knowledge and art, all these facts should be brought to light, for the good of our National American life.</p>
