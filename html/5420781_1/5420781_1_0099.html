   <p>If the plans are crowned with success, the Cicero Timothy Christian School will be realized next September, if it pleases the Lord. Last Wednesday, April 13, the Timothy School Society accepted the plans of the Building Committee by a unanimous vote.</p>
   <p>The lowest bid was $99,000.00. The Building Committee was instructed to build a ten room, fire proof building without delay. The total cost may not exceed $105,000.00.</p>
   <p>The work will in all probability, commence this week.</p>
