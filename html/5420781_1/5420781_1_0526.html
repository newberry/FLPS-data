   <p>The Ladies Circle of the Chicago "Holland Home" held its tri-monthly meeting at the Home, on September 14th. The attendance from eighteen different congregations was large. The program, consisting of songs, recitations, etc. was magnificent. The little master, Van der Veen, five years old, gave a recitation from Luke 6: 1-14 and Psalm 23rd.</p>
