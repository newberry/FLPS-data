   <p>Mr. Editor:</p>
   <p>In your paper of September 21, there appeared a letter concerning public education. In this, it is declared that the citizens must pay sixty dollars per year for each child, while the cost of Christian education is only $20.00. Now I would like to know in what manner this money is paid. I have two children going to school, and I assure you that I do not pay $120.00 in Taxes per year, although education must be paid for from that source. I am at the same time, of the opinion, that no-one pays that much, unless he owns real - estate, representing that value. Now it happens only too often, Mr. Editor, that in order to defend one's own case you make another good case bad, which I think is the situation here. To believe the report of your paper, I must first be convinced. Hoping that the editor will do this, I thank you in advance for the publication of these lines Greetings: C.B.Koop. The only thing that pleases us in the above article, is, that the writer hopes to be convinced. In this we will try to serve Mr. Koop with figures, he will then possibly be convinced that he does not nearly pay enough taxes, and at the same time that it is dishonest and wrong to be forced to pay for the rearing and education of another's children.</p>
   <p>To our sorrow we have no accurate figures on the cost of our public schools, covering the last two years. The last published report, covers the years 1903-4. That year, the total of school - going children, was 220,384. To pay for their instruction, the amount paid to teachers, for schoolbooks, etc. was $7,339,844.44, or approximately $33.50 for each child. For building, $1,944,370.73, or about $9.50 per head. For interest on borrowed capital $115.512.40, being 50c per head with a total of $43.50. To this is not yet a added the salaries of janitors. etc. For this you can safely figure $5.00 per head. That would only be a total of a little over a million. Then we must not forget that the gentlemen of the school board also get plenty, and that there is a large staff of clerks, book-keepers, etc. We will nevertheless, stay at the low figure of $5.00, and we come to a total of $48.50. Now last, but not least, and of this neither the City nor the school - board, ever makes a report, the real - estate belonging to the board. What do you think, if on all the real estate, belonging to the Board of Education, which they themselves use and rent out, a tax was levied, like on all other real- estate, within the city limits, would that not make a large sum? And where these taxes are not levied and where all so - called school property is tax free, then we must figure that the citizens donate this sum to the Board each year. If the real estate belonging to the school - board, were taxed according to their real value, that would be an enormous sum. Let us also figure $5.00 per head on that. That makes then a total of $53.50. But you would say that is not $60.00. That's very true. But these are the figures for the years 1903-4. Since that time the teachers salaries have been increased and at present much more is paid out for school books, and last but not least, more than twice the amount is spent for school buildings. If this in 1904 amounted to 9 dollars per head, this year it will easily be $20.00. On top of this, there is rumored, that the Board will borrow this year $10,000,000. That, we think, closes the case. If, with such figures, the instruction of each child does not cost $60.00, then we confess not to have learned arithmetic. Now, Mr. Koop must not forget that he does not pay alone for the education of his children. Those enormous holdings, for which each year, thousands upon thousands of dollars are being collected in rents, are the property of the citizenry. The person, who, because of his conscience, cannot make use of the public schools, is also a co-owner. And he also contributes to the taxes, from which the cost of public education is being paid. That is not right. Every fair - minded person will concede that, under - stand us rignt. In making these remarks we do not go to war for Christian education. Every one has a right to his own principles, regarding this matter. Onze Toekomst holds itself outside such questions. But we assert that public education is an expensive luxury, and that it is unfair that this instruction is being paid for from the general fund, as long as there is any refusal to support parochial education.</p>
