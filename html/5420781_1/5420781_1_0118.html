   <p>The senior class of the Chicago Christian High School is busy at work on an annual, which will come off the press about the 1st of June. The name of the annual is Violet and Maize. It is a large and elaborate book, showing the extent and character of the activities, portraying life at the high school among the students, and giving a splendid reflection of the school spirit. Not one of our reformed homes should be without this annual, through which we may become better acquainted with the inner life of our high school.</p>
   <p>You don't necessarily have to visit the school to learn what is going on. Buy our annual, and you will live the school life with the students. The subscriptions can be placed with any of the high school students, subscription price being $1.00, of which .50 may be paid down in advance.</p>
