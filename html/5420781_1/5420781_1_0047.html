   <p>Last week, a ceremony took place on the campus of the University of Chicago, namely, the breaking of a ground for the foundation of Wieboldt Hall, a building to be erected with money donated for that purpose by William A. Wieboldt, and which will be used for the study of foreign languages, - particularly the Germanic languages - Danish, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish. Groups of leading citizens, who represented these languages, were in attendance at the ceremony and subcommittees were formed to represent the Danes, Norwegians, Germans, Dutch and Swedes of the Middle West, to make the usefulness of the establishment as large as possible, and more money will be collected for that purpose. The Netherlands sub-committee consists of Judge Frederick De Young, D. C. Gordon, Dr. G. J. Hagens, Cornelius Teninga, (secretary-treasurer of the Germanic group) and John Vennema, Consul of the Netherlands in Chicago. Dr. Hagens of Englewood is <span class="page-break">2</span>well known in the Middle West, coming from Pella, Iowa, and is a cousin to the Oggel family at Orange City. In connection with the agitation for preserving the Netherlands language and history among Dutch Americans, which has been going on in this paper, by the Rev. Van Dellen and others, is the erection of Wieboldt Hall which will be noticed by our people with more than common interest.</p>
