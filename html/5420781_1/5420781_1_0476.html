   <p>Twelfth Street does not exist any more in Chicago. Instead we now have Roosevelt Road from Lake Michigan to the Des Plaines River. What was formerly Twelfth Street is now the first link in a chain of highways through the entire land from the Great Lakes via St. Louis to the Gulf of Mexico which shall be named after the last President, Theodore Roosevelt, at least such is the plan of the Roosevelt Memorial Association.</p>
   <p>The rebaptism of the street was accompanied by fitting ceremonies. Many prominent people made speeches before a crowd of about 50,000 enthusiastic business men and others from Roosevelt Road.</p>
