   <p>The Chicago City Mission Training School is a school that is based on reformed principles. The aim of this school is to give a practical mission course, thereby fitting its students for practical mission work. City mission work is growing in our reformed circles and the demand for workers is also growing. If we remain reformed in our mission work then we must have trained reformed workers. The Chicago City Mission Board has a "try-out" plan for all those who desire to qualify themselves for practical mission work. The tuition is so small that all can take advantage of it. It costs but $5 per year. That means that every student will receive about two hundred lessons for $5. This school is located in the heart of a great city where there is opportunity to secure valuable, practical experience in personal work while in training. Chicago is a well known city of missions, famous settlements, and great <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>hospitals. Come: Fall term opens September 11, 1925. For information write to Thomas J.
