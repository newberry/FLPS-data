   <p>The Ladies Circle for the Chicago Holland Home held their tri-monthly meeting in the Home on June 12, 1923. There was a large attendance, one hundred and sixty ladies were present of nineteen different congregations. The program was unique on that afternoon. There was a dialog of five ladies, a duet was sung and other entertainment was had. Mr. J. De Jong gave a report of our Tag Day. The Matron told the ladies what was brought into the Home in the last three months by friends and that some young people, surprised our aged with a visit to spend a pleasant evening. According to the By-Laws of the Circle, three ladies from each congregation had to resign after four years of service.</p>
   <p>The result of the election was, that those same ladies were re-elected to again take up their labours with love and confidence. The following monies were gathered from the containers: <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>First Chr. Ref., Roseland, $5.50; Second Chr. Ref., Englewood, $4.22; Second Chr. Ref., Englewood, $6.75; Ladies Aid, First Ref., Summit, $10.00; Ref., Grand, $5.25; Ref., Lansing, $5.75; Mt. Greenwood, $8.73; Immanuel, 100th St., $4.58; Bethany, 111th St., $4.33; Dorcas Society, First Ref., Englewood, $13.15; De Motte, Indiana, $3.60; table container, $5.45; collection, $38.46; total, $120.97. The Tag Day, held on May 14 last, brought the sum of $2,415.11. To this we can add from friends $31.50, thus making a total of $2,444.61. We had more workers this year than the last four years, and it certainly paid. Each year we climbed higher, but this year we had $573 more than last year. A true word that many hands make easy work; and we thank all the ladies, young and old, and those who have sent in their gifts for this purpose. This month our Ladies Circle completed, of its existence, eight years.</p>
   <p>A short review was given of the same. Our collections, containers, and gifts amounted to over $2,000. Our Tag Day gatherings for the five years was the sum of $7,911.18. As proof that we have worked together from 1915 to 1923, it can be said that the same atmosphere of love and oneness still rules. Showered with all these blessings we thank our Heavenly Father and our prayer is that we continue to receive his blessings.</p>
   <p>Mrs. P. Roosma, Secretary.</p>
