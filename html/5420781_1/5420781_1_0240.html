   <p>Mr. and Mrs. J. Van Sipma of 107th Street and Wabash Avenue, Roseland, the parents of our well-known jewelers, had the privilege, last Tuesday, June 28th, of remembering their 60 years wedding anniversary.</p>
   <p>One can imagine that their thoughts on that day returned to Bergum, Friesland, in the old country, where they were married on June 21, 1850.</p>
   <p>Mr. Van Sipma is at present 88years old, and his wife 82. They had 7 children, of which 6 are alive. Three of them are living in Chicago and three in the State of Washington.</p>
