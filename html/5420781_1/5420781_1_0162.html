   <p>The board of the Christian School on 104th Street and Wentworth Avenue was informed, last week, by the Board of Education, that their school was recognized by that body, because it satisfied by the demands required by the City of Chicago. The diplomas which will be given in the future by the afore-mentioned school, will have the same value, as those given by the public school, and its recipients will be admitted to the City high schools without examination.</p>
