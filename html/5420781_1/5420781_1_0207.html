   <p>In answer to Mr. S. Bolt's article regarding comfort stations in the Netherlands and Chicago, I have this to say: In Chicago the toilets in the saloons are free to the ladies as well as the men. Mr. Bolt is of the opinion, that he has to buy something. That is up to him.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, the saloons have side entrances which are convenient to the toilets. In the Netherlands, however, one finds only urinals, to serve the public. If you do find a comfort station, which is an exception, you pay for the use of it. So I come to the conclusion that the toilet situation in America is better than in Holland. I doubt whether erecting a sufficient number of comfort stations would prove Mr. Bolt's theory that there would be fewer drinkers. Closing the saloons or houses of prostitution does not remove evil. People of little breeding have evil passions and are looking for each others company either in saloons or in other public places. People whose desires are normal, seldom frequent saloons.</p>
