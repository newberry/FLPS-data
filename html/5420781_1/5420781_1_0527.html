   <p>Thousands of people of Roselend, Englewood, Chicago and vicinity, visited the "New Holland Home " during the two days dedication ceremonies. Our aged friends have in this building a cozy home. The servants who tend and care for the aged do everything in their power to make happy the evening of their lives. The new building with its fifty rooms is conveniently planned and well heated, lighted and ventilated. That our aged may find there rest for their souls as well as for their bodies is our wish. And in that case those who have given and donated to this worthy cause are well repaid.</p>
