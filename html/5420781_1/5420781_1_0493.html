   <p>Inasmuch as Zelf Hulp has a capital of more than 40,000 dollars, it is necessary to elect for its board of directors men whom we know with certainty to be not only honest, but above all, capable of administering its fund.</p>
   <p>For president we need a man with practical knowledge, one who thinks with his own head and who can act independently of his subordinates. Such a man is Mr. N. Fisher. As director, Mr. Fisher has shown he is the right man in the right place. Hence, we are recommending him with frankness for the president's chair of Zelf Hulp.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. Stuit, the present vice-president, possesses so much of the confidence of the members of Zelf Hulp that it is unnecessary for us to recommend him.</p>
   <p>For secretary, Mr. Douwe Dykstra is the right man in the right place. The <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>secretary of Zelf Hulp has to be a person to whom not only the cash may be entrusted, but also the books. He must not make internal affairs of the union, especially those recorded in its books, available to the public by permitting their publication in the papers.</p>
   <p>Mr. R. Mulder, as fellow-founder of the Union, requires no separate recommendation. Who would not be ashamed to withhold his vote for such an old veteran in our union life?</p>
   <p>For directors we recommend L. Holstein, H. DeYoung, Henry Boss, and E. H. Wierenga.</p>
   <p>Mr. L. Holstein and Mr. H. DeYoung have been directors at different times, in <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>which capacity at all times they proved themselves equal to the task.</p>
   <p>Mr. Henry Boss, one of the first members of Zelf Kulp, is well known as one of the old settlers. We who feel so much respect for the "old settlers" shall [not] withhold our vote for a man who has been so many years among the Dutch people in Chicago, and who is one of the first members of Zelf Hulp.</p>
   <p>Mr. E. H. Wierenga, as a very busy and reliable real-estate man, is also well-known, so that we do not doubt he will carry most of the votes. We are recommending the persons whose names are given below with the greatest frankness and earnestness for the Board of Zelf Hulp, in the first place because through their relation to the union they already have a claim to it, but above all because they are fit for the different board offices.</p>
   <p>For president, Nic. Fisher; for vice-president, H. Stuit; for secretary, <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>Douwe Dykstra; for treasurer, Reinder Mulder; for directors: L. Holstein, H. DeYoung, Henry Boss, and E. H. Wierenga.</p>
   <p>Recommended by:</p>
