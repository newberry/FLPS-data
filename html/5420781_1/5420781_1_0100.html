   <p>A large number of people took part in the dedication of the new Christian High School. And were the participants happy? At the meeting which was held in the afternoon at the First Reformed Church, 62nd and Peoria Streets, a collection was taken which amounted to $2,600. The program was entertaining and the main speakers, Reverend Weersing and Reverend Althuis presented their messages in a masterly manner. Lack of space prevents us from making a report in detail. We may possibly get this later from someone, who is more closely connected with the school. From the Church the people went by automobile to the school, led by traffic police. The crowd was shown the entire school, and every-one was full of praise for the magnificent design of the building, its quality and workmanship, and the complete equipment of the school. For those who missed the opportunity on Thursday, it will be worth while to study the building inside and out. The gymnasium and the laboratory drew especial attention, but also the lockers, etc., and everything is according to the most modern design. All classrooms are planned scientifically and well provided with windows so that plenty of light and fresh air is admitted. Truly a building to be proud of!</p>
   <p>May God grant that it will serve his purpose - to give Christian education to the young people - to the end of time. In the evening there was another program. This time it was held in the schools main auditorium which seats 400 people.</p>

   <p>Naturally, a large number of people had to stand and a good many could not even get into the hall. This program also went without a hitch. We heard from various sources the total sum donated, but we will wait for an official news item concerning that. The lunch prepared by the "Ladies Auxiliary", added to the total, because many people partook of it.</p>
