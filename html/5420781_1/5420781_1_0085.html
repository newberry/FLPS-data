   <p>The annual Christmas program of the Christian School in Roseland was held last Thursday evening in the Church of the First Christian Reformed Congregation. This time, not only the children of the 110th Place School were present, but also those of the 104th Street School with their teachers. This is a natural consequence of the consolidation of the schools and school societies.</p>
   <p>There is, at present, only one school society and one school Board, which governs two schools. The church was too small in former years to accomodate the crowds, now the building is full to overflowing, so that many are compelled to return home disappointed, because they are unable to gain admittance.</p>
