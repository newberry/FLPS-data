   <p>Let us not forget that our schools can be of enormous value to our country. Is it not possible that God will use our people to give to American Christianity the free Christian school? American Christianity is not satisfied with our public schools without the Bible. It seeks a remedy.</p>
   <p>This remedy was given to us by God in the free Christian school. And with more than ordinary interest Americans take notice of our schools. It is a cloud only as large as a man's hand, but probably the forerunner of something big.</p>
   <p>If our free Christian school is to be as a model to American Christianity, however, it also must be an American establishment.</p>
