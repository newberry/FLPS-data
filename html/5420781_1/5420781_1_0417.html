   <p>The summertime is outing time, when one should visit the great outdoors in order to behold the beauties of nature. All outings contain the possibilities of pleasure, but an outing which Christians arrange gives an excellent opportunity to glorify God, which is the primary purpose of Christian recreation.</p>
   <p>Recognizing this fact, the Chicago League is making elaborate preparations for its outing. It has selected July 22 as the date, and Beverly Hills as the place. Everybody is invited. The program will begin with devotional exercises, and will continue with various clean athletic events. Friends, let us take advantage of the occasion. Let us spend a few delectable hours in pleasant surroundings, where Christian fellowship prevails. The larger the attendance, the greater encouragement for repetition.</p>
