   <p>The League of Christian School Societies of Chicago and vicinity, has taken up the plan to erect a Parochial Normal School. In view of this fact a meeting should have been held last Wednesday, but this meeting has been put off until August 17th.</p>
   <p>We are unable to say, however, how the affair will be carried out.</p>
   <p>At the meeting of August 17th, which will be held at the Christian Reformed Church at Douglas Park, two statements will be delivered. One by Mr. P. Prins of Roseland on: "Is supervision of the authorities of our schools desired?" and the other by Dr. G. Haan on: "The necessity of a Parochial Normal School for the training of teachers."</p>
