   <p>How do we stand? Do the Hollanders take 1st place in subscribing to the various United States America loans? First place among all foreign born? These questions may be answered with a big YES. But our work could be even more honorable of we were organized just a little stronger, if we were given credit for all the money that flows from us into the United States Treasury. What can we do about it? The Holland Committee is requested to give us any enlightenment that may be valuable to the success of the Victory loan.</p>
   <p>Please tell us some of your plans. They should be no secret. Let us all join hands and co-operate to bring the Victory Loan to victory.</p>
