   <p>Mayor Thompson said the word and the voice that had been smothered so long was heard everywhere. And the saloon, the whisky closet, where men's brains are dulled, is closed on Sunday. And whatever it may be, he is right. Mayor Thompson, what do you care if the wet army calls you guilty of treason? Let it talk and stick to your principles. Now, on Monday morning many a man, who drank on Sunday and felt the effects on Monday, goes to work Monday morning fresh as a rose and fit. And what does it matter if the saloon-keeper says that Thompson killed his trade and took his living? That is only bluff. The saloon-keeper took the bread of the workman and his family and now that he cannot get it, he protests in the name of "Liberty". Be brave, Mayor Thompson and do not cater to the saloons. You will come out on top, because beer and whisky make ruined homes and slaves of the devil.</p>
