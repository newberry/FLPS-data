   <p>We want to remind our readers to do their duty April 1st, to choose by ballot the men who they wish to rule for the coming four years. Women as well as men are entitled to vote.</p>
   <p>Since an organized party is of the highest benefit to the country, we urge you to support the entire Republican ticket. No one who has read our columns, can be in doubt as to who to elect and when all do their duty Mayor Thompson, George Holmes, Guy Madderom and Chas. C. Foucek will all ride to victory.</p>
