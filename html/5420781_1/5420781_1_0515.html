   <p>Last Sunday was the third time, that the Dutch Sick and Death - benefit society "Eendracht Maakt Macht" (Unity makes strength), had the opportunity, to bestow the last honors to a brother, and even as Ten Brain, and Prins, he was a resident of the North West Side. It was wonderful evidence of the power of a organization, manifested in this society, that they were represented in such large numbers at these solemn rites, not only by the members themselves, but also by their wives and other friends of the society.</p>
