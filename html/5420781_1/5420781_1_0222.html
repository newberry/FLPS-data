   <p>A violent conflict has broken out between the so-called United Societies, the organization which tried to reject the new Charter, and the Chicago Law and Order League. The first organization has put two bills before the Legislature. One proposes to make the Sunday closing law null and void by giving the Council the right to grant extra permits for the sale of beer or liquor at dancing parties, political meetings, and assemblies of different types. At present such permits are not available, because liquor can only be sold in licensed saloons. Therefore, the purpose of these bills are to invalidate the Sunday and the saloon ordinances.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Law and Order League is attacking these bills. The league has sent a memorandum to the Legislature wherein the probable consequences of such bills are explained. We hope with all our hearts that the Legislature will reject these bills.</p>
