   <p>Some members of the Women's Society of the First Reformed Church, 107th St., Roseland, are working for the interest of the Christian School at 104th St.</p>
   <p>They have been busily engaged with that work for ten months, and the other day they surprised the board of that school with a gift of $36.25.</p>
   <p>We are hoping that this good example will be imitated by other women, either by joining the society, or by forming their own club.</p>
