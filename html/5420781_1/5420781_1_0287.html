   <p>Everyone knows now, that our countryman, Age Zylstra, is again a candidate for the Republican nomination of Alderman in the 33rd Ward. He has not forced himself upon the people, but after repeated urgings of his many friends and admirers, he has at last consented to accept the nomination. But this was not easy as committee upon committee had to plead with him before he at last gave his consent. Now it is the duty of every Dutchman in the Ward to vote for him. His sterling character, and his generosity for those in need of help - he has been called the philanthropist of the 33rd Ward, make him doubly worthy of the honor. And that is not all. A more capable person can not be found. His long experience in public office makes him the right person to represent our interest.</p>
   <p>Later we may possibly have more to say on the matter, but right now just this: Hollanders! Let no party lines keep you from doing your duty. Let it be an honor to all of you, to send a man to our City Council, who not alone will honorably represent the 33rd Ward, but in whom you all can place your trust, and who at the same time will be a credit to the Dutch people. Therefore on February 28th, next, vote for your countryman Age. Zylstra, and send him where he belongs, to the City Council.</p>
