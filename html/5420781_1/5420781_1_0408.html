   <p>The Choral Society of the First Christian Reform Congregation, sang on the evening of November 13, the beautiful cantata "Hymn of Praise," for the second time, in the auditorium of the church. The organ and piano music was unexcelled, as well as that of the violins. The tenor and soprano, in solo or duet, sang wonderfully and the entire choir was very strong. The collection taken was for the benefit of the Christian school, and so we see, again, that our children walk in our footsteps, for which we cannot give thanks enough to the Lord.</p>
