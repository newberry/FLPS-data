   <p>If people have the idea that education in our public schools is neutral about religion, they must take the trouble to read the opinion of President Schneider of the Board of Education, the man, under whose care children's education is trusted, who speaks about the Bible as a book unsuitable for children and as a dangerous book for young boys whose intellect is not completely developed.</p>
   <p>A person who dares to express himself in this manner is by no means neutral.</p>
   <p>No wonder that the influence of such "neutral" education can be observed in the pupils and that everyone is complaining that the present youth is leading a more undisciplined life than any previous generation.</p>
   <p>Where children are educated in the belief that religion is good only for old women and drudges, it is natural that they lose all respect for parents, authorities, law and order, when they reach maturity.</p>
   <p>Our opinion is that Christian and social virtues are the consequences of Christianity, Where the last is ousted the first of course will disappear.</p>
