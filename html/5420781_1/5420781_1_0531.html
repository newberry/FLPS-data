   <p>Monday morning, May 26th, ground was broken for the new building called, the "Holland Home." Miss Mary Tamminga, great grand daughter of our well-known D. Tamminga, had the honor on her fourth birthday to put the spade in the ground. The women who gathered such large sums on the last "Tag Day", had a jubilant gathering in Englewood, last week. The high ideal shall be realized. There will be a new "Home" and many of the aged may spend the evening of their lives in a lovely home with thanks to the Lord.</p>
