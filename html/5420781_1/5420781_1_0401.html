   <p>On the evening of January 24th, an organ recital was held in Bethany Church. The headliner of the evening was Mr. Fred Eaassen, organist of Zion Tabernacle and of radio station WBCD. Among other things, Mr. Eaassen played "The Russian Patrol", which was beautiful, but when he played Psalm 42, the "Patrol" sank to insignificance in the soft flowing, almost crying tones of the winded deer. Continued applause prompted Mr. Eaassen to play that Psalm once more, and, on request, he played it again, the music accompanied by hundreds of voices.</p>
   <p>It was magnificent. The well-known Bethany choir also sang in an unsurpassed manner, especially the beautiful song: "O, Come to my Heart." A silver collection was requested and we believe this request was filled to overflowing and many people had to return home.</p>
   <p>On February 14th, a sixth Organ Recital will be given there. For that occasion, a New York musician will give the program.</p>
