   <p>According to reports, the two Roseland Societies for Christian Education, each in their respective meetings, have agreed to form one society instead of two. This happened last Monday evening, a little late, but not too late in this case, although this should have been done long ago.</p>
   <p>Now the two Societies must of necessity dissolve, to be able to form one solid and recognized association. According to plans, the Board will consist of 15 members. These members will be chosen from 5 wards or "districts," three from each district. The districts are divided as follows: Districts No. 1, everything south of 111th Street; No. 2, south and north from 107th to 111th Streets and everything east of Stewart Avenue; No. 3, south and north, 103rd to 107th Streets and everything east of Stewart Avenue; No. 4, everything north of 103rd Street; No. 5, 103rd Street on the north to 111th Street on the south and everything west of Stewart Avenue. Now if all is orderly and amicable, then this is a good setup, and why not? Now in our minds many questions arise as to order, <span class="page-break">\2</span>but we will not interfere.</p>
   <p>We shall only wait. The foundation is indestructible. The foundation of this movement is, "Seek first the Kingdom of the Lord and his righteousness, and all other things shall be given unto you".</p>
