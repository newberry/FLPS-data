   <p>Is it not strange that while foreign scholars are eager to make the Dutch history and literature known to their country-people, our Dutchmen in America, seem not to care for their own literature.</p>
   <p>Who among our readers is making use of the hundreds of beautiful Dutch books in the Chicago Public Library? Everyone can read them free of charge.</p>
   <p>It is only because no one uses the books, that the Dutch section is not kept up to date. Consequently new books of the last ten or fifteen years are absent.</p>
   <p>But even now a treasure of Dutch literature is buried in our Chicago Library, under clouds of dust, and about which no one seems to care.</p>
   <p>Every time we visit the library we observe one hundred to two hundred citizens of all nationalities, Americans, Germans, Bohemians, French, etc, in the large reading room, but our Dutch folks are not present. Never, so far as we know, have we met one of our country-men. It is a strange but sad truth.</p>
