   <p>That Christian education, gradually draws more interest was proved las Wednesday, at the meeting in the First Christian Reformed Church in Englewood, where delegates of seven school societies representatives of several congregations, among whom were 4 preachers and 15 teachers, were present. What was known already, was shown by the report of the committee which was appointed at the last meeting, that the diploma's given by the Christian schools would only permit one to enter the public high school, when a specified course of study was made, according to school Superintendent Cooley. The Board of Education would then send an inspector, who would sign the diploma's. A committee was named, consisting of the principals of the different schools and a delegate from each one of the school-societies which until now have had no principal, to formulate such a plan. It was decided to question the different school-societies, whether it would not be to their advantage to formulate a union of the various societies and to form a central committee, which would handle matters of universal importance, and at the same time would place all the societies in Chicago on an equal footing.</p>
