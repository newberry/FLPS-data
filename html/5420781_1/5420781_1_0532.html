   <p>The "Tag Day" held on Monday, May 12th for our Holland Home, was very successful. The sum of $2,642.98 was collected and we may say that our work was very pleasant. Thanks to our Heavenly Father for the excellent weather on that day and thanks to all the ladies who helped so much.</p>
   <p>The entire amount for the thirty-eight homes amounted to $97,000. Now all the Taggers are cordially invited to have a good time on Friday evening, May 23rd, in the Second Christian Reformed Church of Englewood, 72nd and Peoria Streets.</p>
