   <p>The quarters of the Christian School in Englewood are becoming too small; the number of pupils is too great for four teachers. On Monday night, November 16, a general meeting was held to arrange a plan to supply the school's wants. A committee was appointed to institute an inquiry concerning the most suitable manner of making improvements. This committee will provide the Society with suitable recommendations in the next meeting, which will be held in two weeks.</p>
