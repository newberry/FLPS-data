   <p>He who wishes to see very large pumpkins should go to Mr. L. Wierenga's farm at 62nd and Whipple Streets, where you may see specimens of thirty-five to fifty pounds each, the largest ever cultivated in or near Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wierenga received first prize for pumpkins at the Michigan State Fair. It is worth the trouble for those who are interested to take a look at such vegetables. Go to see them.</p>
