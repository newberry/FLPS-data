   <p>P. 5 - We have often pointed to the desirability of a good Dutch book store in Chicago. According to information received this desire has now been fulfilled. Mr. I.J.S. Brand Van Woerden, who only last summer came from the Netherlands to Chicago, has opened such a book store. It is located at 10727 Michigan Avenue, Roseland.</p>
   <p>We trust that Mr. Van Woerden has started this business in the right way and in that case he will be successful. Chicago is a desirable location for such an undertaking.</p>
