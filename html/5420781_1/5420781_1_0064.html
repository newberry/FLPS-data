   <p>A good example for the Hollanders was set by the French population of this city, last week. At a large meeting in which Mr. Elievezina was the principal speaker, it was strongly urged to speak the French language as much as possible. A- right it was pointed out, that to hold to the National character, it is in the first place necessary to keep up the mother-tongue, and that the best citizens of America are those who not only honor their fatherland, but also their mother-tongue.</p>
   <p>Every Frenchman in America should become an American citizen and learn the English language, said the speaker, but let them at the same time safeguard their nationality and practice the French language, the traditional language of our fore-fathers.</p>
