   <p>P? 3. - This home is making good progress. Since the last announcement in Onze Toekomst, the following friends have made contributions totalling $11:00: W. De Herder; H. Van der Ploeg; R. Mulder; A. Schoonder Mark; P. Bloemsma and D. Driebergen.</p>
   <p>The old man was very happy that he was able to put to use, his talents as a decorator, for the beautification of his yet unfinished home. The balance of the money, will be used to buy lumber from his friends, Loss and Brink. The sum of fifty dollars which is still lacking, will, we trust, be soon collected by Mr. Stuivenga's friends. The readers of Onze Toekomst, are again being called upon to contribute toward this worthy cause.</p>
   <p>Donations may be sent to J. Jasper, 1116 North Western Avenue, L. Los, 1723 North Robey Street, R. Stuivenga, 2437 West Huron Street and I Emmering, 84 La Salle Street.</p>
