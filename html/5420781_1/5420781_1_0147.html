   <p>The year 1912 lies behind us. It is gone away forever, and because we entered the year 1913 already, we shall give the people again some information about the Christian School Society "Ebenezer," of Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>I shall begin with the remark that a feeling of thankfulness touches me when I try to revive the year which has passed. It is true that Christian instruction in general is only in the beginning, yet it may be said that it has taken an established position in our social life. It may be said without exaggeration that it has come to stay; moreover, in some respect it is no longer in its first stage, and can be looked upon with a certain pride.</p>
   <p>During the year 1912, regular school hours were held. We could work unimpededly at the instruction of the children, and our work was blessed. At regular times the children were removed to a higher class, while only a very few could not pass. During 1912, our school turned out nineteen graduates, of whom some went to high school, others to business college, and, naturally, a certain number went to work and occupied places in stores, offices, and workshops. Of the graduates who went to other schools to obtain <span class="page-break">\2</span>more knowledge, we heard that their standings are O. K., and in that way these schools give evidence of the standard of our instruction.</p>
   <p>Parents, who moved away out of our neighborhood and were compelled to send their children to another school, have returned them to our school, or testified openly that they were missing our school terribly.</p>
   <p>With an eye on the possible enlargement of our school, the society bought the property next to it so that limited room would not be a reason to prevent the school from growing.</p>
   <p>Also, in the financial sphere, God blessed us. We started the year with a considerable debt and closed it with a profit.</p>
   <p>However, we met also with distress. Several pupils, and also a member of the board, passed away to the great beyond.</p>
   <p>And herewith I am ending, beseeching God's blessing for 1913.</p>
   <p>Ebenezer Chr. School Society</p>
   <p>George Offenhoff, Secretary.</p>
