   <p>Our countryman, Dr. Francis J. Buss of Chicago, is the president and director of the new American Hospital, Monroe Street and Hoyne Avenue, which was formally opened last Wednesday, July 15. This is one of the most modern private hospitals in Chicago; it is equipped with the latest medical and surgical instruments and appliances. The department for women patients is divided into two wards fitted with twelve beds; the men's ward has seven beds. In addition to the wards there are ten private rooms and other semi-private rooms with three beds each.</p>
   <p>The building is four stories high, and is so planned that all patients' rooms face the outside, and are provided with supply closets and other necessary equipment.</p>
   <p>The hospital is equipped with electric light, gas, and an electric elevator. The rooms and kitchen for the personnel are entirely separate from the patients' rooms.</p>
