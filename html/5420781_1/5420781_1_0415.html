   <p>Mr. Editor:</p>
   <p>Will you please place the following in your honored paper: Saturday evening, there was played in Marquette Hall, 118th Street and Lowe Avenue, a comedy in the Dutch language, called "Janus Tulp," with much success, by the Dutch Dramatic Club. A large audience was present, over 600 persons. While such does not often occur among our Dutch people, I nevertheless, deem it proper to make mention of this in Onze Toekomst, even though our Dutch public shows but very little interest in dramatic art. The Dutch Dramatic Club is a well organized society, many of the members of which have shown that they possess real talent.</p>
