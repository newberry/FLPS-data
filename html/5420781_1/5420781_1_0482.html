   <p>Next Wednesday evening, February 12, the regular annual meeting of the burial fund, "Zelf Hulp," will be held.</p>
   <p>We call attention to this meeting because we consider it one of the most important ones to be held by our people in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Lelf Hulp has at present 13,925 members and a reserve capital of $42,243.68, so it is important who should be chosen to manage such a large fund. Furthermore, there have come in a series of proposals <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>to revise the regulations, which are requiring the attention of the members. We did not read the proposals and therefore cannot judge of its contents, but we are of the opinion that repeated changes and alterations for a society, as "Lelf Hulp," is undesirable.</p>
   <p>At all events, it is the duty of every franchise member to be present Wednesday evening at Handel Hall, 27 E. Randolph St.</p>
