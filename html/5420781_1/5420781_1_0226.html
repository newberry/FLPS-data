   <p>The word "prohibition" is of the same meaning in the Dutch language as in the English. Although the meaning remains the same, it seems to be altered to the extent that in daily life it is only used exclusively in relation to the sale and use of alcoholic liquors. However this may be to the supporters of personal liberty who lament over the enactment of the prohibition law which curtails their personal liberty(?), prohibition will also be enforced against narcotics and all forms of dope. The so-called Miller anti-narcotic bill was accepted by Congress in Washington and it was up to President Harding to make this much-discussed subject a law.</p>
   <p>Those who are against opium prohibition have time and again declared that such a law was inadvisable, and would be impossible to enforce, pointing to the yet many cases of drunkenness in spite of the prohibition law. But, in the first place, the violations of this law are steadily declining and in the second place, the fact that a law is being violated cannot make such a law undesirable. Besides it will be much easier for the authorities to enforce opium prohibition than liquor prohibition.</p>

   <p>The new law gives the entire opium trade, manufacture as well as import, into the hands of a committee consisting of three cabinet members. This commission is completely empowered to stop all unlawful trade in morphine, cocaine, and other narcotics. Violation of this law can be punished by a fine of $10,000 and a five year prison sentence. And this law was necessary. The use of opium has, especially since the enactment of the prohibition law, alarmingly increased and for thousands of men and women, old as well as young, worked bodily and spiritual loss. Where a person does not know how to protect himself bodily and spiritually, then it is the duty of the government to come between and to protect the people from possible condemnation in spite of themselves. The government is in the service of the nation and does this not for the protection of a single person, but of the entire nation as such.</p>
   <p>Honor to the present government which had the courage to enact the opium prohibition law, and if there be obstacles to the enforcement of a law, those obstacles can be overcome. This was proved by the Sunday closing law in Chicago. Just as did the mayor of Chicago, the government at Washington shall find that the strict enforcement of the prohibition law and of the opium prohibition law will have the support of the best part of its citizens.</p>
