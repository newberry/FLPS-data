   <p>We are happy to report that Mr. T. Court van Woerden, our well-known Dutch chemist and urinalist, will be connected, beginning Sept. 16, with the Medical Specialty Company. He will now be able to employ his mind in a more extensive sphere, and to be of even more help to suffering humanity, than heretofore.</p>
   <p>That Mr. van Woerden's qualifications in the Medical world could not remain unobserved was to be expected. In the Netherlands, his ability as a chemist and his method of urinalysis drew the attention of the principal medical authorities. Even while still a boy, he proved that he had a natural talent for chemistry, and drew the attention of the celebrated chemist De Kruif, who at that time was established at his birthplace, Delft; from De Kruif he learned much in the sphere of urinalysis, meanwhile continuing his studies under the guidance of Dr. de Haan of Bleskensgraaf, who during his life was known not only in the Netherlands, but throughout Europe, for his great talents.</p>

   <p>When Mr. van Woerden came to America to find for his activities a more extensive field, he first settled in Grand Rapids, where his work was followed for a long time by one of the professors of the Medical College, who came frequently to his office.</p>
   <p>In Chicago his services were requested by the Medical Specialty Company. Before he was accepted, however, he was submitted to a strict examination, which ended to the satisfaction of all concerned. This Company has offered him a salary of $5,000 per year. This is not only a sign that the company gives him its full confidence, but it shows also, when professionals offer him such a salary, that he indeed must have produced much in the field of urinalysis.</p>
