   <p>The meeting of the burial fund "Zelfhulp", which was scheduled for last Thursday evening and then postponed, was opened at the last minute. There were present approximately 150 members. Thanks to the excellent discipline of those present, the best of order was maintained until the last minute. It was plain that the members came to make an end once and for all of the troublesome by-law question. The committee who had formulated the changes, could not boast of a pleasant reception.</p>
   <p>Through innumerable amendments the new by-laws were changed to such an extent that the committee found it difficult to recognize it as the result of their labors. In nearly all the important points they reverted back to the old by-laws. The stipulation, that in the future only the directors and the vice-president,(who because of their positions are automatically members) shall have the right to vote at the executive-board meetings, was especially important.</p>
   
   <p>The salaried officers ( President, Secretary and Treasurer) shall only have an advisory vote. The Board of Directors was instructed to have the by-laws printed in both the Dutch and English languages. The new by-laws will take effect next August 1st.</p>
