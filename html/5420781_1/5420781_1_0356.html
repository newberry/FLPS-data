   <p>A promise is a promise. In the preceding number of Onze Toekomst, I promised to give some particulars about the plan to establish a land organization. Circumstances prevent me from doing so, and therefore I am compelled to postpone it until Friday evening of this week. An advertisement in this number gives the necessary information about this meeting in Soustehs Hall, on 18th and Laflin Streets.</p>
   <p>May I herewith express to the public my sincere apologies, and thank the editor for the space furnished in his paper.</p>
   <p>Yours respectfully,</p>
   <p>J. de Boer.</p>
