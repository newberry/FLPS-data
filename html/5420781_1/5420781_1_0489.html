   <p>The meeting held last Wednesday, March 15, by the Dutch Society Excelsior was well attended.</p>
   <p>The hall, which was too large to make the speakers audible, was filled to capacity. Considering the poor acoustics of the hall, the program turned out better than could be expected. The band Harmonie, under the baton of director G. Ottenhoff, played wonderfully and is entitled to a word of appreciation.</p>
