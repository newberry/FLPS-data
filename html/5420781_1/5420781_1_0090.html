   <p>Two Christian school societies of Roseland, (Chicago) which have existed side by side for over thirty five years, have decided on the evening of May 2nd to reorganize and, henceforth, conduct their affairs under one Board and under one administrative head. According to the Christian School Yearbook, the "110th Place Christian School Society", is one of the oldest existing school societies in America. It was organized in 1884. The pupil enrollment which began with twenty-four, is now listed two hundred and sixty-nine. Seven years later, in 1891, the "104th Street Christian School Society was organized. From an initial enrollment of 25 pupils, the present enrollment is almost four hundred. Being in close proximity (the two schools being less than a mile apart), the two societies have put forth repeated efforts during the last thirty years to bring about an amalgamation. We are glad to report that the recent efforts put forth in this direction have been crowned with success. From a business point of view it is not difficult to point out, that is is comparatively easy to build up a strong organization when we can select the best organizing talent of two existing school societies. It is also obvious that one large organization can operate more efficiently and more economically, than two smaller organizations operating independently of each other. The greatest benefit, however, which we hope to derive from the union of our Christian educational forces in Roseland, is of an educational character. In the past our Christian schools, as well as our people, existed quite independently from American life. Being removed from American life our schools could arrange their affairs in innocent seclusion. Times have changed. At present our Christian schools must take a place alongside our public schools. Their buildings, equipment and educational standards must compare favorably with the buildings, equipment and standards of our public schools. If we, as supporters of the Christian schools, do not insist upon a certain equality in these respects, then our schools will become objects of reproach, not only for those who do not sympathize with the Christian school movement but also for our rising generation. Because of our present close contact with American life and its educational institutions, our Christian schools must, at least in a general way, be able to compete with the public school as educational institutions or else we find ourselves compelled to abandon our educational activities. To speak in more concrete terms, our schools must be able to stand the test of State inspection. They must be accredited by the State authorities. This means, that in the eyes of the public school authorities our schools must be in a position to give instruction which, intellectually considered, is on a par with that of the public schools. It goes without saying, that the educational standard as at present maintained in the public schools, is due in no small measure to the size of the school system. If each public school was an independent unit, its educational standard in a large degree would be undoubtedly much lower.</p>
   <p>In view, therefore, of the principle that in union is strength, the Christian educational leaders in Roseland have educational efforts in this part of our large city along co-operative lines. This recommendation of the two roseland school boards was concurred in by the respective school societies,each of which considered the amalgamation proposal on the same evening. A splendid attendance characterized both meetings. There were about 120 members present from the "110th Place Christian School Society". Although we did not make a close count of the number present, at the 104th street school meeting, we venture to state that, at this meeting, there was an even larger attendance. This could be expected in view of the fact that the latter society has a larger number of members. Under the leadership of J. Bosch, President of the "110th Place Christian School Society" and A. Zwitzer, President of the 104th street Christian School Society," a good spirit prevailed in the two separate meetings. And the motion to unite was practically unanimous at both meetings.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly one of the reasons why the plan to join has met with little of no opposition, is due to the fact, that both societies are finding it difficult to finance their school enterprises, if not in the way in which they are now operating then, at least, in the way that these enterprises should be operated in the near future. Because of this fact we wish to call attention to a possible danger. This danger, as we see it, is three-fold. In the first place, there is a possibility that a number of people of both societies, may be of the opinion that the merging of the two societies, will somehow open up a new source of income for financing the school and, for that reason, it may be thought that less money need be contributed. Now it may be possible to stop up certain financial leakages, nevertheless, let us bear in mind that the reorganization of our forces be it an an improvement in efficiency, as such, is not strictly speaking adding to the sources of our income. Insofar as money is needed, it must come from our pockets. Our people, you and I, are and always will be the sources of our income. Organization, management, is at best only a means or method of obtaining such money. A second possible danger resulting from the union of two societies may arise from the fact, that in the eyes of some, the reasons for contributing may seem less potent. Having grown up with a certain school, (one of the schools has a history of almost half a century), one becomes attached to such a school and its organizations. As a matter of loyalty to one's particular school society, one has added reasons for making financial contributions. Besides, wholesome rivalry between two local school societies is often a powerful factor in making financial sacrifices. If, however, such two societies become one and are operated under a new board such motives, as those just refered to, become largely ineffective. If our people, however, contribute to the cause of Christian education as a matter of principle, out of love for God and out of a deep abiding interest in His kingdom, then, I say there will be little danger that with the loss of a certain sense of private ownership there will be a corresponding loss of a sense of personal responsibility. Finally, and this possible danger is based on the two mentioned - by concentrating our educational efforts in one instead of two school organizations, we are in danger of removing the school from its constituency. Our Christian schools rest upon the principle that the parents are responsible for the education of their children. To carry out this responsibility, parents must ever be in close contact with their school and co-operate with the school authorities in an intimate as well as an intelligent manner. Now it is an undeniable fact that, in proportion as a school society becomes larger, there is a tendency on the part of the individual society member to become less and less informed in regard to school affairs, and there is a tendency on the part of the school board, to operate the school on a more independent, if not autocratic, basis. Naturally, this tendency is apt to become more pronounced when two comparatively large school societies merge into one. These matters have, of course, been duly considered by our local educational leaders. And we doubt not but that the new board will take the necessary precaution to offset this dangerous tendency. Personally we believe that by means of a strong publicity program, including frequent interesting, stimulating, society meetings, parent- teacher's meetings, effective committee work, (house - visitation), etc., the necessary contact between the school and its constituency cannot only be maintained but can be strengthened over and above what it is now. May God's blessing rest upon this important decision. May the merging of these two long established Christian school societies be the occasion for injecting new interest and enthusiasm in our local school activities. May God especially endow the to-be-elected board with the necessary wisdom, so that in the future it may become, that the union of these two societies has been conducive to further the interest of Christian education in these parts and, thereby, promote the cause of God's kingdom.</p>
