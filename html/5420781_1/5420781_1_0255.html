   <p>We observed, several weeks ago, that the inscription "In God We Trust" no longer appears on new ten-dollar gold pieces. This omission has lead to quite a discussion in the last few weeks.</p>
   <p>President Roosevelt himself is responsible for this change.</p>
   <p>Several important people, especially theologians and newspapermen, do not approve of the change. Their opinion is that there is enough skepticism in these days, and that it was an advantage to have the people reminded, whenever they handled the money, that this nation trusts in God.</p>
   <p>The President, however, believed that these words should not be printed on the new coins.</p>
   <p>If President Roosevelt has ever made a mistake that he will not acknowledge, <span class="page-break">\2</span>then it is this one. A more beautiful motto for the people than the serious, vigorous, holy words, "In God We Trust," cannot be found. That motto suggests that the prosperity we enjoy is derived from God.</p>
   <p>Today we are celebrating Thanksgiving Day, a day proclaimed by the President as a national holiday. How Satan would have enjoyed himself if President Roosevelt had not only done away with the motto, "In God We Trust," but had also withdrawn our national Thanksgiving Day.</p>
   <p>The President was wrong when he ordered these words omitted from the coinage. Let us honor Him who must be honored! Give God the honor that this nation intrusts in Him. "Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things which are God's."</p>
