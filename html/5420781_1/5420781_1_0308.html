   <p>Next Tuesday, will take place the primary election for the nomination of candidates for Judges. We call your attention to the fact that Justice McKinzie Cleland, now a judge of the Municipal Court, and who was dropped by chief Justice Olson, because he carried his Christian principles with him to the Judge's chair and because he instituted the so-called parole system, is a candidate for Judge of the Circuit Court.</p>
   <p>A vote for him is a vote for someone, who is not ashamed of his principle and who proves himself to be a Christian even in the Judge's chair.</p>
