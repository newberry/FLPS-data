   <p>On another page of this issue you will find an editorial, in which the writer expresses his doubts about the advisability of the establishing of a postal savings bank. He especially does not consider this country ripe for such an undertaking. A few weeks ago we pointed out how the practicability of the establishment of a postal savings bank is possible, and will refer back to that for the benefit of that worthy writer and of others, who cherish the same viewpoint. Let us say before hand that we are the enemy of the Socialistic principle of states or Government power. State power retards individual development and takes away from the people their individuality. Socialism, for that reason is dangerous. It goes against the free development of the individual. But where a case, even though it brings us in the path of government ownership and consequently of government power, has so many qualities that are worth recommending, as has a postal savings bank, we declare ourselves in favor of it. The postal system also belongs to the government, and it would be difficult to have it any other way. We say this with emphasis: We are against state ownership; and there must be indisputable reasons, why we declare ourselves in favor of exploitation by the government in one or the other undertaking. These indisputable reasons are evident relative to postal savings banks. The benefit of this can not be denied, and with that our worthy writer agrees wholeheartedly. As long as our bankers <span class="page-break">2</span>can give no better proof of their honesty and trustworthiness, as is now the case, and as long as the common citizen has not enough discretion to boycott the family banks,- for those are the dangerous ones, as we pointed out a few weeks ago-, then there must be found a safer banking system for our people, to encourage and develop the most beautiful of all virtues, the saving habit. But our worthy writer fears that our country is not ripe for a postal savings bank. And why not? Because our national debt is not high enough? So much the better. Right at this present moment, our government is busy with the construction of the Panama Canal, for which hundreds of millions dollars are needed. That money must be borrowed. And the government must pay interest on this borrowed capital. Could not this undertaking be paid with the money which is entrusted by us as citizens to the postal savings bank, for which the government pays us the so-called 2 1/2 per cent? This is only one case out of many. If there were no other place for the money, then the government could use it for the construction of of streets and high - ways. But that would not even be necessary. Why could it not be invested in State, County or City obligations? Take for example Cook County. In the last few years we were compelled to borrow millions for the building of parks and a new courthouse, for which obligations were issued. We know that would be called speculation, but what of it. All we want is a place for our savings, over which Uncle Sam has control, so that we are assured that <span class="page-break">3</span>they will not sometime be wiped out, and a place or opportunity, where Uncle Sam can invest that money. And such places and opportunities are legion.</p>
