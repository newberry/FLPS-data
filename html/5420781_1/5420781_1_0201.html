   <p>Last Wednesday the pupils of the Christian School, 111th and State Streets, spent a pleasant day in the "Pan Handle Woods." The children were transported from the School to the picnic grounds in the woods in automobiles and carriages.</p>
   <p>The Women's Club, which has undertaken the task of making and selling clothes to support the School financially, sold all the clothing which it offered for sale.</p>
   <p>It is reported that the picnic netted the School a profit of approximately one hundred dollars.</p>
