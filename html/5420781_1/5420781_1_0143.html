   <p>The Society of the "Roseland School for Christian Instruction," at 104th Street and Princeton Avenue,held Friday evening, February 28th, a meeting in the school building. The attendance was satisfactory and important decisions were taken. Because the present school does not meet the requirements,it was decided, if possible, to build a new school-house.</p>
   <p>To attain this purpose a committee of five members was chosen, which was ordered to draw up a plan to look for a convenient locality and to estimate the costs. There was also decided that all school-fees, starting with the beginning of April first, will be collected at the homes of the school-children.</p>
