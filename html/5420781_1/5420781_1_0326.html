   <p>The Republican voters, as was to be expected, have set the seal of their approbation upon the administration of Govenor Deneen and have renominated him by a majority of 12,000 votes for an office which he has occupied for four years in a worthy manner. The majority would have been much larger if thousands of Democrats had not voted for Mr. Yates instead of voting for their own candidates.</p>
   <p>Whatever the offices concerned, the so-called administrative candidates, in general, were chosen. Several, however, who we had hoped to see renominated, were not chosen. Among them we must mention John J. Healy, candidate for State's attorney, and our compatriot G. L. Rries, candidate for county commissioner. The loss of Mr. Healy is especially to be regretted because his opponent John E. W. Wayman, who was nominated has declared positively that he will not attempt to enforce the Sunday closing law, which Mr. Healy in recent years tried to enforce, although his efforts were rewarded with little success.</p>

   <p>At Roseland, in the eleventh senatorial district, our compatriot Cornelius J. Jon was renominated as candidate for the legislature, and Mr. Van Steenbergen once more obtained the nomination as candidate for county commissioner.</p>
