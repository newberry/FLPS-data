   <p>Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>In reply to a request from S. C. Ribbler, I write an article on some phase of the work at the Christian High School. I am submitting the following:</p>
   <p>Registration at the "C. C. H. S."</p>
   <p>As soon as I received the request from Mr. Ribbler for this article, I decided that I would undertake to give a few facts about the registration recently concluded. We have an enrollment at the present time of 177 pupils, distributed as shown in the following chart (chart seperate). Of course these figures can be analyzed in many ways with varying interpretations, but the outstanding facts are indicative of general growth for the period covered. The total enrollment has increased by 61 per cent during that time, a good portion of which is in the commercial department. It must, of course, be noted that this is also in great part responsible for the increased percentage of girls to boys.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>The relation of Reformed to Christian reformed has not been materially changed, but the number of those coming from other denominations has been increased from two in 1923, to nine at the present writing. These include five from the Norwegian Lutheran Church, one from the Christian Church and three from Mission enterprises. From the standpoint of classes there are eighty-two students in the first year of work, forty-five in the second year, thirty-three in the third year, and seventeen in the fourth and final year.</p>
   <p>It can readily be seen that the new building is no only desirable but imperative. We felt crowded in 1923 with 110 pupils, now we feel smothered. Fortunately, the end of this period is in sight, and we shall enter into a new era. How much this will mean to the institution, only those who have attended here can begin to realize. And perhaps not any so much as those who have attended in the previous quarters on Loomis Street. Of that group of pupils and instructors only one teacher and one pupil are still in our midst, namely Miss Hammekool and Anna Wieringa, who have returned to complete the work. Credit for the outstanding increase must of course be given to the West Side and Englewood, which have doubled their number of students since that time. Roseland and the outlying districts have always been well represented, but have not evidenced the same percentage of growth. Perhaps a word of explanation is necessary about the distribution to the general and commercial courses in 1925, where 136 are shown <span class="page-break">\3</span>as enrolled in the general and only 10 in the commercial course. This is not entirely a true statement, as among those taking general studies were a good many who intended to take up commercial work, but could not by reason of the limitations in equipment and facilities. This will be seen readily in the figures of 1926 where a more normal ratio is maintained.</p>
   <p>Yours Sincerely</p>
   <p>J. W. Sietsema</p>
