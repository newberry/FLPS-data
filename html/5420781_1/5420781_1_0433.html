   <p>The Dutch press is the soul of Dutch life in America, and of the soul, the editors are the strongest revelation. That is, Dutch Journalism in the United States has the mark of personal journalism and is governed by a few influential persons. These persons are usually Dutch by birth, of genuine Dutch principles and character, and have thus impressed upon the Dutch press a strong character with Dutch peculiarities. The Dutch press in America is divided into a church and a secular press. But the last also carries a religious character. Experience has taught that a neutral Dutch press among the Reformed Dutch in America has no chance for success. The Church press has its home in the State of Michigan where there exists the largest Dutch population. The Hope, and the Leader of the Reformed church are published in Holland, Mich., while De Wachter and the Banner are published in Grand Rapids, Mich., as well as Religion and Culture. Grand Rapid is the bulwark of the Christian Reformed Church. The contents as well as the form of the English printed publications look definitely American. The language, however, is secondary for their main purpose is the well-being of Churches and Institutions. The two main papers of the Church, DeWachter and De Hope have, like their English sisters, about the same contents, more or less dictated by different needs and circumstances. In some cases, the same articles appear, although translated, in both the English and Dutch papers. The influence of these papers is very large in their respective Church groups, for what is <span class="page-break">2</span>printed in De Wachter or De Hope is usually taken for granted. Not alone have these church organs great influence as such, but also as carriers of the Old Dutch Civilization and as users of the Dutch language. These papers reach nearly all the Netherlands population in the United States and give to this population a feeling of self-appreciation as well is maintained our spiritual heritage. Next to the afore-mentioned church papers, weeklies, and news papers such as De Grondwet at Holland. The Christian Journal at Grand Rapids and the Hollandsche Amerikaan at Kalamazoo, Mich. have a far-reaching influence. De Grondwet is the oldest Dutch newspaper in the United States and was established in 1860. (It has never denied its exceptional character as a newspaper.) Besides general news, these Michigan papers have columns for Netherland news, correspondence agricultural news, editorials, and other such contributions. De Hollandsche Amerikaan, which is published semi - weekly, and the Christian Journal are more local of character and circulation than is De Grondwet. In contrast to its English name, the Christian Journal contains in the main Dutch articles, and but little news. The Eastern part of the United States has two Dutch organs, Het Oosten (the East-tram) at Paterson, N. J., and Holland and Her Colonies, a monthly, Published by the Netherland Chamber of Commerce at New York, and the Netherlands American foundation, of which Mr. Edward W. Bok is the head and founder. The first paper contains much news, is a Christian paper and is circulated largely in the immediate vicinity. Holland and Her Colonies is a trade organ with the <span class="page-break">3</span>purpose of making the ties between the Netherlands and America stronger. It uses the English language. This periodical with its glorious photographic pictures and good articles of high calibre, is devoted to the commercial cultural interests of the two countires. This organ is supported by influential Americans of Old Netherlands origin. In Chicago, the second largest city in the United States, and the actual center of Dutch life in this country, there is circulated in addition to the weekly, Onze Toekomst, a Flemish weekly, The Gazetto of Moline.</p>
   <p>Originally a young people's organ, Onze Toekomst, in a quarter century, became the most important newspaper among the wetherlanders in America. Under the energetic leadership of the Present editor, this paper has spread and has become a great influence. The foreign news bears witness to its sharp-seeing eye, the Netherlands news is newer and more interesting than that in most other newspapers in this land. Thru its numerous advertisements, it has become independent and was even able to publish and extra page called "Het Westen" (The West) which is edited from Orange City, Iowa. The main contents of this issue is written in strong and sometimes illustrious Dutch, which is a sign of good taste. In Iowa, there are now three Dutch weekly papers, De Volksfriend (the People's Friend) of Orange City, The Pella Weekblad (Pella Weekly) at Pella and the Sioux Center <span class="page-break">4</span>Weekblad (Sioux Center Weekly) at Sioux Center. The first mentioned of these publications contains many articles and pious editorials as well as a far-reaching correspondence from the Western States, while the other two are more local in character and meaning and are possessed of the same local characteristics. In the different publications in the Dutch language in America, there is, however, revealed one tone, namely, the tone of love for the Netherlands and the House of Orange. In this love they have never strayed or failed, because the ties to the Netherlands Royalty and the love for the old fatherland were in their blood as well as in that of the writer.</p>
   <p>The language is the people and as long as the Netherlands press exists in America, that long shall the Netherlands and the House of Orange be honored.</p>
