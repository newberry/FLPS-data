   <p>In another article of this number, you can read what Lloyd George says about the British-Japanese accord. The accord has no designs against any land and certainly not against the United States. For what purpose, then, this accord? The Allies promise to aid one another in time of need, or, at least, in case one or the other gets into trouble with another country, to observe strict neutrality. An accord between two or three nations means more than mere sentimentality...Great Britian's purpose is mastery on the seas, expansion of the empire of world commerce, as well as leadership in the financial world. Japan's purpose in the first place is expansion. It already has gone to war three times for this purpose, with China, Russia and Germany; and everytime it came nearer to its goal. It won Korea, Formosa, Port Arthur, Saghalin, and economic control over Shantung, and military occupation of a large part of Siberia, as well as strategic points in the Pacific Ocean. And you know what Great Britian won. British friendship for the United States still consists in uttering words. With the strained relations existing between our land and Japan, we should consider very carefully what a renewal of an accord between England and Japan can mean for us. Let us not be misled by England's soft whistling. Beware.</p>
