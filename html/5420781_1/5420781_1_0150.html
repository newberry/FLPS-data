   <p>Sunday night a special meeting was held at the First Reformed Church on Hastings Street. Six young men were present who were about to say farewell to Chicago, to their parents, friends, and relatives, in order to prepare themselves elsewhere for the struggles of life. In other words, these boys were either returning to university, or were about to enter upon some venture for the first time.</p>
   <p>The principal guests of the evening were our fellow citizens Clarence Dam and Fred Zandstra, who were returning to Holland, Michigan, to qualify themselves at Hope College for Christian service. With them went E. Ferda, who also hopes to train himself at that institution to be a minister of the Gospel.</p>
   <p>There were also present three students from a previous congregation of Reverend H. P. Schnurman's who had spent some time with their former teacher. These boys were also ready to return with the others to Holland, Michigan. They are Gerrit Maurits, Henry Jacobs, and Harry Hoff.</p>
   <p>Reverend P. Braak, home missionary of the Reformed Church, was among those who came to say farewell to the young men.</p>
