   <p>On Monday, at Roseland a meeting was held of representatives of the Christian school boards in Cook County, attended also by the principals of the schools, to decide about a curriculum made up by the principals and sent to the various boards in order to take the matter accurately and earnestly into consideration.</p>
   <p>The purpose of the adoption of the curriculum is to obtain from the State such recognition that the boards shall be entitled to award certificates to graduated pupils, admitting them to high schools under the same conditions as the children who attend the public schools.</p>
   <p>Two curriculumshad been laid out, in the first of which the Dutch language would be used in the first three of four classes, while in the second Dutch is entered only as a subject.</p>

   <p>Because the opinions of the school boards were divided on this subject, neither of the curriculums was accepted. It was decided to revise both, in order to bring them nearer together and so to satisfy both parties.</p>
