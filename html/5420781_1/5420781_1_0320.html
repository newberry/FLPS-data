   <p>Herman Teninga</p>
   <p>Candidate for Alderman in the 33rd Ward</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois, February 24, 1910.</p>
   <p>Dear Friends:</p>
   <p>May we call your attention for a moment to the candidacy of Mr. Herman Teninga, Republican alderman of the 33rd Ward in Chicago?</p>
   <p>We should like to tell you in brief what he has done to keep the good name of our Dutch people in high esteem.</p>
   <p>He was chairman of the committee which obtained the beautiful Palmer Park for us here.</p>
   <p>For two years he was president of the South End Business Men's Association</p>
   
   <p>As chairman of the Head Committee of the 60-year jubilee, held the 5th of July, 1909, he was a tireless worker.</p>
   <p>The Mayor of Chicago nominated him as a member of the Chicago Plan Committee. This committee worked hard to build up and beautify Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Teninga has done much for the inhabitants of our ward especially, and for the City of Chicago in general.</p>
   <p>This should convince you that his experience will make him one of the leaders in the Council of Chicago.</p>
   <p>We, as city Dutchmen and also as citizens of this ward are favoring improvements; therefore, we have to get the best man for the office of alderman. We are sure that you have to admit that, from the point of view of experience, Mr. Teninga is the right man.</p>
   <p>This election depends greatly upon you.</p>
   
   <p>We are urgently requesting you, therefore, to vote Friday, March 4, for Mr. Herman Teninga.</p>
   <p>Your Friends,</p>
