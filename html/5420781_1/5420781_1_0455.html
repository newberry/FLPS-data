   <p>This we read in an advertisement of one of the largest film studios in America. All to the movies, so the cat take the most comfortable chair in the house. Thousands upon thousands spend a couple of hours daily in the movies. The film art is pretty, the making and showing of films is very profitable, but the moral influence of the film in general is very sad. The movie habit is a habit hard to get rid of. We read an illustration of this not meant to show the danger of the movies, but which nevertheless, does: The husband of a washwoman told her employer, that she could not come to wash, because she was sick. "Not bad I hope," said the lady. "Yes," answered the nessenger, "Last night she was so sick, I had to go to the movies alone."</p>
