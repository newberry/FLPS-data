   <p>Last Friday evening, May 27th, the Dutch Society Excelsior was pleasantly surprised by a visit of Mr. Frank Danish, Alderman of the 11th Ward. This gentleman called the attention to the fact that he had come to fulfill his promise, which he had made during the last Alderman's election.</p>
   <p>He had promised the Dutch Society Excelsior, a donation at that time, and he declared, that he did this because he was a great advocate of such societies, where mutual assistance is procured, and if agreeable, the society would hear more from him.</p>
   <p>Often during election time some promise a lot, only to donate very little afterwards. But Mr. Danish has shown himself to be a man of his word. He was elected and still he came. And when such a man represents the 11th Ward - a man who has an open eye for the needs of his Ward - it cannot be otherwise, but that we may expect those improvements, which are necessary in the Ward.</p>

   <p>In the name of the members of the Dutch Society Excelsior.</p>
   <p>J. Van den Berg, President;</p>
   <p>B. Van der Molen, Secretary.</p>
