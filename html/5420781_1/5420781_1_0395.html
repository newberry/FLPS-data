   <p>Mr. Homo Faber, our countryman and fellow citizen, 67 Flournoy Street, was awarded the Gold and Silver medals at the World's Fair held at Rotterdam from May 19 to June 1 of this year for his invention of the so-called folding organs, which are particularly adapted for street preaching by traveling evangelists. The organs can be folded and carried like a suitcase. Mr. Faber, who has branch offices at Amsterdam, Utrecht, and Arnhem, was represented by John De Heer, of Rotterdam. Mr. Faber's folding organs are already being distributed throughout the entire world. He showed us among others a telegram from Melbourne, Australia, with an order for ten folding organs. This order came possibly as a result of the round-the-world trip made by the Chapman Alexander Missionary Society.</p>
