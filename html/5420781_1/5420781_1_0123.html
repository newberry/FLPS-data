   <p>Evergreen Park has a beautiful, purposeful and well-planned school building. There are four rooms; two are in use and the other two are awaiting further development of Christian education in this place.</p>
   <p>The number of pupils now is about ninety, instructed by three teachers in eight grades. The board consists of nine members. Mr. William Hoekstra is president, and Mr. Wiersma, secretary.</p>
   <p>Certainly this is a very good beginning. The Union hopes that Evergreen Park will also join them. (Union of Christian School Boards.)</p>
