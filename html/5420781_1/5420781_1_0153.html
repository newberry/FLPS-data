   <p>Now we have to use this American expression, and why not since it sounds properly to.</p>
   <p>The graduating exercises of our parochial schools are taking place this week. Those of the school on 15th Street, were held on Tuesday evening, July 19th. First, the principal, Mr. Kuiper, gave a speech and after that the graduates recited compositions in English and Dutch, as proof that they have qualified themselves in both languages and that the instruction in the Dutch language did no harm to their English.</p>
   <p>To-night (Thursday evening) the graduating exercises of the Englewood School are taking place in the church building of the First Christian Reformed Congregation, at 71st Street. The program is nearly the same as that on the West-side, except, of course, persons and subjects differ.</p>
