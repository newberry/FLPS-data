   <p>Many good people are withholding their support from the Christian school movement, because, as they say, they do not wish to play a losing game. The Christian schools, according to their way of thinking, are bound to peter out. This is the way they size up the Christian school situation. The idea of the Christian schools has not only been imported from the Netherlands, but the whole educational system of the Christian school is characteristically Dutch; as such, it is foreign-outlandish. This being the case our schools must die out with our Holland churches. Progressing in the Americanization movement spells decadence in the Christian school movement. Discard the Dutch language and you bury the Christian school. Do these predictions agree with the actual history of our schools? Let us see. Those who are somewhat familiar with the history of our Christian school know that the schools have passed or are passing through three rather definite stages of development.</p>

   <p>In their first stage, the Christian schools were Dutch schools. The teachers were Hollanders, rather than Americans. Thought was conveyed by means of the Dutch tongue. The teaching methods, the customs and manners were largely, if not entirely, Dutch. Even the ideals held up to the children were often more foreign than American. Regrettably, this is the picture which many of the opponents of Christian education have of the Christian school, even to day. They seemingly do not know that just as a child outgrows its childish prattle and childlike ways, so also the Christian school movement had outgrown the Dutch language and the Dutch customs. (Those which still devote sometime to it, largely teach it as one of the many subjects in the curriculum.) In these schools the tendency is to make the study of Dutch elective. In its second stage of development the Christian school movement is marked as being largely a church affair. Our schools, though not in name, were in reality parochial schools.</p>

   <p>The pressure which was brought to bear upon our people in behalf of the Christian school proceeded from the church, and was done largely for the sake of building up the church. The leaders of the church were also the leaders of the Christian school. The institution of the school was subordinate to and existed for the institution of the church. Sad to say, our schools have not yet out- grown this church stage. Some schools must still become free - free Christian schools. It is, however, a hopeful sign that those schools which are blameworthy in this respect are struggling hard to free themselves from the ecclesiastical stigma.</p>
   <p>The third or final stage of our Christian schools can be characterized by saying that our schools are American free Christian schools. They are American -American in the sense that they are constitutional, willed by our country, being expressions of religious freedom - that glorious privilege of which Americans will always boast, as long as the America to be, develops in a manner <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>consistent with the spirit of the American which was. Again the schools are American in the sense that they hold up American ideals, that they teach true love for our country, and, in the same sense, that they foster a loyal citizenry, and doing all this in a far more effective way than can be done in a religious educational institution. The Christian schools, in their highest development, are free free in the sense that they strengthen both state and church. Instead of proceeding from the state ( as do the public schools), or from the church (as do the parochial schools), the Christian schools owe their origin, their maintenance, and their management to separate societies, called in to being for that very purpose. Furthermore, the Christian school, in its last stage of development is Christian - Christian in the sense that the spirit of the school, its teaching and its discipline are, in a deep going fundamental way, conditioned by the word of God. Such has been the development of the Christian schools; from Dutch to American, from parochial to free. As Dutch families our people migrated to America, but in due time, by natural development, these Dutch families became American families. How could our schools fare differently, inasmuch as each school represents a group of families. In our next article we hope to take up the expansion of our Christian schools in a more thorough manner. M. Fakkema.</p>
