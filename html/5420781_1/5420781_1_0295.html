   <p>Tuesday is election day, O, yes we have wholesale elections. But to tell the truth the one next Tuesday is of very little interest to us. In only a couple of wards is there a contest worthy of mention, and then only in such wards where only a few Hollanders reside. Take for instance the eleventh ward, where Edward Cullerton has ruled for a long time. Luckily that our countryman Mr. H. Stuit, is a candidate on the prohibition ticket in that ward. We can do nothing but advise our readers to vote for him, even if it is only with little hope for a majority, but as a protest against the rotten political machine of both the large parties in that ward.</p>
   <p>The City offices, are so far above the others and we wish to refrain from recommending anyone. Probably the primary election of April 13th, for Judicial candidates will be more interesting.</p>
