   <p>The debate that took place last week between the Chicago Christian high school and that in Holland, Michigan, was a double success for the Chicago school. The Chicago affirmative team that went to Holland, Michigan, received a two to one decision, while the negative team at Chicago that debated against Holland, also won the debate.</p>
   <p>There was but little difference, it was a close contest. The Chicago high school is proud of its teams.</p>
