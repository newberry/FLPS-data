   <p>The death of President Harper of Chicago University will delay the plans of the General Dutch League. The League is busy making plans to secure a course in the Dutch language at Chicago University.</p>
   <p>According to our information, Dr. Harper was favorable to starting such a course. That he, just now, should be called from his field of labor at the age of forty-nine is to be regretted the more for that reason. We hope that his successor will be even more favorable to our cause.</p>
