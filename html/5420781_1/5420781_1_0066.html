   <p>Mr. Oosterheert last week received the following letter from Dr. Judson, president of the University, which reveals that the agitation for a chair for Dutch learning is not dormant, but is probably nearer its fulfillment than we had dared to hope some time ago:</p>
   <p>Worthy Mr. Oosterheert;</p>
   <p>Your letter of January 25th, concerning the Dutch Chair of learning was handed to me by Dr. Goodspeed. As you well know, I am immensely interested in this subject. It should be well understood, that a part of the work which was proposed by the committee, is already being done by the University.</p>
   
   <p>The department of History and the department of History of art, are both favorable to the subject. At the present time, no specified work is being done in the Dutch language and literature. It will be a pleasure to me, as soon as the University, finances are sufficient, to add this work to the department of Germanic languages and literature.</p>
   <p>We have no doubt some teachers, who are capable of doing this work, but at the present, all their time is occupied with the work that is now being done.</p>
   <p>With recognition of the interest shown by the League I am yours,</p>
   <p>Very truly,</p>
   <p>Harry Pratt Judson.</p>
   
   <p>A communication from the headquarters of the administration of the General Dutch League, located at Dordrecht, was sent to the Board of Trustees and University Senate, which read as follows:</p>
