   <p>Last Week we announced that the above mentioned society would give an entertainment on March 12th. The members are already in the possesion of the admission tickets. The price is twenty-five cents for adults and fifteen cents for people under sixteen years of age. We wish to point out, however, that it is not an evening for children, being exclusively set apart for those who can keep themselves quiet, and who make no undesirable noises during the performance.</p>
   <p>We have seen the cover, which was sent to the members to obtain advertisements. It appears to us that the committee has left no stone unturned to make the evening a success.</p>
