   <p>Last year, on the 4th of July, the Chicago Lithuanians for the first time took part in the parade as a separate national group and not as part of the Poles. The American newspaper praised us very much and said, "The Lithuanians showed up for the first time, and they proved themselves to be very good....."</p>
   <p>Beginning at that time the Lithuanians have taken an important place in Chicago affairs. What part the Lithuanians will take in the [future] civic life of Chicago will depend upon their [own] initiative.</p>
   <p>Since the Lithuanians have begun to take part in civic life, they have been invited to participate in the anniversary celebration of Washington's birthday on February 22.</p>
