   <p>A meeting was called on May 23 to organize the new local of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. The speakers at that meeting were Doctor Zimontas and K. Jurgelionis, who explained to the people the importance and the benefit of having a local of the Lithuanian Alliance of America in Chicago, Illinois. They invited all people to join this local, regardless of their religion or political view point. This local does not discriminate against Catholics or Socialists. They are all welcome to join. A large number of people came to this meeting to hear about the new local of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, which is being organized by Dr. Zimontas and K. Jurgelionis. The very same evening the Lithuanian Alliance of America local was organized and signed by ten charter members and the executive committee was elected. Some of the members who were elected are as follows: B. Janulis, chairman; B. Biliunas, secretary; J. Ciapas, financial secretary; and J. Baukus, treasurer. The members elected are hard working men and have sufficient experience in handling the problems of our new local. Moreover, they are progressive people and know their work. We firmly believe that this new local will be a success.</p>
