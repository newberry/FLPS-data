   <p>On April 29, Sunday, the well known Evangelical pastor, M. Keturakaitis, held a sermon for the Lithuanian Protestants in the church at 14th and Union Avenue. On May 1st, the Lithuanian Protestants held their meeting and the pastor was present there. Some of the Protestants wanted to organize their society on the basis of Roman Catholics, that the pastor should come every month to hold the sermon. If the members of the society should pay 50 cents per month to the society and 25 cents to the pastor, the total would be 75 cents per month. As the payment was too high, the suggestion failed. After the long lamentation, only two new members joined the society, while other kept quiet and tied their pockets.</p>
