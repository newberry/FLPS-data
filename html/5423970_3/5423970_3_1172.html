   <p>The commemoration of the five hundredth anniversary of the Gruenwald Battle, which is being arranged by the Poles will have to be for them, whether they wish it or not, a rather mournful ceremony. For, while it will remind them of the great ancient victory on the fields of Gruenwald, it will also have to remind them of the hard blow dealt them today by the Lithuanians. [Translator's note: In 1410, a united Lithuanian-Polish army, led by Lithuania's Grand Duke, Vytautas, so decisively defeated the German Knights that the latter's power was completely shattered. In planning a commemoration of this victory at Gruenwald, now known as Tannenburg, the Chicago Poles invited the Chicago Lithuanians to join them in the celebration. This article describes a meeting which was called to discuss the same sort of commemoration.] If until now the Poles were in doubt about this matter and cherished the hope that their former ties with the Lithuanians, which were long ago disowned by the latter but which the Poles continually cite to the point of boredom, would be renewed, then the last flickering of that hope must now be <span class="page-break">2</span>extinguished for them.</p>
   <p>This was made plainly apparent during a well-attended meeting which was held in Chicago on February 27 concerning the planning of the commemoration of the Gruenwald. The meeting was held in the St. George School Hall and was attended by a total of about sixty persons, delegates from various nationalistic and church societies in Chicago. Several of the delegates were authorized to represent more than one society so that it can be boldly stated that about ninety per cent of all the Chicago societies participated in this meeting . . .</p>
   <p>This question was raised first of all: "Will the Lithuanians have a celebration of the Gruenwald Battle?" This matter was to be decided by the delegates in its final form.</p>
   <p>After brief and clear speeches were made on this question by Reverend Ambrazaitis, B. K. Balevicius, Pocevicius and others, it was finally decided that a festive celebration be planned to commemorate the Battle <span class="page-break">3</span>of Gruenwald.</p>
   <p>Here, in turn, the attention of the meeting was called to the invitation which the Chicago Poles officially addressed to their "Lithuanian brothers".... attempting to persuade them to celebrate the proposed commemoration together with the Poles.</p>
   <p>While B. K. Balevicius read the aforementioned appeal very apparent smiles were observed on the countenances of the delegates, who, attempting to maintain official courtesy, strove to hide them. Later, when the same B. K. Balevicius read an excerpt from the Polish newspaper, Dziennik Chicagoski to the meeting, in which a temporary Polish committee boasted that"..... our Lithuanian brothers favor a common Gruenwald commemoration," the dignity maintained up to then broke and the Hall resounded with laughter, and the hearty chuckles of the delegates.</p>
   <p>In view of such a demonstration, the formal question, "Will we celebrate with the Poles or alone?" was apparently unnecessary and it was noisily and unanimously decided to ignore the Poles and to continue our plans as they <span class="page-break">4</span>have been begun.</p>
