   <p>The Lithuanian public convention was held on February 22, 1906, in Philadelphia, Pa. Not much good came of this convention to the Lithuanian public. In the number 14 issue of Lietuva it was stated that another such convention should be called in Chicago, in order to make better plans as to how to help the revolution in Lithuania against the tsar of Russia.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Alliance of America will have its convention in Chicago this year. The delegates of the Lithuanian Alliance also belong to other societies in their cities, so it would be proper for such delegates to represent the Lithuanians of their cities at the Lithuanian public convention. Such a public convention would not make more expenses for the delegate, with the exception of living expenses for one or two more days. I think that this second Lithuanian convention can be more successful <span class="page-break">2</span>than the first convention in Philadelphia. Now the people will know the reason why the convention in Philadelphia did not give the desired results. I am sure that at this convention we will be able to unite all the Lithuanian factions into one strong political union to help our brothers in Lithuania fight against the tsar's despotism.</p>
