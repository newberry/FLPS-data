   <p>The Chicago Archbishop permitted the building of the new Lithuanian church in Chicago. The committee obtained a written permit.</p>
   <p>For this reason we are calling a meeting on March 31, at 778 S. Halsted St. At this meeting the Archbishop's permit will be read and the constitution which was approved by the church authorities. Therefore all the Lithuanians should come to this meeting who want to establish God's home and help us to go forward. In the name of the committee.</p>
