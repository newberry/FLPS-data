   <p>The Lithuanian Baptists began to organize about the year 1918, and they called themselves the Raymond Missionary Institutue until 1928. The first preacher was J. Vaitulis from 1918 to 1928. From 1928 on, the name was changed to Raymond Chapel. The present Pastor, Rev. J. Rodinas, has been there since 1928. His assistant, since 1922, has been G. Tamosiunas.</p>
   <p>There are about seventy parishioners. The parish maintains a school which has a Kindergarten, and which teaches the older children all kinds of handwork, but nothing else.</p>
   <p>A journal called Sviesa (The Light) is issued monthly. Previously it was issued regularly, but now it is issued only when the funds allow it. The first editor was J. Acas. The publishers are Rev. G. Rodinas and G. Tamosiunas.</p>
   <p>The church is worth about $15,000.</p>
