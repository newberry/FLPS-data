   <p>In the last issue of Lietuva we wrote about the split that is taking place in the ranks of the Knights of Lithuania youth organization. A similar movement is now manifesting itself among our Socialists. The newly formed Lithuanian Workers' Council is the nucleus of a separatist Lithuanian Socialist organization. That was not clear before but now it appears that there cannot be any doubt about it.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Grigaitis, organizer and head of the Council, did not lay all his cards on the table until now. However, as soon as he noticed that several branches of his Council were organized, and as soon as he felt some kind of a solid foundation under his feet, he immediately sent a stern ultimatum to the Lithuanian Socialist League, threatening to resign from the League if the newspaper <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Kova (The Struggle), organ of the League, did not cease criticizing him and his Council.</p>
   <p>Kova has not stopped criticising, and it may be stated that relations between Mr. Grigaitis and the League are as good as broken. Mr. Grigaitis remains as the leader of a new organization, to which he has given a high-sounding name--"Lithuanian Workers' Council."</p>
   <p>Now it becomes very clear why Mr. Grigaitis, who during a speaking tour of the United States in the year 1905 energetically denounced Lithuanianism and nationalism, has now incorporated into his program the defense and promotion of the interests of Lithuania. It appears that he does not expect to receive any support or to gain any members from the Socialist International; all true Lithuanian Socialists belong to the Lithuanian Socialist League and look upon Mr. Grigaitis' organization with disfavor. Likewise, the Council cannot <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>recruit any members from the ranks of the Catholics. Therefore, only one field remains in which Mr. Grigaitis can recruit members for his organization; that field is in the middle, between the Socialists and Catholics--that is, the half-hearted Nationalists.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grigaitis does not expect to recruit members from the ranks of full-hearted Nationalists, but even half-hearted Nationalists will not be any too anxious to join an organization which discredits the Lithuanian nationality and is not concerned with the interests of Lithuania. So in order to attract that element into his organization he added to his program a tail, which deals with the defense and promotion of the interests of Lithuania. Everyone who knows the head and the leaders of the Lithuanian Workers' Council well understands that the insertion of a plank about the interests of Lithuania is only a bait to catch unsuspecting Lithuanians. The general Lithuanian-American public should also be aware of this fact.</p>
   <p>Whether or not Mr. Grigaitis will succeed in recruiting some members from <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the Lithuanian Socialist League and other sources only the future will reveal.</p>
