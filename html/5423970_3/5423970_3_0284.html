   <p>During a christening party at the home of Joseph and Anna Dacialas, 2322 West 22nd Place, given in honor of their son on March 5, attention was called to the difficult plight of our brothers and sisters in Lithuania. It was decided to make a collection for their benefit. [Names of donors omitted in translation.] The collection totaled twelve dollars, which sum was sent to the National Fund[one of the three relief funds maintained by the Lithuanians]. Sincere thanks should be expressed to the donors.</p>
