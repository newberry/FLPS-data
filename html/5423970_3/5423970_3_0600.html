   <p>The great need for an organization such as the Association of Chicago Lithuanian Societies, a need which was felt for a long time by all Chicago Lithuanian mutual aid societies, clubs, lodges of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, branches of the Lithuanian Socialist League, and the theatrical and musical societies, has been met by a new organization known as the Association of Chicago Lithuanian Societies, which has just been established and incorporated according to the laws of the state of Illinois. This Association has been established in order to unite all Chicago Lithuanian societies and clubs for material and moral benefits, and for the honor of Lithuaniansm. This Association plans to build a community hall where our Lithuanian organizations may have meetings, conventions, commemorations, balls, theatrical presentations, and a public library in which to deposit historical Lithuanian documents and objects.</p>
   
   <p>In order for the Association of Chicago Lithuanian Societies to succeed and attain its goal, it must receive the support of a sufficient number of Chicago Lithuanian societies and clubs. All the Lithuanian organizations of Chicago and its suburbs are invited to join and support the Association. All organizations are requested to send intelligent and patriotic delegates to meetings of the Association. All societies and clubs that have not joined the Association are asked to do so at once. Let us work separately, but in unity. It is a well-known fact that if all our organizations work together in unity, they will be able to accomplish much greater deeds for the benefit of our people.</p>
   <p>Although the Association is only newly organized and has only about twenty-five per cent of all Chicago Lithuanian societies and clubs affiliated with it, nevertheless, it is already credited with a number of worthy accomplishments. The other seventy-five per cent of our societies and clubs should join the Association in order to show other nationalities that we can work in unity and accomplish something good for the honor and benefit of our people.</p>
   
   <p>Let us work together, and in a short time we will be greatly pleased with the fruits of our labors.</p>
