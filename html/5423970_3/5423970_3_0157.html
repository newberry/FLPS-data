   <p>The Federation of Chicago Lithuanian Societies, organized last fall to raise funds for Lithuanian war relief, has already raised over five hundred dollars. The money was raised by benefit affairs sponsored by the societies "which belong to the Federation. The money will soon be sent to Lithuania, in care of Dr. Jonas Basanavicius, the director of the Lithuanian War Relief Society in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>Last Saturday, in the Milda Hall, a meeting was held for the delegates and officers of the various societies of the Federation. Plans for the future activities of the Federation were formulated at the meeting. It was proposed that a big picnic be held in midsummer for the benefit of the war-stricken people of Lithuania; it was proposed that the picnic be sponsored by all societies of the Federation, and that the members of all the societies attend the picnic as a unit. Final decision on this matter was postponed <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>until the following meeting, on April 9, at Wodman's Hall, 33rd and Lime Streets.</p>
   <p>At the meeting a vote of thanks was given to the newspaper Lietuva (Lithuania) because of its excellent co-operation with the Federation in all its activities. Lietuva published the advertisements of all the Federation's benefit affairs free of charge, whereas other Chicago Lithuanian newspapers charged for these as for all business advertisements. Furthermore, some of the other publications even made efforts to hamper the activities of the Federation.</p>
   <p>At the meeting a few more societies handed in their donations to the warrelief fund. Among these societies were: Truth Lovers Society, Lithuanian Fellowship Society, Sacred Heart of Jesus Society, St. Matthew's Society, and the St. Peter and Paul Society. John Kulis, professional Lithuanian wrestling promoter, handed in fifteen dollars, the proceeds from a benefit wrestling show.</p>
