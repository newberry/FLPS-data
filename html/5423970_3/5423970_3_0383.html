   <p>The Second District (Chicago) of the Lithuanian Alliance of America held its regular monthly meeting at Aurora Hall on July 8. Among other matters, the most important question of the day, the war, was discussed.</p>
   <p>It was unanimously decided that many little flags be prepared for sale at the District picnic, which will take place at Leafy Grove on September 6. The profits from the sale of these flags will be donated to provide relief for our brothers in Lithuania who are suffering because of the war.</p>
