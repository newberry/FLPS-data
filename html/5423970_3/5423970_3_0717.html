   <p>The Lovers of the Fatherland Society has donated five thousand Lithuanian books for use by Lithuanian prisoners of war in various European countries. Mr. M. J. Damijonaitis, librarian of the Society, has already shipped the books from Chicago to New York.</p>
   <p>Lithuanian war prisoners, in Germany especially, have been craving Lithuanian books for a long time. The Society had been planning to send books to Lithuanian prisoners for quite some time. However, a final decision was not made until Martynas Ycas, Lithuanian representative in the Russian Duma, came to America on a visit and persuaded the Society to send the books now. Mr. Ycas promised to supervise the shipment on his return trip to Europe this fall.</p>
   <p>The value of the books that have been donated is about one thousand dollars. They were published by the Society. All shipping expenses will be paid by the Society. It is believed that the books will reach the Lithuanian prisoners <span class="page-break">2</span>shortly before Christmas. Therefore, these unfortunate Lithuanians will receive a very pleasant Christmas present.</p>
