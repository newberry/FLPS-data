   <p>There was an article in number 23 of Lietuva about the Lithuanian Alliance of America. Such an alliance among the Lithuanians is very essential. A few years ago there was organized a Lithuanian science society. This society failed because it criticized the Catholic religion, priests, etc. The leaders of this organization did not care about the church, faith and the benefits of the Catholic religion.</p>
   <p>We must organize all Lithuanian societies in Chicago to join the Lithuanian Catholic Alliance of America.</p>
   <p>This Lithuanian Catholic Alliance of America has already published a history of Lithuania written by Simonis Daukantas. This book will be given free to all members of the Lithuanian alliance.</p>
   <p>It is the time for our Lithuanians in Chicago to join this organization, we will do good not only for ourselves but to the Catholic faith and to our mother Lithuania.</p>
