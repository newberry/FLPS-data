   <p>Our honorable guests, Dr. J. Basanavicius, and M. Yeas from Lithuania, having arrived as delegates of the Lithuanian Science Society, it becomes the duty of our American Lithuanians to support them in every way. To help them fulfill the purpose for which they came, it is necessary that we act not merely as Lithuanians, but because we are a large part of Lithuania, that one-fourth of our nation which is living in America under superior living conditions.</p>
   <p>The need for a national museum is so imperative that no one can deny it. There are many nations smaller than ours who have their own national institutions of culture. These nations for such cultural projects put aside all their political differences, and act together for the establishment of a cultural center. Therefore, the Lithuanian nation cannot remain static, but must go forward. Our nation must stand in the front, not in the rear of others.</p>
   
   <p>We have proof of what we have accomplished since we obtained the freedom of our language press in Lithuania. During these few years, we have made marvelous progress. Other nations looking with astonishment at what we have accomplished in the cultural field. The historians used to say that our nation "lived in the past" that our nation "is dead". And we were even proud when some historian mentioned the fact that our nation was not yet dead, but was "dying slowly". Our nation has proved that she is neither dead nor dying, but has more energy and power than some of the existing nations. Since we obtained our freedom of the press in Lithuania, we have created a culture in these few years (since 1904), that took other nations scores of years to produce. The Lithuanians have proved that they understand their cultural need. Where it was necessary, the Lithuanians have stood together to build the highway of culture for our nation.</p>
   <p>The American Lithuanians have always stood in the first rank of our national affairs. Every great problem of our fatherland was supported by American Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>The visit of the delegates from the Lithuanian Science Society of Vilnus is a most important event, to our community. The previous affairs, which we supported, were partisan affairs. But this is a national problem neither partisan nor political. The establishment of a national museum ought to be supported neither by nationalists, socialists, nor clericals individually but by all of us together because the national museum is a national project and not a political nor partisan problem. To achieve the goal is not an individual affair. All the Lithuanian organizations in this country must unite for this important cause. Every Lithuanian community, every organization must unite to support this important project.</p>
   <p>In America, Lithuanians live in many different places and it will be impossible for the delegates to visit all of these colonies. In such communities committees should be organized to make collections in their districts.</p>
   <p>In Lithuania, 15,000 rubles have already been collected. We, in America, are the richest part of Lithuania; why cannot we collect three times as much as has been contributed by our brothers in Lithuania? It would not be difficult for us to do it. If we act willingly, we can accomplish our aim. "The willingness of a man, is his heavenly kingdom."</p>
