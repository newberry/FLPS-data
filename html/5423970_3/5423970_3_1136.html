   <p>On Friday, February 22, the West Side Lithuanians commemorated the birthday anniversary of George Washington, the first President of the United States. Under the auspices of the Chicago Lithuanian Council similar celebrations were sponsored in other Lithuanian colonies on the same day.</p>
   <p>The West Siders also took the opportunity to say farewell to twenty-five young Lithuanians who left for the war soon after the mass meeting. Through the efforts of J. I. Bagdziunas, chairman of the local board, and others, the future soldiers were presented with packages containing all the needs of a soldier.</p>
   <p>A packed house listened to speeches delivered by Attorney John Brenza and J. Bagdziunas. Mr. K. Napp, editor of the Chicago Daily Journal, also spoke briefly. Miss Rakauskas made a good impression with the few songs she sang. We must also mention that two "little men" played violins.</p>

   <p>Though parting with friends is sad, I believe this affair will be remembered for a long time.</p>
