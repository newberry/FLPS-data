   <p>This week has been designated Red Cross Week. Donations will be collected throughout the United States for the Red Cross, which, during these war times, is doing a gigantic task, helping our wounded soldiers, the sick, etc.</p>
   <p>The Red Cross is a most honorable and beneficial organization. Donate to it as much as you can. The dollar you donate to the Red Cross may save the life of your dearest friend, acquaintance or relative, wounded on the field of battle.</p>
   <p>Our soldiers do not dodge bullets. Don't you at home dodge the drive for dollars. Give! Donate!</p>
