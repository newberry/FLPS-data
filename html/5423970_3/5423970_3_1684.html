   <p>Brother Lithuanians! In Chicago there is the so-called St. George's parish, but this parish gave birth to another parish, and if we do not protect ourselves from losing our money, we will be forced to build a third and a fourth Lithuanian church, not for the benefit of our nation or our selves, but for the priests.</p>
   <p>Dear brothers, upon organizing the second parish be sure that your work will not be in vain. Be careful, brothers, that our parishes be not like Polish parishes, where the priests are doing what they please with their parishioners. The Polish priests are chasing and kicking out of the parish the best people, those who donate the most. The second Lithuanian parish should not be recorded in the priest's or the bishop's name, but in the name of the parish.</p>
   <p>Brother Lithuanians! You are donating your hard-earned money for the church so that the priest may do his private business in the home of God. Let us look to the French and German Catholics: their churches are the property of the parish, not of the priest or the bishop. The parish budget is controlled by a parish committee, not by the priest. Their churches are free from debts while ours are sinking into them because they are in the hands of the priests and bishops. They have made the churches a place for their private business. The church should be the home of God, not a business place. So long as the church is in the name of the bishop we won't have a moral and sober priest.</p>
