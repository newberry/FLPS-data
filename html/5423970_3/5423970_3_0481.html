   <p>"The Lithuanian people, being a harmonious group, do not wish to be split up as much as they are now. They would like to be just plain Lithuanians," asserted Mr. John Brenza, the president of the Metropolitan State Bank, speaking at a dinner given by the Lithuanian Parliament members in honor of the Chicago Lithuanian leaders, last Tuesday night, August 3, at the Shoreland Hotel. "The self-appointed leaders," said Brenza," split the people up and cause them to hate each other.</p>
   <p>"These leaders try to do the thinking for all the people and go so far as to attempt to form opinions for the plain folks.</p>

   <p>"The time has come to quit all this and unite the various factions into one strong party, a party that will make every American Lithuanian a member."</p>
   <p>The dinner was attended by fifty prominent Lithuanians. Others who spoke were the editors of Draugas (Simutis), Juanimas (Poshka), Sandara (Vaidyla), Vytis (Lapinskas), and the Lithuanian Consul, Dr. P. Dauzvardis, Judge Zuris and J. B. Borden. Members of the American Lithuanian sports committee were presented with gifts from Lithuania.</p>
