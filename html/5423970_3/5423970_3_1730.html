   <p>Sunday, June 25, was the day to hold the meeting in the parish hall by the Province of God Society, but our Rev. Krawczunas closed the hall. When the society sent its three delegates to find out why the priest closed the hall, the priest answered that we had asked no permission from him to hold the picnic. We told him that we came to him to ask about the picnic, but he closed the door and told us that he would have nothing to do with the society picnic business. Then the priest told us that we were not acting according to the constitution, that we should not provoke member against member, that we should not break the horns of others, etc.</p>
   <p>When we told the priest that we would not make trouble among society members, that our members have no horns to break, that they are created by God in his own image, therefore they have no horns, because God himself has no horns, the priest told us to get out.</p>

   <p>Our society is fulfilling its duty according to its constitution. But the priest never goes according to the parish constitution. Instead of preaching sermons in the pulpit, the priest swears, curses, uses bad language in denouncing publishers who do not dance according to the priest's music.The priest sells steamship tickets, publishes a newspaper Katalikas in order to denounce and blacken the good people. The priest should not control the parish budget. If the priest had no control of the parish money, the priest could not sue the newspapers which are telling the truth about him. Instead of completing the building of the church, the priest gives the money to lawyers, and if this is not enough, the priest even made a loan on the church property through a Milwaukee bank.</p>
   <p>Now the priest is going from house to house collecting money, and says that he needs one hundred thousand dollars to complete the church. It would be much better if the priest tell the truth, that he is collecting from his foolish people the money, not for the building of the church, but for his lawyers, to fight the case against the good people, and to maintain his newspaper Katalikas.</p>

   <p>We appeal to all Lithuanian parishione s and to all Lithuanian societies to hurry with their affidavits, that the bishop demands for ratification of the complaint against the Rev. Krawczunas, in order to get rid of such an improper priest, who brought ruin to our church.</p>
