   <p>We are living in the twentieth century; we have seen the hard life of our ancestors. History shows that our ancestors ate very crude food, which they had been able to find on the surface of the earth. When they made a little progress they began to cultivate the land, to raise better crops and this brought better food. Today the people are having better food and the other necessities of life. This has been an improvement which we owe to the men of science.</p>
   <p>We have many societies, but no society has such an ideal aim as the Aurora society. This society was organized three years ago. During that time it has helped fourteen Lithuanian students, donating to them $2,500 and at present is helping ten students.</p>
   <p>American Lithuanians! Do not forget that without men of science we would <span class="page-break">2</span>be spiritual beggars. For this reason we must help the Lithuanian students who are eager to obtain an education.</p>
   <p>Therefore, join the Aurora society. Help to increase its fund in order to help more Lithuanian students.</p>
