   <p>[Translator's note: No mention is made of this convention in the following issues of the Lietuva. The Knights of Lithuania is a Lithuanian-American Catholic youth organization. It became very popular in Chicago, where about ten chapters or councils were organized. The 1916 Year Book of the Lithuanian Catholic Press Society contains the following information about the convention mentioned above:</p>

This organization of young Lithuanian-American men and women, known <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>as the "Knights of Lithuania," under the patronage of St. Casimir, will strive to guide its members to lead a moral Christian life and to guard them from those dangers which lead to the loss of religion and morality. The organization will strive to promote the intellectual development and material welfare of its members by proper means, such as the establishment of libraries, and will encourage its members to be industrious, thrifty, to abstain from alcoholic liquors, etc.</p>
