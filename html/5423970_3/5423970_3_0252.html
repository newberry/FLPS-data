   <p>According to announcements in the American press, President Wilson has proclaimed November 1 as Lithuanian Day, on which day public collections will be made all over the United States for the relief of Lithuanian war victims in Europe. The newspaper Zvaigzde (The Star) reports that the American Relief Fund for Lithuanian War Sufferers [also known as the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund] received an official notification to that effect from Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Lithuanian-Americans should now increase the tempo of their activities in this field and make all necessary, preparations to collect as much money as possible on that day. If we are well prepared and organized for this occasion, it can be expected that a large sum of money for the relief of our war-stricken brothers and sisters will be collected.</p>
