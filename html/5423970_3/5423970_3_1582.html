   <p>On March 13 the Appellate Court of Cook County decided the case which was appealed by the parishioners of the Providence of God parish. When the parishioners made a riot in the church on February 11, 1906, they were slugged and beaten by the priest's hired police force. In compliance with the desires of the priest and the bishop, the police court declared the parishioners to be the guilty party and they were fined and sentenced to prison. Those who were sentenced to small fines paid then, but those who were fined heavily appealed their cases. The Appellate Court, after close scrutiny, dismissed the case in favor of the parishioners.</p>
