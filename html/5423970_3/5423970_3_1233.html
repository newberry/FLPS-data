   <p>In certain sections of the United States there is a great demand for a national congress of Lithuanian-Americans. However, in some sections there is strong opposition, even organized opposition, against calling such a congress. Nevertheless, it appears that this opposition will not succeed in the face of the steadily increasing nation-wide demand for a congress. More and more problems and questions that can be solved and answered only at a national Lithuanian-American congress are coming to the fore. The resolutions which were recently adopted by Lithuanians in Philadelphia, testify to this. The text of these resolutions is published in this issue of Lietuva.</p>
   <p>The demand for calling a congress leads to the following conclusion: The Lithuanian-American public desires such a congress, and wants to see some kind of an understanding or agreement between the various Lithuanian-American factions and political groups. It may be stated that opposition to the proposal is found only in certain Lithuanian-American newspapers.</p>
   <p>Only the future will tell which side will be victorious. However, there can be no doubt that at the present time the Lithuanian-American public is endowed with a great moral force.</p>
