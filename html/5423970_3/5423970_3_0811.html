   <p>At the meeting of the Lithuanian societies on November 28, it was reported that the charter for our association had been received from Springfield, Illinois--that this charter permits us to organize the Lithuanian societies not only in Chicago, but the right to organize Lithuanian societies, or to take the existing societies into our association, in every town and city of the State of Illinois. Therefore, we have a legal right to spread enlightenment, culture and morale among our brother Lithuanians, not only for the benefit of our homeland, but for the good of this country as well.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, three new societies joined our association, and several other societies gave their pledge to join our organization....</p>
   <p>At the next meeting, December 19, of all the societies that belong to the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association, the board of directors will be elected.</p>
   <p>It is very important that every delegate of those societies should attend this meeting.</p>
   <p>J. J. Hertmanowicz, Secretary.</p>
