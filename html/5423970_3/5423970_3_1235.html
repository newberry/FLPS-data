   <p>The Lithuanian Students' Association of America held its annual convention on September 14-15 in the Ausra Hall, 29th and Halsted Streets, Chicago, Illinois. Although there were not many delegates at the convention, nevertheless many important decisions were made for the benefit of the organization.</p>
   <p>A motion was made and discussed at the convention to affiliate with the Lithuanian-American Workers' Council, which was recently formed in Chicago by P. Grigaitis, editor of Naujienos (News). It was decided not to affiliate, because the Council is a temporary political organization with unclear aims.</p>
   <p>The issuing of a monthly organ, entitled Banga (Wave), was discussed. However it was decided not to issue an organ on account of the lack of funds.</p>
   
   <p>The convention concluded with a big concert, which was given by the Association last Sunday evening, September 16, at Meldazis Hall, 23rd Place and Oakley Avenue. The musical concert netted a profit of $150, which will be turned over to the Association.</p>
   <p>Some of the most talented Chicago Lithuanian musical artists took part in the concert. Among the participants were: F. Jakutis, soloist; Miss Marion Rakauskas, popular singer; Karl Sarpalius; Paul Stogis; Miss A. Radauskas; Miss M. Norkus; and Mr. M. Juozavitas, young pianist.</p>
   <p>Most of the musical artists who took part in the program were members of the famous Biruta Chorus of the Biruta Singing and Dramatic Society.</p>
