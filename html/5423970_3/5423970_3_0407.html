   <p>Last week, Tamosius Druktenis died suddenly of a heart attack, at the age of thirty. He had a good job, and made good money. He was a member of five Lithuanian mutual benefit societies. He had contributed a lot of money to various Lithuanian national causes. He supported many Lithuanian students, and had loaned a considerable sum of money to some of them to help them to complete their educations. He had loaned a lot of money to K. Gugis, a student. But when Druktenis died, Gugis did not even attend the funeral of his former benefactor, who had loaned him money to complete his education. Gugis' conduct deeply offended those who attended the funeral.</p>
