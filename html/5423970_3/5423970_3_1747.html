   <p>Reverend Rector:</p>
   <p>In order to maintain our good neighborly spirit we will remove that sidewalk which prevents you from building a fence around your lot. I have been very disappointed with the city and the permit which was issued to me to build my sidewalk. After the sidewalk was built the permit was revoked by the city. Of course, I could have sued the city for the expenses, which it cost me to put in the sidewalk. If I did not care to make extra expenses, for myself, I could have got an injunction against the city. But I feel that this case would continue too long and would cause me more expense than it is worth. I decided to drop this injunction against the City of Chicago.</p>
   <p>This permit caused me more trouble than anything else, especially disagreement between you, me and the parish. All this happened because the city issued the permit to me and the next minute they changed their mind about this permit.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Moreover, they sent the police who prevented the building of your fence around the lot. Today is your choice. You have the right to do as you please. However, if the parish will continue to antagonize me, I won't be able to tolerate any longer; then I will be compelled to sell my property even at a loss to Polish Independent Parish, in order to free myself from persecution.</p>
   <p>However, if you wish to leave at least a part of the sidewalk under my doors, I would be very greatful to you and parish; and at the same time I would be willing to apologize for my words that hurt you so much in the eyes of the parish.</p>
   <p>It is a well known fact that no man can maintain his silence when he is being chided continuously without any reason. I do sincerely believe that if a man has a permit from the city of Chicago to build something, others have no right to disturb him. However, if a man is disturbed by those people who have business, he cannot keep silent without chiding those who stick their noses in other people's business.</p>
   <p>If you agree with my proposition which I have submitted to you, I am willing to apologize and also to stop those articles in Lietuva which are against you and <span class="page-break">3</span>the parish. In addition, I promise that my paper Lietuva hereafter will maintain your side. For two weeks you announced in the church and referred to me indirectly that I did not come out openly in my paper Lietuva, and that I was not sincere enough and that my proposition is a doubtful one.</p>
   <p>If you feel that my proposition appears doubtful, I have another proposition to offer you if you think that my first proposition is doubtful. I heard just recently that you are planning to build a home for Sisters. It appears to me that it would pay much better to buy my building, which is large enough for both school and home for Sisters. In addition, you will be able to buy a backside lot, put a fence around the lot for a reasonable price. It may cost you a little more, but it is better than to buy an old building, including moving of it. Besides, an old building will depreciate much sooner than the new building which I am offering you. It is obvious that you will not gain anything by buying an old building. We are selling our building now for $9,000, that is, if you want to buy it at our set price. Our terms are very agreeable; we want only five thousand dollars in cash and the rest, four thousand dollars, will give you on long term payments. It believe that this offer will be agreeable to both of us. In addition, we would leave this neighborhood for the good of the community and its people. We want to have peace, and happiness in this world <span class="page-break">4</span>and nothing else. Poles are offering us $8,000 for our building, but we dont want to sell for that price because the building alone cost us $8,000 and the lot $800. To suffer a big loss just on account of the sidewalk does not pay. Of course, if the parish will begin to antagonize us again, so that we cannot tolerate it any longer, we will have to sell for the price which was offered us. It does not pay for a man to lose his health, just on account of wealth. If my proposition appears beneficial to you, I want you to inform me by letter of messenger and I will be ready to apologize for my harsh words, which appeared in the newspaper Lietuva some months ago.</p>
   <p>With my respects,</p>
   <p>A. Olszewskis.</p>
