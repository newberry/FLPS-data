   <p>At a meeting of Branch No. 22 of the Lithuanian Socialist League, held on Saturday, April 1, a collection was made for the benefit of Bruno Vargsas [Bruno Laucevicius], famous Lithuanian playwright, and his family. Mr. Vargsas is now dangerously ill and he and his family are in dire need. The Branch donated five dollars, and a collection among the members netted $9.46. [Names of contributors omitted in translation.] [Translator's note: Mr. B. Vargsas died on March 31, 1916. A large photograph, taken at the cemetery just before the casket was lowered into the grave, appears in this issue of the Naujienos.]</p>
