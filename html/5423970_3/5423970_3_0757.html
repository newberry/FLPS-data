   <p>"The Lithuanian societies of Chicago have for a long time understood that unity is necessary to accomplish anything on important nationalist problems. Single societies, even though they might have huge memberships or might even be very rich cannot alone solve any great nationalist problem which deals with the Lithuanian public in general. For this reason, there was organized last year the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association.</p>
   <p>"The enthusiasm with which we began this work led us to believe, that we would accomplish a gigantic task, but right after the first convention, which was held November 3, 1912, the enthusiasm cooled off, and all of the beautiful projects were forgotten. No one has tried to bring these projects back to life. The societies have stopped paying their dues, the central board has held no monthly meetings, and the organization has died. All the machinery of this organization was created and set in order but there was no "steam" to give it life. None of the proposed projects have been achieved for there is no one to see that they should be. In such circumstances, the whole year <span class="page-break">2</span>has gone by without any accomplishment and the time has come to call the second convention.</p>
   <p>"It is a duty of the central board to make arrangements for the second convention. I cannot make preparations for this convention, because circumstances have forced me to leave America to go to Lithuania. Because of the importance of maintaining such a local organization as the central unit of the Lithuanians of Chicago, I mailed on September 15, postal cards to all the representatives of this society, begging them to come to the meeting. It happened to have rained on that evening and very few representatives came to the meeting; and for this reason we were unable to do anything, not even to elect a general secretary to take my place.</p>
   <p>"At this meeting, I gave my resignation notice in writing to Mr. K. Gugis, the chairman of the first convention. Later, I mailed this notice to Mr. J. J. Elias, president of the Association, begging him to call a meeting and to continue with the work of the Association. Up to the present, as far as I know, <span class="page-break">3</span>very little has been accomplished. Sorry, but this coming Saturday, October 11, 1913, I am leaving Chicago. I cannot continue anymore with the work begun by this organization. All the documents and papers will be left with Mr. Pranas Butkus, the vice-president.</p>
   <p>"This is a sad picture of backwardness and inactivity in our nationalist affairs! Nevertheless, I believe that at the next meeting all the Lithuanian societies will take action for the benefit of this association, and will not permit this good organization to disappear. They will elect, I hope, a new central board, which will take care of our important nationalist problems by solving one after the other until the good results of this task will be admitted. Then you will understand that such a central organization among us Lithuanians is essential.</p>
   <p>"The Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association must live!</p>
