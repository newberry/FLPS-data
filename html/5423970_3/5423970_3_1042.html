   <p>HISTORICAL SUMMARY.</p>
   <p>The history of the Lithuanian Alliance of America is very interesting and is closely related to all the American Lithuanian national and cultural activity, historically, and its action reflects on all the Lithuanians of America.</p>
   <p>The American Lithuanian public organization - alliance idea was originated by Dr. John Sliupas. He was the leader of the "Aurora" organization. The first project to establish the Lithuanian Alliance of America was brought forth in New York City at the Lithuanian Voice Society, April 17, 1886. The original leaders of the Lithuanian Alliance project were Dr. John Sliupas, P. Pasecka, P. Ramanauskas, Bucinskas, V. Dziankauskas and A. Juskauskas.</p>
   <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>
   <p>In the same year, August 15, 1886, the first convention was held;at this convention there were delegates of eleven Lithuanian societies. Among the delegates was one who is still active in the Lithuanian Alliance of America organization, John Skritulskas. This convention established "The Alliance of all Lithuanians of America". Although this alliance, under the leadership of the above stated persons, existed up to August, 1888, the third convention was not held.</p>
   <p>The cause of the Lithuanian Alliance dispersion is that at that time the Lithuanians in America were very ignorant people. The clergy were the leaders of the ignorant Lithuanian minds and they told the Lithuanians that this alliance was under the control of the infidels. This was the cause that inspired the Catholic leaders to organize another Lithuanian Alliance. This has developed with the present Lithuanian Alliance of America.</p>
   <p>The original idea of the leaders of "Aurora" society as the basic foundation of the Lithuanian Alliance, at once was taken by the group of Catholic leaders to establish the Catholic alliance. Of this second Alliance the promoters were: Joseph Paukstis, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>publisher of the Vienybe Lietuvninky - (The Unity) , a Lithuanian newspaper, editor Domininkas Backauskas of the same paper, and Rev. Varnagiris, the rector of the Lithuanian and Polish parish in Plymouth, Pa. Later this priest quit the priesthood and took up the medical profession. With the consent of two Lithuanian societies, they called the convention on November 22, 1886 in Plymouth, Pa., and established "The Alliance of all the Lithuanian Catholic Societies of America".</p>
   <p>Like the first alliance, the second alliance was established for the noble purpose of upholding Lithuanianism, bringing up the morale of its members, and uplifting the Lithuanians spiritually and materially. But the second alliance placed the religious affairs as the foundation of the alliance. At the beginning, both of the alliances had as their principle basis to bring other societies into the alliance, but not to organize branches of individual persons. Of the second alliance, the fundamental purpose was stated as follows: "every Lithuanian belonging to the alliance must uphold nationalism, give succor to his brother in distress, and live a Godly life by showing a good example of himself. The newly arrived brother from Lithuania must be given help.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>The Alliance of all the Lithuanian Catholic Societies of America membership dues is ten cents a year with the arrangement that every member of the Alliance can transfer himself to other societies which belong to the alliance, without any obstruction.</p>
   <p>Even this alliance had poor success. At that time, non-members of the alliance could have been leaders. In this organization the fights and disputes were among the priests themselves and their followers. The earnest group was lead by Rev. A. Burba. J. Paukstis and other more patriotic priests and secular leaders. Those who had the organization under their control and the uncultured conductors were the Rev. Juodisius, D. Backauskas, Rev. Masiotas and the Polanizer, T. Butkevicius. The orgaization's name, "The Alliance of all the Lithuanian Catholic Societies of America" existed up to the 4th convention, which was held on November 4, 1889. At this time the charter was incorporated in the Circuit court of Luzerne County, Wilkes Barre, Pa., under the name - Lithuanian Alliance of America. Under this name, in the incorporated documents the alliance existed up to the convention in the year 1926.</p>
   <p>The fifth convention of the Lithuanian Alliance of America was held in the year <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>1890, at Mahanoy City, Pa. During the struggle at the convention, the legal delegates saw that nothing good would come out of this convention, so they left the hall, and while traveling on the train elected the central administration of the alliance - the Rev. Burba was chosen as president. Those delegates who remained at the convention and some who were not elected as delegates, elected another central administration - the Rev. Juodisius was elected president of the alliance. Then a hard struggle started between the two central administrations. For the administration of Rev. Burba the newspaper - Vienybe Lietuvninky was the organ, and for the Rev. Juodisius' group, the newspaper Saule (The Sun). At last the struggle was won by the group of Rev. Burba because a majority of the societies that belonged to the alliance supported this priest.</p>
   <p>At the sixth convention, Dr. John Sliupas, Vincas Dauksys, and T. Astramskas participated as the leaders of the liberal group, and others were under the leadership of the priests. Vincas Dauksys was elected secretary. This organization at this time is still very weak; it has only 244 active members, and $158.71 in its treasury. After this convention the struggle between the clergy and the liberal <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>group began. The Alliance president, Rev. Burba started to attack the "infidels". During the same year from the Alliance he expelled Dr. J. Sliupas, J. Andziulaitis and V. Karalius as the promulgators of "infidelity".</p>
   <p>In spite of the clergy's effort not to permit "infidelity" to break into the alliance, in spite of the order to the members to be obedient to the clergy, the Lithuanian Alliance of America members began more and more to think by themselves and openly began to criticise the politics of the clergy.</p>
   <p>As the consciousness of the members of the Alliance increased, the progressive movement in the organization took the leadership. At the eighth convention it was decided to take women into the organization on an equal basis with men. At that time, branches of this organization had been organized in several Lithuanian colonies, and several mutual benefit societies joined the Lithuanian Alliance of America.</p>
   <p>At the ninth convention it was decided to increase the death benefit up to $150.00 and to increase it gradually with the increase in membership. With the beginning <a name="p7" class="page-break">7</a>of the year 1896, the monthly organ Tevyne - (The Fatherland) was published.</p>
   <p>At the 14th convention it was decided to have a second section of the death benefit for the sum of $600.00 with a yearly payment of $10.00 and the initiation fees according to age. But at the following convention the increased death benefit was abolished. Only the former section of $150.00 death benefit was left and this one section remained up to 1911. At the 15th convention it was decided to publish the organ Tevyne every week. The Alliance now began to participate in national and cultural activity; it published books on various subjects, mostly text-books. Now the alliance became an important factor in the life of the American Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>At the 15th convention the clergy perceived that in the alliance among the members, the individual liberal reasoning power was becoming more aggressive, that the more active members bravely and openly in the presence of the clergy, criticised the politics and the immorality of the priests. Therefore, the clergy, disregarding everybody, made a firm demand, that the members toward infidelity must be <a name="p8" class="page-break">8</a>expelled from the Alliance. Even though the convention decided to abolish the censor of the clergy, the Alliance president Rev. Kaupas disregarded the convention's decision and took the alliance organ under his absolute control. This brought struggle and disorder, to the alliance. Then the president, Rev. Kaupas took a more aggressive step, and in the first part of January, 1901, he sent a notice to the Lithuanian Alliance of America central administration and demanded, that from the Lithuanian Alliance branch 11, Waterbury, Conn., two members; John Tareila and Mike J. Damijonaitis, must be expelled stating that these two members are going against the constitution of the Alliance because they "are openly going against the christian faith". Without any explanation by the accused members they were expelled from the Lithuanian Alliance of America.</p>
   <p>This step of the Rev. Kaupas was the beginning of the great storm. As a consequence of this, at the following convention, the clergy took the most despotic means in order to overpower the "infidels" and this brought the split in the Lithuanian Alliance. Before the coming of the 16th convention, both sides, the <a name="p9" class="page-break">9</a>clerical party and the liberals, were organizing and preparing for the inevitable struggle. At last, at the T. Kuncas Hall, Wilkes Barre, Pa., was held the historic Lithuanian Alliance of America 16th convention. The Alliance president, Rev. Kaupas himself took under his control the mandates of the delegates All the delegates undesirable to the clergy, were expelled from the convention. The priest even went so far that he rejected the central secretary, Thomas Astrauskas, as the 10th branch delegate. At the same time he was expelled from the central secretary's duties. In this manner the Rev. Kaupas expelled 29 legal delegates from the convention. This conduct of the priest almost brought a riot at the convention. Against such an unlawful step even two priests, Zilinskas and Zebrys protested, although the clergy and their followers disregarded their protest.</p>
   <p>At this convention all the clerical followers were marked with a flower on their lapel. When the expelled delegates left the convention hall, 14 delegates marked with the flower threw them away, and went out with the expelled delegates. Amongst them were two priests: Zilinskas and Zebrys. Even these two priests did not participate in open activity with the expelled delegates, and when the Rev. Zebrys remained a <a name="p10" class="page-break">10</a>member of the Lithuanian Alliance of America at that time, it helped very much the leaders of the Alliance to fight against clerical propaganda stating that the Lithuanian Alliance of America was an "infidel" organization.</p>
   <p>The expelled delegates at once hired the Slumpsas Hall and went on with the real 16th convention of the Lithuanian Alliance of America; the conventions provisional administration was elected - secretary, P. Mikolainis and V. Ambrozevicius, and for the convention's president, K. Draugelis. As soon as the convention was started, at the complaint of the priests, the convention's two secretaries were arrested, and later the former secretary of the Alliance, T. A stramskas was likewise arrested. By doing this, the clerical faction was thinking to get the Alliance books, which by the shrewdness of T. Astramskas, were taken from the convention.</p>
   <p>This real convention lasted three days. They examined the Alliance constitution, made many decisions, brought in resolutions as to why the Lithuanian Alliance split, and when the central administration was elected the delegates departed. They did not know how the Lithuanian public would accept their accomplished purpose. To <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>the central administration was elected as president, M. Tatorius,; vice-president, V. Kaunas; secretary, T. Astramskas; treasurer, Thomas Paukstis.</p>
   <p>At once after the convention, the trial started in court between the factions of the Alliance, and after a few years of litigation in the court, they made an agreement among the factions, to leave the name of the Lithuanian Alliance of America as it was, with the original charter which had been previously incorporated. To the clerical faction was left the alliance treasury- $6,000.00, and for the progressive faction, the real Lithuanian Alliance of America, was returned a few books and the Alliance flag. The clergy made an agreement to organize a new Lithuanian Alliance of America and to incorporate under the name - the Alliance of the Lithuanian Roman Catholics of America. This brought to an end the litigation between the two factions which split at the 16th convention. With the 16th convention, the tendency of the Lithuanian Alliance of America was to become a progressive national organization. Those of various religious faith, and political views can freely join this alliance. The rapid growth of membership and the assets proved that the tendency of such an organization was supported by the American Lithuanians. It must be borne in mind <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>that after the 16th convention, in the alliance there was not one cent left in the treasury, and after the meeting of the convention the delegates contributed $15.40 as expenses for the trial with the clergy. Also, from about 1400 members only 616 remained with the alliance. At the 17th convention, which was held on May 22, 1922 in Boston, Mass., there were shown unbelievable results in the growth of the alliance in membership and assets. At the convention there were present 65 delegates, representing 58 branches of the alliance and other societies. Statistics proved that the membership in the Alliance was larger than before the split - at present there were 1,721 members and in the treasury $2,237.00.</p>
   <p>After this new reorganization, for five years the Lithuanian Alliance of America existed and acted in peace. At the 22nd convention of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, 1907, in Cleveland, Ohio, the trouble began again between the nationalists and the socialists for leadership in the Alliance. This struggle for leadership lasted until the great disaster of the Alliance in 1911. Even before this,the Alliance met with several major unfortunate events.</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>At first, we must state that the 22nd convention of the Alliance decided, that the members of the Alliance by general and secret ballot shall elect the officials of the Alliance, and that the members by their ballot can decide the major problems of the Alliance. The second important decision of this convention was that for the following year, to renew the publication of its organ Tevyne. Therefore, on the 28th day of January, 1908, they started to publish the Lithuanian Alliance of America organ, Tevyne. The yearly subscription for members was $.50; for non-memgers - $1.25. The organ Tevyne during all that time served not only the members of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, but also the national and cultural affairs of the Lithuanians of America.</p>
   <p>After the 23rd convention in the year 1908, it revealed, that the Lithuanian Alliance of America charter, without delay must be amended. In order to accomplish it, there had to be called a special convention. Up to this time the Lithuanian Alliance of America charter was incorporated as for any local benefit society, but not for general organization. Without amending the charter it was impossible for the Alliance to register and legalize its branches in other states. For that reason, on October <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>21, 1908, in Wilkes Barre, Pa., a special convention of the Lithuanian Alliance of America was held and the amendment to the charter was adopted. At that same time the president of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, F.J. Bagocius resigned. His place was taken by vice-president, J. Tareila. This brought a vacancy in the vice-presidency. To fill the vice-president's vacancy, P.W. Birstonas was elected.</p>
   <p>Before and after the special convention disputes had been going on between factions in the Alliance over the question of the general ballot and leadership. At last, at the 24th convention in June, 1909, Worcester, Mass., the general voting system was abolished. At this convention it became clear that the by-laws of the Alliance must be changed and revised in order to make them adaptable to every state's insurance statutes. By not adapting the by-laws of the Alliance according to the various state's insurance laws, the state can forbid the organization of branches of the alliance and the collection of dues from the members.</p>
   <p>Finally, at the 25th convention, 1910, in Chicago, Illinois, there were adapted the new constitution and by-laws. The due payments according to the age, and three <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>sections of death benefit policy: $300, $600 and $1,000. The members did not like the new system of dues payments according to age, because up to this time every member used to pay equally - $2.00 a year for $150.00 death benefit. According to the revised constitution, the smallest membership yearly dues is $3.36 a year. At the time, before revising the constitution, the Alliance had 11,000 members, and at the end of 1912, there were left only 4,949 members.</p>
   <p>To this reform of the Alliance, two more causes brought misfortune: (1) the members were against the so-called reform, and (2) the blind stubborness of the officials, who disregarded the protest of the members in order to crush the majority in their attitude against the reform. In order to explain to the members that such a revision of the by-laws was the most essential affair to make the future of the Alliance strong, the officials disregarded the voice of the members. They suspended the individual members and even branches of the Alliance. Notwithstanding all the losses, the alliance was for adapting the new reforms, the organization was placed on the strong foundation of fraternal insurance and the future was made firm.</p>
   <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>
   <p>Further reforms for the benefit of the members were adopted at the 27th convention in the year of 1912, at Brooklyn, N.Y. At this convention was adapted a new reform of the constitution and three new sections for sick benefits. A widows and orphans fund was established to help the members and their families. It was decided to hold the convention every two years instead of every year as it had been up to that time.</p>
   <p>Lastly, it ought to be mentioned that the Lithuanian Alliance established the Lithuanian youth section, which could be joined by children at least two years of age. They stayed in that section till they could join the adult section. The children's section had two degrees of death benefit: $100.00 and $150.00.</p>
   <p>The Alliance, during its existance, passed several more crises. First, the various state insurance departments forced the Alliance to make equal due payments according to age even to those members, who joined the Lithuanian Alliance organization previous to 1911. These members up to the new reform had been paying the lowest dues. This again brought disputes among the members. The second crisis came in 1918 and 1919, when the same state insurance departments demanded that <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>the members be assessed special dues in order to fill the Alliance treasury, which was weakened by the influenza epidemic on account of a large number of deaths.</p>
   <p>With the beginning of 1920 again a struggle started for the leadership in the Alliance between communists and other factions. This struggle was a hard one, because the communistic groups in the Lithuanian Alliance were firmly organized and were under the leadership of the communist party. This stormy struggle lasted up to the 36th convention of the Lithuanian Alliance, which was held in June, 1930, in Chicago, Illinois. At this convention the communists demanded the right to appoint their delegate to the mandate committee. Their demand was rejected, so the communist delegates during the first three sessions did not permit the convention to hold organized sessions. The riotous communistic delegates were thrown out of the hall by the police. Then the mandate committee reported, that there were 307 delegates legally elected by their local branches, and the markers were pinned to the lapel of every delegate, making them lawful delegates of the convention. The committee acknowledged all lawfully elected delegates - 180 of the delegates did not reply and did not come to get the delegate's pins.</p>
   <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>
   <p>The 180 delegates, who left the convention, held a separate convention and dedided that through the court they must seek recognition of their rights and in that manner to get control of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. The court rejected the communist demand, and recognized the 36th convention's majority delegates as lawful controllers of the Alliance. The communists' group attack on the Alliance was hard on the organization. 3,000 members left the Lithuanian Alliance of America organization.</p>
   <p>How materially and spiritually strong the Lithuanian Alliance is, is proved by the state insurance departments of the new established sections of the Lithuanian Alliance. Seven new and modern insurance sections were adopted by the 36th convention of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. At the 38th convention of the Lithuanian Alliance of America held in June, 1934, in Detroit, Michigan, there was given to the Alliance members, the possibility to insure themselves up to $5,000.00 with much smaller dues than in any commercial insurance company for the same policy. At this convention they also changed and adapted new reforms of the Lithuanian Alliance of America charter and by-laws, reestablished the general election so that the <a name="p19" class="page-break">19</a>members by general and secret ballot can elect the executive board. The establishment of the new and important reforms by the Lithuanian Alliance of America organization, the approval by the state insurance departments not only proves that the Alliance is materially strong, but at the same time places our organization side by side with the most modern insurance institutions of America.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Alliance, besides material aid to its members, during its 50 years existance, did not put in last place the Lithuanian national and cultural activity. With all its effort it supported the important events and affairs of the fatherland Lithuania. With its tens of thousand of dollars it supported various relief and cultural institutions in Lithuania. It donated large sums of money for the establishment of Lithuania's independence. Tens of thousands of dollars have been spent for the enlightenment of its own members and the Lithuanian public of America. To the student members of this Alliance was given financial aid to complete their education in various science.</p>
   <p>Upon looking into the material help that was given to the members of the Alliance we <a name="p20" class="page-break">20</a>see an enormous task accomplished. As much as we can find in the records of the Alliance up to the year of 1935, the Lithuanian Alliance has paid its members death benefits to the sum of $1,316,321; sick benefits of $1,434,715 and to the widows and orphans it has donated $50,000.00. In addition to these sums of money paid for relief for cultural affairs there have been spent another $150,000.00.</p>
