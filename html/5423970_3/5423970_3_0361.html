   <p>p. 8.... On New Year's day a number of guests assembled at the home of K.Jankaitis. During the course of the celebration a suggestion was made and adopted to aid our brothers who are starving and dying in the war fields in Lithuania. A collection netted $9.50, which was later sent to the Lithuanian Relief Fund.</p>
