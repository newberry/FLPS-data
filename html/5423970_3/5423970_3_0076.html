   <p>The Day Nursery Society, recently organized for the purpose of establishing a day nursery in the Bridgeport district of Chicago, held a benefit social for the nursery last week at the home of Mrs. Zimontas, president of the Society. The guests enjoyed refreshments, games, and engaged in conversations. They donated $37.50 to the nursery fund.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Society are striving to raise enough money as soon as possible for the establishment of the nursery.</p>
   <p>The Society, which is affiliated with Fellowship House in the Bridgeport district, is making plans to conduct a tag day on May 30 (Decoration Day) for the benefit of the nursery. An effort is now being made to obtain a permit from the city administration for the tag day.</p>
