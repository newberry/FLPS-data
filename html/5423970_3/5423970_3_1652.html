   <p>In No. 13 of Katalikas Mr. Ugzmedis states that we are organizing various parties because it is not right to assign the churches to the bishops without telling why it is not right. We have stated our reasons many times why we are against the assignment of the churches to the bishops.</p>
   <p>The churches are built by the Lithuanians and that means that the property should belong to them. The bishops should have nothing to do with the peoples' private property. The bishop should take care of the people's spiritual affairs only, not the material matter. There are many more reasons why it is not good to assign the parish properties to the bishops, but for the present time we will say nothing else on the matter.</p>
