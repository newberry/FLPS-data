   <p>At present there is among the Lithuanian public marked dissatisfaction of our church order and of the despotism of the clergy ruling in the parishes and over the treasury. The people see that the churches, built with their money, are sinking into debts; that the people have no right nor voice to regulate their own churches; that the priest is ruling with his despotic fist. The people started to demand of their priest to rule liberally, in order to protect themselves from the despotism of their priests and save the churches from ruin. The priests, however, instead of working with the people, are denouncing the people, excommunicating them from church and denouncing the newspapers for upholding the rights of the people. If the people should have no place in the newspapers to appeal for justice, what then remains for the people to do?</p>
   <p>The people were oppressed by the tsar and his dissolute servants; they knew that the people had no right nor place to appeal to the public, so they exploited and kept in oppression the down-trodden people. In like manner, the clergy are treating their parishioners in America. The clergy <span class="page-break">\2</span>are denouncing the newspapers for letting the people express their views against the drunkard and dissolute priests.</p>
   <p>During the past time the priests began to teach Lietuva morality. Our answer to the clergy about the moral teaching is, as the saying goes, That the prostitute is teaching morality.</p>
   <p>The accusation against the priest would disappear if they would stop the cause of it. Who can honor the exactor priest who uses the parish money for his own benefit, that the people donated their money for the church to please God? Who can honor such a priest who seduces the married women? If the priests deny this, denounce us, let them demand proof, we have the facts to prove it. We are receiving all sorts of complaints against the priests from the people.</p>
   <p>Here is what the people are writing to us from one town: "The Lithuanian here demanded a Lithuanian priest to perform the Easter confession. The Irish Catholic priest gave his church for a reasonable rent, and the Irish priest got a Lithuanian priest. The Lithuanian priest came, performed the <span class="page-break">\3</span>confession, collected a lot of money, and left the Irish priest without saying good-by or paying the agreed rent for the use of the church."</p>
   <p>Where can you find such a hoggishness among priests of other nationalities, that they would do what the Lithuanian priest has done? Then these poor, ignorant, honest Lithuanians, who gave the money in their belief that the priest will pay the rent to the good-hearted Irish priest, announced in the newspapers, wants to know where the priest has his parish, demands to return the money or pay the rent for the church. Can you find such priests among other nationalities? Only among the Lithuanians and the Poles, but not among others.</p>
   <p>When a newspaper prints such news, the priests sue the newspaper for telling the truth. The Rev. Krawczunas sued Lietuva just because Lietuva printed what the people demanded, and our moral duty was to fulfill the wishes of the people, to tell the truth to the public.</p>
   <p>Many of the clergy were glad that the Rev. Krawczunas sued us, the clergy <span class="page-break">\4</span>believed that they will suppress free speech. And yet, hypocricy lost and morality won the case. Therefore, all the clergy are guilty of trying to suppress the moral truth, the exploitation of their parishioners.</p>
   <p>If the clergy want the public to support them, let the priests clean the dirty and dangerous foam among them. As long as the clergy will use the pulpit for exploitation of the ignorant people, we will expose all their black deeds.</p>
   <p>Here, the Rev. Krawczunas deposited in the bank $60,000, while the church is sunk into debt. Where did the priest get the money if not by fraud? The people are ignorant, unfed, poorly clothed, and yet our priest opens the fair, sells drinks, makes the people drunk, exploits them, takes away from them the last penny, and this is done in the name of God.</p>
   <p>Let the priests educate the people in morals of religion, and let the priests uphold morality among themselves, then we will support them.</p>
