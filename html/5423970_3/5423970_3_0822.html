   <p>The Lithuanian White Rose Club was organized three years ago. Its purpose is to train its members in wrestling, boxing and lifting of heavy weights. [Its aim is] to draw the Lithuanian youth away from saloons, to teach them sports, instead of their wasting their time gambling and drinking.</p>
   <p>As a result, many of the young Lithuanians who joined this club, quit smoking and drinking. They found out that they had to lead a clean life, that drinking and smoking did not make a good wrestler or boxer.</p>
   <p>During the recent days, many young Lithuanians joined this club not only to train themselves in sport activity but also to raise [the level] of national sport.</p>

   <p>Another club, similar to the White Rose Club, was organized in the vicinity of 18th and Halsted Streets. We hope that many more such clubs will be organized in Chicago. When we have many of them we will be able to organize our own Lithuanian battalion. Such battalions already have been organized by the Poles, Czechs and other nationalities who have lost their independence.</p>
