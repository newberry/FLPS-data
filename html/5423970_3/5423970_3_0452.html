   <p>In two weeks there will be a trial of a good Lithuanian, Mr. Blauzda. Blauzda got into trouble through the hoodlums of this city.</p>
   <p>It is known countrymen, that the law of this land is such, that a poor man without protection, even if not guilty, will rot in jail.</p>
   <p>For this reason we are calling a mass meeting at the Hall, 634 South Canal St., at 7 P.M. We will make a protest against this trial, we will make and sign an affidavit by our good citizens, to prove that Blauzda was morally good, this will be a good weapon to his lawyer, who can help us. We have among us no rich lawyers, nor rich judges, who would protect and help us.</p>
   <p>Let us have a big mass meeting, let us show to the world that we are people of one nation, that we understand the statutes - trials of this land.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Brothers, listen to the appeal of this innocent man, come and extend your hand to our sinking brother.</p>
   <p>The editor of "Lietuva" cordially invites all brother Lithuanians to help us, by giving us your brotherly love, which in the near future will prevail among us.</p>
