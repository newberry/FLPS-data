   <p>On Friday, February 18, the Alliance of West Side Societies held a mass meeting at the M. Meldazis Hall. The purpose of the meeting was to collect donations for Lithuanians who are suffering because of the war.</p>
   <p>The societies formed an Alliance so that they could collect as much in donations as possible for the war sufferers.</p>
   <p>The Alliance began its activities with a mass meeting in order that all the West Siders could become acquainted with the purpose of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>The invited speakers were K. Jurgelionis, S. Tananevicia and A. Zimontas.</p>
   <p>All the speakers spoke of the hardships of the war sufferers, describing how they slowly and tortuously starve to death. It was also explained what the Alliance of West Side Societies had already accomplished in soliciting donations.</p>

   <p>The Alliance has a plan which is something like this: the Alliance will prepare a certain kind of blank, and authorized agents of the Alliance will call on Lithuanians in their homes, asking them to hang these blanks on their walls as reminders of a promise to donate a nickel or a dime from each pay they receive; Then, at the end of each month, the authorized agents will call again, this time to collect the sum which had been put aside for this purpose.</p>
   <p>The Alliance of West Side Societies will not remain content with only this plan, however. It will sponsor mass meetings and fairs which, it seems, are planned for about the beginning of April of this year. In this manner it is believed that the West Siders will be successful in their drive to collect a large sum in donations for the war sufferers.</p>
   <p>That this plan can succeed is proved by the first mass meeting of the Alliance. After the speakers had explained the purpose of the meeting a total of $83.51 was collected in donations. This is a nice sum for a beginning, especially since the audience was not very large.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>Other communities ought to follow this example; for in this manner we can collect more in donations in six months than we usually can in a year and a half.</p>
   <p>The West Siders should be wished success in their future efforts.</p>
