   <p>The Polish saying that "When the woman had no anxiety she bought a pig," applies to the new Lithuanian parish in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The bishop expelled Rev. Steponaviczius, who had some misunderstanding with Rev. Krawczunas. Rev. Krawczunas, at its own initiative, brought Rev. Peza from Pennsylvania. Rev. Peza is very well known in Pennsylvania for his dirty work there. Therefore Rev. Krawczunas brought him to Chicago as his assistant. It looks as if Rev. Peza is serving Rev. Krawczunas better than it was expected. Rev. Krawczunas, with the help of the Polish priests, wanted to put Rev. Peza in the rectory of the new church. We have heard that the bishop's chancellor begged the parish committee to accept Peza as rector. We suggest that Rev. Krawczunas take care of Rev. Peza, since he was the one who brought him from Pennsylvania.</p>
