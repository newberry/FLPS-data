   <p>When Russia received her death blow from Japan the revolutionary movement which had been going on many years started in full swing. The Russian government began to watch closely the students, because they are the first bearers of the light of freedom. As young students, they studied secretly the causes and effects of revolutions. The young students grew up into young giants, into leaders of the struggle for liberty and for human rights. When the opportunity came, they set to work with all their intellectual and material energy to fight the oppressors. I do not say that only the students were oppressed in Russia. All the inhabitants suffered material and intellectual oppression. The uneducated, the ignorant did not know who their enemy was or why they were suffering. Such people were unable to understand how they could organize themselves. The help came from the educated, the students who went and delivered speeches to the ignorant masses. They explained to them why they were suffering and told them the way out. Many such students were shot to death, <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>hanged, tortured, imprisoned, or exiled because they demanded equal rights for the people. This is known to all of us; there is no need of explaining this any further. I want the people to pay attention to one of our most important problems. It is known that during the revolutionary movement the Russian government closed academies, universities and high schools. Thousands of students were thrown into prisons and hundreds of students escaped to foreign countries. Among them are many Lithuanian students. Many of these were in the last year of their studies. They were thinking that after graduation they could go back to their native village to spread the spark of light among ignorant friends and neighbors. Now they are living in strange countries far from their parents, brothers and friends. These students are unable to complete their education; they are in dire need of help. Many such students came to America. Instead of attending schools they went to factories to work at hard labor, because they do not know any trade. If we do not take care of them they will contract various diseases, and the Lithuanian educated youth will be lost. The duty of the <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>American-Lithuanians is to extend their friendly hand to the students, help them materially so they will be able to complete their education.</p>
   <p>For this purpose since 1901 the Aurora Society has helped many of the Lithuanian students. For the last two years, on account of the Russian revolution, help to the students was rather small, because all energy was turned toward helping the revolution in Russia. Now I am appealing to the Lithuanian public again to help the students. Donate as much money as you can to the Aurora Students' Fund. Only through education can we uplift the Lithuanians culturally and materially.</p>
