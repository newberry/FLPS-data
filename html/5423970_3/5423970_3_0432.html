   <p>We are glad to see that our brothers began to understand their own necessities. They are listening to the voice of one who needs material and spiritual help.</p>
   <p>Last week we wrote in our newspaper Lietuva that we are calling a mass meeting to help our brother Blauzda. The meeting was large. J. Goinius was appointed chairman, and Mr. Sarafinawiczia as secretary.</p>
   <p>In this meeting citizen Blauzda spoke about his trial. He explained that he was innocent. After his explanation, all understood that he is innocent, and everyone in this meeting signed an affidavit that Mr. Blauzda is a man of good reputation.</p>
   <p>Sixty Lithuanians signed the affidavit and collected $12.50 for Mr. Blauzda to help him to fight his case.</p>
   <p>Contrymen! You have done a good deed by helping your brother. For this we are thanking you through newly born newspaper Lietuva.</p>
   <p>Sec. Sarafinawiczia</p>
