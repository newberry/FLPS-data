   <p>The Women's Lodge (208) of the Lithuanian Alliance of America complains that its efforts to collect clothing for the war-stricken people of Lithuania are meeting with a cold reception from Chicago Lithuanians. Two storage stations for the clothing have been established in two Chicago Lithuanian districts. However, very little clothing is being received.</p>
   <p>Additional volunteers are invited to enlist in this work in order to make it successful. Leaders of the Lodge have expressed the desire to see the recently organized Lithuanian ladies' Gabija [goddess of hearth and wealth in Lithuanian mythology] Club join in this work. The main purpose of the Club is to aid the poor. Therefore, by assisting in the collection of clothing for the war victims of Lithuania the Club is performing work that is fully in accord with its principal aim. It is hoped that the members of the Gabija Club will not refuse to enlist in this humanitarian work.</p>
