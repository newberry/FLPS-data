   <p>All Lithuanian working men and women are invited to attend this meeting.

Your financial assistance is needed to alleviate the sufferings of these innocent prisoners and also to assist their children and wives whom they were temporarily forced to abandon.</p>
   <p>The membership dues in this organization are only ten cents per month. It is very important for every class-conscious worker to be a member of this organization.</p>
