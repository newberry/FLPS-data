   <p>Complaints are often heard from the local West Pullman Lithuanians to the effect that no news of this colony is ever published in our newspapers. The supposition that there are no persons here who would, or could, undertake that task was usually offered as a justification for the lack of news. Regardless of what the truth may be, the fact is that the general public has had very little news of this colony and its activities. Nevertheless, even in silence, life did not remain stagnant here. It meandered along its own path, unseen and unknown by the public at large. The pulse of life beat here and slowly progressed. Life, of course, is life anywhere....</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians settled here about fifteen years ago. For a long time their number was small. During the last several years, however, the number of families has increased to about 150. There are also about 400 unmarried persons.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>As in other Lithuanian colonies in America, we also have ignorant Lithuanians here, who, following the practice of "olden times," are inclined toward the Poles and regard themselves not as what they really are--Lithuanians--but as sons of that "noble" nation. They avoid and are ashamed of everything that appears Lithuanian or carries a Lithuanian name. On the other hand, their joy is unbounded when they breathe the odor of the Polish spirit and--like a fish out of the water--it seems as if they would suffocate if they would not be allowed to smell the odor for a longer time. They receive the same reward that is given to all who attempt to ape others and crawl into their coats and, sometimes, slippers. When things are going well, the real Poles get along with these "imitation" Poles. But should a black cat run between them--and it does happen--those who attempt to please the Poles immediately receive such a beauty as "commoner," "damned Lithuanian," or "dog's blood." That is the reward for walking in foreign footsteps. As much as those poor souls would like to shake off their innate quality, they cannot do so. Why, even a Pole himself will stick such a person under your nose--like a barley cake in a market place. The status of these ignorant people is not enviable.</p>

   <p>However, the number of such people is small. The majority of the Lithuanians are nationalistically conscious. These Lithuanians concern themselves with their affairs. When the number of Lithuanians here became quite large, plans for their own church and parish were begun. Then, on March 6, 1913, a general meeting of Lithuanians was called by the Discovery of the Holy Cross Society. The purpose of the meeting was to organize a parish in West Pullman. It was unanimously decided, after a long discussion, that a parish was necessary. Here a parish was created under the name of the St. Peter and Paul Parish--if the Bishop will not change the name. A special committee was elected, which included the following persons: A. Vainauskas, K. Ziogas, S. Eidintas, A. Kiaulakis, J. Dobilas, and M. Kiubetis. They were entrusted with the whole matter. At this meeting a total of $137 was collected for the new parish. The site of the new parish was chosen at 123rd Street and Emerald Avenue. The necessary lots cost $2,400. The work progressed so, that on June 21, 1913, the treasury had $1,200. On June 21, 1913, $1,000 was made as a down payment on the lots. It was further decided to approach the Bishop, requesting that he appoint a priest. This decision was fulfilled September 29, 1913. At first <span class="page-break">\4</span>the Bishop revealed himself as not being very much in favor of the idea of a new parish. In time the affair turned in favor of the parish and on January 6 of this year the Bishop agreed to investigate the matter. The result of the report by the Reverend N. Lukosius, which was given the Bishop, was the appointment of the report giver as the pastor of the new parish. The parish's first services took place January 10. Since it does not yet have its own church, the services were held in the Polish church, at 123rd Street and Parnell Avenue. The remaining work progressed swiftly and, on June 17, the foundation for the new church was laid. The church, which will also include a school, will be a brick structure. The rectory will be separate. The total cost will be about $25,000. The blessing of the cornerstone will take place July 19, at 4 P. M. The founders and members of the new parish plan to celebrate the occasion festively and expect a large number of societies and individuals to attend. The committee invites all the nationalistic and religious societies--local and in the vicinity--to attend the celebration. The societies which will participate will meet at 119th Street and Michigan Avenue, at 3 P. M. There it is planned to meet the Bishop and, at an appointed time, parade to <span class="page-break">\5</span>the site of the blessing. M. A. Vainauskas, 715 W. 120th Street, West Pullman, Illinois, has been placed in charge of organizing the societies which will participate....</p>
   <p>The affairs of the new parish are supervised by the pastor, Reverend Lukosius, and a committee composed of the following persons: A. Vainauskas, A. Norbutas, A. Vaitekus, A. Kiaulakis, B. Simkus, K. Ziogas, K. Morkunas, K. Paliliunas, T. Zutaitis, P. Mikolaitis, M. Kiupelis, and K. Maciulskis. The priest and the committee are in concord, and it is expected that they will also be able to avoid misunderstandings in the future. There is also a ruling that every person who donates twenty-five dollars or more to the parish will be known as a founder and will have his name carved in marble in a prominent place in the church. Such persons will be remembered by the parish annually. Founders may be either local people or those from afar. The Reverend N. Lukosius, 1201 South Lowe Avenue, West Pullman, Illinois, is in charge of the donations.</p>
