   <p>The Chicago Lithuanian parishes want to establish their own cemetery. But the trouble with the cemetery will be, as it is everywhere, that the spiritual leaders want to assign the cemetery to the bishop. If the cemetery will be the property of the Lithuanians, would it be non-Catholic? In Lithuania the cemeteries belong to the parishioners and not to the bishop, and yet the cemeteries there do not lose their holiness. Why in America if the cemeteries are not assigned to the bishop as his sole property, then the cemeteries are not holy? If the cemeteries must be assigned to the bishop, then we see no reason to have a Lithuanian cemetery. Through control by the bishop, he can stop the burial of Lithuanians in such cemeteries, because the bishop will have the right to say that he does not want to bury foreigners in his cemetery.</p>
