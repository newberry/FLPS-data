   <p>Ten years ago the Lithuanians were against the spreading of their own literature; now they are demanding the spreading of scientific literature among Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>From every corner voices are coming, stressing the need of literature and more literature that may enlighten and educate them, teach them how to live and how to emerge from darkness and misery. From Chicago, the Enlightenment of Brothers Society has sent $5 to the treasury of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, as a donation for publishing more books. The Lovers of the Fatherland Society is very grateful for this donation.</p>
