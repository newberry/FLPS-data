   <p>Have all of you bought your tickets for the program and dance to be given October 29, at the Lithuanian Auditorium, 3133 South Halsted Street, Chicago, by the young people of the Lithuanian Alliance of America?</p>
   <p>The program is an excellent one. This is the first time since its origin that the lodge is attempting to furnish an entertainment for the Lithuanians not only of Chicago, but also of other Lithuanian colonies. This is going to show just how much ability the young people have.</p>
   <p>Three short and good comedies are to be staged by various members. Songs will be sung and instruments played by outsiders who have graciously given their aid to make the program a big success. A banjo quartet, "Four Aces," consisting of girls, and just organized by Ted Jones, instructor of banjo, is going to make its first appearance.</p>
   <p>Dance music will be furnished by Chicago's best orchestra, "The Sheridan Troubadours."</p>
   <p>Does not all this sound too good to be true! Wake up, it is true! Dont't forget to come!</p>
