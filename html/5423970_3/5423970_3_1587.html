   <p>On July 3rd the Rev. Krawczunas, president of St. Casimir Cemetery, called a meeting to discuss the affairs of the cemetery. The meeting started before the arrival of the Rev. Ambrozaitis who seems to represent the opposition of the administration represented by the president and the Rev. Lukosius. The Rev. Lukosius has a brother who acts as bookkeeper for the cemetery at fifty dollars per month and who has authority over the duties of the men employed in the cemetery at forty to forty-five dollars per month each. As he also operates a rented farm adjacent to the cemetery he very likely benefits by the use of the labor of the cemetery employes in which the present administration shares.</p>
   <p>The Rev. Ambrozaitis was sidetracked in trying to bring in previous discussions.</p>
   <p>The Rev. Krawozunas spoke of the improvement of the cemetery. He said that $2.50 must be raised from each of the lot owners and, especially, from those parishioners who did not donate money for the cemetery. He refused permission for Rev. Ambrozaitis to speak.</p>

   <p>It was revealed that, because the financial affairs were in bad shape, Rev. Lukosius and Rev. Krawczunas were planning to auction the cemetery off to the highest bidder. It was the common belief of this meeting that the administration was not for the best interests of all concerned yet permission was denied to all seeking to voice such opinions and to ask for explanations as to the cause of the mess in the cemetery affairs.</p>
   <p>The discussion on how to improve the cemetery affairs brought no results. Under the present control nothing can be done. We wish that all parish societies would elect delegates at their meetings and call a special meeting to discuss the cemetery problem. At such a meeting an effort should be made to gain full control of the cemetery. As long as the priests control the financial affairs of the cemetery, it will be a failure.</p>
