   <p>Hereby we are announcing to all the parishioners that this week we have bought the lots for the church of the Providence of God. The lots are located on the southwest corner of 18th and Union Avenue.</p>
   <p>In the near future we will have a priest and the church will be opened. We have heard that some Lithuanians are calling a meeting on the West Side in the name of the parish, but about such a meeting we know nothing.</p>
