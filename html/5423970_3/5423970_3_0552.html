   <p>The efforts of the South Chicago Lithuanians to make a statistical survey of their colony is a fine example to other Chicago Lithuanian colonies. It would be a very good thing if all other colonies would follow this example, and in that way assist the Lietuva (Lithuania) to make a complete statistical survey of the Lithuanians of Chicago. Questionnaire blanks may be had at the office of the Lietuva, 3252 S. Halsted Street, Chicago, Ill.</p>
