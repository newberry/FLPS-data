   <p>The Lithuanians in this city are gaining reason daily. The parishioners took the parish treasury from the priest. Now the priest says that such attitude on the part of the parishioners is an act of infidelity. The priest says that the bishop sent him here to take care of the church and the treasury. If the parishioners control the treasury, an act against God's will is committed.</p>
   <p>But the parishioners paid no attention to the threats of the priest and [proceeded] to elect a committee. A treasurer, under a $400 bend, was appointed.</p>
   <p>Before the Easter holidays the priest announced in church that every parishioner should come to him to get an Easter receipt for confession. The committee had the receipts, and armed with them went among the parishioners making collections for this religious service. When the priest saw that he could not write out the receipts for confession, he announced that he would confess even those without Easter confession receipts.</p>
   
   <p>This is not all. The priest said that there are some members in the church choir whom he does not like. He added that if these members remain in the choir, he will not hold mass. Then on Sunday the priest started to sing the holy mass, but no sooner he heard the voices of the singers in the choir than he stopped singing it, and instead began to read it.</p>
   <p>When the priest failed through these tactics to bring about a turmoil in the parish, he begged the parishioners during confession [to help] him get the parish budget back to his control. Of course, the people promised, but when it came to reality, they again voted that the parish budget must remain in the hands of the parish committee.</p>
