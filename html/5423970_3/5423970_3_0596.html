   <p>Beginning with the next issue, the Lietuva will inaugurate a special column under the title Life of Chicago Lithuanians, which will contain a large variety of interesting and educational news matter pertaining to the Lithuanians of Chicago. Material for this column will be gathered by the Lietuva reporter.</p>
   <p>Hitherto, Chicago Lithuanians knew very little about what was going on among them, and it is not at all surprising that many of our people complained that our newspapers made no effort to satisfy the desire of the readers for more news about local Lithuanians. The publisher of <span class="page-break">2</span>Lietuva has decided to satisfy this demand of the readers. The Lietuva will gather and print all kinds of news about local Lithuanians in their current events; news about jobs, where and how many Lithuanians are employed, the nature of their work and how much they earn; where and how Chicago Lithuanians live; the number and classification of Chicago Lithuanian business establishments, their investment, expenses and profits; the number of Chicago Lithuanian home owners; the number and location of Lithuanian neighborhoods and groups in Chicago; the total number of Lithuanians living in Chicago and its suburbs. In other words, the column will cover all current events and statistical news about the Lithuanians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is not necessary to say much about the value of such news matter to our people, because everybody can readily understand that such information <span class="page-break">3</span>is essential for our unity, uplift, and education. When we learn how much and what kind of possibilities we possess, it will be much easier for us to take advantage of them in promoting our welfare.</p>
   <p>The gathering of such news matter is not easy. In order to secure accurate statistics of our people, the co-operation of all Lithuanians, or at least a large part of them, is absolutely necessary. However, the publisher of the Lietuva has bravely assumed this responsibility and believes that in due time our people will be supplied with a variety of complete and accurate statistics pertaining to the Lithuanians of the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>As mentioned above, besides statistical information, the column will contain all kinds of carefully collected news about current events and other interesting information. A special effort will be made to obtain <span class="page-break">4</span>information about jobs; many of our people are now unemployed and are deeply interested in such information.</p>
