   <p>Next Monday, July 21, midnight, marks the close of our contest. All entries must be mailed previous to that hour.</p>
   <p>If you have not written your story, essay, description or whatever your inspiration prompts, do it now.</p>
   <p>For the last time, here are the details: All young folk who have never been in Lithuania are eligible. We have all heard stories, and read accounts of the Land of Our Fathers. So let us write of our idea of this country that our parents ever dream about. Just describe what picture your mind holds of this Lithuania that brings so many memories to the old folk.</p>
   <p>The only other requirement is that you submit, together with your article, your name, address and education or occupation.</p>
