   <p>The Children's Day Nursery, which was organized by a group of prominent Lithuanian women in the Bridgeport district, and about which much has been written in previous issues of the Lietuva, is meeting with great success.</p>
   <p>The Nursery is rendering a great service to the people of the community. It was established to accommodate poor working mothers who have no place to keep their children while they are at work.</p>
   <p>Working mothers can leave their children at the nursery all day for a small fee. The children receive expert care and supervision. Mothers who leave their children at the Nursery can feel confident that their little ones will be safe from harm.</p>
   <p>Last Wednesday, the Lietuva reporter interviewed Mrs. Zimontas, who is the president of the Children's Day Nursery. "Since last June," said Mrs. Zimontas, "1,547 children have been harbored in the Nursery; all the children were Lithuanians, with the exception of two Irish children. At present, thirty children are being harbored at the Nursery. The constantly increasing number of children that are being cared for is proof that mothers are satisfied with the services of the Nursery and that it is really a very useful institution."</p>
   <p>Reporter: "It costs money to maintain such an institution; from what sources does the Nursery obtain funds to meet expenses?"</p>
   <p>Mrs. Zimontas: "Mothers who leave their children at the Nursery pay ten cents per day. However, the institution obviously cannot be maintained with that income alone. Most of the expenses are met by donations from kind-hearted people. In this connection, I wish to point out that although nearly all children harbored at the Nursery are Lithuanians, nevertheless, few donations come from Lithuanians; most of them are received from non-Lithuanian Americans."</p>
   <p>Reporter: "You can raise money among Lithuanians by sponsoring some kind of benefit program or bazaar; the Nursery is really a useful institution, and deserves the support of every Lithuanian-American."</p>
   <p>Mrs. Zimontas: "Yes, that is exactly what we are planning to do. We are planning to sponsor a masquerade ball for the benefit of the Nursery on New Year's Eve, at Milda Hall, 3140 South Halsted Street. Later, we plan to sponsor a bazaar. We believe that our people will give their full support to these benefit programs."</p>
   <p>The Children's Day Nursery is located at 829 West 33rd Place. Visitors are welcome to visit the Nursery any day.....</p>
