   <p>The 28th (Chicago) Chapter of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society held two benefit programs for the relief of war victims in Lithuania. The first program, which was held on December 31, 1914, netted a profit of $15.80; the second program, on April 24, yielded $7.67. The Chapter thus raised a total of $23.47.</p>
   <p>The Farmers of Lithuania Society, in the West Side colony, donated $100 from its treasury for the cause of war relief. In addition, a total of $25.95 was collected from members at the last three monthly meetings. Thus, the Society's contribution amounted to $125.95.</p>
   <p>The sum of $149.42, raised by the two societies, was sent directly to Lithuania through the Vilija agency. The money was sent to the Educational Society of Lithuania at Vilna, with instructions that the money be used for the relief of Lithuanian war victims. Dr. J. Basanavicius, famous Lithuanian patriot, is the president of the Educational Society.</p>
