   <p>The Federation of Chicago Lithuanian Societies will hold its annual picnic on Sunday, July 12th, at Schutz Grove, which is located on 22nd Street, Riverside, Ill. All the features of a very pleasant picnic will be available. The admission price is 25 cents per couple.</p>
   <p>The entire proceeds from this picnic will go towards a fund to build a Lithuanian auditorium in Chicago. We all know how badly we are in need of a hall for our ever increasing activities. For that reason every Lithuanian in Chicago should support this picnic.</p>
