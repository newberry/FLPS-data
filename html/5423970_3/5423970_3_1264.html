   <p>As a delegate from Lodge 122 of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, I went to Aurora Hall, at one o'clock, December 6, the date designated for the convention. The hall was full of people: the seats were all occupied and many had to stand.</p>
   <p>Such an interest in the matters of the Alliance was pleasant to behold and I happily waited for the convention to open.</p>
   <p>The convention was called for one o'clock, but at 1:15 it had not yet begun. The delegates became impatient and demands were made that Dr. A. Zimontas, the president of the delegates, who had called the convention, open the meeting without further delay. Because the constitution of the Alliance states that conventions must be opened by the chairman of the executive committee, Dr. Zimontas requested the delegates to wait until Mr. K. P. Gugis, the chairman of the executive committee, arrived.</p>
   <p>After a short period of waiting Mr. Gugis arrived. When Mr. Gugis was asked to open the convention he declined to do so, basing his refusal on the fact that the convention was called not by the executive committee, as the constitution demands, but by Dr. Zimontas. He said that whoever called the convention should also open it.</p>
   <p>In his explanation Dr. Zimontas accused the executive committee of inactivity and of stifling the Alliance.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the executive committee, Mr. Gugis, pointed out that, though the executive committee was not active, it did not violate the constitution as did the president of the delegates by his action of calling the convention.</p>
   
   <p>After a short discussion it was made clear that the convention chairman not only has the right, but is also duty-bound to keep an eye on the activities of the executive and other committees and to make accusations at a regular or special meeting of delegates, if he should notice anything censurable in their actions, thereby giving the accused an opportunity to defend themselves. If such an accusation is found to be true by the delegates, the matter must be turned over to the judiciary committee for a final ruling. During the course of this action, the accused officer, or the executive committee as a whole, or any committee involved, is suspended and, to carry on their duties, the delegates elect a pro tempore committee.</p>
   <p>Such an explanation of the matter was accepted as just by the assembled. In the present instance the convention called by Dr. Zimontas could be regarded only as a special convention called to consider the accusation against the executive committee, but it could by no means be called the regular annual convention. But when it was made clear by Dr. Zimontas' accusation that none of the societies had paid their dues during the past year, it became evident that because of their failure to do so all of the societies had forfeited their right to send delegates, thus making a farce out of the Alliance of Chicago Lithuanian Societies.</p>
   <p>Under these conditions neither the convention called by the president of delegates nor the one planned by the executive committee for January is legal. A convention can take place only when the societies, having formally made application and having been accepted into the Alliance, comply with the laws of the Alliance and appoint delegates according to Section 37 of the bylaws. They must send copies of their delegates' credentials to the general secretary no later than two weeks before the date of a convention, thereby giving the general secretary the opportunity to verify the credentials and the status of the member societies before deciding which societies and how many delegates are to be admitted to the convention.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, all of this was overlooked and this meeting was recognized as the third convention and therefore distinct from a common meeting--a mass meeting.</p>
   
   <p>After the farce had begun, a majority vote designated this as the third annual convention and the executive chairman, Mr. Gugis, appointed a committee to inspect the credentials.</p>
   <p>The committee on credentials reported that the "convention" was attended by 107 delegates representing thirty-two societies.</p>
   <p>It became known, through the report of the committee on credentials, that eight Socialist societies had sent delegates, despite the fact that not one of these Socialist societies had made a formal application for membership in the Alliance and had never paid a cent in initiation fees or monthly dues. There-fore, neither according to the constitution of the Alliance of Lithuanian Societies, nor Robert's Rules of Order, nor the corporation laws of the state, nor the common practice of all organizations did they have any right to attend a legal convention of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>Regardless of this fact, the meeting approved all of the credentials by a majority of ten votes, and the election of convention officers got under way. Mr. Petratis was elected chairman; Mr. Strazdas, secretary.</p>
   <p>After the election of officers there followed, according to the procedure set down in the constitution, the reports of the officers of the central committees.</p>
   <p>Gugis, chairman of the central executive committee, reported that nothing was accomplished. His report was accepted with applause.</p>
   <p>Secretary Ilgaudas reported that nothing was accomplished. The report was accepted.</p>
   <p>Financial Secretary Mrs. M. Jurgelionis "reported" that she knew nothing of the financial state of affairs. Report accepted.</p>
   <p>The treasurer, Mr. Bierzinskis, was not present at the convention because he had to preside at a meeting of a society of which he is the president.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the finance committee, Mr. Kibortas, reported that the income from the second convention and the dues paid by the Lithuanian Alliance of America, Lodge 122, amounted to more than seventy-two dollars. About forty five dollars was given to the Alliance for charitable purposes. The total income was about one hundred and twenty dollars, most of which was used for printed matter and other expenses by the executive committee. Fifty dollars was given to the chairman, Mr. Gugis, to cover travelling expenses to the general convention in New York. A deficit of more than eight dollars in the treasury and an unpaid bill of $1.50 for printing done by Mr. A. Olszewskis in 1913 were revealed in the report. The report was accepted.</p>
   <p>The publishing committee, in charge of the preparation of an official organ which the last convention voted to publish quarterly, then gave its report. The central executive committee decided that it should be published only once a year. The publication committee had prepared sufficient material and had solicited enough advertisements from Lithuanian businessmen, but the organ was never published. Mr. Gugis took the blame for the failure to have it published.</p>
   <p>The committee in charge of the founding of a Lithuanian center explained that it had conferred with architects and prominent businessmen and had learned that a building would cost from fifty to seventy-five thousand dollars. This would not include the price of the site for the building. Realizing that it would be impossible to collect such a large sum, the committee abandoned the idea. The report was accepted.</p>
   <p>In discussing new business it was decided that the new executive committee should strive to collect enough money to purchase lots for this purpose [i. e., the Lithuanian center] and to go on with the idea; that is, to erect the building.</p>
   <p>Nothing more of importance was discussed, since every new suggestion had been anticipated in the constitution and was included within the jurisdiction of the various committees. Therefore the convention did not discuss other matters but devoted its valuable time to the election of new officers.</p>
   <p>When the nomination of candidates got under way, it became evident that the delegates of the Nationalist societies did not desire to play an active part in the farce called "the third convention of the Alliance of Chicago Lithuanian Societies". They allowed the leadership to be taken by member societies of the Socialist Alliance and their delegates. The latter, though they had no right to attend this convention, had apparently planned to take the leadership of the Alliance of Chicago Lithuanian Societies into their own hands.</p>
   <p>There were two candidates for chairman of the executive committee. Mr. Gugis was the first, and I had the honor to be the second. Mr. Gugis received fifty-two votes, I received eleven. A total of sixty-three delegates of the hundred and seven present voted. This showed that forty-four delegates, representatives of Nationalist societies, refused to vote because they considered the convention illegal. Thereby they allowed the Alliance to become a Socialist-controlled group. Now the Socialists have a duplicate society of their own Alliance, through which they can accomplish gigantic tasks without being hindered by Nationalist and church societies.</p>
   <p>This is a beautiful gift which the Nationalist and church societies are presenting the Socialists. The Nationalist and church societies had organized the Alliance without Socialist help, and now that it has become Socialist property they have withdrawn from it.</p>
   <p>Because of this, when I became vice-chairman automatically upon receiving a smaller vote for chairman, I expressed my gratitude for the honor bestowed upon me, but declined to accept the position. I felt that, being a non-Socialist, I would hinder the accomplishment of gigantic tasks which are always easier to realize when there is a unanimity of opinion.</p>
   <p>Since I had the honor of organizing this Alliance, of writing and publishing its constitution, and of guiding it through its first year, I am imbued with the aims and spirit with which that organization was created and feel that I know the trend it should have taken and the methods under which it should have functioned. Realizing that the fundamental principles, aims, and spirit of the organization have been scorned, I informed the "convention" that I refused to have any further ties with the organization and that I saw the need for organizing a new alliance on the same general principles and with the same aims that originally characterized the present alliance. This new organization would honor its constitution and maintain correct procedure, thus avoiding the staging of farces instead of conventions.</p>
   <p>With these observations I close, wishing success to the Alliance of Socialist Societies and strongly urging the Nationalist and parish societies to start a new organization which would be of value in the realization of common nationalist aims.</p>
