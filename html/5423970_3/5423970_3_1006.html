   <p>To the question as to who obstructed the growth of the Lithuanian Alliance of America during the past sixteen years, briefly we can say: the clergy did it. This can be seen today by every Lithuanian who watches the national movement. Now when the Lithuanian Alliance of America is freed from the tutelage of the clergy, it is going forward with gigantic strides. Having a free road, we have no doubt that the alliance will bring the desired results. Even though the clergy, under the name of Catholicism, was trying to deliver the death blow to the Lithuanian Alliance, their aim was seen and their plans were frustrated.

They are accustomed to grabbing the money and giving nothing, but they forget that dollars will not make a man happy. By destroying the alliance, the clergy believed they could make profits for themselves, while they were ignoring the rights and the needs of the people. The Lithuanian Alliance of America won the sympathy of all the American Lithuanians, and that is why the alliance is growing. Therefore, let me suggest that the day on which the trap set by the clergy was broken, should be proclaimed as a national holiday. The day is the 21st day of May, 1901. Therefore, the alliance should consider it as its yearly anniversary to celebrate the victory of light over darkness. I must</p>
