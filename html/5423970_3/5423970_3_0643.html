   <p>A meeting was held by the Lithuanian Independent Political Club on May 14, 1893, 1 P. M., at the Lithuanian church hall, Bridgeport.</p>
   <p>At first the committee reported the speech of President Grover Cleveland delivered at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. President Cleveland said that he, as President, can do nothing further, because the Senate has passed and signed the agreement between the United States and Russia. The Senate passed a law that when the Russian government wished to get any of her citizens from the United States, the case must go through the courts. If the court decides to deport the fugitive Russian, then he will be transferred to Russia.</p>
   <p>The agreement between the United States and Russia was to deport Russia's criminals to Russia. Lithuanian, Polish and Russian political fugitives <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>know that Russia has a net of spies in the United States. When Russian spies find any political leader who is active among his people in this country, then the Russian spies will make a false report to the United States government that such a political leader is a fugitive from Russia as a criminal. Russia will produce false witnesses against such a political fugitive. Therefore, according to this agreement, the United States government must deport such a political fugitive as a criminal, even though he was incriminated falsely by Russia.</p>
   <p>At this meeting speakers declared that all people from Russia are political fugitives and that we Lithuanians must unite and fight against the monster dragon of Russia. That the Russian dragon is not satisfied with sucking the blood of the oppressed people in Russia, but is sneaking into this free country seeking for victims to satisfy this dragon's lust for blood.</p>

   <p>Furthermore, the Russian dragon had its hypocritical war with Turkey to free Roumania and Bulgaria from the Turkish yoke. Who were the best soldiers and officers in the Russian army during the Russo-Turkish war? Why, the Lithuanians! The Lithuanian sons won the war, and the Russian dragon, the oppressor of humanity, gets the credit!</p>
   <p>If Russia in reality fought the Turk in order to free the Christians in Roumania and Bulgaria of the Turkish yoke, why then, brother Lithuanians, does not Russia free Lithuania? If the Russian dragon fought the war against the Turk, for the sake of Christianity, why then is the same Russian dragon keeping our mother country under its yoke? The Russian dragon suppressed our language, even the prayer books in the Lithuanian language being prohibited. And for reading prayer books in the Lithuanian language our sons are exiled to Siberia.</p>
   <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>
   <p>Now this Russian dragon is not satisfied with the blood of his victims, but this terrible dragon is seeking for more victims in this free country of America.</p>
   <p>We Lithuanians must devote ourselves, all our energy and effort, to help the oppressed people to overthrow the great dragon of Russia.</p>
   <p>S. Dargewicz, Secretary.</p>
