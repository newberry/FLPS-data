   <p>During the year of 1907, the amount of money received was $438.54. For the students' stipendia we have paid the sum of $461.90, which was more than we received.</p>
   <p>Everyone can see from the statement that the Lithuanian public disregards the poor Lithuanian students; and by such conduct, we Lithuanians are stopping the progress of our nation. It is obvious that without educated leaders, the Lithuanian public will not make progress. We know from history that even one educated person can do much for the human progress.</p>
   <p>Many times we have appealed to the public to help the poor Lithuanian students, but the Lithuanian public has turned a deaf ear to our appeals.</p>
