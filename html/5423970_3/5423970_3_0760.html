   <p>We, the members of the Lithuanian Theatrical Club, "Lietuva," unanimously protest against our national degenerates who, under cover of the name of socialists, are denouncing our national leaders, Dr. J. Basanavicius and M. Ycas, those tireless workers of the Lithuanian Science Society of Vilnus. These two honorable men are devoting their energy and time for the establishment of the National Museum in Vilnus. We protest against the so-called socialist newspapers and others, who dare to call these honorable men, beasts. We protest against all those who are trying to harm the cultural activity of these two honorable men.</p>
