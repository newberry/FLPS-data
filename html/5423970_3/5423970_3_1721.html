   <p>The Krawczunas church fair beats even the Clark Street dens. Last Sunday night at 11 o'clock, the people drank much of the holy beer at the church fair, and when they went on 33rd Street, they started to swear, curse and at last to fight. On this commotion came running the Rev. Krawczunas and the parish president, J. Gurinskas, with revolver in hand who started to shoot in the air, warning to kill if the drunk parishioners did not stop fighting. Of course, our honorable priest is uplifting the Lithuanian name? For such a prominent work of our Rev. Krawczunas, the parishioners should build him a monument.</p>
