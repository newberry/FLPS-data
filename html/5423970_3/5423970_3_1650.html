   <p>To the invitation by the Rev. Stefanaviczius that the Truth Lovers Society take part in the consecration of the school of the Providence of God parish, the society cordially accepted and decided to participate in that celebration.</p>
   <p>But the same priest, in the pulpit, on May 19th, denounced the national society for holding national celebrations, therefore, the Truth Lovers Society has recalled its promise to take part in the consecration ceremonies. We are doing that because we do not want the honorable priest to take the trouble again to denounce the national societies.</p>
   <p>The Truth Lovers Society.</p>
