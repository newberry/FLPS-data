   <p>And the widest sea has its shore, and the deepest waters have their bottom, and the most patient people have a limit to their patience. When the delegates, Dr. Jonas Basanavicius and M. Yeas, from a significant cultural institution, came to America, a certain group of our "socialists" looked askance at them. Even the better class of our people, and also the more earnest Lithuanian press were inclined to look "through the fingers" at them. Yet when a certain group of those trouble makers, covering themselves with the wrapper of their two newspapers, Laisve (Liberty), and Kova (Struggle), as though they were progressives and protectors of the workers, although they are not even fit to tie the shoestrings of Dr. J. Basanavicius, [when these trouble makers] began, in their accustomed way to smear these most important men of culture by various insinuations, to slander the delegates who came here to accomplish a most worthy cultural act--then the patience of the sober-minded Lithuanian snapped.</p>
   <p>In Brooklyn, N. Y., the Lithuanians protested against those good-for-nothing persons, who in their blindness disgraced forever all the Lithuanians of America. The protest (of Brooklyn, N. Y.) was published in the last issue of Lietuva.</p>
   <p>As soon as the protest was published, letters began to come in at once, with resolutions protesting the attitude of Laisve and Kova, and against those, who in the name of socialism, cover themselves with a hypocritical mask to exploit the workers. And these idiots now denounce our honorable guests, the disseminators of culture.</p>
   
   <p>Let our brothers in Lithuania, and our guests in America see and convince themselves, that the American Lithuanians are not scum, that they have no solidarity with those who are denouncing our national culture-bearers, that these slanderers of our honorable guests are Lithuanians in name only.</p>
   <p>Here are the signatures of those, who joined the protest resolution which was published in the last issue of Lietuva:</p>
   <p>"Chicago, Ill. August 31, 1913--The Grand Duke Algirdas of Lithuania Society, having held its meeting on August 30, upholds and fully agrees with the resolution published in No. 35 of Lietuva, as a protest against the two newspapers Laisve and Kova for their contemptible smearing of our honorable guests.

   <p>"Chicago, Ill. August 30, 1913--We are disgusted with the insinuations of Laisve and Kova against our honorable guests, Dr. J. Basanavicius and M. Ycas; we sign our names under the protest resolution which was published in No. 35 issue of Lietuva:</p>
   <p>"Pranas Butkus, president of the Lovers of the Motherland Society, Juozas Hertmanavicius, general secretary of the Chicago Lithuanian Societies Association."</p>
   <p>"Chicago, Ill. August 30, 1913--We, present at the farewell banquet at the Sherman Hotel for our honorable guests, Dr. Jonas Basanavicius and M. Ycas, fully agree with the protest resolution which was published in Lietuva against the editors of the newspapers Laisve and Kova; we hereby protest against the said two newspaper editors and those, who scorn our national culture-bearers in order to smear and stop their cultural activity among us:</p>
   <p>"Dr. A. J. Zimontas, A. Olszewski, Right Reverend V. P. Karkauskas;" other names were omitted because there were too many.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The newspaper Laisve was a socialist weekly newspaper, published in South Boston, Mass. At present, this newspaper is a communist daily paper, published in Brooklyn, N. Y. The Kova was a weekly organ of the Lithuanian Socialists Alliance of America, published in Philadelphia, Pa. At present, the Kova does not exist. After the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, the Lithuanian Socialists Alliance of America was destroyed by the hard-boiled followers of the bolsheviks of Russia. The bolshevik-communists took the Kova's machinery, literature, money--total value of $75,000.</p>
   
   <p>The publication of Kova was stopped; some of the books and literature were taken by the Laisve editors, and the machinery was brought to Chicago, and the communists in Chicago are publishing Vilnis, a daily newspaper. The purpose of the communists was to publish their newspaper in Chicago, in order to put out of existence the Lithuanian daily Naujienos.]</p>
