   <p>On Decoration Day there will be a grand celebration of the opening of the Lithuanian National Cemetery. Eighteen Lithuanian societies will take part in this celebration, and besides the societies, several thousand Lithuanians will be at the cemetery.</p>
   <p>At this celebration the Right Reverend Mickevicius from Scranton, Pa., will deliver a lecture on this event. (Translator's note: This priest was an independent; he did not belong to the Catholic Church of Rome. He called himself an independent Lithuanian Catholic priest. The Lithuanian National Cemetery organization had not invited him to come. He came of his own accord. They permitted him to speak not for the sake of religion or for the sanctification of the cemetery; they respected the priest as a more liberal person than were the Roman Catholic clergy.)</p>
