   <p>In Chicago there are about 12,000 Lithuanians. It looks to every one of us that such a number of Lithuanians ought to stand, morally and materially, on a very high plane. If they would donate one cent each, it would be $120; if each would give one dollar, then it would be $12,000.</p>
   <p>Then they could have schools, libraries, halls, where they could have lectures, present stage plays, hold national celebrations, enlighten themselves, educate themselves, build themselves up morally, intellectually, and materially. That is how it looks when we are looking at this matter from outside. But when we observe close the Chicago Lithuanians, we see an entirely different picture. When we glimpse into their material combination, we find only few that own their small houses, several saloons, and few other insignificant business establishments, and that is all.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Previously the Lithuanians were boasting that they had their own church, the parish hall, and school, because all that has been built with their own money. But now they found out that the said church property does not belong to them because it belongs to the Bishop. Now, when the parishioners wanted to hold their meeting they were forced to hire the hall from Rev. Krawczunas. And that the programs must pass through the censor of the Bishop's agent, who censors according to his sympathy and antipathy. It shows that the Chicago Lithuanians have no institution of their own.</p>
   <p>Let us glimpse into the enlightenment of Lithuanians and their morality. Of the 12,000 Lithuanians we may find about 300 readers of newspapers. What are the others doing? When they come home from work they go to a saloon, where they spend all evening drinking, and when they get drunk they are fighting and then go to court. While others are drinking in their homes and playing cards and fighting, and then the last resort is the court. During the summer, the windows of their houses are open <span class="page-break">\3</span>and when you walk on the street by a Lithuanian house, you can hear how the drunkards are cursing, swearing, singing and fighting. Americans are holding Lithuanians for wild men.</p>
   <p>Who caused the Lithuanians to fall so low? It is easy to understand. In whom the Lithuanians believe, they listen to him, they are following his example, and learning his morality. While our Lithuanians believe only in the priest they are learning the moral conduct of their priest. Our priest has prohibited to Lithuanians to read the newspapers; for reading the newspapers he will give no absolution at confession. Instead of reading the books our priest established a holy saloon at the church fair, where every Sunday from noon until 12 o'clook at night, the Lithuanians are drinking, oursing, vomiting and they are accomplishing other "great deeds" in the church. And as a fitting climax they end with a fight to the glory of God and for the benefit of the priest. Through the anxiety of our spiritual leader, at night time, the churchyard becomes <span class="page-break">\4</span>a real slough. It is not enough that the Lithuanians are ignoramuses and awkward in reading, that in one hundred hardly two or three read the newspapers, that our priest not only denounces the readers, but he drags them to his "holy saloon." "Come here, you faithful Catholics, I see that you are fools, squander here your last intellect, and give me your last cent.</p>
   <p>In the last number of Lietuva we mentioned what happened with the annual celebration of the scientific society of Simonas Daukantas, whose members are the publisher of Lietuva and Rev. Krawczuncas. When this society intended to hold its annual celebration this year, then our little priest was struck, as with terror, that the parishioners at the celebration meeting might start to discuss the affairs of the parish budget, and the parish school. The priest said that he would not give the parish hall without seeing the list of the speakers. When the committee did not know <span class="page-break">\5</span>who the speakers were going to be at the celebration meeting, the society had to call an extra meeting in order to decide on the speakers.</p>
   <p>The society consists of 80 members, but at this meeting there were 25 members, and Rev. Krawczunas himself. Our priest, at this meeting, was burdened with a confused mind and he was hardly able to stand on his feet. When the motion was brought at the meeting to elect the speakers by majority vote, Rev. Krawczunas protested and and said, "Not only by majority vote, but even if the speakers were unanimously elected, I will not permit them to speak. All the undesirables I will chase them out from the hall." Then the priest read a letter which was written by the publisher of Lietuva to Anton Kalasauskas. Rev. Krawczunas in his own lying version was trying to explain the letter; that Anton Olszewski wrote the letter and was inducing the wife of A. Kalasauskas to Quit him. Then the priest demanded to throw Olszewski out from the society as a family breaker.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\6</span>
   <p>Then the publisher of Lietuva answered the priest that Mr. Kalasauskas wrote letters to A. Olszewski, and stated in that letter that Rev. Krawozunas, at the confession box asked the young wife of Mr. Kalasauszkas to leave her husband. And that Olszewski wrote a reply to the letter of Mr. Kalasauskas, instructing him what he ought to do with such a priest. The publisher of Lietuva proved that the priest was lying and said, "If you throw me out for this letter from this society, the priest must be thrown out first, because at the confession the priest was urging a young woman to quit her husband."</p>
   <p>It is a fact that Rev. Krawozunas was trying to persuade at the confession the young wife of a Lithuanian to quit her husband. These people are living in Chicago, and they are telling to everybody what doggishness Rev. Krawozunas is doing in Chicago. When the publisher of Lietuva told that the priest was persuading young wives to quit their husbands, Rev.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\7</span>
   <p>Krawczunas get so mad that he, with his followers, attacked A. 01-szewski, shut off the lights, and when only by chance Obszewski escaped, then the priest attacked the typesetters, and the followers of the priest jumped on them like mad dogs. At such hellish turmoil the annual celebration of the scientific society was terminated.</p>
   <p>Now, beloved brothers, you see why the Chicago Lithuanians are on such low level. No wonder that the Chicago Lithuanians know notheing better to he drinking and fighting, beoause their spiritual leader Rev. Krawczunas teaches them that. The Lithuanians listen to nobody, they listen to the priest, and do what the priest tells them to do. He teaches them drunkenness by setting a bad example, at the confession he urges the wives to quit their husbands, always lies like a shameless person, at the meetings he starts the fights, he squandered many thousands of dollars of the parish money. Therefore, the Lithuanians began to imitate the conduct of their own priest, and no wonder that they are <span class="page-break">\8</span>fighting and drinking like their spiritual father. Perhaps, to punish the Chicago Lithuanians, God gave them such unfit spiritual leader and teacher of morality.</p>
