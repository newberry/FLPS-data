   <p>The 36th Lodge of the Lithuanian Alliance of America held a meeting last Sunday, January 10, at the Ausra hall. Among other matters, a decision was made at the meeting to donate twenty-five dollars to the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund.</p>
   <p>The question of whether or not the Lodge should join the League of Chicago Lithuanian Societies was raised at the meeting. Final decision on the matter was put off indefinitely. Sentiment at the meeting was very strong against joining the League.</p>
   <p>Two new members joined the Lodge at the meeting; both enrolled in the one-thousand-dollar death benefit class.</p>
   <p>Since this was an annual meeting, the new officers of the Lodge officiated. Dr. A. L. Graicunas is president.</p>
