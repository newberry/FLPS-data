   <p>When we say we have 6,000 members in the Lithuanian Alliance of America, we think that we have a great multitude in it. In America we have over 300,000 Lithuanians. That means we have a very small percentage in the alliance. To the Lithuanian Alliance can belong men, women, and children. If ten percent of the Lithuanians in America would belong to this organization, we would have 30,000 members. No doubt we could have them if there were more agitation among Lithuanians. It is easy to pay $2.25 a year and become a member of one of the largest Lithuanian organizations in America. When we have such a small number in our organization, it is our fault. Without agitation we can accomplish nothing. Therefore, we must not slumber. I ask all compatriots to join in action to get more members. We can easily increase our membership to 10,000 members. Then we can be proud of having such a number and bravely step forward and accomplish better results in the future.</p>
   <p>The alliance cannot grow by itself, but it can grow by the devoted action of its members. It is not enough to wear the button of the alliance; we must be active for the benefit of our organization.</p>
   <p>Let us make it an honor to have people become members of this organization. At every opportunity we must urge Lithuanians to join the alliance. It would be best for the local branches to hold meetings every month, instead of the usual quarterly meetings. With monthly meetings we can show more activity among the members and inspire enthusiasm for broader activity. Let us cultivate the field, then we will reap an abundant crop.</p>
