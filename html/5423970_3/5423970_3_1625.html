   <p>In other cities the clergy sometimes establish schools to teach the Lithuanian language, but the Chicago clergy do not care to have such schools for their brothers. The Lithuanian clergy in Chicago prohibit everything that is good for the workers.</p>
   <p>It is very essential to have a Lithuanian school in Chicago. The American schools will be opened soon, but in such schools it is impossible to learn English because the Lithuanians do not understand what the teachers are talking about. We must have a Lithuanian school where the teachers can explain the meaning of English words in the Lithuanian language. Such schools should be taken care of by the priest, but the priests are taking care of the nuns' schools, which give no benefit to anyone.</p>
