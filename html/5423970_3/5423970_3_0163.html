   <p>The Federation of Chicago Lithuanian Societies, which was organized several months ago to raise funds for Lithuanian war relief, is sponsoring a series of benefit programs for that purpose. The program on each occasion consists of speeches, motion pictures about the war, and musical numbers.</p>
   <p>The Federation has already given four benefit programs: in the Bridgeport, the Town of Lake, the 18th Street, and the West Side colonies of Chicago Lithuanians. The proceeds realized from these events were as follows: Bridgeport, $27; Town of Lake, $55; 18th Street, $32; West Side, $28,50, which sum includes a twenty-dollar donation by Mr. Joseph Saunoris, a Lithuanian tobacco merchant.</p>

   <p>More than fifty Chicago Lithuanian societies have already joined the Federation. Besides supporting all the benefit programs that are sponsored by the Federation, these societies make collections at their meetings and turn the proceeds over to Mr. Kareiva, treasurer of the Federation. Mr. Kareiva is under a two-thousand-dollar bond. All money that is raised by the Federation is deposited in the First National Bank, the largest bank in Chicago, and later is sent to Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The St. Joseph's Society, of South Chicago, one of the members of the Federation recently held a meeting at which $12.25 was collected. The money was turned over to the Federation by Mr. J. Trijonis, treasurer of the Society. Other officers of the Society are Mr. A. Maniokas, president, and Mr. M. Ciuplis, secretary.</p>
   <p>Another member of the Federation, the St. Dominick Society, netted a total of $8 at one of its meetings. The officers of the Society are Frank Vaicekauskas, president; J. Bukantis, secretary; A. Grisius, treasurer.</p>

   <p>The next program of the Federation will be a musical concert on February 11, at Pulaski Hall. After that concert has been given, it is planned to hold a gigantic bazaar.</p>
   <p>At present, the Federation is making preparations to participate in the Allied Bazaar, which will be held in the Coliseum for ten days, beginning January 10. All the national groups of the Allied nations of Europe plan to participate in this bazaar, which is being held for the purpose of raising funds for the relief of the war-stricken people of the Allied nations in Europe. By participating in this bazaar, the Chicago Lithuanians expect to raise about ten thousand dollars for Lithuanian war relief.</p>
