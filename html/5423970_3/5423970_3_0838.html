   <p>On January 8, at Klacel Hall, between 19th and Leavitt Streets, the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, branch 28, presented a one-act comedy, "The Bridegroom," translated by Dr. Grinius.</p>
   <p>The players were: Mr. J. Ragevice, Mr. R. Zaura, Mr. J. Stasiunas, Mr. Brusokas and Miss Kaupyte.</p>
   <p>Mr. Brusokas delivered a monologue, "The Yawn." It was very humorous and the audience laughed. After the performance of the comedy, there was dancing. Also drinks were sold. It would be a very good idea if the Lithuanians would stop selling drinks at their entertainments.</p>
