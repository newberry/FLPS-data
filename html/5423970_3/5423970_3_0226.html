   <p>Little Joseph Stalilionis, who lives at 3137 West 38th Place, is not a very big "man"; he is probably less than eighteen inches tall. He has not yet tasted the horrors of war and still does not understand the meaning of war, but anyway, he performed a patriotic deed for his fatherland. Thanks to him, the war-stricken people of Lithuania received eleven dollars the other day for relief.</p>
   <p>Joseph's christening was held last Sunday, when he reached the age of one month. He is the son of Justus and Ona Stalilionis. Upon the arrival of an "heir", Joseph's parents, in accordance with an honorable Lithuanian custom, gave a big christening party.</p>
   <p>The party was attended by relatives and friends. While the guests were enjoying themselves and wishing young Joseph and his parents good luck, the <span class="page-break">\2</span>godfather, Peter Kraujalis, made a motion in the name of his godson to remember our war-stricken brothers and sisters in Lithuania. It was not necessary to urge the guests any further, for they immediately dug their hands into their pockets, pulled out their pocketbooks, and donated a total of eleven dollars, saying, "Grow, healthy little Joseph; grow up to be a big man and a good Lithuanian; you have already started your life in a good way."</p>
   <p>The donations were taken to the newspaper Lietuva (Lithuania) with instructions to transmit the money to the Lithuanian war relief fund.</p>
