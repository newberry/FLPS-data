   <p>The local Simano Daukanto Society had a meeting March 3, at which, among other things, it was decided to aid Lithuanian strikers at Lawrence, Massachusetts. The Society appropriated twenty-five dollars from its treasury for this purpose, and members volunteered a collection of $5.50. In that manner a total of $30.50 was raised. The money was sent to A. Ramanauskas' address at 101 Oak Street, Lawrence, Massachusetts.</p>
   <p>The other Chicago Lithuanian societies ought not to forget their brothers on strike, many of whom find themselves in a critical situation.</p>
