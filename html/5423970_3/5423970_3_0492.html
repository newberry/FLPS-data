If one newspaper advertised a certain affair or boosted a particular person, the other newspapers were careful not to mention anything about this person or affair unless it were to give postmorten sentence.</p>
   <p>However, it seems that at last the day is dawning when all Lithuanian publications are writing about and praising one and the same person at the same time. An example of this is in the concert given in honor of Mikas Petrauskas.</p>
   <p>Likewise, the true Lithuanian nationalistic spirit is shown in some articles regarding candidates for political positions. The sentiment is that what we want to put into office of a Lithuanian regardless of what faith or creed he follows in private life.</p>
