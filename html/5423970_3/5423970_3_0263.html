   <p>The Lithuanian Women's Educational Society held a picnic in the woods at Beverly Hills on July 30. Although the weather was unusually warm on that day, a fairly large crowd of people attended. While the people were enjoying themselves they did not forget their suffering brothers and sisters in war-stricken Lithuania. Miss Karalius delivered a short address and suggested that a collection be made for the relief of the war-stricken people in Lithuania. Her suggestion was approved by Dr. Jonikaitis and others who delivered short addresses.</p>
   <p>The collection at the picnic netted $6.50. This money is being held in the treasury of the Society until more money is raised for this purpose; then it will be sent to the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund.</p>
