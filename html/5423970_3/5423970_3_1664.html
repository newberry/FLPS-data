   <p>Troubles are beginning (to appear) in the new parish, brought on by the new priest. Last Saturday a meeting was called by the parish committee. The new priest, who wants to be the master of the new parish, called his own parish meeting on Sunday, where he brought many followers of Rev. Krawczunas by telling them that the bishop's delegate would be at the meeting. The bishop's delegate came, and the delegate was Rev. Krawczunas himself. All this comedy is similar to the case two years ago when the Jews at Wadowici, Poland, to coax the money from the Poles, sent telegrams with an alarm clock to the American tsar, asking him whether they could buy land from him in order to establish a Polish colony.</p>
