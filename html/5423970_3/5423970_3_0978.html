   <p>Last Sunday at the drug store of Dr. Graiciunas a meeting was held by the Aurora Society. It was decided to give financial help to two students: one is attending the University of Illinois, the other is studying painting. We are sorry that the Aurora cannot help some more students. We have appeals from several students from Europe and America, but the Aurora has not much money in its budget.</p>
