   <p>Since December 4, 1910, the Lithuanian Evangelical Lutheran parish has existed in Chicago. Its name is"Zion of the Lithuanian Evangelical Lutheran Parish".... At present they have no minister or church of their own. The Evangelical Lutheran ministers are coming from other cities to take care of their religious affairs. They think, that in a short time, they will get the minister and will establish a church of their own. At the present time,they are holding their divine services at the German Evangelical Lutheran Church, on 19th and Johnson Street. Their divine services are in the Lithuanian language; and at their meetings they are using the Lithuanian language. Their parish will be able to unite all the Lithuanian Evangelical Lutherans in Chicago. Thus, they will keep them from denationalization (from becoming Germans). Their parish rules are entirely different from the Roman Catholics. The parish is under democratic control. All parish assets and by-laws are in the hands of parishioners. Every parishioner has an equal voice in the parish affairs. They also elect their own minister.</p>

   <p>They have a mutual aid society and money in the bank. Every year, they have banquets and other festivals. There is another Lithuanian Evangelical Lutheran society, but this society is so Germanized, that we cannot call it a Lithuanian society.</p>
