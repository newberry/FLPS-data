   <p>The Town of Lake (Lithuanians call it "Taunleikis") Chicago Lithuanian colony, located in the area around 47th Street and Ashland Avenue, has eighteen Lithuanian organizations, including two building and loan associations, two clubs, two branches of national Lithuanian organizations, and thirteen mutual aid societies. Six of the latter group are non-Catholic, six Catholic, and one mixed Lithuanian-Polish society.</p>
   <p>There are 109 Lithuanian business establishments in this colony. They are classified as follows: 36 saloons; 21 food stores; 11 barber shops; 4 cigar making establishments; two jewelry stores; two photographing establishments; two undertaking establishments; two printing shops; two furniture stores; one clothing store; one hardware store; four tailor shops; four steamship and real-estate agencies; two bakery shops, etc. This colony is the home of the Lithuanian monthly Erelis (Eaglet), which is published by S. Szimkus.</p>
   <p>The boundaries of this Lithuanian colony are as follows: From 47th Street north to 43rd Street; from Honore Street east to Laflin Street.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians who live in this colony are not less prosperous than those who live in the Bridgeport colony. There are several large and prosperous looking Lithuanian business establishments here. For example: The Star Clothing Co.; the furniture stores of Barskis and Kosmarskis; the printing shop of A. Zemaitis; and the steamship and real-estate agency of Marcinkevicius.</p>
   <p>This colony is the home of Joseph Elias, a Lithuanian, who is a hospital commissioner for the city of Chicago. He is having a large and beautiful home built at 46th and Wood Streets. He is in a position to do much good for our people, if he would care to do so. However, according to the way our people are speaking about him, he dislikes Lithuanians, refuses to do any favors for them, and, instead, assists the Poles and Irish.</p>
   <p>Not a small number of Lithuanians in this colony are members of the Lithuanian nobility, but they like to pretend that they are Poles. Most of the Lithuanian business men in this colony have non-Lithuanian (Polish) names.</p>
   <p>The general appearance of this section of the city is probably not worse than that of the other Chicago Lithuanian colonies. However, the air in this locality is worse than in any other part of Chicago, due to the presence of the stock yards. The odor in the air is so obnoxious that it is very difficult for a stranger to endure. When the wind blows north towards Bridgeport, which is much farther away from the stock yards, the odor is just as offensive there as it is in the Town of Lake.</p>
