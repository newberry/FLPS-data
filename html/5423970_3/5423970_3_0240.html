   <p>During the hot summer months the activities of the South Englewood Lithuanians in behalf of our war-stricken fatherland were temporarily at a standstill. However, now that the heat of the summer is gone, the Lithuanians of this district have resumed their activities in that direction.</p>
   <p>On August 13, two local Lithuanian organizations, the Englewood chapter of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society and the St. Anthony Society, held a joint picnic in Evergreen Park, Illinois, for the benefit of the war-stricken people of Lithuania. The sum of thirty-five dollars, of which twenty-five represents the proceeds from the picnic and the remaining ten a donation from Mr. J. J. Baukas, was sent to the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund.</p>

   <p>This sum is not large, but it must be remembered that these two organizations, as well as Mr. Baukus, have made donations for this cause several times before. Mr. Baukus deserves to be praised. He is the most successful Lithuanian merchant in this district, and is likewise the most generous with contributions for various Lithuanian causes. Other Lithuanian merchants in this district are less philanthropically inclined....He also donates the free use of his hall for all charitable purposes.</p>
   <p>On September 7, the Committee of Englewood Lithuanian Societies held a meeting to discuss plans for raising more funds for our starving brothers and sisters in Lithuania. It was decided to hold a benefit social on November 18. At that social, a sewing machine worth twenty dollars, a guitar worth five dollars, and an umbrella worth three dollars, will be raffled off. The proceeds will go for the relief of Lithuanian war victims in Europe.</p>
   <p>Long discussions took place at the meeting about the coming Lithuanian Day <span class="page-break">\3</span>(tag day), November 1, on which day public collections will be made all over the United States for the relief of the Lithuanian war sufferers. Two representatives of Chicago's Lithuanians attended the meeting and invited the Englewood Lithuanians to form a united front with the Lithuanians of Chicago for the coming Lithuanian tag day.</p>
   <p>Miss M. Radzevicius reported at the meeting that two representatives from Lithuania, Mr. M. Ycas and Reverend J. Zilinskas, will soon arrive in Chicago, and suggested that the Lithuanians of Englewood arrange mass meetings for them. Mr. Ycas, as most of us already know, is a Lithuanian member of the Russian Duma. He and Reverend Zilinskas are coming here to collect funds for the relief of Lithuanian war victims.....</p>
   <p>The Lovers of the Fatherland Society, Chapter 65, and the Lithuanian Alliance of America, Lodge 182, have decided to hold a joint benefit entertainment <span class="page-break">\4</span>this fall. Proceeds from this program will go toward the relief of the war-stricken people of Lithuania.</p>
