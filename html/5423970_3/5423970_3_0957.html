   <p>The Aurora Society at present consists of four branches with 59 members. Forty-four members joined the Chicago branch; six are from other cities, and seven quit the society. There now remain 37 members. The branch of Scranton, Pa., had six members and now has 3. The Brooklyn branch has thirteen members; the Plymouth, 6.</p>
   
   <p>During the three years of its existence, the Aurora Society, with the help of the public, has aided seven students. The society has had many enemies who in various ways have tried to obstruct its work. In Baltimore, an Aurora Society's member, Miss M. Aukstakalniute, collected money for poor Lithuanian students, and the ignorant Lithuanians in that city tried to have her arrested.</p>
   <p>The society has gone forward with its aim of helping poor Lithuanian students. The public must know what they have donated and what we are doing with their money. We will give a short statement as to whom we have given help. The names of the students will not be disclosed for political reasons.</p>
   <p>Miss V-te is attending a university in Switzerland, taking courses in literature and history. She is a good writer. She contributes to Varpas (The Bell), Ukininkas (The Farmer), and other publications. She has written to Lietuva, too, on various subjects. The Aurora Society pays her stipend of $120 a year.</p>
   <p>Mr. V. M. has attended a polytechnical institution in Riga. He was imprisoned twice for organizing politically the Lithuanian students and workers, and for Socialist activities. Because of persecution by the Russian police, he was forced to go to other countries to complete his education. The Aurora Society gave him a stipend of $120 per year. But after one year this allowance was stopped. When he was imprisoned his health was ruined. Since he was unable to attend the university, the stipend was stopped.</p>
   <p>Mr. V. D. is attending school in America and contributes literature to Apsvieta (Light), Naujoji Gadyne (The New Age), and other publications. The Aurora Society pays him a $100 yearly stipend.</p>
   
   <p>Mr. A. V. is studying at the Cracow Art Academy. Last year, at the art exhibition of the academy, he received a bronze medal as an honorary token for his artistic work. The Aurora is paying him a yearly stipend of $100.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grazys is attending a university in Switzerland, taking a course in literature and philosophy. While in Russia he studied medicine, but he had trouble with the Russian police on account of his political views and was forced to go to other countries. He has contributed literary work to Varpas (The Bell), Ukininkas, (The Farmer), Naujienos (The News); later he contributed to Darbininku Balsas (Workers' Voice), and Draugas (The Friend). He wrote under various pseudonyms , such as Barzdyla (The Bearded), Bezenies (The Landless), etc. In America two of his brochures were published: Aukos Kares Dievini (Victims of the God of War), and The Assassination of Alexander II. The Workers' Voice also published several of his brochures, as From the Past of Ours, etc. At first his stipend was $60 a year, but after one year, it was increased to 100 dollars yearly.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. K. is studying medicine in America. This is the last year of his course. In Lithuania he was very active in spreading literature among the people. He has been receiving a stipend of $175.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. M. is studying medicine in America. At the University of Moscow he studied jurisprudence for two years. He was arrested for Lithuanianism and exiled to the province of Viatka. Now in America, while he is studying, he contributes much of his literature to the Lithuanian newspapers, especially to Vienybe. He received help from the Aurora Society in the amount of $50.</p>
   <p>Besides these, another Lithuanian youth appealed for help. He is taking up sculpture. There are other students asking for help. We will help them if the Lithuanian public will come with their contributions.</p>
   <p>After graduation the students will repay a hundredfold by contributing to literature and to other fields of learning, thus adding to the glory of Lithuanians. By helping the students we are doing good not only to them but to ourselves. These students will write articles in the newspapers and books on various scientific subjects. This will uplift our nation.</p>
