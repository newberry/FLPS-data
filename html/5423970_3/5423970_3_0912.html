   <p>During last winter there was organized a women's society, Enlightenment, by a few energetic and active women. The society has held several meetings with lectures. This coming winter we must lay for our society a stronger foundation. Up to the present time we have no by-laws for our organization. We must have liberal by-laws, that every member of this society can be free to express her views without fear.</p>
   <p>Women! We are the foundation of the present society, we bring up the children; therefore, it is our duty to look that our children be brought up in culture, not in slavery and obedience. As it is today, the human race is enslaved by superstition. Our meeting will be held on October 6th, at 4 P. M., 325 S. Halsted St. All Lithuanian women are welcome.</p>
   <p>The Enlightenment Society Committee.</p>
