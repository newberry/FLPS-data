   <p>During the latter part of last week the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Students' Association of America held a convention in St. George's parish hall, 32nd Place and Auburn [now Lituanica] Avenue.</p>
   <p>A group of young Lithuanian-American students (mostly divinity students) of various American colleges attended the convention. Sessions took place during the daytime only; during the evenings of the convention days various entertainments were sponsored by the convention.</p>
   <p>It appears that nothing of real importance took place at the convention. The only "new" manifestation, which was not previously noticed, is an apparent dissatisfaction among the members of the Association. There are two classes of members in the Association: lay students and divinity students. The latter compose a majority of the membership and they wield their "power" in a manner that is altogether unsatisfactory to the lay students.</p>

   <p>Predictions have been heard to the effect that if the divinity students continue to dominate the lay students it would not be surprising if the Catholic lay students secede and form an organization of their own. However, only the future can tell whether or not this prediction will come true.</p>
   <p>The new president of the Association, Mr. Al. M. Rackus, was elected at the convention.</p>
