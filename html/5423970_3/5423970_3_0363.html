   <p>Three organizations, the Lovers of Lithuania Society, the St. Augustine Society, and Lodge 782 of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, co-operated in arranging a program on December 20, the purpose of which was to collect donations for war sufferers in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>P. Mulevicius read a paper entitled "Life in the Cities and on Farms". Then Dr. K. Drangelis and Mr. Stepulionis spoke on the necessity of providing relief to suffering Lithuania. In between the lecture and speeches the Misses A. Ulkis, B. Zilevicius, and K. Saluckas recited many beautiful poems which pleased the audience very much.</p>
   <p>Donations for the Lithuanian Assistance Fund were collected after the speeches. [Translator's note: Here follows the list of donors, which I am omitting. The total sum collected was $10.40.] The program ended at 10:30 P.M.</p>
