   <p>The Roseland lodge (Branch 139) of the Lithuanian Alliance of America sent the sum of $62.76 to the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund. This sum was raised by a donation from the treasury of the lodge, and from the proceeds of a benefit social which was held by the lodge a short time ago.</p>
   <p>The question of which fund the money should be sent to precipitated quarrels at the last two meetings of the lodge. It was finally decided to send the money to the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund. A separate fund to assist Lithuania has been created by each of the Lithuanian-American factions. The "Lietuvos Gelbejimo Ir Autonomijos Fondas" (Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund) was created by the Lithuanian nationalists; the "Lietuvos Selpimo Fondas" (Lithuanian Assistance Fund) was created by the Lithuanian socialists; and the Catholics set up the "Tautos Fondas" (National Fund).</p>
