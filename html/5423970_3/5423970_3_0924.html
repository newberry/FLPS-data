   <p>Compatriots: Whoever wants to uplift our nation should bring help to the nation's children, who are exhausted materially and cannot complete their education. Let us extend our hands to the poor students, because without our help they cannot go any further with their studies. We are lacking educated leaders. We know it is the educated man who leads us forward. Therefore, we should not neglect our poor students. At every opportunity, at meetings, banquets, festivals, celebrations, we should make collections for the students' fund. If we want to go with other progressive nations of the world, we must help our students.</p>
   <p>The meetings of the Aurora Society are held on every first Monday of the month at 869 33rd Place, at 1 P. M. All Lithuanians are invited to join this society.</p>
