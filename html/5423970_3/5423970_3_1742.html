   <p>As long as Olszewski tolerated and said nothing about the shameless conduct of Rev. Krawczunas, the priest kept Olszewski as a good Catholic. But as soon as Olszewski started to expose the priest's graft in the parish, the priest denounced Olszewski as arch-infidel, denouncer of God. Is it infidelity when one demands of the priest to give an honest account of the parish budget?</p>
   <p>Even Rev. Krawczunas and his Jewish lawyer were trying to prove that I am not a Catholic and not a believer in God. They failed to prove my infidelity, but many people testified what a drunkard the priest was and how immoral he is in his life.</p>
   <p>When one approves the priest's graft in the parish budget, the priest says of him that he is a good Catholic, but as soon as one disagrees with the graft of the priest, he calls him infidel.Where is the logic in this priestly hypocricy?</p>
   <p>A. Olszewski.</p>
