   <p>Science has brought man higher than all other animals. With his trained mind, man can be called "the king of all the creatures." Science has cultivated man's brain and this cultivated mind has made many inventions. If there were no science, there would be no railroads, electricity, telegraph, automobiles, airplanes, and many other inventions which serve man and help him to accomplish the hardest tasks. Therefore, science is power. The more man knows the higher he stands. The more scientists a nation has, the stronger she is. With science, the nation goes forward; without it, down. The Aurora Society is helping the poor Lithuanian students who ought to be helped by the nation. Therefore, support the Aurora Society, join it, help to increase its budget. By this you will help make the nation strong! Without education man is a slave, with education he is a king!</p>
