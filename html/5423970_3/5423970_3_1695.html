   <p>Some Lithuanians are talking, saying that the proposed organization for the new parish has been dissolved. They say that even the newspapers say nothing about this. To this we are answering that the organization on for the new parish is not dissolved yet, but with the help of God it is going forward, and we will have a new parish. We have said nothing in the newspapers because we have nothing new to report. As soon as we get permission from the bishop, we will call a meeting and push the project forward.</p>
