   <p>We are preparing and waiting for the Lithuanian Alliance of America's twenty-first convention, which will be held in Chicago on the 28th, 29th, and 30th of May, 1906. The 36th branch of the Lithuanian Alliance of America has mailed letters to all the Lithuanian societies in Chicago, regardless of their political and religious views, with invitations to participate in the parade on May 27th. All loyal sons of Lithuania should participate in this grand parade, to show the Americans that we Lithuanians are a separate nation, that our Lithuanian nation exists. This grand parade will be held in memory of our brothers who lost their lives for Lithuania's freedom. Now then, who would oppose such a project? Only he who is not of our nationality, who is not going with us. Such a person is our enemy. In this case the degenerate Lithuanian appears to be the Rev. Krawczunas. As soon as we mailed our appeal to <span class="page-break">\2</span>the Lithuanian societies, the Rev. Krawczunas, on Sunday, March 11th, in the St. George's Church, stated, "We the five priests have decided to make a pretest against the convention of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, which will be held in Chicago this coming spring. We forbid all societies and individual people to participate in the convention and the parade. For not obeying our order, they will be excommunicated. We will not perform nuptials, baptism, and we will not receive confessions. We do not need such people." Therefore, the Rev. M. Krawczunas and his five priests have shown that they are the open enemies of Lithuanlanism. Whatever is beneficial for the good of Lithuanianism the priest has denounced from the pulpit. I am not amazed at the Rev. Krawczunas. He admitted in court, before the judge, that he is a Pole and that he does not understand Lithuanians. Up to the present time we have not insulted the priest Krawczunas nor his friends. We have cared for our own duties, but now when that priest has attacked our organization in order to harm our national activity, we will take up our weapons to defend ourselves.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>and our defense will be easy because light always conquers darkness.</p>
   <p>We are thanking Rev. Krawczunas for the declaration he made about the Lithuanian Alliance of America, because on the same day after the denunciation of this organization, we held a meeting, and behold! twenty new members joined the 36th branch of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. The threats of the priest brought benefits to us.</p>
   <p>Honorable Lithuanian priests of Chicago! You are succeeding in befogging the minds of the people, and in reaping the benefit for yourselves. The other Lithuanian colonies, as we can see, are not as fat a prey as that of Chicago. But the priest must remember things will not always be like that, because the people are claiming their freedom. You became conscious of the fact too late to fight against the Lithuanian Alliance of America, which at present in Chicago has four branches in various parts of the city. These branches are growing fast; the membership is increasing daily. It would be much better for the priest not to show his degeneration. He should urge the people to take part in this great Lithuanian celebration.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>The Rev. Krawczunas should do like the Rev. Zebrys, who urged the people to attend the convention of the Lithuanian Alliance and to participate in its celebration.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Alliance of America does not take action to destroy the churches. Its duty is to spread love among Lithuanians, unity, enlightenment and morality. To defend the Lithuanian nation from her oppressors who are exploiting our nation politically and economically and demoralizing it morally and politically. Those who want to stop the progress of our nation should depart from our midst!</p>
   <p>In the name of the 36th branch,</p>
   <p>M. J. Damijoniaitis.</p>
