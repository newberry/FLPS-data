   <p>For several years the St. Kazimieras Lithuanian Cemetery has been terribly neglected. The parishioners tried to keep the cemetery in good order, but the clergy obstructed them. Now, when the Lithuanian National Cemetery has been established, the problem of improving the Catholic cemetery comes up again. The disagreement between the cemetery supervisor and the parishioners has lasted for a long time. The problem and disagreement in question has even reached the archbishop.</p>
   <p>The parishioners themselves formulated rules to keep the cemetery orderly. The archbishop added a few points and approved the parishioners' bylaws of the cemetery. On May 21, Right Reverend Fitzimons called the cemetery committee and the Lithuanian priests to his office to settle the cemetery <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>problem. He invited the following priests: Reverend M. Kriaucunas, A. Skripka, Ezerskis, E. Steponavicia and K. Ambrozaitis. The parishioners' delegates were: Messrs. K. Stulga, J. Judeikis, J. Klimas, J. Lentauskis, S. Stibutinas, M. Vabalas, S. Dargis, J. Bagdziunas, M. Meldazis and J. J. Alijosius. All the delegates were present. But from the clergy, only two priests, E. Steponavicia and K. Ambrozaitis attended the meeting..... The priests did not come because they thought that without them, the archbishop's secretary, would disregard the parishioners' demand. However, unfortunately for the clergy, Reverend Fitzimons read the new bylaws of the cemetery and gave them to Mr. K. Stulga, with an order to print them and to distribute them among the parishioners. According to the new bylaws, the sole owner of the St. Kazimieras Cemetery will no longer be St. George's Parish. The cemetery must be supervised by delegates, one to be elected from each parish. Then the representatives of the parishes will elect, among themselves, the president and directors. Such a decision was delivered in favor of the parishioners' demand. Messrs. K. <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Stulga and J. Judeikis have devoted much energy to the task of removing the cemetery from the control of the clergy. The cemetery's financial and general affairs were in a very bad state. In order to place the cemetery in an orderly shape, the parishioners "revolted" against this mess that had been brought on by the clergy.</p>
