   <p>It was mentioned before in Lietuva that we need in Chicago a cooperative society. This society wants to build a Lithuanian hall, 50 x 125.</p>
   <p>Such a hall will cost $20,000. It will be a stock company, one share will be ten dollars. One person or society cannot buy more than one hundred shares.</p>
   <p>To raise the money time will be limited to one year. The money will be deposited in the bank. If in one year not enough shares are sold to build the hall, the money will be refunded to every shareholder with 3% interest.</p>
   <p>At present we have nineteen members in our cooperative society. Those who are willing to join, write or call in person at the office of Lietuva. The final meeting for the complete organization of this society will be called later.</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
