   <p>Lithuanian Farmers' Society meetings are held in the West Side Hall, 2242-44 W. 23rd Place. The first meeting was held on August 17, 1906 in the J. Zilis Hall, 1 W. 24th St.</p>
   <p>Record of the First meeting:</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by citizen Michael Duda, who told the people that the purpose of the meeting was to organize a Lithuanian Society in that neighborhood.</p>
   <p>Further, they wondered what name to give the society. Michael Duda made a motion that the name should be "Farmer of Lithuania; so it would always remind them of Lithuania, her farmers and our brothers. Also, the name was fitting to them, as they themselves, had been mostly Lithuanian farmers. So they unanimously voted the name: "Society of the Farmers of Lithuania."</p>
   <p>Citizen J. Jilis, took upon himself the task of getting a charter, thus doing a service to the newly organized society. The task of making a constitution was given to Michael Duda.</p>

   <p>2. Giving the members facilities to acquire more knowledge and strengthening the mutual understanding among Lithuanians in America.</p>
   <p>3. The society will try to the best of its ability to uphold and strengthen the love of Lithuania and the Lithuanian language among her members as well as among those who do not belong to the society.
