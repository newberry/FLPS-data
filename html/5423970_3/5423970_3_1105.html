   <p>The culmination of the celebrations in commemoration of the Lithuanian Grand Duke Vitautas the Great will take place on the anniversary of his coronation, September 8, 1930.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians will hold celebrations on the anniversary of the Grand Duke's coronation in Chicago, New York, Boston, and other Lithuanian colonies in America. On that day, also, great festivities will be held throughout Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The Vitautas committee has decided to erect one large monument, perhaps a museum, to the Grand Duke's memory and has requested all provincial committees not to erect separate monuments. Instead, all collected contributions should be sent to the central committee for the erection of a single, large-scale memorial.</p>
