   <p>This year the 21st convention of the Lithuanian Alliance of America will be held in Chicago. The expenses of this convention will be covered by the local branches of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. For this reason the 36th branch of the Lithuanian Alliance of America held a banquet on the 18th day of February, at K. Landauskas Hall. In order to help make this banquet a financial success, Mr. K. Jokubaitis donated a dresser and Mr. K. Petronis donated a mandolin. These two objects were to be raffled and many tickets were sold. Many people were at the banquet. The net profit from the banquet was $80. In the name of the 36th branch, I am thanking all supporters of this great cause.</p>
