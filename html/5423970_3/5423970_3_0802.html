   <p>The Birutes Society is the most sympathetic organization among the Lithuanian societies in Chicago. Most of its members are Lithuanian youths, many of them are American-born Lithuanians. The Birutes Choir is one of the best in Chicago, or perhaps in the United States. Many a time this choir has consoled our spirit with beautiful songs, and with its dramatic presentations has brought cultural enlightenment to our public.</p>
   <p>When the composer Mr. M. Petrauskas, went to Europe, many said that this choir would be unable to [continue to] exist. But today, our society is stronger than ever.....</p>
   <p>During the last year, our society has presented twenty plays and concerts.</p>
   <p>The income was $2,082.80, the expenses--$2,085.46, a deficit of $2.66.</p>
   <span class="page-break">2</span>
   <p>Hall rentals, $505--orchestra, $307--singing lessons, $284.85-- printing and publication, $246.50, etc.</p>
   <p>The above financial statement ought to awaken sorrow and sadness in the heart of every Lithuanian, and pity for the Lithuanian youth for his devotion of time and energy to the cultural enlightenment of their older brothers. Such is the reward we are giving our youth!</p>
