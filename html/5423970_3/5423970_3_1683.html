   <p>The society of the Maidens of Holy Mary the Rosary will hold its meeting on May 13, at 12 noon, in the house of Miss Mary Sereikeyte, 3305 Auburn Avenue. There are many important matters to decide.</p>
   <p>The society obtained its charter, therefore, all the members should come without fail. The cause for transferring the society's meeting to another place is this: The local rector, Rev. Krawczunas, came to our society without invitation and made improper advances toward the girls. He also demanded from the society the dismissal of such girls as he does not like, and when the society refused to do that, the priest appropriated its books and does not permit the society to hold its meetings in the usual place.</p>
