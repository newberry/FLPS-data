   <p>We, the members of the Simonas Daukantas society have the purpose to proclaim science amongst Lithuanians, to propagate Lithuanian literature, to Maintain a large library, to collect Lithuanian relics for the museum which now we are preparing to have. But here, we read an article in Tevyne (Fatherland). organ of the Lithuanian Alliance of America that all Lithuanias are changing into Englishman, we became discouraged and worried when we read that article. We are sorry to hear that the Lithuanians become Englishmen and forget about the dear motherland Lithuania of which every foot was sprinkled with blood, the suffering of our forefathers in defending their land. If some other newspaper would say that about Lithuanians it would not discourage us so much, but when the organ of the Lithuanian Alliance says that, we are very sorry for that.</p>
   <p>If Hollanders and Swedes would change into Englishmen, we would not be surprised, because their language is smilar to English, but for Lithuanians it is impossible to change. Lithuanians can become Englishment only for the lack of enlightenment. The Tevyne's editor says that the Frenchmen in Canada.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>even though they are under the English rule, are still Frenchmen. We will remind the editor of Tevyne that in New Orleans, La., and in the other cities in the States of Georgia and Florida, the French people lived there for the last three hundred years and they are not Englishmen yet; they are still Frenchmen.</p>
   <p>The Irish people lost their language by oppression and yet they are Irishman, but not Englishmen, although they cannot speak any more of their own language.</p>
   <p>For many years there had been many German colonies in America, they still speak their language and they are still Germans.</p>
   <p>The Jews were persecuted in every land and nation, and they have not yet assimilated with any nation.</p>
   <p>A cultured people will never assimilate with other nationality. What <span class="page-break">\3</span>The Russian government accomplished when he tried by force to Russianize the Lithuanians. Thousands of Lithuanians died in exile, thousands were hanged and shot -- and yet even by force, our Lithuanians did not change into Russians.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians in this country are organizing societies, publishing books and newspapers, building the churches with their own money. Is there any proof that the Lithuanians are changing into Englishmen?</p>
   <p>We, the members of Simonas Daukantas society, after many discussions in the meeting, decided to raise the protest against the organ Tevyne for such an insult to the Lithuanians. The organ would do much better if it would spread education and enlightenment among Lithuanians instead of publishing such insults about Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>In this age education is the most important thing; science is going forward with tremendous speed; we do not need to wait for a ozar or any other despot that would give us education and freedom. We must educate ourselves, <span class="page-break">\4</span>and when we become a cultured people, we will overthrow the yoke of the czar, and will show to the people in this country, that we are an able and cultured people.</p>
   <p>Take the Czechs, they have their organizations, halls and churches in Chicago. They never think of calling themselves Englishmen. They are Czechs, although they are highly educated and cultured people.</p>
   <p>Lithuania perished through the ignorance of her people, but the enlightened people will resurrect her.</p>
