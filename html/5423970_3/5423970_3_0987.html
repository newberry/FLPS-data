   <p>The Aurora Society held its monthly meeting last Sunday at the drug store of Dr. Graicziunas. The most important decision of the society was to give a stipend to a student who is willing to study music or the arts. In reality, at present we have no Lithuanian student who is attending a conservatory of music or an academy of arts. As the Aurora Society has received no reply from such a student, therefore the society will advertise in the Lithuanian newspapers for Lithuanian boys or girls who would like to study music or arts. But such students must prove their ability in that line.</p>
