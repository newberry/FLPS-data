   <p>The Lithuanian societies on the West Side collected several hundred dollars for the relief of Lithuanian war sufferers in Europe. Now this fund is being liquidated for several reasons, one of them being that, since this country entered the war, many of our very active men have joined the army. We feel certain, however, that if there is a need, the societies will not refuse to do a little work again for the welfare of the nation.</p>
   
   <p>The Committee of the Organizations and the Auditing Committee thank the West Side organizations for their activity.</p>
   <p>The officers of the Committee were Stanley Kriukas, chairman; J. Krumas, secretary; and Raphael Zaura, treasurer. Other members on the Committee were Stanley Rokas, F. Kirsnis, and J. Pauksnis.</p>
   <p>Editor's note: This achievement of the West Side societies deserves much praise; it has shown clearly what can be done by uniting forces.</p>
