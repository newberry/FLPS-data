   <p>Through the efforts of Mrs. Zimontas a large bundle of clothing was collected for Lithuanian war relief. Another large bundle was collected by Miss M. Radzevicius. An effort is being made to collect a carload of clothing in Chicago and then send them to the central station in Brooklyn, New York from where they will be sent direct to Lithuania.</p>
   <p>People who are associated with this work state that Chicago Lithuanians are very generous in contributing clothing for the relief of their war-stricken brothers and sisters. A large amount of clothing can be easily collected if there were more people engaged in this work. According to reports, young Lithuanian ladies are especially successful in collecting clothing. A number of them are devoting their spare time to this cause.</p>
   <p>For further information in regard to the collection of clothing for Lithuanian war relief, apply or write to Mrs. Zimontas, 3252 South Halsted Street.</p>
