   <p>Last Sunday at Dr. Graiciunas' drug store the Aurora Society held its monthly meeting. It was announced at the meeting that this society has given a stipend to three students in Europe and one in America who are studying medicine. From such a young society we cannot expect much more. It is a disgrace to the Lithuanian public, of course with the exception of the Aurora branch in Scranton, Pa., that there never were organized more branches of this Aurora Society! We are disapproving of the clergy, although we are not following them in their activity. The clerical organization Motinele (The Little Mother) collected more money than the Aurora Society collected. We are not jealous of the Motinele Society. We are willing to advertise in the Lietuva the accounts of Motinele, but the clerical newspapers are not taking a friendly attitude toward the Aurora Society. For instance, the newspapers Zvaigzde (The Star) not even advertised the account of the Aurora Society. The newspaper Zvaigzde prints more instigations against the Aurora Society than favorable news. Although the Aurora Society does not in any way <span class="page-break">\2</span>trespass on the rights of the Motinele Society. It would be proof that the clergy who are boasting of their morale, cannot separate the good from the bad. The clergy are upholding themselves as moral in the eyes of their followers!</p>
