   <p>The commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of St. George's Lithuanian Roman Catholic Parish was concluded last Thursday evening with a great banquet at St. George's Parish Hall, 32nd Place and Auburn [now Lituanica] Avenue. About four hundred guests attended, and many speeches were delivered by prominent Lithuanians. A collection was made at the banquet to aid the war-stricken people of Lithuania. The collection netted about fifty dollars.</p>
