   <p>The growth of the Lithuanian Alliance of America is not as good as it is supposed to be. We must be more active in order to increase its membership.</p>
   <p>In order to get more members we must have speeches at every meeting; we must invite the people, let them hear why they must belong to this national organization in America.</p>
   <p>At the meetings of the church societies the people have no right to open their mouths. They must obey orders from above. But at our meetings we can raise our voice and discuss problems freely. Only by such conduct can the organization grow and make progress. Branch 36 decided to hold meetings with lectures during the winter months. The meetings will be held every month; therefore, Lithuanians, take this opportunity to attend these meetings. Learn about your affairs and duties as Lithuanians. Know why you should belong to this national Lithuanian organization.</p>
   <p>Frank Eismontas, Sec. of the 36th Branch.</p>
