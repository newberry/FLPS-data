   <p>Our Alliance which is under the control of the Soul Shepherds wore the national name. There was no nationalism, though, because nationalism was wrapped with religious swaddling clothes and was divided into two contrary beliefs. Before the convention both sides led the agitation; one side led the agitation with the truth, while the other, the clerical side, with intrigues and money. It is well known that in America today, with the truth you cannot go far, but with bribery and money you can go everywhere. So it was with the Lithuanian Alliance. Those who controlled the money bribed the delegates. We have heard that they paid $25 for letters which were written to uphold the clergy and that the clerical delegates get $50 and a free ticket. Through bribery, the clergy at the convention obtained a majority. Later on we will hear much more about the bribery and graft of the clergy before and during the convention. We are not sad at this event.</p>
   <p>The same struggle with the clergy at the Polish Alliance. Since the separation in the Polish Alliance, the liberal Polish Alliance is <span class="page-break">2</span>progressing culturally and financially, while the clergy alliance is at the point of stagnation.</p>
   <p>The major branches of the Lithuanian Alliance are upholding the liberal, progressive side. Now the clergy has named the Lithuanian National Alliance the Lithuanian Catholic Alliance. We have the charter and the majority of the Alliance branches, so we can organize them under the old charter. Now we have the national alliance without clergy. We must work hard, spread the idea and the benefit of this liberal Lithuanian Alliance. Even though at present we have no alliance organ, the Tevyne, our liberal newspaper, can be used for this alliance of ours.</p>
   <p>The central officials of this liberal Lithuanian Alliance should advertise their names and addresses in the newspapers, because there are many Lithuanian colonies that are willing to organize the alliance branches but they do not know who the officials are or where they are.</p>
   <p>We ought to explain to the Lithuanians that in this Lithuanian alliance all are equal, can express their views and criticize their officials.</p>

   <p>The clergy has no right nor power to expel a member just because he is not a Catholic, does not support the priest, or dares to criticize the clergy. We must show that this is the cheapest mutual aid organization. For 35 cents per week, the member get $150 death benefit.</p>
   <p>Previously, if you dared to criticize the black acts of the priests, or their mistresses, you were expelled from the Lithuanian Alliance. Now we are free from the clerical despotism; we can write and criticize, to show openly what is wrong with our Alliance and how to correct it. We know that more people will join this liberal Alliance than the despotic clerical Alliance.</p>
