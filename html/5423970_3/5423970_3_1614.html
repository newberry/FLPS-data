   <p>Pastor Stefanowitch of the Lithuanian Church of the Divine Providence at 18th and Union St. made an appeal to the Superior Court for an injunction order against Michael Jurgatis, Paul G. Bagwilonis, Teneas Uslitis, and other members of his congregation. The pastor had nominated last Sunday Simon Scudas and Adam Macisjenski as members of the church committee for the collection of money and other activities. These nominations caused the displeasure of a number of parish members to such a degree, that they stormed the pastor's home and wounded several policemen, who protected the pastor. The pastor appealed to the court to forbid them to molest the committee and to menace the pastor and to interfere with the church service or make other disturbances.</p>
