   <p>In the printed program of the Federation of Chicago Lithuanian Societies' Concert, which took place last Sunday evening in Pulaski Hall, there is a very unusual advertisement. On Bridgeport Avenue there is a St. David's Roman Catholic church whose pastor is Reverend Joseph McNamee, an Irish priest. Reverend McNamee donated the sum of ten dollars for Lithuanian war relief and also placed a ten-dollar advertisement in the printed concert program. The advertisement reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"St. David's Church, located at 32nd Street and Emerald Avenue, welcomes all nationalities. Masses are held every hour from 6:00 A. M. to 11:00 A. M. on Sundays. Catechism classes are held every morning at 8:00 A. M. First Communion is made on Easter Sunday. The church maintains a parochial school for children. No fee is charged for the Easter duty confession. We do not ask for money for christenings, weddings, or funerals; we accept only money that is voluntarily offered to us after each ceremony. We do not ask that anyone divulge his or her nationality. All nationalities are equally welcome."</p>

   <p>We understand that upon reading this advertisement certain Lithuanian priests became angry over what they sneeringly term the "politics of the Irish."</p>
