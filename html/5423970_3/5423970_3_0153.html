   <p>J. W. Mundelein, Archbishop of Chicago, has donated seven hundred dollars for Lithuanian war relief. This donation seems to have been made in connection with Lithuanian Day, May 20, 1917, which day was designated by the Pope. Funds for the relief of the war-stricken people of Lithuania will be collected in all Roman Catholic churches in Chicago and elsewhere on that day.</p>
   <p>Chicago Lithuanian priests have elected a Lithuanian Day committee composed of Reverends A. Skripka, F. B. Serafinas, and M. Krusas.</p>
