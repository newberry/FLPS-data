   <p>There is very little news being printed about the Lithuanians on the north side of Chicago. They too are active in the cultural field. February 26, the Lithuanian Singers Society, which is under the auspices of the St. Cecilia Society, presented "The People," by B. Vargsas. The play was well performed.</p>
   <p>Then the boys' and girls' choir, whose ages run from seven to twelve, sang several songs beautifully. This children's choir was instructed by the organist Preksaitis. No doubt the instructor has devoted much time and energy to the children's choir since they have reached such a high quality of singing. Several boys and girls also presented declamations.</p>
