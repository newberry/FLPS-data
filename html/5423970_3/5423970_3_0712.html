   <p>During the past few months such phrases as "National-Catholic parish" and "National-Catholic priest" have appeared in our press and have been heard in the speeches of many of our leaders. These terms are usually applied in instances where parishioners have broken away from their parish because of their dissatisfaction with the Roman Catholic priest, and have proceeded to organize a new parish to which they have invited some "independent priest" to act as their pastor.</p>
   <p>At this time we do not intend to discuss at length the various reasons for the formation of such parishes among Lithuanian-Americans. We do wish to point out that such parishes are formed by faithful Catholics who, because of resentment toward their pastor, quarrel with him and then declare a strike against him. Finally they form an "independent" parish to which they invite an "apostle" <span class="page-break">\2</span>as a form of vindictive expression toward their pastor. As far as we know this is the only reason for the formation of such parishes among Lithuanian-Americans; none of them have been formed on the basis of differences in religious principles or ideals. The Poles, for example, have a more or less idealistic "National church", which developed from a number of independent parishes. Among them, according to reports, there are some groups which believe that their church should actually by "National"; but there is no such thing among Lithuanian-Americans. Therefore, to call such independent Lithuanian parishes "National" or "National-Catholic" is absurd. And it is still more absurd to refer to the pastors of such parishes as either "National" or "National-Catholic" priests.</p>
   <p>We do not know of a single independent Lithuanian priest who can honestly be called a "National" priest. Neither do we know even one independent Lithuanian priest who sincerely devotes himself to the principle and ideals which he preaches. Not one of them is a "reformer", but many of them are worthless ignoramuses and contemptible racketeers who have adopted the priesthood as an easy way to make a living.</p>

   <p>It is the duty of our more conservative newspapers, especially the nationalist press, to publish these facts from time to time. It should be understood that we are not making these assertions to defend our present Roman Catholic priests, their parishes, or their religion. The Nationalists are not interested in such matters as religion. The Nationalists must keep these facts before the public only in order to safeguard the political reputation of the Nationalist party.</p>
   <p>If the Nationalists have nothing to do with religion, then how can they permit anyone to hang religious icons on their necks? The Nationalists would wreck their platform if they permitted religious questions to creep into it; if they remain silent they will be providing opportunities for all kinds of racketeers--who have the same amount of Nationalistic ideals as a male goat has milk--to hide under the cloak of Nationalism. We know that Nationalists who are deeply concerned with the ideals of Nationalism are not interested in religious racketeering, and that they do not shelter such charlatans under the cloak of their party. However, the enemies of the Nationalists are making an effort to align religious racketeers with the Nationalist Party.</p>

   <p>Roman Catholic priests who more or less willingly engage in a fight against the "independent priests", often connect the "independents" with the Nationalists and their party. This is being done for no other purpose than to degrade and harm the Nationalist party. This propaganda is particularly harmful since the "independents" smear themselves with bad deeds. As a result of this action by the Roman Catholic priests many people, either through blind faith or ignorance, accept this false propaganda and refer to the "independent priests" and the "independent parishes" as "National priests" and "National parishes."</p>
   <p>The truth is that those "independents" have nothing in common with Nationalism. On the contrary, they are detrimental to the interests of true Nationalism and to the Nationalist party. We repeat, they have no ideals, no patriotism, nor any other lofty aims. They are not struggling for the attainment of any ideal, because they do not understand such values; in most cases their limited mental resources make it impossible for them to grasp the meaning of idealism.</p>
   <p>In nearly all cases the "independent" religious movement is the result of either the quarrels and disputes with local priests or the activities of some professional <span class="page-break">\5</span>racketeers. Therefore, the press and the members of the lofty Nationalist Party must not remain silent when the name of Nationalism is being dragged into various quarrels and disputes, or when racketeers attempt to hide under its cloak.</p>
   <p>One can be an "independent" or a "dependent" according to choice; one may belong to one religious group or to the other; but it is not proper to connect Nationalism with such religious matters. Only the enemies of the Nationalist party desire to claim such connections.</p>
