   <p>A Lithuanian community center and hall for holding conventions, society meetings, mass meetings, lectures, etc., has been established at 3149 South Halsted Street by the Lithuanian Club. It will be available for use on and after September 18.</p>
   <p>The center will have three sections. The front section will house a Lithuanian-American library; the middle section will be used for meetings and conventions; in the rear, there is a room for committee meetings. Plans are being made to remodel the basement into a spacious hall for balls, etc.</p>
   <p>The building, in which the Lithuanian community center will be located, was purchased by the Lithuanian Club for seven thousand dollars. The convention hall and library room are very high and light. At night, the building is lighted with gas and electricity. Owing to the fact that the building was purchased by the Lithuanian Club, the permanency of the Lithuanian community center is assured. For the time being, the center will be in charge of Mr. B. Vaitiekunas.</p>
   
   <p>This community center fully fills all the needs of Lithuanian organizations. It will no longer be necessary for any Lithuanian society to depend upon the mercy of saloonkeepers for a meeting place. Likewise, it will no longer be necessary to conduct our lectures in a hall adjoining a saloon bar; nor will it be necessary to pass a bar or barrels of beer on entering a hall.</p>
   <p>As we all know, a saloonkeeper donates the free use of his hall to societies with a selfish end in view; that is, he expects the society members to form the habit of patronizing his saloon. In this way, the saloonkeepers unquestionably gain a large number of new patrons. Now that a Lithuanian community center has been established, it will not be necessary for our societies to hold their meetings in saloon halls.</p>
   <p>An important feature of the center will be the library. Lithuanians, who desire to acquire knowledge and advance themselves intellectually, can come to the library and read good books and newspapers. Already a number of Lithuanian organizations in Bridgeport have libraries, but they are located in saloon halls, and for that reason, are inaccessible to women and children. Furthermore, hardly anyone cares to seek intellectual advancement if, in order to do so, it is necessary to pass a saloon to get into a library room where confirmed addicts to the amber fluid disturb the peace.</p>
   <p>The library in the community center will be easily accessible to all Lithuanians of both sexes. Lithuanian newspapers as well as American newspapers are available. The library room and the hall are very beautifully decorated. Everyone is invited to use the library freely.</p>
   <p>The establishment of this community center marks another major step forward in the life of Chicago Lithuanians.</p>
