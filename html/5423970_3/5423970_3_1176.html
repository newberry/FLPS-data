   <p>The following is an appeal to the Lithuanian societies and Lithuanians in particular of Chicago by Reverend M. Kraucunas, John Ilgaudas, J. M. Tananevicius, Reverend K. Ambrozaitis, S. Marcinkevicius, and B. K. Balutis:</p>
   <p>July 15, 1910, will be a very important holiday for the Lithuanian people. On that day, it will be exactly five hundred years since the most formidable enemy of Lithuania, the Teutonic Knights of the Cross, was completely crushed by the Lithuanian army, under the leadership of Vytautas the Great, at the battle of Gruenwald (now known as Tannenberg, East Prussia). That battle caused a turning point in Lithuanian history. Therefore, it is our duty to appropriately commemorate that important event.</p>
   <p>On that day, July 15, 1910, all Lithuanians, regardless of religious, political, or dialectic differences, will unite under the able leadership of <span class="page-break">\2</span>Vytautas, in order to crush and forever eliminate the most powerful and dreadful enemy of the Fatherland. Therefore, on the five hundredth anniversary of that day, all Lithuanians of all different views should likewise get together and mark that important historical event. This holiday must be a purely national holiday, free from any and all factional tendencies. Every Lithuanian should observe that holiday, because it is of equal importance and significance to all factions.</p>
   <p>Realizing the full significance of that important holiday, the undersigned, who attended a meeting called by Reverend Kraucunas in his rectory (32nd Place and Auburn-Lituanica Avenue) on December 15, made the following decisions:</p>
   <p>Since the five hundredth anniversary is a purely national holiday, and since Lithuanians of all different views should participate in its commemoration, the undersigned have decided to appeal to all Chicago Lithuanian societies and clubs to elect two delegates each, and send them to a meeting which will be held on January 30 at St. George's parish hall, 32nd Place and Auburn <span class="page-break">\3</span>(now Lituanica) Avenue. The delegates will make all necessary arrangements and preparations for an appropriate and fitting observance of that great holiday. It is highly desirable that delegates be elected by every Lithuanian society or club in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It is true that the Poles, Russians, Tartars, and Czechs assisted the Lithuanians in that historical battle. However, the final and decisive thrust of the battle was made by the Lithuanian army. Credit for the victory is honestly given to the Lithuanian army in the annals of history.</p>
   <p>The Poles are also making plans to observe this holiday, and they have invited the Lithuanians to make a joint celebration. However, it has been decided not to join the Poles, because they always take undue advantage of our people for their own gain and glorification. The Poles unjustly claim for themselves the honor for the victory at the battle of Zalgiris (Gruenwald-Tannenberg). We will observe this holiday separately; our celebration will not be as boisterous as that of the Poles, but it will be more true to historical <span class="page-break">\4</span>facts.</p>
   <p>Since July 15 falls on Friday, and since Lithuanians are ordinary working people who cannot afford to take a day off from work, it has been decided to observe the holiday on Sunday, July 17, but on Friday the event will be celebrated with holy Masses in the Lithuanian churches. All Lithuanian societies and clubs are requested to refrain from planning picnics or any other affairs on July 17; that day must be left open so we can observe the holiday in a truly united fashion.</p>
   <p>We hope that all Lithuanians, as children of one mother, will assist in making adequate preparations for the proper observance of this national holiday. We should learn to great each other as Lithuanians, and not as people of opposing viewpoints. We can accomplish greater deeds and make greater progress only with the united effort of all Lithuanians.</p>
