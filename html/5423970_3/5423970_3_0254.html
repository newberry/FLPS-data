   <p>Last Tuesday evening, August 29, at a meeting held in Ausra Hall, 3001 South Halsted Street, the Chicago Lithuanian Nationalist and Catholic organizations decided to launch a united campaign to raise funds for the relief of war-stricken Lithuanians in Europe. There were thirty-six delegates of Chicago Lithuanian organizations at the meeting. It was unanimously decided to elect a permanent committee for immediate action.</p>
   <p>The meeting was conducted by Attorney F. P. Bradchulis in a very orderly and exemplary manner. Two troublemakers and obstructionists, who were present at the two previous meetings of this group, were absent on this occasion, and the business of the meeting progressed smoothly and harmoniously.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that there will be much work in connection with the campaign, it was decided to elect a large committee. The following were elected to the committee: Dr. A. J. Zimontas, chairman; Dr. K. Drangelis, B. K. Balutis, and John Dimsa, vice-presidents; Mr. Stankauskas and Mr. Kvietkauskas, secretaries; Mr. Kareiva, treasurer; Mr. Zalandauskas and Mr. Balandis, board of trustees, Mr. A. D. Kaulakis. Mr. Tamulevicius, Miss Karalius, Mr. Balnis. Mr. Pranikas. Mr. Dobilas, and Mr. Gaubas were elected to the committee as advisory members for the purpose of assisting the officers and to form various auxiliary committees, such as the collection committee, press committee, arrangements committee, etc.</p>
   <p>It was decided at the meeting that the treasurer of the committee must not keep too large a sum of money in his possession; every week, or at least every two weeks, he must deposit all the money in his possession in the First National Bank of Chicago. Previous to this decision, an effort was made to select one of the Lithuanian banks in which to deposit the money of the committee. However, it was argued that if one Lithuanian banker were favored then all other Lithuanian bankers would feel insulted. Therefore, in order to avoid bad feeling among our own bankers. it was decided to select the above-mentioned bank, which is one of the largest in Chicago. The treasurer was placed under a bond of one thousand dollars (a larger bond is not necessary because he will not keep the money in his possession).</p>
   <p>Discussions took place at the meeting regarding preparations for the coming Lithuanian Day. Dr. Drangelis reported that news has been received from Washington, that President Wilson has officially designated November 1 (All Saints' Day) as Lithuanian Day. On that date public collections will be made all over the United States for the relief of the war-stricken Lithuanians in Europe. The officers of the elected committee were empowered by the delegates at the meeting to make adequate preparations for the observance of Lithuanian Day in Chicago.</p>
   <p>It was decided that the delegates of the various Chicago Lithuanian Nationalist and Catholic organizations are to meet once every two weeks, but the officers and committees are to meet at least once every week.</p>
   
   <p>After the regular meeting adjourned, all the newly elected officers held a meeting and decided to gather next Tuesday evening in Ausra Hall to make plans for action.</p>
   <p>Before the close of the main meeting, an article that recently appeared in the Naujienos (News) was read. The article is a protest against the exclusion of Socialists from the united front. Some delegates opposed the reading of the article on the ground that it would be giving undeserved honor and recognition to the Socialists. After the article was read, the delegates laughed at the slanderous phrases of the article and decided to ignore it completely. One member said "Let them bark, and let us go on with our work......"</p>
   <p>After the meeting, the delegates appeared to be very happy over the fact that a united front had finally been established between the Nationalists and Catholics for the benefit of the war-stricken Lithuanians in Europe.</p>
