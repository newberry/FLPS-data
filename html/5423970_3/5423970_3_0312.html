   <p>Among us Chicagoans has lived and still lives a young, brilliant, industrious man, the father of a family. His name is Bruno Vargsas [Laucevicius]. He is now lying on his deathbed. His family has become destitute because of his long illness. All his savings were exhausted a long time ago. He was assisted by his intimate friends, but they have grown tired [of contributing].</p>
   <p>Permit me to appeal to you, honorable Lithuanians, for your sympathy. Those who can spare some money may kindly send it to the editorial office of Lietuva, 3252 South Halsted Street, Chicago, Illinois. All donations will be handed over to Bruno Vargsas.</p>
