   <p>The Chicago Naujienos (News) presented a very ingenious question to the Lithuanian-American Nationalist press. The Naujienos claims that it does not understand the meaning of such a "mystic" phrase as "common interests of the various Lithuanian-American factions," and asks for an explanation. The question would not be amazing if it had been presented without the limitation which the Naujienos imposed upon it. The question is restricted by the following statement: "We are not asking the Nationalists to cross the ocean and go to far-off Lithuania to seek common national interests, but to explain what common national interests exist here in America among the various Lithuanian American factions."</p>
   <p>This question of the Naujienos is illogical in that it separates one section of Lithuanians (the Lithuanian-Americans) from all other Lithuanians of the <span class="page-break">\2</span>world and demands to be shown what common national interests exist only within this one section of the Lithuanian nation. Common national interests equally affect the Lithuanians in America and the Lithuanians in Lithuania; we can decide what interests are common and what interests are not common only by comparing the interests of the Lithuanians in Lithuania with the interests of those in America. Without such a comparison we cannot even talk of any common national interests. The question, as it is presented by the Naujienos, is equivalent to a demand to point out the common interests between two brothers by considering the interests only of one brother and without comparing them with the interests of the other. Everyone would say that such a demand is absurd. Nevertheless, the Naujienos is making exactly the same kind of a demand. The question, as it is raised by the Naujienos, is really "mystic."</p>
   <p>Probably what the Naujienos meant to ask is what kind of common interests exist among Lithuanian-Americans of various callings and occupations. This appears to be suggested in part by the limitation which the Naujienos placed on the question. In other words, the Naujienos wants to know what common interests <span class="page-break">\3</span>exist among the various classes of Lithuanian-Americans, but the question was improperly presented. If our guess is correct, it should not be difficult to answer the question.</p>
   <p>There are very many common interests among Lithuanian-Americans. The first common interest is our language. Because it is published in the Lithuanian language the Naujienos has a common tie with all other Lithuanian publications, regardless of aims, policies, or character; for the same reason, the Naujienos is distinguished from all non-Lithuanian publications, even from those that advocate the same ideals as the Naujienos. The Lithuanian language is a common tie between all Lithuanian-Americans, regardless of religious beliefs or political affiliations, and distinguishes them from all non-Lithuanian people. The Lithuanian language places all Lithuanian-Americans into one separate and distinct group. There would not be a Naujienos if there were not in existence a group of people who are divided by various convictions and vocations but bound together by a native Lithuanian language. However, the language may be put aside and considered to be outside the pale of "interests."</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Let us now consider the problems of immigration. People of various nationalities concern themselves with the welfare of the immigrants of their respective nationalities. The Poles aid Polish immigrants, the Jews aid Jewish immigrants, and other nationalities aid their immigrants. Businessmen are just as concerned with immigration as are ordinary workers. If for no other reason, at least the feelings of brotherly love and humanitarianism urge those who came here earlier and have already established themselves to aid their brothers and sisters who arrive in the United States at a later time. Other nationalities are not concerned with the welfare of Lithuanian immigrants; for that reason we ourselves must be concerned with immigrants of our own nationality. In this connection it should be mentioned that immigrants of other nationalities are being aided in an organized and effective manner, while Lithuanian immigrants are almost completely neglected. It is very sad to note that Lithuanian-Americans are so very far behind other nationalities in immigrant welfare work. The problem of immigration is of utmost importance and is of common interest to all Lithuanian-Americans.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>Furthermore, according to the statistics of the United States Department of Immigration, nearly one half of the Lithuanians who emigrate to America cannot read and write. It is, therefore, our common duty to carry on educational work among these immigrants. We must not, of course, attempt to impress the immigrants with the false notion that the Socialists are educators, and that all other factions are composed of ignorant and contemptible people. We should limit our common educational activities among Lithuanian immigrants to the teaching of rudimentary educational subjects, such as the alphabet, reading and writing, important American laws, American customs and living conditions, etc. Lithuanian immigrants can be successfully approached only by those who know the Lithuanian language, understand the character of Lithuanians, and are well acquainted with America. In other words, this can be done only by Lithuanian-Americans who are well acquainted with this country and are more or less educated.</p>
   <p>Now let us consider the problem of mutual aid. There are many kinds of American fraternal and mutual-aid societies. However, very few Lithuanians join such societies because they are not sufficiently acquainted with the English language and would feel very strange in such societies. Lithuanian-Americans, therefore, <span class="page-break">\6</span>are forced to form their own mutual-aid societies, in which they can talk to each other in a language they all understand and in which there are no Americans to insult them by calling them "foreigners". Lithuanian-Americans look upon the insurance companies with suspicion, because they are often cheated by dishonest insurance agents. In times of need, because of their inability to speak and understand the English language, Lithuanian policyholders experience great difficulty when dealing with the insurance companies or American fraternal societies. This miserable situation further encourages Lithuanian-Americans to form mutual-aid societies of their own. Therefore, the problem of mutual aid is of common interest to all Lithuanian-Americans. All classes of people--unskilled laborers, skilled workers, merchants, and people of various professions--belong to Lithuanian-American mutual-aid societies.</p>
   <p>Immigrants in the United States usually settle down in so-called colonies; that is, people of the same nationality live in a group in the same locality. Lithuanians, for example, live in one section of the city, Poles in another section, <span class="page-break">\7</span>Germans in still another section, etc. By comparing the colonies of various nationalities, at least from the standpoint of health and hygiene, we find that the Lithuanians are living in a less favorable district than, let us say, the Germans. The Lithuanian merchants, unskilled laborers, skilled workers, and various professional people all live together in the same locality and are thus equally affected by the conditions of the locality. It is necessary to make various improvements in the locality in which we live. That is of common interest to all the imhabitants of the locality. Of course, all towns and cities have health departments, but they cannot accomplish much in the districts inhabited by the foreign born on account of the difference in language; no health program can be successfully promoted in such districts without the aid of the doctors of the nationalities represented in them. It is of common common interest to all Lithuanian-Americans to improve the health conditions in the districts in which they live.</p>
   <p>Another matter of common interest to all Lithuanain-Americans is the field of politics. Every intelligent person who has closely followed so-called local <span class="page-break">\8</span>politics has learned, in spite of all claims to the contrary, that all political activities in the United States have their roots in, and are intimately connected with, the various national groups. People of one nationality usually control and dominate all the govermental and political machinery. As a general rule, it may be said that the various sections of the United States are controlled and dominated by Irish, Anglo-Saxons, and Germans. Members of these nationalities invariably look upon the people of all other nationalities with contempt; when a Lithuanian or a Slav goes to a governmental institution or to any other public establishment he is shunned and snubbed. When a complaint is made to the police or to any other department of the government, and if the complaint concerns a district populated by one of the hated nationalities, it receives very little attention. But when a complaint is made by any member of the nationality that is in power, it receives full and even enthusiastic attention. Such matters appear to be trivial to the average person, but those who have had actual experience with such "trivialities" regard them as of great significance. One of the best ways to free ourselves from this humiliating position is to form a powerful Lithuanian-American political force. This matter is of equal interest to all Lithuanian-Americans. It is <span class="page-break">\9</span>to the interest of the unskilled Lithuanian worker, the skilled worker, the merchant, and the professional to free ourselves from the humiliating position just discussed.</p>
   <p>Let us now consider the problem of employment. An overwhelming majority of Lithuanian-Americans are common laborers, engaged in the lowest-paid, most arduous, and most dangerous occupations. It is highly desirable, and it is the duty of Lithuanian-American leaders, to assist our people to learn trades, to become skilled workers, and to attain a higher standard of living. This matter also affects our business and professional people, because when the prosperity of the masses increases, the prosperity of the business and professional people simultaneously increases.</p>
   <p>These, then, are the common interests that exist among the Lithuanian-Americans. There are many more such interests. However, the few that have been shown here should be sufficient to prove that there really are common interests among the various Lithuanian-American factions. It is highly regrettable that instead of <span class="page-break">\10</span>focusing their attention upon these vital common interests, the minds of many Lithuanian-Americans are occupied with the Utopian aspirations of the Socialists; they are expending their valuable time and energy in non-Lithuanian and often scandalous activities.</p>
   <p>Yes, we have very many common interests. However, in order to promote these interests, we must first shift our attention from the heavens above us and focus it on the practical things of life.</p>
