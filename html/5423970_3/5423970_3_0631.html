   <p>Lithuanians in Chicago began to show with their activity. Up to this time we used to say that the Lithuanians know only the stockyards. Now we see a few Lithuanians holding city jobs. This is very good, shows that we Lithuanians are just as good as other nationalities.</p>
   <p>We Lithuanians have a political club in Chicago. This club urges Lithuanians to become citizens. When all Lithuanians are citizens then all of us as a mass of people can go to vote, demand official jobs, etc.</p>
