   <p>Today the Lithuanian Democratic League of Cook County is officially recognized by the Democratic Central Committee of Cook County as the only representative Lithuanian organization. This has often been demonstrated, too.</p>
   <p>Probably the most important recognition given this organization was the placement of our able Lithuanian Attorney, John Zuris, on the regular Democratic judicial ticket. Another is the fact that before this organization was brought about the Lithuanian people had very few precinct capitains and received fewer political appointments. Today there are over fifteen precinct captains in various parts of the city and over fifty job holders. There is no doubt that the possibilities of this organization are unlimited, and the Lithuanian people can look forward to having elective positions in the near future.</p>

   <p>Our Lithuanian Democratic leaders and organizations are to be complimented on the fine showing they have displayed in getting results in their respective ward organizations on numerous occaions. Individuals such as Dr. J. Poska, John Damkus, C. Kaivis, Joseph Kaminskas, M.Povilionis, Paul Saliner, Jack Juozaitis, Joe Lenkart, Tony Vish, Joseph Pentis, Victor Balanda and Theodore S.Thurston are a credit to our people in their sincere efforts at securing Lithuanian recognition in the political world.</p>
   <p>With less than ten days of actual campaigning left, I wish to call your attention to a duty every American citizen owes this country. Your privileges to vote on November 3rd is indeed an important one. First, the Lithuanian people have an opportunity to elect one of their own, John T.Zuris, Democratic candidate for Judge, by voting the small Democratic Judicial ballot straight. Secondly, we must all vote for the greatest President that ever sat in the White House, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the entire Democratic ticket. This I am sure we will all do, knowing that by the re-election of President Roosevelt our homes <span class="page-break">\3</span>will be safe, our money in the banks secure, the poor will be clothed and fed, this country kept out of war and see the practical projects, of mutual benefit to all of us, now under construction finished.</p>
