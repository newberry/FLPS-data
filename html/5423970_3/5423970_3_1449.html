   <p>The term "renegade" is usually applied to a person who was closely associated with, but broke away and separated himself from, an organized group of individuals who believe in and foster the same ideals.</p>
   <p>Dr. A. K. Rutkauskas, who is now one of the pillars of the Clericals, still continues to apply the term "renegade" to every person who disagrees with his own ideas. Has he a moral right to do so? He was formerly an extreme leftist and also a very ardent Freethinker. Later, he severed his connections with these groups and allied himself with the middle (Nationalist) faction. Finally, he broke away from the Nationalists and joined the Clerical faction, among whom he is now probably the strongest pillar.</p>
   <p>From his past history the conclusion may be drawn that Dr. Rutkauskas is the greatest renegade that Lithuanian-Americans have ever seen in their midst. He <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>may be called a champion of the renegades. Nevertheless, Dr. Rutkauskas is endeavoring to label others with the term "renegade", which fits him better than anyone else.</p>
