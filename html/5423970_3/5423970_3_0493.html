   <p>All aliens are in grave danger of losing all their rights in this country. A number of anti-alien bills have been introduced in Congress. These bills are being advanced under the pretext of forcing all aliens to become American citizens. However, a detailed examination of the various provisions of the bills indicates very clearly that their purpose is not to make citizens out of aliens, but to put them in chains so the capitalists may be able to exploit them better. It is a well-known fact that the majority of workers in our basic industries are aliens. For that reason the money barons of the nation are very anxious to make helpless obedient slaves out of all aliens.</p>
   <p>If the famous Oswell Bill would be passed, then every alien in the country would be forced to register every year. His rights would be narrowed so <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>much that he would not be able to move freely from one part of the country to another. He would be subjected to police persecution everywhere and at all times. The police would have the power to arrest and jail him any time and everywhere and detain him indefinitely for investigation and possible deportation.</p>
   <p>Another vicious anti-alien bill is the McClintic Bill, which is known as an "out-and-out" deportation bill. According to the provisions of this bill, every alien who has lived in this country for over five years, must declare his intention to become a citizen within six months after this bill is passed or else be deported to the country from which he came.</p>
   <p>Comrade Jay Lovestone said that the McClintic Bill would be an excellent tool for strike-breaking. The bill gives the department of labor unlimited <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>power to persecute the workers. It would transform the Federal Department of Labor into a strike-breaking agency.</p>
   <p>Comrade Lovestone also explained how Judge C.D. Orr, in Pittsburgh, Pa., in 1922, refused to grant citizenship papers to applicants who were out on strike. The judge said, "Return to work, and then you shall receive your citizenship papers."</p>
   <p>If the McClintic Bill becomes a law, then those aliens who are out on strike would have only two alternatives: either become strike breakers or be deported.</p>
   <p>It is very obvious that those gentlemen who are sponsoring the anti-alien bills are not doing so merely to make citizens out of aliens. They are primarily interested in narrowing the rights of alien workers in order <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>to make them helpless in working-class struggles. And since there are so many aliens employed in our basic industries, the anti-alien laws would enable the industrial barons to make strike-breakers out of alien workers with the threat of deportation.</p>
