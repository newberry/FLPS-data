   <p>The 27th Convention of the Lithuanian Alliance of America began on June 3 and ended last Friday night...</p>
   <p>The most important work of the Convention was the discussion and, finally, the acceptance of a new constitution.</p>
   <p>The constitution, with several changes, was finally accepted and ratified...The new constitution will become effective beginning January, 1913.</p>
   <p>The second most important task of this convention--probably the most important of all, excepting the task of writing the constitution--was the inauguration of a benefit class in the Lithuanian Alliance of America.... The benefit class will become effective on July 1 of this year.</p>

   <p>Great changes were made with the organ of the Lithuanian Alliance of America: first of all, separate charges to members for the organ were voided. It was decided that each member pay fifteen cents each month for all of the Alliance's business and that the organ will be received without charge. In this manner the payments are reduced by two cents and everyone will receive the organ each week....[Translator's note:--The "organ" referred to is the newspaper, Tevyne, which is published by the Alliance.]</p>
