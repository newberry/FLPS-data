   <p>The Cicero Lithuanian Societies Alliance sponsored a program of speeches and recitations last Saturday.</p>
   <p>The program was opened by M. Gabraitis. There were five speakers: Dr. K. Drangelis, J. Kristisonas, B. K. Balutis, F. P. Bradchulis, and F. Strielciunas. Several girls rendered recitations. The purpose of the affair was to raise funds for Lithuania.....A total of $18.25 was collected. With previous contributions, the total in the treasury is now $30. These donations will be sent to Mr. T. Paukstis, treasurer of the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund. Despite the bad weather, many people were present.</p>
   <p>The Cicero Lithuanians, it is said, are not satisfied with the total collected thus far and are determined to speed up the collections.</p>
