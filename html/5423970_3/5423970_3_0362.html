   <p>p. 4.... The Lithuanian Educational Society of Burnside, Ill., held a public gathering Dec. 19 for the purpose of raising funds for the relief of war refugees in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. Glebauskas addressed the audience and appealed for contributions to the Lithuanian Assistance Fund.</p>
   <p>There was a disagreement among the people as to which relief fund the contributions should go. There are three different relief funds set up by three conflicting groups: The Lithuanian Assistance Fund,by Nationalists; the National Fund, by Catholics; and the Lithuanian Relief Fund, by Socialists. The question was settled by a vote of the audience. Nineteen votes were cast for the Lithuanian Assistance Fund and ninety-six votes for the Lithuanian Relief Fund.</p>
