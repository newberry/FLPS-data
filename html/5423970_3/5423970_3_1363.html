   <p>It is desirable that delegates come to Chicago on May 27th before noon, because on that afternoon, at three o'clock, a grand parade will be held. The local Lithuanian societies and the Lithuanian Alliance of America branches will march from Morgan street to State street to the hall, where there will be lectures, songs, declamations, music, etc. Therefore, the delegates from eastern states are asked to notify us when they are coming and what speeches they will deliver, so that their names can be put on the program.</p>
