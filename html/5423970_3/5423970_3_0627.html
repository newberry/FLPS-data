   <p>It would be a great benefit to the Lithuanians to take out their first papers, and after two years they can get second papers and become citizens.</p>
   <p>There are over 6,000 Lithuanians in Chicago, 3000 of them would be voters if they had taken out citizen papers. Three thousand votes means a lot; we could elect our own people to the offices of city and county.</p>
   <p>When you Lithuanians are applying for citizen papers, do not say that you are from Poland, Russia or Prussia, say that you are from Lithuania. Of course, the clerk does not know that there is such a nation as Lithuania, you must insist that the clerk mark that you are from Lithuania. Do not be ashamed to call yourself a Lithuanian. The government wants to know of what nationality the people are.</p>
