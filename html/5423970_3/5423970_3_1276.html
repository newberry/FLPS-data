   <p>To the Public: The results of the Lithuanian convention in Brooklyn are known, by now, to the Lithuanian public. The convention was called in order to assemble the Lithuanians of all factions so that they would be able to work together.</p>
   <p>Our motherland, having fallen into misfortune, is demanding the united support of all her children. The people who suggested a convention and the voice of the people speaking through our newspapers demanded a general and nonpartisan convention. They demanded that, at least at this [critical] moment, our various parties forget their partisanship, that they leave their political issues at home and attend the convention with clean hands and a purely Lithuanian conscience. It was desired that there be no factions at the convention, but that everyone consider himself primarily a Lithuanian and leave his party label at home.</p>
   
   <p>Unfortunately, it happened otherwise. Our Socialists turned a nonpartisan convention into a partisan one. They turned the Lithuanian-American convention into a Socialist convention. To attain this end they used pre-convention conferences and other politician's tricks with which they are familiar.</p>
   <p>The undesirable results were soon apparent. It was apparent at the convention, and later publicly confirmed, that the Socialists wanted to put the Lithuanian Assistance Fund under the control of their party. They were successful: today all the officers of the fund and the fund itself are under Socialist control.</p>
   <p>Despite the fact that this fund is under the wing of the Socialists and controlled entirely by them, the Socialists are attempting to convince the public, through their newspapers, that this fund is a public fund.</p>
   
   <p>We, the undersigned, are compelled to inform the public that this is not so. We clearly state that the Lithuanian Assistance Fund is not a fund of all the people. We openly and publicly state, for the information of the public, that the present Lithuanian Assistance Fund is under the protection and control of the Socialists alone. And only the Socialists are to be held responsible for this fund.</p>
   <p>Having had experience with the Socialists in the past, we, the Nationalists, refuse to be responsible to the public for the donations which are controlled only by the Socialists. One can understand from this that we cannot guarantee and will not guarantee the manner in which these donations of the people will be utilized.</p>
   <p>We, the committee elected by the convention of Nationalists, hereby announce that we are responsible only for the donations which are sent to the Lithuanian Relief Fund, in care of its treasurer, Mr. Thomas Paukstis of Pittston, Penn sylvania. We can guarantee that these donations will be used according to the wishes of the donors for the welfare of Lithuania.</p>
   
   <p>Lithuanians who desire to aid war sufferers in Lithuania, who desire a better and brighter political future for the motherland, send your donations to the treasurer of the Lithuanian Relief Fund in the following manner: Make out checks and money orders to T. Paukstis, Pittston, Pennsylvania. Send the check or money order, with the donor's name, to the financial secretary, J. O. Sirvydas, 120 Grand Street, Brooklyn, New York.</p>
   <p>The donations received through T. Paukstis will be announced in the newspapers.</p>
   <p>The Committee Elected by the Nationalists' Convention in Brooklyn: Dr. John Sliupas, Scranton, Pa.; J. O. Sirvydas, Brooklyn; Thomas Paukstis, Pittston, Pa.; Dr. K. Drangelis, Chicago; K. R. Karuza, Philadelphia, Pa.; V. P. Jankauskas, Brooklyn.</p>
