   <p>The disagreement between the Roseland parishioners and their priest, appears to have come to an end. When the delegates came back from the archbishop, they announced that the parishioners cannot control their priest. Just the same, the parishioners have had their revenge upon their priest. When the priest went with his Christmas collection, he met many unfavorable rebuffs. In many places, the doors were closed on him.</p>
   <p>The parishioners have elected a committee to buy a lot. The question is what will they build. Some of them want to build an independent church, while others want to build a hall for theaters and concerts. If they build such a hall, they will have accomplished a very important project. In this vicinity, we need such a hall very much.</p>
