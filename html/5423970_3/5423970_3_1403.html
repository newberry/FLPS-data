   <p>St. George Parish records contained interesting writings about the first Chicago Lithuanians and their efforts to organize a Lithuanian parish.</p>
   <p>The first Lithuanian parish in Chicago was begun in 1884, because from that time on Lithuanians began coming to Chicago, and at the same time the first St. George Society was organized. As at that time there were a few Lithuanians and in a short time the few that were there had left for other cities, the society couldn't exist and dispersed.</p>
   <p>Further, the writer says that in 1886 more Lithuanians began coming to Chicago. Then the Lithuanians who had remained began thinking of getting a Lithuanian priest. As these Lithuanians saw that they couldn't maintain a priest, on October 24, 1886, they determined to call a Lithuanian meeting at Dr. Kossakauskas' drug store, at 668 Noble Street for the purpose of organizing a Lithuanian society. There were twelve Lithuanians at the meeting and they organized the St. Casimir Prince Society. On November 7, 1886 another meeting was held and twenty-three more Lithuanians joined. About Easter time of the following year, 1887, the St. Casimir Society invited Rev.</p>
   
   <p>Cizauskas from South Bend, Ind. This Lithuanian priest was received by the Polish priest W. Barzynski of the St. Theresa Parish. For the first time in the Polish church Rev. Cizauskas listened to the confessions of the Lithuanians from Chicago and suburbs in their native tongue. Then he delivered a Lithuanian sermon, inviting the people to join the society, saying that in a short time they would be able to have their one Lithuanian Parish, church and priest.</p>
   <p>For six years the St. Casimir Society grew and became stronger. Each year the society invited the priest at Easter, and sometimes he was invited twice. As the society began to grow the members began to think of organizing a parish and having their own priest.</p>
   <p>In the beginning of 1892 Rev. Cizauskas was convinced that there were more Lithuanians in Bridgeport at the Polish Parish of St. Mary School and began to organize a Lithuanian parish and collected money for the purpose. On March 2, 1892 Rev. George Kolesinskis arrived. He was the first regular Chicago Lithuanian priest, and from that time began the real life of the Lithuanian parish. The parish was named after St. George.</p>
   
   <p>Before the arrival of Rev. G. Kolesinskis, the newly-organized Lithuanian parish committee had found a place for the church at 33rd. Street and Ambrose Avenue. In 1892 they bought eight lots for $4,800.00 at this place. An old wooden church was bought from the German Catholics for $1,100.00 and it was moved to the lots which they bought. Later four more lots were bought for $2,850.</p>
   <p>Rev. G. Kolesinskis stayed in Chicago until the fall of the year 1893. Temporarily, the Bohemian priest from 18th Street took his place.</p>
   <p>The second Chicago Lithuanian priest was Rev. M. Kriauciunas who had long worked in the St. George Parish. He became the priest on January 28, 1894. From the very beginning Rev. M. Kriauciunas ardently carried on his work. He began thinking of changing the church both on the inside and outside. In the basement of the church he organized a Lithuanian school, the first teacher of which was Stanly Daugelevicius, who is still living and has a milk business. The first organist was Alexander Popkevicius.</p>
   <p>On March 31, 1895 a parish meeting was held and it was decided to build a brick rectory. The parish then had hardly any debts; so the entire meeting in which there were about 700 people, unanimously agreed to the plan. They decided that the cost would be from seven toeight thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>The building of the rectory began that same year in the month of May.</p>
   <p>In the spring of 1896 Rev. Kriauciunas was given an assistant the Rev. E. Steponavicius.</p>
   <p>Since the number of Lithuanians in Chicago grew, they decided that the wooden church was too small; so they planned to build a new brick church. In the fall of 1896 the foundation of this church was laid. There wasn't enough money to finish the church, and they didn't want to take out a mortgage. About half was built, then the work stopped. A temporary roof was put on and for ten years sermons were held in the unfinished church. The old wooden church was used as a school.</p>
   <p>Between 1900 and 1901 the brick church was finished in new style.</p>
   <p>The next thing for the St. George Parish to do was to establish a suitable school. On August 3, 1902, three lots were bought for the school.</p>
   
   <p>The building of the school started in 1907, and the work was finished the next year, 1908. The school was built in accordance with the requirements of the city, as to health, safety and style. This was the nicest and largest Lithuanian school. It had sixteen rooms, and a large hall which seated about 1,000 people. The sisters here taught at the St. George Parish since 1897.</p>
   <p>In 1918 Michael Leon Krusas was appointed priest for the St. George Parish.</p>
   <p>In the spring of 1924 Archbishop Mundelin of Chicago returned from Rome with the title of Cardinal and with a gift for Rev.M.L.Krusas, pastor of St. George Church, - the title of Monsignor.</p>
   <p>The parish maintains a school which has about 600 pupils. Fourteen sisters are the teachers. There are about 2,000 parishioners. Also, they have a church choir with about seventy members, and the St. George Parish's School Orchestra, whose leader, Anthony S. Rocius is a composer and an organist.</p>
