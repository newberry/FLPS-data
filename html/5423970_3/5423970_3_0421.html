   <p>The Lithuanian Alliance of America, branch 36, held a meeting, January 24th, at Azukas Hall, at which the living conditions of the writer Andrius Vistalis, in an insane asylum in Argentine, were discussed.</p>
   <p>The right thing to do would be to elect a committee to devise means of bringing Mr. Vistalis home from this asylum. As we have seen from his letters, his treatment at the asylum is very brutal. We, the Lithuanian patriots, ought to consider means of helping our writer and freeing him from the institution. We could help him by appealing to the Lithuanian public for contributions, or the Lithuanian Alliance of America can give to that cause.</p>
   <p>We believe that the public will take the Vistalis matter under consideration. The immigration laws of the United States do not-permit a person over 60 years of age to come to this country to make his residence. The Lithuanian Alliance of America could guarantee the United States Government that the Lithuanian Alliance would be responsible for his upkeep during his life, that he would be no burden to the United States Government. Then the United States Government would permit him to come to this country.</p>
   <p>(Translator's note: Mr. Andrew Vistalis was a well-known Lithuanian writer. When he went to Argentine he had money. He bought there three hectares of land and still had $2,000 left. It was not known for what cause he was arrested, sent to the insane asylum and his money and property confiscated. He appealed to the Lithuanians in North America for help. The Lithuanian public contributed money, but when it was sent to him, the authorities of the insane asylum in Argentine did not give it to him. From his letters we found that the asylum's authorities used to give him a small piece of stale bread and a glass of dirty water, once in 24 hours. While he was in the insane asylum as an insane, he contributed a few articles and poems to Lietuva. The articles and the poems do not seem to be the writings of an insane person. It looks as if he were locked up in the insane asylum for being a freethinker. The Catholic authorities in Argentine kept him in the insane asylum, starved him there and at last he became insane).</p>
