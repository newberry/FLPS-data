   <p>For a long time the Lithuanians have slumbered here; there are forty families and about two hundred single persons, but up to the present time they have shown nothing good. There is a society, the Holy Cross, but it hardly exists.</p>
   <p>Through the efforts of Mr. Steve Marcunas, the lectures were arranged. There were two speakers, Mr. V. Pukas spoke on how the ancient Lithuanians united for their own protection; Mr. John Jankauskas spoke about the Lithuanian Alliance of America. He spoke of the benefit of such a large organization and what can be accomplished by having a large and strong organization. After the speeches, the local branch of the Lithuanian Alliance of America was organized, nine new members joining it.</p>
   <p>It is our duty as Lithuanians to belong to such an organization and educate ourselves by reading scientific books and newspapers.</p>
