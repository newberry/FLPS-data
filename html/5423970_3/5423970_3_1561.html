   <p>There were commemorations of the Battle of Gruenwald, July 17, in Bridgeport, Town of Lake and, it seems, the North Side of Chicago.</p>
   <p>In Bridgeport the celebration was in the Mark White Square Park. Only three societies participated in the marching. The speeches were made, not in the hall, but outside. The speeches were hindered by a very strong wind, so much that one could benefit very little from the speeches since not much of them was audible. The speakers were the Reverend M. Krauciunas, Mr. Satkus, Mr. Mazeika, Reverend Skrypko, Reverend Stepanavicia, and others. The St. George Parish Choir sang and a band played.</p>
   <p>There was a dance in the St. George's Hall in the evening.</p>
   <p>In Town of Lake, the Reverend Skripka's parish, the anniversary celebration <span class="page-break">2</span>of the Battle of Gruenwald, at the Columbus Hall, was very poor and, it can be said, fell apart. Disagreements arose with Reverend Krauciunas of Bridgeport before the celebration. All of the nationalistic societies withdrew from the Krauciunas partisans and joined nine other societies from Town of Lake to hold a separate commemoration. The Commemoration Committee elected in Town of Lake arranged a celebration program along these lines: the Youth Circle was to sing the national anthem and was to be followed by a speech by Keistutis Sliupas, a declamation by Miss Berzinskiute, etc. Finally the church choir was to sing and the Reverend Skripka was to speak. Skripka, seeing that the church choir was not to sing first and that the priest himself was put in the last place on the program, while K. Sliupas was in the first, decided to destroy the program. He called his servants and instructed them to print another program, from which K. Sliupas was omitted, the church choir put in first place, immediately followed by himself.</p>
   <p>When all had entered the Hall, Mr. Jankauskas, a member of the Committee, <span class="page-break">3</span>announced, in opening the program, that two programs were in existence and that he intended to blend the two so both would be whole. Therefore he asked if the audience wished to have both choruses sing "Lithuania, Our Motherland." All those assembled in the Hall shouted that they did. The Youth Circle moved to go on the stage but the Reverend Skripka, observing that only the Youth Circle was moving up and that the church choir was not, instructed four men not to allow them on the stage. Jankauskas, not wishing to have the police benefit from the pockets of Lithuanians (for a fight could easily have resulted), gave what might be called the Lithuanian Knights the victory and announced from the stage that the Reverend Skripka would replace the singing with a speech. Then all of the other speakers and reciters resigned. In his speech the Reverend Skripka pointed out that the Knights wished no harm for the Lithuanians but only craved to instill in them, the pagans, the true, Catholic religion of Jesus Christ. When the Reverend Skripka finished his speech, nothing else took place.</p>

   <p>The Town of Lake societies spent about $400 for the commemoration and for that sum of money only heard one of the Reverend Skripka's daily sermons, in which the Order of the Knights was even praised. This, then, was the kind of commemoration in Town of Lake.</p>
