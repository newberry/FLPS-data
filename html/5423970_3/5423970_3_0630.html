   <p>Dearest of all things to us Lithuanians is our own language, because our language is the most beautiful. Our ancestors fought, shed their blood, lay down their lives in order to save their language and the independence of their country.</p>
   <p>Many Lithuanians here in Chicago don't care to speak Lithuanian language, they willingly are speaking the Russian, or the Polish language. No matter where you go, you will hear Lithuanians speaking broken Polish. This is a disgrace to all such Lithuanians. They disregard their own mother language and mother country.</p>
   <p>We were oppressed by the Russian government in Lithuania, we were forced to use the Russian language. But in this free country of America nobody prosecutes us for speaking our own language, and to read newspapers and books in the Lithuanian language.</p>
   <p>We must remember our brave ancestors and other great men, they struggled and worked for the benefit of our language and country.</p>
