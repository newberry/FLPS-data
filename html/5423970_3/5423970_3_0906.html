   <p>The subject of this lecture was, "Woman and her Place in Society." This lecture was delivered by Joseph Laukis. The lecturer devoted much time to preparing the lecture. It was very interesting, constructive and educational.</p>
   <p>We are very glad that the Aurora Society chooses such lecturers. It is the duty of every Lithuanian to attend these lectures. Those who have attended have learned much.</p>
   <p>There are many enlightened Lithuanians who could deliver lectures. We have many books, especially in English that they could read and use to prepare lectures. Young Lithuanians do not waste your time! Educate yourselves and give education to others! Those who feel that they cannot deliver lectures but have some education, come to the lectures of the Aurora Society. You will learn how to deliver lectures.</p>
