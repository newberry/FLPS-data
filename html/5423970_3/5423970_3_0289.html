   <p>Of all the Lithuanian colonies in Chicago, the West Side Lithuanian colony stands as an example when it comes to participating in public affairs.</p>
   <p>Now again, the West Side Lithuanians are an example to other Chicago Lithuanian colonies, except the Englewood Lithuanians, who are well known for their good work.</p>
   <p>One of the West Side Lithuanian societies--the Farmers of Lithuania--has decided to organize all Lithuanian societies of the West Side into one unit, for the purpose of collecting a larger amount of money for the people who have suffered from the war in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>"We waited and waited for someone to organize us," said one West Sider, "until we realized that the waiting was in vain, so we organized ourselves."</p>
   <p>Up to the present time, fourteen societies have joined this organization, and we hope that the remaining societies will join too. All societies, such as nationalistic, church, and socialistic have joined this organization.</p>
   <p>All these societies together will have affairs and regular collections of money.</p>
   <p>To make a good start, they have decided to have lectures for that purpose at M. Meldazis Hall, on February 18, in the evening. Admission is free and there will be good speakers.</p>
   <p>Much success for the West Side Lithuanians.</p>
