   <p>The Aurora [Society] received from Mr. Sernas many books, written by him. Some of them have been sold, and the money give to the student fund. Many of these books have not been sold; they do not benefit the Aurora, nor the Lithuanian public. The Aurora Society has decided therefore to sell these books at lower prices. A geography book, priced at $3.00, will sell for $2.00; a book on hygiene, price, $1.00, will sell for 35 cents, etc. These books must be distributed among Lithuanians that they may read and learn.</p>
