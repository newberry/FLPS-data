   <p>The delegates of some of the societies were late and presented their credentials after the meeting had already been opened.</p>
   <p>The elected officers of the conference took their places. Chairman Petraitis read the agenda, which was unanimously accepted without change. The agenda follows:</p>
   <a name="p11" class="page-break">11</a>
   <p>(1) Participation in a general political convention of Lithuanian-Americans;</p>
   <p>(2) Financial and political aid to Lithuania;</p>
   <p>(3) Local problems.</p>
   <p>The first subject on the agenda, participation in the political convention of Lithuanian-Americans, which is being called in New York on October 1, 2 and 3, was put up for discussion.</p>
   <p>Demijonaitis moved that, since the majority of the newspapers and four of our largest organizations--the Lithuanian Alliance of America, the Lithuanian Socialist Alliance, the Lovers of the Motherland Society and the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance of America--had approved the convention in New York, we too should support the New York convention.</p>
   <a name="p12" class="page-break">12</a>
   <p>Pakstas asserted that the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance was not supporting the New York convention.....</p>
   <p>Jurgelionis, having obtained the chair's recognition, made a long and fervent speech, a synopsis of which we present here: "Lithuania is in most unfortunate circumstances, and it is our duty to help her. But we must maintain our unity; we must all get together and make preparations. We can do this at the convention which is to be held in New York. One of the factions, the Catholic Federation, is sponsoring a congress tomorrow, September 21. It will discuss the entire matter. The Federation has called its convention because of its desire to take a leading role in the whole movement. It claims that it represents eighty-five to ninety per cent of the Lithuanians in America and is inviting others to its conference in Chicago. Such behavior on the part of the Federation--its desire to take everybody under its wing--is a work of destruction and should be censured. All the Lithuanians are supporting the convention which will be held in New York. It is necessary to protest against the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance's approval of the destructive work begun by the Federation."....</p>
   <a name="p13" class="page-break">13</a>
   <p>A motion to close the discussions was offered and accepted. Gabrys asserted that the question of both the New York and the Chicago convention should be submitted to a vote.</p>
   <p>The secretary read the motion: "Does this conference support the convention which is to be held in New York?"</p>
   <p>The general convention in New York was accepted, with only five dissenting votes.</p>
   <p>The second part of the agenda, relating to financial and political aid to Lithuania, was placed on the table. Voices were raised requesting that Jurgelionis speak. He arose and spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"Lithuania will, for the most part, suffer great economic and financial losses as a result of the war. There may be political calamities also, but that we do not yet know. We know only that Lithuania will suffer.....We must now <a name="p14" class="page-break">14</a>organize donation-collecting committees in all Lithuanian colonies, and these should begin their work as soon as possible. The local committees must be connected with a central committee which will be elected by the general convention in New York."</p>
   <p>After Jurgelionis' speech several delegates pointed out that the Lithuanians in America, suffering from unemployment, are also in need of relief.</p>
   <p>The discussions were closed. Jurgelionis' motion that local committees, connected with a central committee which will be elected by the general convention in New York, begin their work immediately was brought to a vote and was unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>Then the question of political aid to Lithuania was brought up.</p>
   <a name="p15" class="page-break">15</a>
   <p>Grigaitis spoke as follows:</p>
   <p>"Material aid to Lithuania is a question on which all can easily agree. The political question is more acute. There are two schools of thought in regard to the political situation in Lithuania. One group would take advantage of the opportunity by having the Lithuanian-Americans present their demands concerning Lithuania to the various nations. The second group holds to the theory that the Lithuanians of America have no right to speak for Lithuania, for it is not known what Lithuania wants. I am of the second opinion.</p>
   <p>"There is no certainty about which side will be the victor. It is possible that both sides will be so weakened that they will withdraw and keep their old boundaries. In this event everybody, including the Lithuanians, will have suffered. Therefore material aid to Lithuania must be placed first..... We can only prepare to give aid to Lithuania. If Lithuania is to be autonomous, there must also be freedom for the workers. A petition to that effect should be sent to the general convention in New York. We must also pass a resolution <a name="p16" class="page-break">16</a>denouncing the system which manufactured this war."</p>
   <p>The press committee read the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"We, the delegates of Lithuanian societies in Chicago and vicinity, meeting at Meldazis Hall on September 20, express the sincere desire that Lithuania obtain as much freedom as possible after the war. On our part, we promise to assist in Lithuania's battle for freedom with all our resources. In order that our support be well organized and well directed, we advise the General Political Convention of Lithuanians in America to elect, or to set up rules for electing, a central committee of Lithuanians in America to supervise political aid to Lithuania.</p>
   <p>"Such a committee should justly represent the Lithuanian political factions."</p>
   <p>The resolution was accepted unanimously.</p>
   <a name="p17" class="page-break">17</a>
   <p>Gugis moved that the collection of donations in Chicago be entrusted to the Alliance of Chicago Lithuanian Societies...Finally..the motion was passed in a corrected form: That the collection of donations be entrusted to the Alliance of Chicago Lithuanian Societies, together with all the other Chicago societies and their branches.</p>
   <p>Kaitis moved that this conference elect three delegates to the New York convention and that the societies donate one hundred and fifty dollars for their traveling expenses. The motion was carried.</p>
   <p>Gugis suggested that the delegates participating in this conference state the sums which their societies would guarantee for this purpose.</p>
   <p>Many of the delegates had no authority to make guarantees. The following, however, did: the Women's Enlightenment Society, ten dollars; the Unity Society, the Aidas Musical Society, the Lovers of Lithuania Society, the Chicago Lithuanian Mutual Benefit Society, the Lovers of the Truth Society, the Liberty Society, the Simanas Daukantas Society, and the Cicero Society, which is <a name="p18" class="page-break">18</a>composed of Jancevskis himself, five dollars each; the Kensington Lodge of the Lithuanian Alliance of America, six dollars. Total, fifty-six dollars.</p>
   <p>It was decided that each society send three delegates to the next meeting.</p>
   <p>A motion was made that the date for the next meeting be next Sunday, September 27, at 1 P. M., at Aurora Hall, 3149 South Halsted Street. The motion was carried.</p>
   <p>The motion was made and adopted that all the newspapers advertise the meeting.</p>
   <p>The chairman adjourned the conference until September 27 at Aurora Hall.</p>
