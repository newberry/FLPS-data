   <p>Last Friday evening, the United Lithuanian Societies of the West Side sponsored a mass meeting for the benefit of the war-stricken people of Lithuania. The main speakers were: J. Bagdziunas, who spoke about the necessity of helping our unfortunate brothers and sisters in Lithuania; Attorney B. K. Balutis, editor of the Lietuva, who delivered an address on the subject "You Will Know Your True Friends Only in the Hour of Dire Need"; and Reverend P. B. Serafinas, who spoke about the coming Lithuanian Day (Tag Day) on November 1, 1916.</p>
   <p>Besides the orations, two little girls played the piano and entertained the audience with several recitations. A capacity crowd attended--every seat was occupied. A collection at the meeting netted a total of $146 for the relief of Lithuanian war victims in Europe.</p>
