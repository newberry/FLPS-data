   <p>Two more new Lodges of the Lithuanian Alliance of America were organized in Chicago last week. One Lodge, consisting of nineteen members, was formed in Burnside; another of nine members on the North Side. The latter was created on the ruins of an earlier Lodge which fell apart last year and had only two members left. A group of youth went to work and renewed the Lodge. Another new Lodge is planned to come into existence in West Pullman this Saturday.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday three new members joined Lodge 129 on the West Side; nine joined Lodge 36 in Bridgeport and three joined Lodge 122 in Town of Lake.</p>
