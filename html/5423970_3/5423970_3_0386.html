   <p>On November 23, at the wedding of Mr. J. Guzovskis and Miss Elizabeth Gasiunaite, Mr. K. Dagis, who recently arrived from Lithuania, delivered a short talk on the present conditions in Lithuania. He told how the Russian government persecutes the Lithuanians for distributing literature, and for spreading enlightenment and liberal ideas among the people there. He also told how many Lithuanians are exiled to Siberia for their liberal activities. It is our duty to help those prisoners there, Mr. K. Dagis asked the people to contribute as much as they could for the prisoners. He collected $19.</p>
   <p>After the collection, Mr. K. Dagis said that the poor Lithuanian students <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>at Valparaiso University should not be forgotten, and that this surprisingly large collection of $19 should be divided between the prisoners and the students. Ten dollars of this collection was given to the Lithuanian prisoners in Russia, and nine dollars to the Lithuanian students at Valparaiso University.</p>
   <p>The wedding was in the home of Mr. J. Varekojis, in Roseland.</p>
