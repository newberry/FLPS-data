   <p>The Lithuanians in Chicago celebrated the tenth anniversary of the restored press in their fatherland. This celebration was sponsored by the chapter of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society. All societies participated in this important celebration, except the Chicago Lithuanian Society League. The Chicago Lithuanian Society League withdrew from the celebration because its committee disagreed with other society committees which were sponsoring the anniversary celebration. It is very regrettable that we cannot get together to celebrate this important anniversary. It is our national duty to celebrate the freedom of our press for which we have fought for hundreds of years. Regardless of our different political views, we should unite in one group and remain impartial, especially when celebrating this tenth anniversary.</p>
   <p>This celebration was held Sunday evening, May 10, at the Mark White Square Park, 30th and Halsted streets. There were about 400 people gathered to celebrate the freedom of the Lithuanian press. The hall was very nicely decorated with American and Lithuanian flags. There was a white flag above <span class="page-break">\2</span>the stage with an inscription, "The Tenth Anniversary Celebration of Our Restored Press." Every Lithuanian should be proud of our achievement and success. Our fight lasted about four hundred years. We have accomplished our purpose through a great struggle and persecution, under which our nation and our press suffered foreign oppression for hundreds of years. After all our fight was not in vain; we won our battle for the freedom of our press.</p>
   <p>The chairman was Dr. Draugelis, who conducted the evening program for this anniversary celebration. He gave a short talk on the freedom of the press and he emphasized the importance of the press to the Lithuanian nation. After his short talk he introduced Mr. Pocius, the leader of the famous Lithuanian national choir Birute, who completed the evening program with Lithuanian songs. Birute is the name of the Lithuanian queen married to the great Lithuanian king Keistutis, who ruled Lithuania in the 14th century. The Lithuanian national choir is named after this queen, who was the most beautiful lady at that time. At the beginning of the program the Birute choir sang a national hymn and other folk songs <span class="page-break">\3</span>to brighten the evening program and entertain the public.</p>
   <p>The first speaker of the evening was Dr. A. K. Rutkauskas, who gave a general talk about the press and its great importance to the nation. A nation without its own press is like a blind man who cannot see the beauties and wonders of the world. The press is the eyes of a nation and without it a nation cannot survive very long. The speaker gave a brief outline of the history of the press and mentioned Gutenburg, the man who gave the first press to the world. The next on the program was Jakutis, the singer, who sang three beautiful songs. When F. Jakutis finished his singing the public applauded enthusiastically and asked him to sing again.</p>
   <p>The second speaker on the program was Rev. F. Kemesis, an ardent fighter for restoring the Lithuanian press in our fatherland. Rev. F. Kemesis was an indefatigable fighter in Lithuanian and devoted half of his life to restoring the press to our people in Lithuania. He never stopped working for our nation and its people, for he had hopes that Lithuania would have <span class="page-break">\4</span>its own press again, and his hopes and wishes came through. Today Lithuania has its own press and books printed in the Lithuanian language. He spoke about the importance of the press and its history, the great men who invented and helped to develop the press which we are using today to print our newspapers and books. When he mentioned in his speech the fight for the Lithuanian press, he recalled the incident in his childhood days when his father wanted to teach him from Polish books and he refused to study from them. He told his father that he could not tolerate the Polish language because its pronunciation and spelling were terrible. The Polish language is disliked not only by Lithuanians, but by all neighboring nations, especially the Germans, Swedes, Norwegians, and Danes. The Poles are known as the most tyrannic people in all Europe. History shows that Poland was divided three times by the neighboring nations who hated the Poles and their language. Poland always was known as a black sheep among European nations because she caused a lot of trouble among peace-loving people. Poland has destroyed Lithuanian culture and almost succeeded in destroying the oldest spoken language in Europe.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The world-famous philologists, B. Dwight and Taylor, stated that the Lithuanian language is the oldest spoken language in Europe, and its value is inestimable to philologists because it is the key to all other languages. The philologists know the importance of the Lithuanian language, but the Poles don't know it because they are too ignorant. Polish ignorance is their national culture, and the Lithuanian people did not want such culture. The Poles claim that they gave culture to the Lithuanian nation; that culture, however, was ignorance and slavery. Moreover, the Poles forced their own language upon our people and forbade them to speak the Lithuanian language, which is known to philologists as the language of songs. The language that is highly praised by the philologists was almost completely destroyed by the tyrant Pollacks. Even now Poles are using every possible means to wipe out the name of Lithuania from European history; they tell the world that Lithuanians are just a tribe, but not a nation, and are still uncivilized. But they are ignorant of the fact that the Lithuanian nation introduced agriculture in Europe, about the seventh century. During that period the Lithuanian people were settled and toiled at their lands, while the Poles as barbarians were still roaming around Europe, attacking <span class="page-break">\6</span>and plundering peaceful people who lived near the shores of the Baltic Sea. The Poles are responsible for the downfall of Lithuanian culture; for they destroyed the Lithuanian press and the morale of the people, and made actual slaves of the Lithuanian nobility. Notwithstanding this cruel and barbarous persecution, some of the Lithuanians became great writers. Those who became well known in the field of literature became Poles by adding a tail to their names, for example, "Sienkiewicz" instead of "Sinkus." In other words, they made the writer a Pole by adding a Polish ending to the Lithuanian root (the ending "ievicz," which is pronounced "yevitch.") The methods which are enumerated above were used by the Poles to destroy and thwart Lithuanian cultural progress. The Poles made every effort to wipe out the Lithuanian names from historical records, but they failed in their attempt to wipe out the name of Lithuania. After Rev. Kemesis had finished his speech, Mr. Pocius sang a few Lithuanian songs and one patriotic song was selected especially for this occasion. At the end of the evening the chairman, Dr. Draugelis, introduced the last speaker, the editor of Lietuva, Mr. Balutis, who gave a short talk on Lithuanian history and the struggle of the Lithuanian people. He stressed his point about the Lithuanian press for which we have fought for generations and finally have regained by dint of great sacrifices. Our people suffered hardships and <span class="page-break">\7</span>persecution more than any nation in Europe. Lithuanian culture was completely destroyed and the people were made slaves. The Lithuanians settled along the Baltic Sea long before any nation or any tribe in Europe. The Lithuanians, being much older settlers in that part of Europe where they are today, have the right to their own culture and an independent country of their own, where they can live in peace and enjoy the freedom of civilization. We should be proud that we have regained our press. No nation has any right to deny us a press and liberty. We are entitled to have the same rights as any other nation in Europe. The speaker concluded his speech by saying that we should fight now for the independence of our nation, the same as we have fought for regaining our press.</p>
   <p>We fought a long battle before we regained our press, and if we want our nation to be independent, we must keep on fighting until we get our independence.</p>
   <p>At the end of the program the Lithuanian national choir Birute sang a few songs and the program closed with great success.</p>
