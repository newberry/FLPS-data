   <p>According to Attorney A. A. Slakis, secretary of the National Fund (a Lithuanian-American war relief fund set up by the Catholics), the directors of the National Fund have decided to send ten thousand dollars to the Lithuanian War Relief Society in Vilna, Lithuania. The National Fund sent five thousand dollars to Lithuania for war relief purposes a few weeks ago. Thus, the total will now be fifteen thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>This act of the National Fund deserves much praise and warm congratulations.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund (set up by Lithuanian-American Nationalists) has already made two contributions of war relief funds to Lithuania. Another contribution will be made as soon as a sufficiently large sum is collected.</p>
   <p>It would be a good thing if the Lithuanian Assistance Fund (set up by Lithuanian-American Socialists) would send the money that it has thus far collected as soon as possible.</p>
