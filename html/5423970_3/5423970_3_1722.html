   <p>Katalikas' readers remember well when we mentioned in our last number that Lietuva had put in an article from somewhere, entitled "Priest's Proclamation." We made a very good guess that this idea was originated by Lietuva and not by Catholic priests. We are absolutely sure that no Catholic priest will dare to approve Nauja Godyne, (New Era); Karda, (Sword); and Nauja Draugija, (New Society), and so forth. This article which we found in Lietuva was purely an invention by Lietuva's editor, stating in the article that he will describe his observation in the next issue. Of course, we were quite anxious to know who is going to publish an editorial entitled "Priest's Proclamation."</p>
   <p>When the next issue of Lietuva came out we found an article entitled "Observations on Priests." They even changed the title of their article and reference is made only to one priest; however, they did not mention who is the priest. In addition, this article mentioned something <span class="page-break">2</span>in regards to proclamation about quarrels between the priest and parish in Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>It appears that the editor of Lietuva is trying again to spread a propaganda of lies against our priests. The owner of the Lietuva claims that he never appealed to the people for help, when he actually needed their support. Now they speak a different language entirely, forgetting things that they said before. Using such unfit and bad words in their articles and acting like small children, shows that some people have not developed far mentally. Man's intelligence is judged by his words and his expression. There are certain groups of people who are classified into various categories, degenerates and hypocrites, and their conducts are similar to dogs in rutting time. They change their minds and emotions very often and it is hard for them to keep their minds and emotions in a substantial state. A. Olszewskis makes the statement that his moral principles do not agree with the principles of Catholic <span class="page-break">3</span>priests. We cannot expect to agree with his principles. The editor of Lietuva, A. Olszewskis, cannot apply his principles, which he uses in saloons, to our church. His well known principles are only to scorn the priests and the churches. The principles of our priests are to love God, to love your neighbor, to love enemies and to live according to the commandments of our God and the Catholic Church. However, A. Olszewskis cannot see the difference between the two principles, which is right and which is wrong. It is very obvious that Olszewskis has no logical reasoning when he is comparing his principles with ours. We want to call the attention of our readers and writers to see if there is any difference between the two principles by comparison. Is it possible for us to compromise on such principles which have no logical bases? We may make a good comparison of two principles by applying them to every day life. For comparison we may take two different individuals who lead two different lives, moral and immoral. For example, we have one individual who leads a clean and moral life according to the commandments of God and the Catholic Church, and the other who ignores the code of morals of the present day society.</p>
   <span class="page-break">4</span>
   <p>Men who divorce their wives to whom they were married in the Catholic Church and then remarry in the civil courts, knowing that they are committing an immortal sin, have no respect for themselves. No doubt, our writer Olszewskis would recognize his moral principles, especially to those who marry in civil courts and ignore the doctrines of the holy church. His strongest desire is to open the eyes of the Lithuanian people and to show them how to protect themselves from wrongdoing priests. This is what you would call Olszewskis' principle. It would be much more desirable for him to keep his moral principles for himself and not to spread them among our people who have no use for such principles. The world is full of immoral principles as it is, and there is no need to spread any more poisoning.</p>
   <p>There is another article which appeared in Lietuva, No. 26, under the title of "The Affairs of the Lithuanian Parish in America." This article is supposed to have been written by a little old man, but <span class="page-break">5</span>Lietuva did not mention the writer's name. Most of the articles that are written in Lietuva are always under fictitious names, and the writers' names are very seldom mentioned. We don't understand why you people don't put in the writers' names when they write for Lietuva.</p>
   <p>Why, are you afraid of light? We don't see any reason for being afraid. The people who are sincere are never afraid of anything because they know that nobody will put them in prison. There is a good proverb that "good and honest people aren't afraid of light; only the bats are afraid of light," It is obvious that a man who writes an article which does not degrade nor insult another party, will not be put in prison. In the above mentioned article the little "old man" is calling all Lithuanians to unite, crying and shedding alligator's tears that there are so many altercations and disagreements among the Lithuanian people. In order to remedy this situation, he suggested a plan to unite all Lithuanian parishes and select one central committee to handle the affairs of all parishes. The central committee will have the authority <span class="page-break">6</span>to supervise all churches and their property.</p>
   <p>We think that this remedy is more suitable for this "old fellow" to make himself younger. When he accomplishes this, then all churches will unite and will have one central committee. In addition, he may become chairman of the central committee and be able to handle the affairs and the property of all Lithuanian parishes. He cannot accomplish his aim unless he cures himself of "old age disease." If he fails to do that, he will be called old revolutionist or the remnants from the last French revolution. French revolutionists also passed a law to control churches and their property. We believe that revolutionary days are ended, but not to this old fellow who is still struggling in this world to make another revolution and to control church property.</p>
   <p>In a recent issue of the Vienybe there was an article called "Recommendation," written by a man named Mikolainis. In this article he submits a proposition that the Lithuanian Alliance, as a national <span class="page-break">7</span>organization, should make a strong protest against Rev. M. Kraucunas.</p>
   <p>We don't think that the Lithuanian Alliance would pay any attention to such a fantastic proposal. The Lithuanian Alliance of America is the organization that has no political connection at all and takes no part in controversies of any kind. The members of the organization have no cabbage heads, but are real competent men and keep the organization out of all controversies. But Mr. Mikolainis and his degenerated henchmen may make a protest and propose a new protocol against Rev. M. Kraucunas.</p>
   <p>If he succeeds in creating a new protocol, then he and his henchmen would be elected for the office of the organization. No doubt they would be well contented if they would succeed in accomplishing their aim. But we doubt that they will accomplish anything worthwhile, because public sentiment is against them.</p>
   <p>In the last number of Tautos Sargas,(National Guard), there was an <span class="page-break">8</span>article written by an American who accused Katalikas for using unparliamentary words, but he failed to accuse Lietuva for using unparliamentary words. The Lietuva was the very first one to use unparliamentary words in its articles. The Katalikas kept silence as much as was possible, but at last lost its patience and could not tolerate attacks and accusations by Lietuva. The Lietuva made two strong attacks on the Catholic faith, accusing priests and other members of the church. Thinking that they are doing a good deed for the salvation of man's soul, but not knowing that they are misleading people by showing them the wrong road which leads to immoral life. We never stopped anybody from making his choice in picking a road of life, whether moral or immoral. If a man has chosen an immoral road in life, we don't want to stop him, but he should not bluff the people or mislead them.</p>
