   <p>The parishioners of the Providence of God parish are expressing their gratitude to Albert Rose, owner of the Freheit Turner Hall, 5417 S. Halsted St., for giving the hall to the parishioners to hold a meeting free of charge. Mr. Albert Rose has donated $25 to the parishioners by not charging for the hall. This proves that even strangers are helping us fight against the priest of the Providence of God parish. We thank Mr. Albert Rose and we urge all the Lithuanian societies to hold their meetings at the Freheit Turner Hall.</p>
   <p>We are inviting all the Lithuanians to come to our meeting and help us fight against our church enemies.</p>
