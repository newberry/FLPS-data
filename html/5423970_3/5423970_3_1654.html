   <p>The weekly publication of the Illinois Staats Zeitung, Westen, states that on the Lithuanian church in Chicago a new mortgage of $40,000 was made. Previously there was a mortgage of $15,000, so that now the total mortgage is $55,000. No one will deny that this new church is beautiful, but whether it is worth $55,000 it is another question.</p>
