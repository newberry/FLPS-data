   <p>In a letter dated Oct. 21, and addressed to Jacob H. Schiff, Secretary Root, of the State of New York, informs Mr. Schiff that the government does not intend to deport J. Paurenas (Pouren) or any other person on account of political offenses.</p>
   <p>J. Paurenas, a Latvian, is an escaped revolutionist from Russia. He participated in the Russian Revolution of 1905. At the request of Russian authorities he was imprisoned in New York ten months ago for possible deportation to Russia. Although he committed only political offenses against the imperial Russian government as a revolutionist, nevertheless, the Russian government requested his surrender as a common murderer and criminal.</p>
   <p>A Chicago Lithuanian committee to aid Paurenas, headed by Anthony Kvedaras, has been active here during the past few weeks.</p>
