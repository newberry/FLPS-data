   <p>The Russian priest Ardan has told me that on the Island Oahn, Hawaii, there are a few Lithuanians in slavery. Therefore I am asking our patriots what we must do with these enslaved Lithuanians. I would like to know what our priests will do for those poor sufferers. Will they do the same as they did against the Lithuanian exhibit at the Paris exhibition? What will our various societies do in this matter? Can the Lithuanians help our enslaved brothers, to free them from the yoke of the merciless planters?</p>
