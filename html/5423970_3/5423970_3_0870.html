   <p>J. Gabrys, world famous Lithuanian writer, suggested in a recent issue of the Lietuva that we commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Vincas Kudirka (1858-1899), by publishing all his literary works. This suggestion has been enthusiastically accepted by the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, which has three chapters in Chicago. The society has decided not only to publish all the literary works of Kudirka, but also to hold Kudirka Birthday Parties all over the United States on the day of his birth, December 31. All branches of the society are urged to organize and hold such parties. Although the day is still two months away, nevertheless, decisions have already been made in the principal Lithuanian colonies in the United States to commemorate Kudirka's birthday with appropriate ceremonies and exercises.</p>

   <p>In Chicago, where there are three large lodges of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, efforts are being made to unite all or at least a majority of the Lithuanian societies to celebrate the event in unity on New Year's Day. Several other Lithuanian societies in Chicago, such as the Farmers of Lithuania Society and the Simonas Daukantas Society, are already working energetically toward that end. At the annual observance of the birthday of Daukantas by the latter society, held on October 25, Mr. A. Bijanskas, president, urged Lithuanians to unite in the celebration of the fiftieth birthday of Kudirka. At his suggestion $7.40 was collected at that gathering and sent to the Lovers of the Fatherland Society to assist in the publication of the works of Kudirka.</p>
   <p>In Boston, all the Lithuanian societies have already united to celebrate the jubilee of Kudirka in a united fashion. According to our newspapers similar plans are also being made in other Lithuanian-American colonies, such as in New York, Philadelphia, Waterbury (Conn.), Cleveland, <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>Makanoy City (Pa.), Lawrence (Mass.), and Scranton (Pa.). Such united enthusiasm in regard to a hero of our race is very praiseworthy. This is probably the first time that Lithuanian-Americans, who are scattered all over the United States, have united in the observance of an important event of our nationality.</p>
   <p>In an article about the fiftieth jubilee of Kudirka in the Tevyne (The Fatherland, a Lithuanian weekly published in New York), Mr. Artojas suggests that December 31, 1908, the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Kudirka, be declared a national Lithuanian holiday in order that Lithuanians all over the world night remind themselves of the great deeds of Kudirka and his unbounded love for, and attachment to our Fatherland. That is a very fine suggestion and should be materialized. It would serve to demonstrate, better than anything else, the advancement <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>of our people in the intellectual and patriotic fields.</p>
   <p>Dr. Vincas Kudirka was born in Lithuania on December 31, 1858 and died on November 16, 1899. He is the author of the words and music of the Lithuanian national anthem "Lietuva Tevyne Musu" (Lithuania Our Fatherland). He spent his entire life in unceasing activities for the intellectual uplift and racial consciousness of our people. Unquestionably, he is very worthy of all the honor that is being bestowed upon him.</p>
   <p>The Lovers of the Fatherland Society (Tevynes Myletoju Draugija), which has assumed the responsibility of publishing the literary works of Kudirka and of organizing his Birthday Parties all over the United States, is a fast growing society. Six months ago this society had only $344 in its treasury; today it has over $700. The society has <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>twenty-six branches all over the United States, and a total member-ship of 411 patriotic Lithuanians. It is playing a very important role in the cultural uplift of our nation.</p>
   <p>The Lovers of the Fatherland Society has appointed Joseph Gabrys, world famous Lithuanian writer and patriot, to collect the literary works of Kudirka. Mr. Gabrys has moved from his home in Paris, France, to Tilsit, Germany, the scene of Kudirka's literary activities, and is already collecting his writings. Judging by the wonderful support which the society is receiving from the Lithuanian public, it appears that we will not have to wait very long for the published works of Kudirka.</p>
