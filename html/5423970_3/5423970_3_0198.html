   <p>All the Chicago Lithuanian factions, the Nationalists, Catholics, and the Socialists, have finally agreed to form a united front and work in unity for the success of the Lithuanian Day (Tag Day) on November 1, 1916, during which public collections will be made all over the United States for the relief of the war-stricken people of Lithuania. This unity was brought about by the efforts of Mr. M. Ycas, Lithuanian representative in the Russian Duma, and Reverend J. Zilinskas, who recently arrived in America and are now in Chicago. Mr. Ycas and Reverend Zilinskas have come to America in the interests of Lithuanian war relief.</p>
   <p>After the Nationalists and Catholics failed to form a united front with the Socialists last week, Mr. Ycas and Reverend Zilinskas were consulted and it was decided to make one more effort to unite all the factions. For that purpose <span class="page-break">\2</span>a special meeting of representatives of the newspapers Lietuva (Lithuania), Draugas (The Friend), Katalikas (The Catholic), and Naujienos (News) was held last Monday. That meeting was also attended by the two guests from Lithuania, Mr. Yeas and Reverend Zilinskas.</p>
   <p>The guests from Lithuania helped a great deal to bring about unity. After listening to the explanations and pleas of the guests, the Socialist representatives, Mr. Pius Grigaitis, Mr. Casimir Gugis, and Mr. Kleofas Jurgelionis, withdrew the demand, the "ultimatum", of their faction for one third of the collected funds and agreed to accept a one-third representation on the Central Chicago Lithuanian Committee and to abide by all the decisions of the Committee.</p>
   <p>Mr. Yeas and Reverend Zilinskas explained at the meeting that "there are no factions in Lithuania at the present time" and that all Lithuanians are working <span class="page-break">\3</span>in unity for the relief of war-stricken Lithuanians. They stated that it would not make any difference if one third of the collected funds were sent to Lithuania in the names of the Socialist leaders, such as M. Birziska, J. Saulis, J. Vileisis, or S. Kairys, because they are co-operating with all other leaders in Lithuania, and some are even members of the Lithuanian War Relief Society, in which, up to now, the Chicago Lithuanian Socialists had no confidence. It was also explained at the meeting that if all Lithuanians in Lithuania are united in war relief work then there is no reason why Lithuanian-Americans also should not be united in this great humanitarian work.</p>
   <p>Now that all Chicago Lithuanian factions have united, every Lithuanian should do his or her part to help make the Lithuanian Day a great success, and see that as much money as possible is collected on that day for the relief of our suffering brothers and sisters in Europe.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>We must not, however, do anything that would mar the unity that has been established. This unity can be destroyed if any of the factions persists in making dishonest statements and misrepresenting facts. For example, in writing about the above-mentioned meeting, the Naujienos, instead of stating that the Socialists had withdrawn their "ultimatum", stated that "the Nationalists and Catholics had accepted the demands of the Progressive Chicago Lithuanian public". Such a statement was probably necessary to safeguard the prestige of the Naujienos, but it will not help to establish complete harmony among the various Chicago Lithuanian factions. That statement in the Naujienos is especially surprising because Mr. K. Jurgelionis, at a meeting of the Central Chicago Lithuanian Committee, promised in his own name and in the name of the Naujienos not to do anything to mar the unity that had been established.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\5</span>
   <p>The establishment of unity in Chicago should be a good example for all other Lithuanian-American colonies to follow. However, the true situation in Chicago must not be misrepresented, or else the bud will die before it blooms....</p>
