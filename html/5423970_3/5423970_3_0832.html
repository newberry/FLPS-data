   <p>February 26, the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, local 33, and the Singers Dramatic Society, presented a theatrical play at Arsanski Hall (in the saloon). The play was "The Shrewd Widow," written by Guzutis. This was the first theatrical performance given for the Lithuanians of So. Chicago. Not many Lithuanians attended, because they lack enlightenment.</p>
   <p>The G. D. D. Choir sang three songs: "The Red Little Sun," "The Willow on the Hill," and "The Uncle Was in Vilnus," composed by Mr. Petrauskas. There were three speakers. Mr. K. Gugis, in his speech, stated that the Lithuanians lack enlightenment, and for this reason are not active in their national and cultural activities. The speaker also said that because of this lack of enlightenment, the Lithuanians are exploited in the factories; they work the hardest for the lowest wages.</p>
