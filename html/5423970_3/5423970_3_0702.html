   <p>Increased efforts are being made among our people to unite all Lithuanian-American factions. In my opinion, partisan struggles are very necessary, and they should be allowed to continue. The effort to unite all factions into one body is an unintelligent step. The success of that effort would do much harm to us; it would put us into a trance, make us passive and inactive.</p>
   <p>The different parties must vie with one another, but not in a rude manner, not by calling each other names, engaging in foolish quarrels, and making false accusations. The struggles should be based on sound arguments, convincing facts, and logical conclusions.</p>
   <p>The Nationalist party, which is attacked quite often by other factions, is one of the most important and powerful parties among Lithuanian-Americans, because thus far it has accomplished the greatest amount of constructive work with results plainly evident to all. Furthermore, this party has the greatest number of intellectuals; it is the most active and was the first to undertake really constructive work among Lithuanian-Americans, blazing the way for all other groups. The Nationalists organized and still maintain the Lithuanian Alliance of America and the Lovers of the Fatherland Society. These two organizations have been imitated by a countless number of other Lithuanian fraternal and idealist societies,but so far none of them have succeeded in surpassing the organizations after which they were patterned.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Alliance of America and the Lovers of the Fatherland Society have accomplished a great deal of good for our race; no other Lithuanian-American faction can boast of such great achievements.</p>
