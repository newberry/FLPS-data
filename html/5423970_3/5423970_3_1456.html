   <p>"Clericalism is the intrusion of religion into public or political affairs and the employment of religion as a tool in such matters. Clericalism is prevalent not only among Lithuanians; it also exists to a certain extent among other national groups in the United States. However, clericalism is not tolerated among other American national groups, and wherever it appears, it is immediately opposed by all religious groups.</p>
   <p>"In this connection, a very interesting example has been set in the city of Buffalo, New York. That example is of special interest to, and deserves the attention of, Lithuanian-Americans, because clericalism is steadily growing among our people and threatens to dominate our entire life. We can learn from other nationalities how to conduct ourselves [in combatting clericalism]."</p>

   <p>According to The New World, offical organ of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago, "several joint meetings of priests and lay leaders of various religious groups, such as Catholics, Presbyterians, Unitarians, Baptists, Episcopalians, and Congregationalists, were held during the month of July in the city of Buffalo, New York. These meetings were called for the purpose of finding ways and means to stop the mixing of religion with public and political affairs."</p>
   <p>At the first joint religious meeting a long resolution, directed against bigotry and the mixing of religion with politics, was adopted.</p>
   <p>"That resolution should be very carefully read by all Lithuanian-Americans, but especially by our clerics, who desire to label our whole public life with the letters 'R.C.' (Roman Catholic).....</p>
   <p>"It is hoped that some of our Catholics will follow the wonderful example that has been set in Buffalo by protesting against the mixing of religion with our <span class="page-break">3</span>public affairs. The present behavior of our clerics is not only against morality and justice, but also against the principles of the United States Constitution. That is something that Lithuanians, like other citizens of the United States, should not tolerate."</p>
