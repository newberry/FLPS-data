   <p>p.4.... Last Sunday one of the oldest Lithuanian societies in Chicago, the Lithuanian Liberty Society, held a meeting. Many important matters were discussed,, such as relief for war refugees, affiliation with the Federation of Chicago Lithuanian Societies, etc.</p>
   <p>After long discussion $5.00 was donated for war refugees in Lithuania. The question of affiliation with the Federation of Chicago Lithuanian Societies aroused heated debatew and was opposed by a majority of the members. Mr. S.J. Darguzis was the minority leader. Charges were made at the meeting that the Federation was organized by Mr. Elias to further his own political ambitions, and that now the control of the Federation has passed into the hands of left-wing socialists. The invitation to affiliate with the Federation was finally rejected.</p>
   <p>Mr. S.J.Darguzis, who is attending school, was excused from the payment of dues with <span class="page-break">2</span>the understanding that he will not "high hat" the society when be becomes a professional man, as many others have done.</p>
