Salcius, Lithuanian writer who is on a visit in Chicago, and Mr. Kazlauskas, of Montello (sic), Massachusetts. A large crowd, mostly young people, attended the social. The program consisted of songs, dancing, orations, and a dinner. One of the speakers announced that the League, in conjunction with the Lithuanian Independence Fund, had decided to maintain a permanent representative in Washington, D. C. Mr. K. Kasputis, Chicagoan, has been selected as the representative, and he will leave for Washington in a few days. His duty will be to do whatever he can to advance the movement for the independence of Lithuania. The announcement was vigorously applauded by those attending.</p>
