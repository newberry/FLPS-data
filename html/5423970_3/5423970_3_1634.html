   <p>On the 15th day of May the Lithuanians held a large meeting for the purpose of organizing a Lithuanian parish in Kensington. Rev. Steponavicius from Chicago was at this meeting.</p>
   <p>Even though there were many people at the meeting, only a few wanted to organize the parish. The priest said that everyone must pay $25 for the church. The people with different opinion did not have a chance to open their mouths.</p>
   <p>To organize the parish and to keep up the church is not so easy when the priest demands $25 of everyone. There are over 50 Lithuanian families and over 400 unmarried persons. Only a few people wanted the parish, and the priest demanded that they pay $25 at once. Now there were those who wanted to build the church, but the $25 made them hesitate. It looks as if the parish will not be organized here. Many people cannot support it.</p>
