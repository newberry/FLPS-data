   <p>In the new Lithuanian parish, in place of Rev. Steponaviczius, the bishop appointed another priest, Rev. Peza from Pennsylvania. Last Sunday the new soul shepherd announced in the church that he would go out himself to collect money from the parishioners. The committee believed that the priest would go. According to the parish constitution the collection of money is in the hands of the committee.</p>
   <p>There are many light-minded persons among the Lithuanians! In time the committee itself will disappear. In its place the priest will elect his own tools. Is it possible that Rev. Peza is just as bad as Rev. Krawczunas?</p>
