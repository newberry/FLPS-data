   <p>A celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Aurora Society took place January 20.</p>
   <p>The most important part of the evening's program was the presentation of Gogolis' two-act comedy "The Matchmaking." The play was so well given that, according to the saying, nothing better is needed. The actors had worked hard to understand their roles and prepare themslves. It was the best acted play that Chicagoans had ever seen. It was even better than "Salaputris". The actors, all talented, have distinguished themselves long before, but this time distinguished themselves even more. They were at their best. The actors were B. Vaitiekunas, J. Prusinskas, J. Ilgaudas, J. Sankunas, P. Moskiene, M. Damijonaitiene, B. Bernotaitiene, M. Montviliute. The director was K. Jurgelionis. Vaitiekunas and Moskiene can be envied their talents! Prusinskas, a new arrival on the Chicago Lithuanian stage, also distinguished himself well; he was very lively, but his movements were graceful and studied. He had the <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>dapperness and audacity of the best Gypsy-like matchmaker. Ilgaudas was costumed very well and looked, as well as played, the part of a trader magnificently. In a word, the presentation was lively, funny, splendid. If we had numerous presentations like this, Lithuanians would double their love for the Lithuanian stage!</p>
   <p>Such praise cannot be given the concert part of the program. It was like a supplement to the play. It was apparent that the arrangers did not bother as much about the musical part of the program. The most notable artists in this part were violinist Peter Sarpalius, who played De Beriot's "Concerto Allegro and Andante", and Kriksciokiute, who sang Schubert's "Serenade" and Verdi's "Flower Song" from "La Traviata". She did not have much success with the latter. The "Serenade" was sung very well. Zigmont, Dobilius and Mockus gave a saxophone trio. Not bad but nothing special. It was gratifying, though, that Lithuanians are learning to play various instruments.... K. Vicas and A. Micevicia sang Grock's "Nocturne" and Vilbois' "Seamen". The voices of <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>both require much improvement and training.</p>
   <p>K. P. Gugis sketched the history of the Aurora Society in a short speech, pointing out the facts of its founding and its accomplishments. During its ten years Aurora has aided twenty-two students; nine of them are still attending higher education schools, two (Grazys and Kuodis) died while pursuing their studies, four did not finish their studies, seven did. Gugis' speech was interesting, though it was short.....</p>
