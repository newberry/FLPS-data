   <p>In our parish the fight is on again. When the Rev. Smolenskas died the parishioners appealed to the archbishop for a priest. The archbishop replied that six priests are coming from Lithuania. He will send one of the priests to the Waukegan Lithuanian parish. As they were waiting for the priest from Lithuania, the priest Ambrozaitis arrived. He said that he came from Chicago. On the next day the priest left the parish. The parishioners were very much discouraged. On the next day the priest's maid came and demanded the keys of the rectory. The parishioners refused to give the key and refused to permit her to occupy the rectory. The maid broke into the rectory by force. The next day the priest Ambrozaitis arrived. At once the priest demanded that the rectory be decorated and that electric lights should be installed.</p>
   <p>On the 1st of May Rev. Ambrozaitis held a parish meeting. He did not care to ask the parishioners if they accepted him or not, but at once demanded the collection, etc.</p>
