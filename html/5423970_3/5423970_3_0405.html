   <p>The Chicago Lithuanians are waiting impatiently for the guests from Lithuania, Dr. Jonas Basanavicius, and the representative of the Duma, Martinas Yeas.</p>
   <p>So far as we have been able to learn, all the Lithuanians here, regardless of their views, are willing to support the purpose and aims of these guests because they did not come here for their own personal benefit or gain; they came to raise money for the science building to be built in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Lithuanians, in the past, have supported every good cause for their fatherland. No doubt they will double their efforts now, to help build the educational institution in Lithuania. The Chicago Lithuanians <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>must show that they do not lag behind the Lithuanians of other cities. This matter ought to be taken up not only by individuals, but by all the Chicago Lithuanian societies--regardless of whether they are national or religious societies.</p>
