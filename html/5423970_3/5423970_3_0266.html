   <p>The directors of the local branch of the Fund held a meeting during the latter part of June. The secretary in his financial report stated that the income of the branch from December, 1915 to June 15, 1916 was as follows:</p>

   <p>After hearing the report made by Secretary B. Janulis, the directors decided to send $125 to the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund, $25 of which was designated for the autonomy section of the Fund. Thus, the balance which still remains in the treasury of the branch is $25.47 (sic).</p>
