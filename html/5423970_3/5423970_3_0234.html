   <p>The Association of West Side Lithuanian Societies was recently organized for the purpose of raising funds for the relief of war-stricken Lithuanians in Europe. All funds that are raised by this association are sent directly to a Lithuanian war-relief agency in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The Association is made up of fourteen local Lithuanian societies of various partisan affiliations. It was organized on October 10, 1915, and since that date has been engaged in various activities for raising funds for our starving brothers and sisters across the sea. Funds were raised by holding bazaars, mass meetings, donations from societies, and through the efforts of many local Lithuanian families.</p>

   <p>I will explain in greater detail here how the latter method of collecting funds was operated. Collection blanks for this purpose were printed and distributed to many local Lithuanian families. The collection blanks, which contained a printed explanation of the purpose of the Association, were placed in conspicuous places in all homes. When the families received visitors the latter were asked to make contributions and to sign their names on the blanks. Later, the blanks and contributions were returned to the officers of the Association. In this manner a total of $140.10 was collected.....</p>
   <p>Since its inception the Association raised the following funds for the relief of Lithuanian war-victims:</p>

    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>Total</td>
     <td>$33.50</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <p>The sum of $615 was sent through the First National Bank to Mr. J. Aukstuolis, in Stockholm, Sweden, with instructions to turn the money over to Dr. J. Basanavicius, who is head of the main Lithuanian war-relief agency in Vilnius, Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The sum of $312.50 was sent through the Chicago-Russian consul to the Central Lithuanian War-Relief Committee in Petrograd, Russia.</p>
   <p>Therefore, a total of $961 was sent by the Association directly to the Lithuanian war-relief agencies in Europe.</p>
   <p>A balance of $128.49 is still in the hands of Mr. R. Zaura, who is treasurer <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>of the Association and is under a thousand-dollar bond.</p>
   <p>Thus it is seen that the Lithuanians of the West Side district have raised a substantial sum of money for the relief of our war-stricken brothers and sisters in Europe. During the hot summer months, activities of the Association were more or less at a standstill. Now that cooler weather is approaching, the Association is making preparations to hold a benefit mass meeting on September 29, in Meldazis Hall, 23rd Place and South Oakley Avenue. A number of distinguished Lithuanian-Americans have been invited to speak at that meeting. In this manner it is believed that another substantial sum of money will be raised by the Association for the relief of our unfortunate nationals in war-ridden Europe.</p>
