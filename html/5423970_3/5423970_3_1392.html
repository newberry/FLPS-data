   <p>On November 24, 1903 at Pittsburgh, Pa., the Lithuanian Catholic clergy held a convention for the establishment of the Lithuanian congregation for the teaching of girls. There were fourteen priests present at the convention; thirteen approved the convention's decision. It was decided: (1) That for the American Lithuanians it is most essential to have Lithuanian monks, whose main duty must be to educate the Lithuanian youth in the parish schools.</p>
   <p>(2) It is more desirable to restore the old Lithuanian Sisters Congregation "Mariae Vitae," than to establish a Lithuanian branch and to unite with some existing order in America.</p>
   <p>(3) All the petitions to the Apostolic delegate at Washington or Rome, and all the other legal steps, must be made in the name of the Lithuanian Clergy of America.</p>
   <p>May 3, 1904, the Lithuanian priests held a second convention at Elizabeth, N.J., and discussed the affairs of the Lithuanian nuns. Eight priests were present. At the convention they made the following decision: Whereas, there have been no results from the first convention which was held in Pittsburgh, Pa., and whereas, as we have seen from the committie's report, nothing good will come of it, therefore we have decided: To ask the priests A. Kaupas and A. Milukas, to communicate with the sister superior of the order of "Mariae Vitae," and ask her whether she can start from where she is now, to organize the order of "Mariae Vitae" of the Lithuanian nuns.</p>
   <p>April 25, 1905, the priests, A. Kaupas and A. Milukas, turned over all the Lithuanian sisters' congregation affairs to the Rev. A. Staniukynas.</p>
   <p>July 2, 1905, the bishop of Harrisburg, Pa., agreed to take care of the Lithuanian sisters' affairs.</p>
   <p>August 3, 1905, the Lithuanian priests donated $350.00 to start the congregation.</p>
   <p>October 2, 1905, the Immaculate Hart of Mary Sisters agreed to take candidates to the nuns order with a monthly payment of $15.00 by each candidate. The bishop agreed to pay for one year the support of three sisters who were coming from Switzerland.</p>
   <p>November 3, 1905, three Lithuanian girls came from Switzerland: Kazimiera Kaupiute, Judyta Dvaranauskiute and Antanina Unguraicute, and at once they went to the Mount of Saint Mary's Seminary, Scranton, Pa. Information was received to the effect.</p>
   <p>August 2, 1906,that the Lithuanian girls must stay longer than one year in its seminary, and that the bishop of Scranton did not give more support for those girls; then the matter was taken care of by the Lithuanians themselves.</p>
   <p>April 19, 1901, permission was received from Rome for the establishment of the Lithuanian congregation. The present by-laws of the St. Casimir Sisters were made according to the "Normas" or the directions issued to the holy congregation of the bishops and monks in the year of 1901; this must be confirmed by the common promise of the congregation, if they want to have their by-laws approved by Rome.</p>
   
   <p>August 29, 1907, the first three Lithuanian girls received their nun's vestments and have joined the St. Casimir Sisters Congregation, under the following names: Sister Maria, Sister M.Immaculata and Sister M. Concepta.</p>
   <p>August 30, 1907, the first three sisters have the vows of virginity, poverty and obedience.</p>
   <p>February 13, 1909, Archbishop J. E. Quigley, agreed to take the St. Casimir Sisters' Congregation to Chicago, and to loan their mother home establishment $30,000.</p>
   <p>March 23, 1909, Bishop Shanahan when he obtained approval of the archbishop of Chicago, wrote to Rome, in order to get permission to move the Sisters' Congregation to Chicago.</p>
   <p>May 21, 1909, five acres of land were bought for the convent for the sum of $8,500.00, between 67th and 68th Streets, and between Rockwell Street and Wahstenaw Avenue.</p>
   
   <p>November 22, 1909, two lots, adjacent to the convent land, were bought for $550.00, to build the chapel.</p>
   <p>July 12, 1910, adjacent to the convent land there were bought five more acres for $7,000.</p>
   <p>In the year of 1911, soon after the New Year there St. Casimie Sisters came from Scranton, Pa., and at once took under their control the school of All Saints parish.</p>
   <p>July 2, 1911, J.M.J.E.Quigley, the archbishop of Chicago consecrated the convent of Saint Casimir Sisters.</p>
   <p>July 3, 1911, the Rev. J. Kolesinskas donated $5,000.00 to build the chapel. (Translators note: Rev. J. Kolesinskas, the same priest about whom I wrote previously, that he was exiled by the Russian government to Siberia for ravishing girls. Later the same priest in Pittston, Pa., tried by force to ravish a saloonkeeper's wife; the saloonkeeper beat him up. After that the priest came to Chicago, where he robbed the ignorant Lithuanians right and left.)</p>
   
   <p>August 24, 1912, an election was held to choose the superior of the convent. Nine sisters took part in the election. Sister Maria was elected Superior.</p>

   <p>In 1915, the debt of the convent was $57,000.</p>
   <p>July 24, 1915, the St. Casimir Sisters' Congregation was incorporated in the State of Illinois. The sisters got the charter with full rights and power to organize and to establish schools and charitable institutions under their sole control.</p>
