   <p>January 19, the Lithuanian Alliance of America, local 36, held its fifth annual banquet with a theatrical and musical program at the south side Turner Hall.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Laukis read an essay entitled "The Lithuanian Alliance of America."</p>
   <p>Then a one-act comedy, "It is Politics," was performed under the direction of Mr. Vaitekunas. The comedy discusses the present mayoralty campaign in Chicago. It is a very humorous presentation of the political activity going on during the present city election campaign.</p>
