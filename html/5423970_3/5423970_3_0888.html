   <p>The Birute Singing and Dramatic Society will hold a picnic on August 23, at Stickney Grove, Stickney, Illinois. This will be the first picnic to be held by the Society.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this picnic is to raise funds for the publication of a new theatrical play entitled "Kaminkretis Ir Malunininkas" (The Chimney Sweep and the Miller). This is a two-act musical comedy written by Mikas Petrauskas. The main plot of the play deals with a romantic love affair between the son of a chimney sweeper and the daughter of a windmill proprietor. This highly entertaining play will help to fill the need for comical creations among our people.</p>
   <p>This picnic deserves the support of every Lithuanian. The Birute Chorus will sing a few beautiful Lithuanian songs, and a good orchestra will furnish music for Lithuanian dances. It promises to be a very joyous picnic. Admission is only 25 cents.</p>
