   <p>Last Sunday, May 14, the wedding of Casimir Gautis and Miss Petronella Butnoris was held in the home of the Liemezis family at 3203 South Lowe Avenue. While the guests were enjoying themselves they did not forget their war-stricken brothers and sisters in Lithuania. One of the guests, Mr. August Jankus, brought this matter to the attention of the guests in a short talk, and suggested that a collection be made among the guests for that purpose. The collection was made and it netted a total of six dollars.</p>
   <p>The donations were as follows: fifty cents each by A. Jankus, D. Mitkus, A. Plienis, the newlyweds, Mr. and Mrs. Gautis, J. Nutautas, K. Paulis, J. Siaulis, A. Stankus, J. Lemezis, and N. Lemezis.</p>
   <p>The six dollars was sent to the newspaper Naujienos (News) for transmission to the Lithuanian Assistance Fund.</p>
