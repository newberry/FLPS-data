   <p>We do not know how many Lithuanians there are in Chicago, nor do we know how many Lithuanian societies there are. In order to reveal the role of the Lithuanian societies in Chicago, we have decided to publish every year from now on, the names of the Lithuanian societies, their financial standing, membership and activity.</p>
   <p>This year we cannot give the complete statement of the Lithuanian societies in Chicago; some of the societies were afraid to give their statements; others did not care to, and others had no time to prepare their statements. We are publishing the reports of those societies which gave us their statements. Next year we hope we will be able to give a more complete statement.</p>
