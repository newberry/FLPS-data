   <p>Last Saturday, Martynas Ycas, Lithuanian representative in the Russian Duma, and Reverend Jonas Zilinskas left Chicago. They are going to Cleveland, Ohio; from there they will go to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and other Lithuanian-American colonies.</p>
   <p>While in Chicago the guests received many invitations through the Lietuva to speak in many Lithuanian-American colonies. Among the colonies that invited them are Omaha, Nebraska, Scranton, Pennsylvania, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, and Pittston, Pennsylvania. A few invitations also came from the New England states.</p>
   <p>Attorney B. K. Balutis, editor of the Lietuva, and Mr. K. Kasputis accompanied the guests to the railroad station. The guests stated that they are greatly satisfied with the treatment they received in Chicago and with the generosity of Chicago Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>The distinguished guests came to America a few weeks ago for the purpose of collecting <span class="page-break">\2</span>funds for the relief of Lithuanian war victims in Europe. Three hurriedly prepared mass meetings, with the guests as the principal speakers, were held in Chicago. A total of $1,050 was raised at these mass meetings for Lithuanian war relief. The mass meeting in Town of Lake netted $413.; in the Bridgeport district, $363.; in the West Side district, $270.</p>
   <p>It would have been possible to raise twice as much money if there had been time to arrange meetings for the guests in more Chicago Lithuanian colonies.....</p>
   <p>According to reports, people who heard the guests speak are greatly pleased with their visit to Chicago. The people who attended the mass meetings learned many things from the guests about the plight of the Lithuanians in Europe that they did not know before.</p>
