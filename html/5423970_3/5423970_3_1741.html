   <p>I, Joseph Ramoska, being duly sworn depose and say that these Joseph Skinder and others came to him, the affiant, to ask him the favor of signing a petition, not knowing what it contained until afterwards when he learned that it was a petition to depose Rev. Mathews Kracunas from his parish, and this affiant says that if he had known or had it explained to him what the petition contained, he would not have signed said petition.</p>
