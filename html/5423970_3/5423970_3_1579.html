   <p>The Lithuanian Roman-Catholic Alliance of America will hold a celebration and convention in Chicago on June 14, 1908, while on June 16, 17 and 18th, the convention will be held at the Columbus Hall, 1840 S. Wabash Avenue. We are begging all the Lithuanian societies and clubs of Chicago not to have their picnics, banquets, etc., on that day, so that they will not interfere with our pre-convention banquet.</p>
   <p>Sincerely,</p>
   <p>The Convention's Committee.</p>
