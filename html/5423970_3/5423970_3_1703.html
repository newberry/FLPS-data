   <p>We, the Committee of the Lithuanian Roman-Catholic Parish the Providence of God, see the necessity of establishing in Chicago another Lithuanian parish than that which was incorporated in 1895.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we appeal to all the Roman-Catholic Lithuanians who feel that they need another parish in Chicago, come to the meeting on Saturday, January 6, 1900, at 7 P. M., Szemaitis Hall, 632 S. Canal St. If other nations can uphold several parishes, the Lithuanians also can have another parish. All the Lithuanian Catholics are invited.</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
   <p>P. S. Those who want to get more information about this new parish affairs, call at the parish secretary, Alex Gudenauskis, 55 W. 15th St., Chicago.</p>
