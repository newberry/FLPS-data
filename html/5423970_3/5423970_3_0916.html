   <p>The Lovers of the Fatherland Society have accomplished a gigantic task, spreading enlightenment, by publishing scientific books. This was accomplished by Lithuanians, who have joined the Lovers of the Fatherland Society.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this society is to distribute its published books free among the poor people in Lithuania; to collect money for the poor Lithuanian students who cannot complete their education without help. Now, when the press in Lithuania has been restored, many and various educational and literary societies have been organized in Lithuania. There is a great demand for scientific books in Lithuania. The Lovers of the Fatherland Society has sent many books to Lithuania, but the demand for such books in Lithuania is great. Therefore, it is the duty of every Lithuanian to join this literary society, the Lovers of the Fatherland Society, to help the society publish more scientific books and to distribute them among poor Lithuanians in America and Lithuania.</p>
   
   <p>The Chicago Lithuanians can join the 19th branch of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society. This same 19th branch will hold its meeting on the 14th of April, at 3:00 P.M., Rugis Hall, corner 33rd and Morgan St. All the Lithuanians, men and women, come to the meeting, join this society, help us to bring up the Lithuanians from the sleep of lethargy. Let us spread enlightenment and education among our ignorant brothers.</p>
