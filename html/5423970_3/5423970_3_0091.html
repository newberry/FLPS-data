   <p>The Second District of the Lithuanian Alliance of America has decided to hold a bazaar in Milda Hall, Bridgeport, at the end of this month and the beginning of the next month. The proceeds from this bazaar will be given to the fund for the asylum home [a home for the aged] which the Lithuanian Alliance of America organization is planning to establish.</p>
   <p>The Second District has also revived the question of the erection of a Lithuanian hall in Chicago. It says that it is a disgrace to Chicago Lithuanians that such a large Lithuanian colony has not up to the present time built a hall of its own. This second district has appointed a <span class="page-break">\2</span>committee for the purpose of consulting with other Lithuanian societies of Chicago, regarding erection of such a hall. If other societies will not join in this project, then the second district will erect the hall alone.</p>
