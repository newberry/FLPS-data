   <p>A total of $363.11 was collected at a mass meeting held last Monday evening at St. George's parish hall, 32nd Place and Auburn [now Lituanica] Avenue. The principal speakers at the meeting were Mr. Martynas Ycas, Lithuanian representative in the Russian Duma, and Reverend Jonas Zilinskas. Both recently arrived in America from Europe for the purpose of raising funds for Lithuanian war relief.</p>
   <p>Reverend Zilinskas, the first speaker, delivered a long but very interesting address on what he saw in Lithuania after it was occupied by the German army.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ycas, the second speaker, explained the plight of Lithuanian refugees in Russia. [Translator's note: A copy of these two addresses appear in this issue of the Lietuva.]</p>
   <p>The hall was filled to capacity. Everyone listened very attentively to the "voice of the Fatherland", the two guests from Lithuania. Both orations were illustrated with slides, which were made from photographs of Lithuanian refugees in Russia and war scenes in Lithuania. These photographs were brought to America by Mr. Ycas and Reverend Zilinskas.</p>
