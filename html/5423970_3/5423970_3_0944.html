   <p>The newspaper Saule (The Sun) scolds the Aurora Society and the public for their inconstancy and carelessness. This is true. Would the revolution have occurred in Russia if there had been no educated people who devoted their lives to the welfare of humanity and freedom? Who will take the places of the dead revolutionary leaders?</p>
   <p>We must take into consideration the increasing of our power, how to develop the present and the future leaders of the revolution. We must support the revolution, the political prisoners, but do not forget the most important organization, the Aurora. At present the Aurora Students Fund is getting very few donations. Has the Aurora Society outlived its age? In such an event, I appeal to the public that it should not stop helping the Aurora Society, because without the support of the public this organization cannot fulfill its aim.</p>

   <p>President of the Aurora Society.</p>
