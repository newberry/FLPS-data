   <p>When new business was being discussed at the last meeting of St. Rocco's Society, the president, Mr. Peter Milosevicius, brought up the question of donations to the cause of Lithuania's independence. After an earnest discussion, the members decided that it is necessary to donate now; for the present moment is the most important in the history of Lithuania, and no Lithuanian should miss even the slightest opportunity to do something to help Lithuania win her freedom.</p>
   <p>Realizing the need of donations for this important matter, the members voted to donate three hundred dollars--two hundred dollars in Liberty Bonds and one hundred dollars in cash.</p>
   <p>A committee composed of three members, Peter Milosevicius, Michael Polionis, and John I. Bagdziunas, was selected to forward the donation. The committee is authorized to send the money to the fund which the majority of the members prefer. [Editor's note: Several relief and autonomy funds had been organized among <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Lithuanian-Americans.]</p>
   <p>St. Rocco's Society is the oldest [Lithuanian organization] in this vicinity. It was the first Lithuanian society to be established on the West Side, and it can be regarded as the founder of the Lithuanian [Our Lady of Vilna] parish on the West Side.</p>
   <p>The members of St. Rocco's Society have always supported Lithuanian causes, and with the present contribution are continuing that policy.</p>
