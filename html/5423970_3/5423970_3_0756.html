   <p>Last Saturday evening at Aurora Hall, 3149 South Halsted Street, the Lithuanian Lovers of Motherland Society, Branch 22, held its social evening. Those present were almost entirely all young people who danced and played various games. It may be said that this evening had a family atmosphere. The host of the evening was Mr. A. Visbaras. Ten new members joined the society. Now Branch 22 has one hundred and twenty members.</p>
