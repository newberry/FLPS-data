   <p>The Lithuanian Press Society held its fifth conference in Chicago on June 11, 12, and 13. A number of important decisions were made. It was decided to create a Lithuanian information bureau for the purpose of disseminating information about Lithuanians in the American press. This bureau is to be established in connection with the Lithuanian Relief and Autonomy Fund. In our opinion, this is a very important and timely decision.</p>
   <p>It was also decided to create an international league of oppressed nationalities, in order that all such nationalities may work together for greater liberty. Such a league would greatly enhance the possibilities of each nationality for gaining freedom; the Lithuanians would also greatly benefit.</p>
   <p>A resolution was adopted at the conference, protesting to the American press against the unfair practice of referring to provinces of Lithuania as provinces of Poland. War between Germany and Russia is now being waged on Lithuanian soil, which the American press erroneously calls "a part of Poland". Copies of the resolution will be mailed to the larger American newspapers.</p>
   <p>In order to establish relations with other nationalities for the purpose of organizing the International League of Oppressed Nationalities, Dr. J. Sliupas, and B. K. Balutis, who is a member of the editorial staff of the Lietuva (Lithuania), visited the officials of the most influential Czech and Croatian newspapers in Chicago, and also conferred with prominent Chicago Finns and Latvians.</p>
