   <p>A Liberty Week mass meeting was held in All Saints Parish Hall in Roseland on December 15. The purpose of the meeting was to collect donations for the cause of Lithuania's independence.</p>
   <p>The speakers were the local pastor, Reverend P. Lapelis; a local businessman and well-known leader, J.J. Stonkus; and Reverend F. Kemesis. They all spoke to good effect on the present plight of Lithuania. There were many people present, and a total of $3,165.23 was collected. The Roselanders may well be proud of donating this large sum.</p>
   <p>The church choir, under the direction of the organist, Mr. V. Nickus, sang several stirring songs. The mass meeting closed with the singing of the Lithuanian national anthem.</p>
