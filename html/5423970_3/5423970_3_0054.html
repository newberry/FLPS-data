   <p>In the north side section of Chicago we have had a variety of speakers: national, political and religious. But on the 12th day of November, at the St. Michael Archangel Church hall, there was delivered an entirely different speech by J. Elias, about the Lithuanian hospital. I am sorry to say that his speech had no relation to the proposed project, the Lithuanian hospital. He stated how one worker was dying in a hospital, how Elias himself induced the priest to bring the cross to the dying man to be kissed. Further on he said that the Lithuanians must contribute $40,000, for which they can buy the lots for the hospital, then when the lots are bought, Americans will build the hospital building and the hospital will be under the control of the Americans.</p>
   <p>If the hospital is not to be under Lithuanian control, why then must the Lithuanians contribute money for such a hospital? It is much better for Lithuanians to send a few Lithuanian doctors to <span class="page-break">\2</span>the County Hospital, where the sick Lithuanians could talk with the doctor in their own language. After the so-called speech, the Lithuanians were conversing among themselves, saying that they do not see what benefit such a hospital would bring to the Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>It would be a good thing if the promoters of the hospital would announce their program for the hospital to be built. Otherwise the people are in darkness. Are private hospitals better than those hospitals which are under public control?</p>
