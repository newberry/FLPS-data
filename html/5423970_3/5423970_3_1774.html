   <p>Whereas the Rev. Krawczunas attacked me personally without any foundation, I am forced to repel the attack and answer the charges. In No. 49 of Lietuva, the readers have seen the complaints brought by Rev. Krawczunas against me before two societies: Simonas Daukantas and St. Casimir. Rev. Krawczunas charges against me (1) that I broke the laws of the church and the by-laws, and that I have separated from the Roman-Catholic church; (2) that I wanted to appropriate the church land, that I am raising disturbances for wrongful assignment of the church property; (3) that I have mocked the nuns as the Russians have done in Kraziai. (Kraziai is a small town in Lithuania. In previous writings I have related the massacre of the Lithuanian Catholics by the Russian Cossacks in that small town. This massacre of the Lithuanian Catholicas was prearranged by the parish priest of Karaziai in such a manner as to deceive the Lithuanian Catholics.</p>

   <p>When one says something against the priest, they always say that you are doing like the Russians at Kraziai); (4) that without foundation I attack the secrecy of the confession, etc.</p>
   <p>(1) I pray the Rev. Krawczunas to show when I separated from the Roman-Catholic church. The same this year as every year I went to confession in your church and gave $10 for it. Previously I gave more: in 1896, $25; 1895, $13. I took the nuptial vows in your church. Does this mean separation from the church?</p>
   <p>(2) What land of the church was I trying to appropriate? Is it the land where in the past year I laid a sidewalk? The land at that time belonged to the city. When the city gave it to the church I removed my sidewalk, wrote a letter to you and asked you to occupy the land. Is this the breaking of the church laws and the constitution?</p>

   <p>(3) Raising the turmoil for assignment of the church property to the Catholic bishop of Chicago as a corporation sale. Of course, such assignment is not right. If this were all the Catholic nations would have their church property assigned to the bishop. In Chicago the Germans, French, Czechs, etc., have their church property deeded in the name of the parish, while the bishop is only a trustee. Why then is the Polish and the Lithuanian church property deeded in the bishop's name only? Do the Lithuanians and the Poles belong to some other God?</p>
   <p>(4) When and which nuns have I ever mocked? We did not criticize the nuns for being nuns, but we did say that if they are Polish they do not know the Lithuanian language; they cannot teach the Lithuanian children. You and your nuns are destroying Lithuanianism. If all the parish schools would do as you are doing, in a few years no Lithuanian names would remain. Is this mocking of the nuns? All <a name="p4" class="page-break">4</a>the Lithuanian priests, not only in America, but in Europe, too, are condemning your Polish nuns. Some of the priests are begging us to criticize you as long as you keep the Polish nuns. Therefore, according to the Rev. Krawczunas, all the other priests are also infidels, and all the Lithuanian societies must be under the control of Rev. Krawczunas.</p>
   <p>(5) Did I speak without grounds about your detestable acts perpetrated at the confession? You have seized my private letter written to A. Kalasauskas. You wrongfully stated its contents (saying) that I was trying to persuade the wife of Mr. Kalasauskas to quit him because I wanted to marry Kalasauskas to another woman. They who have read my letter found that I never wrote such a letter. That at the confession <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>you have tried to separate a young wife from her husband is known not by me alone, but also by more than one hundred people. This woman even today condemns you for such an evil confession. When that woman asked you what she should do, how could she live, who would support her after she left her husband, you told her to come to the rectory to live with you, that you would support her. Such was the purpose of your confession, to persuade women to quit their husbands! Is it right for the priest to do that? Even the lowest hoodlum would be ashamed of such an act. Am I guilty on that account? And for this exposure of your conduct you want to expel me from society.</p>
   <p>I did not start to pick a quarrel with you, although I had watched your detestable behavior, but I pretended that I did not understand your activities. The trouble between us came over the school, which is the greatest public object of our national affairs. To improve the schools is the duty of every Lithuanian who loves his nation, <a name="p6" class="page-break">6</a>in order that the Polish leprosy may not torture our nation any more. This Polish disease has killed many Lithuanians since Vagiello. We, as good Lithuanians, are wishing the best for our school. We were not against the nuns because they are nuns, but because we are against the Polanization of our children in the Lithuanian schools. And for this the honorable priest is attacking and insulting me.</p>
