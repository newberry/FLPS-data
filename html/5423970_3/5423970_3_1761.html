   <p>The trial, in which Rev. Krawczunas sued us for an article published in Lietuva, October, the last year, when we criticized the rector for not giving an honest account of the St. George Parish budget and his drunkenness, came to an end after five days, and we won the case. The court found the editor and the publisher of Lietuva not guilty. The court heard thirty of our witnesses (we had many more of them), who proved that our statements against the Rev. Krawczunas were true, and that we did not expose even one part of the bad doings of the rector.</p>
   <p>The witnesses brought up all the dirt of Rev. Krawczunas before the court. All the newspapers in every language in Chicago wrote broadly about this trial, exposing all the dirt of our rector. Only the Polish ultra-clerical newspapers kept quiet about this trial. This trial exposed the dirty reputation, not only of Rev. Krawczunas, but undermined the reputation of other Catholic priests. Rev. Krawczunas had said that he could not be judged by the civil courts, but we found out that not only could he be judged, but that we had full rights under the law to expose the misdeeds of the priest to the public.</p>
   <p>Rev. Kraczunas had three Polish priests as witnesses. One of the priests said that the rector was not supposed to give the right to the parish committee to examine the books and the parish budget. (Perhaps the Polish priest does not know that among the Germans, the French and the Czechs, the parish budget is under the control of the church committee, but not of the priest).</p>
   <p>Later on we will write more fully about our trial. We are thanking all of those who have showed their sympathy and helped us in this trial.</p>
   <p>There is another case pending against us, brought by Rev. Krawczunas, for the two articles in Lietuva in which we exposed his conduct of the parish affairs.</p>
   <p>In the second trial we will have more chance to expose much more dirt about our rector's conduct. Of course, this exposure will not uplift the reputation of Rev. Krawczunas, nor that of the others.</p>
