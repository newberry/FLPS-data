   <p>Let us do our best to place our names on this honorary scroll. If we cannot place our individual names there, let us place the names of the societies of which we are members, and inscribe their names in the pages of the history of honor. Let us prove that we love our nation not less than the Lithuanians of Lithuania, or anywhere else!</p>
