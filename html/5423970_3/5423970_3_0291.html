   <p>The local committee of the Relief and Autonomy Fund of Lithuania has begun to work for the benefit of the war sufferers in Lithuania. For that purpose they will hold fairs on February 5, 12, and 16 at Baukus Hall, 8430 Vincennes Road. There will be a variety of prizes to be won. Lithuanians are cordially invited to come to these fairs in order to help their brothers who have suffered from the present war.</p>
   <p>Englewood Lithuanians can be proud of their contributions to the Lithuanian war sufferers. They are not forgetting our fatherland, Lithuania, and our starving brothers. The St. August Bishop Society arranged for some lectures in this Lithuanian colony. The speakers were Dr. A. L. Graciunas, S. Tananevicius, and J. Gelambeskis. An attempt was made to organize a parish here, but it did not succeed. A committee has been elected, which will go from house to house to get the signatures of those who want to erect a church in Englewood. In his speech, Dr. Graciunas urged the public to donate to the war sufferers in Lithuania. The sum of $6.50 was collected and delivered to the local committee for the war sufferers.</p>
