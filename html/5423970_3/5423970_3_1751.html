   <p>In all parts of Chicago the Lithuanians are getting signatures for a petition to the bishop with regard to the removal of the Rev. Krawczunas. They have received many signatures and in a day or two the petition will be sent to the bishop. The priest's friends are also gathering signatures for their petition. But the question is, how many Lithuanian and how many Polish signatures the priest will have.</p>
