   <p>The delegates from thirty-eight Lithuanian societies of Chicago held their meeting June 19, at St. George's Hall, and decided to participate in the celebration arranged by the "Sane Fourth Association."</p>
   <p>In the parade, the Lithuanians will have a beautifully decorated float. It will represent the historical event of 1318, when the keys of the city of Kiev were delivered to the Grand Duke Gedeminas of Lithuania. This float will be made by Mr. Stanislovas Pocevicius.</p>
   <p>The Lietuva Band has promised to play without compensation. The Mark White Square Orchestra and the Birutes Choir, will perform gratuitously also. The program will start at 3 P. M. Besides the orchestra and the Birutes Choir, there will be English and Lithuanian speakers. Mr. K. B. Balevicius, and Mr. Povilas Mazeika will speak in Lithuanian, and J. J. Hertmanavicia, an American, in English.</p>
   <p>It was decided that all the societies ought to help to cover the expense of this celebration. We are also asking individuals to send their contributions to the committee or to the treasurer.</p>
