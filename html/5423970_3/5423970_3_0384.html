   <p>On December 4 a young Lithuanian from Roseland, Mr. Jonas Jcas, departed for Lithuania. He was a very able and studious youth, and had attended the Chicago schools and Valparaiso University. As a result of his hard studies, he became afflicted with tuberculosis, and the doctors advised him to go to Lithuania, where he might regain his health.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Jcas was in good health, he was a good student, and in his misfortune his friends have not neglected him. They have collected $144.95. In Roseland, Mr. Dagis and Mr. J. Varekojis have collected $35.50; in Steger, Illinois, Mr. M. Krisikenas collected $22.50; in Rockford, Illinois, Mr. K. Miksis collected $28; in the Lithuanian Zion Evangelical Lutheran parish in Chicago, Rev. J. J. D. Razokas collected $23.85. Mr. A. Sliakis and Mr. P. Viangis donated $10 each, and Mr. A. Zadokas and others donated $5 each....</p>
