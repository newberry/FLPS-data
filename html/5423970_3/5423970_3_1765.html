   <p>Last week the trial against A. Olszewski's newspaper Lietuva, which published an article maligning personally Rev. M. Kraucunas, was held at the Criminal Court of Cook County. At this trial, the state's attorney acted as accuser against Olszewski for criminal maligning against Rev. M. Kraucunas. Rev. M. Kraucunas lost the case against Olszewski on account of bad witnesses and their limited understanding of the case. In addition, the jury seemed too partial and not in sympathy with Catholic priests, and A. Olszewski was acquitted and found not guilty by the jury.</p>
   <p>Rev. M. Kraucunas, feeling personally insulted by the article which was published in Lietuva by Olszewski, will make another complaint against Olszewski. The first case against A. Olszewski was handled by the state and not by Rev. Kraucunas. The articles which were published in Lietuva made special emphasis about some damages that were done by Rev. M. Kraucunas and he will sue for damages and making expenses. All those statements in their articles have no basis of logic, nothing but complete lies.</p>
