   <p>The third convention of the Lithuanian Students' Alliance of America was held in Aurora Hall last week. Among its more important decisions the following are noteworthy: that the proposed general convention of Lithuanian-Americans is necessary, and that this convention be held in Chicago on September 25.</p>
   <p>Stephen Biezis, A.J. Karalius, and J. Naujalis were elected delegates to the general convention. The delegates were authorized to act independently, but were instructed to uphold the side of the progressives in the coming convention. The Alliance decided to "become legal" and elected a committee for this purpose. [Translator's note: "Becoming legal" apparently means that the Alliance had decided to apply for a state charter.] It was further decided that the decisions of the Alliance's convention should be published in the Jaunimo Sapnai and that the next convention be held in 1915, again in Chicago. [Translator's note: <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Jaunimo Sapnai was a periodical published by the Alliance.] The following were elected to the executive committee: Stephen Biezis (former editor of the Jaunimo Sapnai), president; D. Bagocius, vice-president; J. Naujalis, treasurer; Valasnis and Benosius, trustees; J. Vitkus, secretary; F. Zuraulis, assistant secretary. A.J. Karalius and K. Augustinavicius were appointed editors of the Jaunimo Sapnai. Other committees were made up of practically the same people.</p>
