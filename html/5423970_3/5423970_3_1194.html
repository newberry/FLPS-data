   <p>February 12 is the anniversary of Lincoln's birth. This day is celebrated all over the United States of America as a national holiday. Other presidents do not deserve such commemoration because neither patriotically nor morally are they worthy of notice. Other presidents are the tools of the political parties which they represent.</p>
