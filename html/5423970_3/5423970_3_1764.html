   <p>Dr. Szliupas of Scranton, Pa. left Chicago last Tuesday. He was in Chicago over one week, to deliver lectures. Many people came to hear his lectures. The newspaper Katalikas says that on Easter Sunday many people came to church to hear the serman on "The Devil, the Toad and the Bat."</p>
   <p>With such foolish arguments, as every one understands, even the Church cannot convince the people that Dr. Szliupas is such. In his lectures Dr. Szliupas has told the people how much malignity the clergy has spread among the people. To call the doctor bad names will not convince the people how bad Dr. Szliupas is. The priests must have better arguments. We are sorry to say that our priests have no better argument than slander.</p>
