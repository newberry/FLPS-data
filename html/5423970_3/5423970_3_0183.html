   <p>Lithuanian Day (Tag Day) committees have been formed in all Chicago Lithuanian colonies. These committees are units of the Central Chicago Lithuanian Committee which was recently organized to make plans for and to conduct the Lithuanian Day, November 1, 1916.</p>
   <p>The main purpose of the neighborhood committees is to recruit girls and women as solicitors for the Lithuanian Day.</p>
   <p>All girls and women who wish to act as solicitors are asked to notify the committees in their neighborhoods. If that be inconvenient, then fill out and sign the blank on this page and send it to the Central Chicago Lithuanian Committee, care of Mr. C. Kasputis, 3246 South Halsted Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The names and addresses of the members of the various committees in each colony are given, together with a long list of names of girls and women who have pledged to act as solicitors.]</p>
