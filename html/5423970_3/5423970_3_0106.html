   <p>At St. George's church hall, 33rd and Auburn Avenue, the delegates of 20 Lithuanian societies held a meeting. At the meeting there was a discussion of the proposition that the Lithuanian societies of Chicago should unite and build a Lithuanian hall, where the Chicago Lithuanians could hold their lectures, concerts and other performances. Because at present Lithuanian activity is increasing, such a hall is most essential.</p>
   <p>This problem has been discussed since the last year, and several meetings have been held for that purpose. It was decided to call a meeting of all the Lithuanian societies, regardless of their national, political or religious views. To accomplish such a task all the Lithuanians must be organized, in order to establish such a project.</p>
   <p>Up to the present time the Lithuanians have been unable to unify themselves; it has been impossible to establish something substantial.</p>

   <p>Every time the Lithuanians started to carry out some project there has always been an obstacle, even though the project was for the benefit of all the Lithuanian public in general. Even the Lithuanian Catholics, whom the clergy call fools, began to realize that they needed something better than the church. When the clergy saw that the Chicago Lithuanians were aiming at higher ideals (to establish the Lithuanian hall for cultural purposes), the clergy jumped in against such a project. Seven Lithuanian Roman-Catholic priests held a meeting and decided to warn all religious societies not to take part in the establishment of the Lithuanian hall. Here I will give in full text the clergy's appeal:</p>
   <p>"January 5, 1908.</p>
   <p>"Whereas, as it is known to all of us from the past that at no time came any benefit to Catholicism or Lithuanianism when the Catholics or the Catholic societies joined the free thinking Lithuanian societies, since such a unity always has brought disputes and disorder, which has brought disaster to the nation and religion.</p>
   <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>
   <p>"The Lithuanian Alliance of America, as we all know, consisted of Lithuanian Catholics, but those that did not care for religion have had no peace in the organization until it was split into two different, struggling parties, which brought thousands of dollars of expense and much trouble. All the riots in our parishes came from the agitation of freethinkers, and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, our Catholic Societies are living in peace and are working for the glory of God and for the good of the fatherland,</p>
   <p>"Therefore, we, the undersigned priests, warn the Catholic societies that they should have nothing to do with such societies which do not recognize the Catholic religion and do not agree with Catholic principles. We wish that all the Lithuanian Catholics should form a union and establish our own Lithuanian hall. Then nobody will interfere in our activities.</p>

   <p>Besides this, the rector of St. George's church, Rev. M. Krawczunas, at the parish meeting, warned the parish president, Mr. Butkus, that he should see that Catholic societies must not enter into closer relations with the liberal national societies. The priest denounced the liberal societies, saying that if any parishioner would join the national society, he will go straight to hell.</p>
   <p>When the meeting was called to order the appeal of the seven priests was read. Some of the parishioners obeyed the order of the St. George's church rector and several timid delegates got scared at the priest's warning, but a majority of the delegates in their short speeches expressed the necessity of such a Lithuanian hall. They stated that such a hall has nothing to do with any religion, if the clergy will not permit union with the liberal societies then it is clear that the clergy does not want the people to make progress. The clergy's aim is to keep the people in darkness, to hold their meetings in saloons and church halls, and always to be in fear of the devil and the priest. After the discussion all understood why the clergy are <a name="p5" class="page-break">5</a>against such unity and such a hall, where the priests cannot put the bridle on the people. At the meeting it was decided not to pay attention to the priests' warning, but to go forward with the project to establish the Lithuanian hall. The priest told the people that if they will not obey his order he will not permit any more meetings in the parish hall. The delegates decided to hold the next meeting at Radavicius hall.</p>
   <p>This meeting proved that the ignorant people exploited by the priests began to think that they are human beings, not the slaves of the priests. I have heard the people saying that we have built the church, the rectory, the priests' pockets we have filled with money, now the priest is threatening us with hell because we are trying to establish a Lithuanian cultural center. I do not know why all the Lithuanian national, liberal societies did not take part or sent their delegates to this meeting.</p>
   <p>P. Sermunelis.</p>
