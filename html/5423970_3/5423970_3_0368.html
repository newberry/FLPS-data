   <p>A large number of young people assembled at the home of Miss B. Zilvicius last Saturday night to sample some candy which had been sent from Lithuania. The meeting, which seemed to have no definite purpose, nevertheless served a useful purpose.....During the dinner speeches and recitations were made. Everybody's attention was turned to the present European war. The young people, realizing the difficulties which Lithuania must face at this time, donated a total of thirteen dollars to aid Lithuanians who are suffering because of the war. The money was turned over to B. Lenkauskas, with instructions that it be sent to the Lietuva editors. [Lietuva Editor's Note: We have received the thirteen-dollar donation from Mr. B. Lenkauskas.]</p>
