   <p>It is said that the first Lithuanians have begun to live in this district of Chicago. Even though the Lithuanians have lived here for a long time, on the national field they have accomplished nothing. Three years ago there was built a Lithuanian Roman-Catholic church. The national Lithuanian organizations started to organize only two years ago. There was organized the Gedeminas Theatrical Society, but when the priest found out that this society had no confession clause in its by-laws, he re-wrote the by-laws without the knowledge and consent of the society members, put in the confession clause (that every member must perform the confession). A majority of the members left the society. Later the society died.</p>
   <p>On February 2nd there was organized the branch of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. It has arranged lectures in order to get more members for the local branch of the Lithuanian Alliance of America. When the leaflets were distributed at the church, the priest told a few of his blind followers to destroy the leaflets. They beat up the man who distributed the leaflets. Now even the blind fanatics of the priest know that the greatest aim of the priest is to keep the people ignorant.</p>
