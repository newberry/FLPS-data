   <p>The project of calling a general convention of Lithuanians in America, proposed because of the state of war in Europe and the threat of danger to Lithuania, has won the sincere support of our masses. Individuals, various organizations, and the larger part of our press are in full accord with the suggestion.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian Alliance of America, as is usual when important matters are involved, was the first organization to respond. As we can judge from the appeal appearing in this issue of the Lietuva, the central body of this organization has become very active. The officers of the Second District (Chicago) of the Lithuanian Alliance of America are also showing much activity.</p>
   <p>The Second District has brought forth a new method in preparing for a general convention. As can be seen in the local news column of this edition, the Second District, taking the initiative, is inviting all of the Chicago societies, of which we have many, to attend a pre-convention conference.</p>
   <p>The importance of such a conference is self-evident. Many matters will be cleared up in the general discussion. The path, as it were, will be opened to the general convention and delegates will proceed to the latter having a clearly stated opinion of their local people and knowing their reaction to the whole problem.</p>
   <p>Such conferences are also important because they are the binding links between the convention itself and the people of different localities.</p>
   <p>By attending discussions of the matter, electing delegates from their societies, and holding meetings with the delegates in their homes, the people will undoubtedly become interested in the whole matter and, as a result, the verdicts of the convention will be a fuller expression of the opinions of all of the Lithuanians in America than if arrived at by other means.</p>
   
   <p>In our opinion, it would be a good thing if the work in all the colonies were organized along the same lines.</p>
   <p>The Lovers of the Motherland Society also promises to respond favorably to the suggestion for a general convention. We have learned that Dr. A. J. Zimontas, president of the executive committee of the Society, is preparing a statement to be released by the executive committee.</p>
   <p>Among the newspapers, we have noticed that the Tevyne, Vienybe Lietuvninku, Katalikas, Draugas, Naujienos, and Saule have commented on the suggestion. Not one of the newspapers commenting on this proposal has expressed itself as being opposed to the principle of a general convention. Some have expressed their doubts about whether it will be possible for all factions to meet for a general discussion and whether they could understand each other.</p>
   <p>In our opinion, a common discussion depends on the honest willingness of all of us. If we call everybody together with the idea of working with a united spirit and then begin to prod one another with charges of impossibility or unwillingness to agree, nothing will come of the project.</p>
   <p>At times like this everyone needs to show the highest degree of tolerance. The relations between the separate factions are strained--that we all well know. At this time, however, it is necessary for all factions to show the maximum of intelligence, tact, and submissiveness--at least for the moment. Everyone of our parties and factions is now confronted with a test of its maturity. The test will prove whether a party or faction is mature and whether its leaders and representatives are farsighted. The proferred suggestion will also show which of us are human beings and Lithuanians and which are not.</p>
   <p>We want to believe that all factions will pass these tests, figuratively speaking. At the same time, it is our opinion that such a reaction to the matter is the only thing which can be an aid to the realization of the present suggestion.</p>
   
   <p>There is hardly any basis for saying that the question of a revolution will not be discussed at the proposed convention. In our opinion the convention will discuss all that is necessary to be discussed. If the revolution question appears worthy of discussion to the convention, it undoubtedly will be included in the day's program. Everything depends on how the delegates look upon the present situation in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The same can be said about the idea of a Lithuanian-Latvian republic, which the honorable Dr. J. Sliupas has been propagandizing for a long time.</p>
   <p>We now hear that the political status of Lithuania is a question which should be relegated to the Lithuanians living in Lithuania. In this case the purpose of the convention would be confined to founding the Fund to Aid Lithuania.</p>
   <p>Such a restriction of the purposes of the convention would be hardly suitable. If the political circumstances in Lithuania were to be altered, it can be predicted that a large number of Lithuanians would return to their native land. They are not unconcerned about the trend of circumstances there.</p>
   
   <p>Every person has the right to be concerned about the future of his native land and to strive to steer it onto one path or another. It seems that that right should not be denied even to the Lithuanian emigrants.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians in America reveal a sufficiently intense concern about their native land. This is testified to by the hundreds of thousands of dollars which flow out of America to private individuals in Lithuania and the huge sums which have been donated by Lithuanian-Americans for public needs in Lithuania. Because of this the Lithuanian emigrants have the right to concern themselves with the country of their birth.</p>
   <p>Nobody can say that only the Lithuanians of America have the right to make final decisions in Lithuania's political questions. The opinion of the Lithuanians there is important. We believe it is even more important than our opinion. However, in the present circumstances, Lithuania cannot even pause to deliberate its affairs. As far as we know, there is no political center there from which it would be possible to address all of Lithuania. The conditions of freedom in America permit Lithuanian-Americans to help the Lithuanians overseas in this matter, at least to a certain degree. What the Lithuanians here might decide may meet with the approval of the majority in Lithuania, and it may not. If it meets with approval, the plan would then already be organized beforehand and the most successful results could be expected. If, however, the decisions of the Americans differed from the wishes of the majority in Lithuania, the deliberation of the matter here will be beneficial because it will bring forth ideas and suggestions. Therefore, from any point of view, the raising of the question of the political future of Lithuania at the proposed convention is desirable.</p>
   <p>Difficulties are arising in the selection of the site of the convention. The Vienybe Lietuvninku suggests New York as the place for the convention, but gives no reasons for this suggestion. In his appeal Mr. J. Gabrys suggests Chicago, but also neglects to offer reasons. The Draugas also suggests Chicago and sets the date for September 25. Draugas bases its suggestion on the fact that the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Alliance's Congress will take place in Chicago at that time and the delegates of the Catholic parishes and societies will meet here. In that manner, according to Draugas, "it will not be necessary for many to make two trips to two different places at unnecessary expense. It would be better to donate the money to a fund for helping those who must suffer because of the war." Besides this, as Draugas also states, Chicago has the largest Lithuanian colony and in it "all of our factions and larger organizations are well represented; here, also, are the offices of our largest newspapers".</p>
   <p>We think that the local Lithuanians and the Catholics who will assemble here will not be enough. It can be expected that many delegates would come here from various places. However, in our opinion, the date selected by Draugas is too early. It would not be possible to arrange everything satisfactorily and to have a truly representative convention of Lithuanians in America.</p>
   <p>We advocate Chicago as the convention site for one more reason: because Chicago is centrally located it would be possible for the colonies in western states to send delegates. It would be easier for both the East and West to meet in the Middle West than for the West to travel to the East. There are so many Lithuanian colonies in Illinois and surrounding states that the Lithuanian population about equals that of the eastern states.</p>
   <p>It would be desirable to hear the opinions of other newspapers. It must be pointed out that, with the exception of the Naujienos, not one of the Socialist newspapers has replied to the suggestion. However, we hope that partisanship will be forgotten at this time and that everybody will work for the common good. We see no obstacles.</p>
