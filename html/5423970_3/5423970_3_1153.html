   <p>A large number of people visited the St. Casimir's Cemetery (111th Street and Crawford Avenue) Decoration Day. No special prayers or ceremonies were planned, therefore, the people did not assemble at any special time. Because of this, people were coming in and going out all day. Each one hurried to the graves of his loved ones to decorate them once more or to pray fervently in the sad quiet of the Cemetery..... It is said that during the whole day, ten thousand people visited the Cemetery..... About 1:30 P.M., a crowd of people gathered around the graves of the two garment workers who were killed about three years ago during the garment workers' strike. Twelve wreaths, from various unions, were placed on the graves. Two Lithuanians and two Americans spoke at the decorated graves.....</p>
