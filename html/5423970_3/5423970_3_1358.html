   <p>Preparation for the convention lasted several weeks. Saturday, May 26th, all the Lithuanian houses were decorated with American and Lithuanian flags, and on Sunday more houses were decorated. This showed that Lithuanians felt more for the Lithuanian Alliance of America than for the Rev. Krawczunas, who denounced the convention and warned Lithuanians not to participate in the parade and convention. All the Lithuanian colony looked very nice. It looked like a national holiday. The decoration of the houses made a large impression and brought back feelings of the old fatherland. One thing is unforgettable. The Lithuanian workers decorated their houses with flags, but the Rev. Krawczunas did not decorate the parish property, the rectory and the church stood without decoration like a nettle among flowers. The priest is a good lover of the fatherland!</p>
   <p>May 27th was not such a good day; it was cold and rainy. At noon-time the rain stopped. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when the parade started it began to rain again. Many people got wet. Even though the Rev. Krawczunas warned and scolded the people that they should not take part in the convention, they participated in the parade. Thirteen Lithuanian societies participated in the parade which was ten blocks long. There were seventy coaches. Two coaches were pulled by four <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>horses. The parade started from 33rd and Morgan Street; 33rd to Halsted, Halsted to 31st Street, then to La Salle Street, then back to 33rd Street, and 33rd to State Street, to the convention hall.</p>
   <p>When the public came to the hall at 4:30 in the afternoon, the program started. The program consisted of forty numbers! It was known at the beginning that to complete every number of the program was impossible. The public could not sit for 8 or 10 hours at one time. Ten numbers of the program were left out because the program lasted to 11:00 P.M.</p>
   <p>The celebration meeting was called to order by M.J. Damijonaitis. The first speaker on the program was Mr. A. Olszevskis. He in his anti-clerical speech attacked the clergy, especially in Chicago, who warned the societies not to participate in this celebration. He said that unity among Lithuanians is the most essential affair. The second speaker was an American, attorney Morse Ives as representative of the Mayor of Chicago. He spoke about the benefit of citizenship in this country. He stated that if the Lithuanians do not become citizens, they will be lost and disappear as a nation; they will become denationalized. It is <a name="p3" class="page-break">3</a>a peculiar statement from a lawyer that citizenship will protect nationality. Then the Dr. Kudirka choir sang "Fatherland", and "From a Far Country". The singing was very good. The fourth number on the program was a declamation delivered by a small girl, L. Laukiute, and a boy, E. Domijonaitukas. (5) A speech by A.J.

Beidel, gave a few popular Lithuanian melodies. We are grateful to Mr. Beidel, even though he is not Lithuanian, he has devoted much of his time and energy to preparing the Lithuanian choir.

   <p>The program was a great success. The Chicago Lithuanians never had such a celebration before. This festival will remain in their minds for a long time. It must be mentioned that the hall was very nicely decorated, especially with Chinese candles. A large sign was hanging in the front with the description, "Freedom to Lithuania and Success to the Twenty-first convention". There were pictures of the Duke Keistutis of Lithuania, Lincoln and Washington; and on the sides were the pictures of Vytautas, Algirdas and Gedeminas, the grand dukes of Lithuania. On the front of the stage, was the flowing wreath of the Lithuanian Alliance Branch 36, and the Lyre made of flowers by the Dr. V. Kudirka choir as a present to the Twenty-first convention.</p>
