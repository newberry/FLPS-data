   <p>Up to the present time the leaders of the "Aurora" have been denounced and defamed. I am the newly-elected president of this organization, and as yet I have not been denounced and defamed by those people, who have never accomplished anything good for the "Aurora" society or the nation.</p>
   <p>All the attacks on the former administration were mythological, being based only on imagination. This attack emanated from uncultured people. We always will have misunderstandings among the members as long as they do not find the causes of these misunderstandings in their own minds.</p>
   <p>The first cause is that the members always think of benefit to themselves. The second cause of the misunderstanding is psychological. The third cause is the lack of friendship among the members.</p>

   <p>The fourth cause is the the lack of enlightenment among the members and lack of national feeling.</p>
   <p>Previously, it was remarked that the leaders, the administration of the "Aurora" society, are no good, not active enough, etc. Now, the "Aurora" society of Chicago has elected a new administration. We ask the public to join us, to come to the meetings, bring your suggestions and criticism, and let us exchange opinion; thus we can solve our problems and find out what is wrong with the "Aurora" society and its administration.</p>
   <p>The new members of the "Aurora" first branch of Chicago:</p>
   <p>Dr. A. Rumkauskas, President; J. Sutkus, Secretary; F. Juozapaitis, Financial Secretary; and Mrs. Damijonaitiene, Treasurer.</p>
   <p>By Dr. A. Rutkauskas.</p>
