   <p>We are often reading in the newspapers that there was organized a new Lithuanian club. But unfortunately we cannot separate the good from the evil, very often the bad we are calling good, and to the good Lithuanian clubs we are refusing to join.</p>
   <p>The majority of our clubs are demoralizing our unenlightened brothers by spreading drunkenness; such clubs are weapons for the leaders of them. The clubs of other nationalities have as their duty the enlightenment of their members about the political laws, while our clubs are the political beggars, because they are not organized for the good of nationalism; such clubs are bringing profit to their leaders.</p>
   <p>Did our political clubs uplift our Lithuanian name, did they try by any effort to improve the living conditions of the poor? Not by any means.</p>
   
   <p>The politicians hate us, we become the drudges and are forced to follow them blindly, accept their schemes, and for obeying them they buy a keg of beer for us before election day. Therefore, from such club we are getting no benefit. We must reorganize our clubs on a better basis, on a moral foundation. Such clubs ought to have as their duty to enlighten and educate their members, but not to demoralize them.</p>
