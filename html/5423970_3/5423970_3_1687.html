   <p>The new parish of Chicago will have a public meeting on Saturday, April 12th, at 7 P. M., in the hall at 778 S. Halsted St. At this meeting we will confirm the parish constitution and discuss the matter of further organization in our parish. Therefore, we are inviting all the Lithuanian Catholics to attend this meeting and help us in this work with good suggestions.</p>

   <p>P. S.</p>
   <p>On the 11th day of April, Rev. Steponawiczius, former assistant of Rev. Krawczunas, called a parish meeting without the committee's knowledge. Whereas this parish was originally organized by the committee, everybody demands that its affairs be under the control of the committee and the majority of the parishioners. Priest Steponawiczius is trying to act like Rev. Krawczunas, that is, to do with the parish as he pleases.</p>
   <p>At the meeting the parishioners were not even permitted to speak to Rev. Steponaviczius. The parishioners believe that Rev. Steponaviczius made a secret agreement with Rev. Kraczunas to take control of the parish by himself and do as he sees fit. Is this true or not? We will learn later on.</p>
