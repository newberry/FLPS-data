   <p>A large crowd of Chicago Lithuanians travelled out to Willow Springs, May 30, so that they could decorate the Lithuanian National Cemetery that day. A special program wad provided for the occasion. The day's program started in the Cemetery at about 11 A. M. The Reverend Jankauskas, an independent minister, officiated at the services. It should be remarked that the Reverend Jankauskas is talented despite his youth. His prayer was in the Lithuanian language and notably moving. Then Mr. Pius Grigaitis made a speech adapted to that day. There were songs also, which were rendered by the National Club of Young Lithuanians in America. Then followed the Reverend Jankauskas' sermon.</p>
   <p>Attorney F. Braciulis [Translator's note.--also spelled Bradchulis, Brachulis] was in charge of the day's program. When the program ended the crowd went to the Blinstrupas Grove, where they remained until evening. A picnic was held there for the benefit of the Cemetery. It was later revealed that the picnic brought more than four hundred dollars profit for the Cemetery.</p>
   <p>It is apparent that the Cemetery is being well managed and that many improvements have been made since last year.</p>
   <p>The large crowd of people, probably about five thousand, conducted themselves well during the whole day and there were no reports of any misunderstandings.</p>
