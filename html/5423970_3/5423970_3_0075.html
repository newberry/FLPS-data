   <p>The Day Nursery Society, of which Mrs. A.J. Zymontas is president, is making steady progress in an effort to establish a day nursery in the Bridgeport district.</p>
   <p>It was planned to conduct a public tag day to collect funds for the establishment of the nursery, but this plan had to be abandoned because the Society is unable to recruit a sufficient number of solicitors (it has been estimated that at least one hundred solicitors are required to conduct a public tag day).</p>
   <p>In place of the tag-day plan, it was decided to print membership cards, and give one to each person who agrees to donate at least five dollars annually to a fund for the maintainance of the nursery. At present, the Society has about seventy dollars in its treasury.</p>
