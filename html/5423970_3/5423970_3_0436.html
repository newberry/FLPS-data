   <p>Anthony Zalatoris who, in 1917, stole forty thousand dollars from the State Bank of Chicago, where he was a clerk, was arrested recently in North Dakota, as the Lietuva reported last week. Now he has escaped from the detectives again--completely naked.</p>
   <p>When the sheriff of Glendive, North Dakota wired the Chicago police that he had arrested a "slacker" by the name of Alex Palmer, on whom were found 31 one-thousand dollar bills, the Chicago police immediately believed that it might be Anthony Zalatoris and sent two detectives to Glendive.</p>
   <p>The detectives recognized Zalatoris from his photographs, and he himself admitted that he was Zalatoris.</p>
   <p>Detective Sergeant Thomas McFarland handcuffed him and put him on the train which was to take them back to Chicago. The detective apparently realized that Zalatoris was full of tricks and therefore decided to be careful. He not only handcuffed him but, when it was time to go to bed, he undressed Zalatoris completely, <span class="page-break">\2</span>and put him in a Pullman bed. From time to time the detective looked into the berth to see how his "client" was sleeping.</p>
   <p>But Zalatoris did not sleep. After some time the detective threw back the covers of the bed, and found that Zalatoris was no longer there. He had jumped out of the window, naked and with his hands handcuffed. Apparently he is hiding somewhere in the woods in the vicinity of Hebron, North Dakota.</p>
   <p>Tried To Escape To South America</p>
   <p>It is now known that Zalatoris and his companion, Kochones, left Chicago in an automobile after they got the forty thousand dollars. After some time they came to the town of Hebron and there their automobile broke down. They stopped at the house of Gottried Walth, a farmer who lives near Hebron.</p>
   <p>The farmer had a beautiful daughter named Martha, who so attracted Zalatoris that he did not hurry about having the automobile repaired. Having forty thousand dollars in his pocket, what did he care about an automobile? He made a present <span class="page-break">\3</span>of it to the farmer, Martha's father, who, in gratitude, allowed Zalatoris to live with him.</p>
   <p>After some time Zalatoris proposed to Martha but the farmer, in spite of the donated automobile, would not consent to part with his young daughter. Then Zalatoris sent his friend Kisonas, or Klamans--his name is given many ways--to San Francisco with instructions to buy three steamship tickets to South America, for himself, Kisonas, and Martha.</p>
   <p>Kisonas was arrested while he was buying the tickets and four thousand dollars were recovered from him. In the meantime Zalatoris and Martha decided to run away from the farmer, and they did. They went to Glendive where they registered at a hotel as Mr. and Mrs. Alex Palmer of Chicago.</p>
   <p>They got no farther because the local police suspected "Mr. Palmer" of being a "slacker." Their suspicions were obviously correct, for Zalatoris did not have a registration card. Then all of his sins came to light.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Zalatoris, no doubt, will not be able to avoid recapture for very long.</p>
