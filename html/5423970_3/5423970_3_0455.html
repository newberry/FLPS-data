   <p>A few days ago Judge John H. Lyle, of Chicago, delivered a lecture before a capitalistic club. He talked about crime, and told how much it costs the people of the country. His statistics on crime and its cost are very characteristic.</p>
   <p>Judge Lyle stated that the annual cost of crime to the people of the United States is not less than ten billion <span class="page-break">\2</span>dollars or one-sixth of the total wealth of the United States. In that sum, Judge Lyle includes the cost of the upkeep of the courts, penal institutions, agents, etc. The Judge did not state the cost of law violations alone. However, that is not important because we all know that burglary, robbery, murders, etc., cost the people gigantic sums of money.</p>
   <p>A social order in which such gigantic sums of money are thrown into the wind is absolutely worthless. The apostles of capitalistic Democracy have nothing to boast about. On the contrary, they indirectly denounce the very same social order <span class="page-break">\3</span>which they uphold.</p>
   <p>However, when the communists say that the capitalistic system is rotten and worthless, the apostles of capitalism, such as Judge Lyle, reply that "you communists want to destroy civilization." That civilization which the apostles of capitalism uphold surely must be rotten if it swallows billions of dollars every year because of crime.</p>
