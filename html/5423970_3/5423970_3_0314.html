   <p>A mass meeting in honor of Stasys Simkus, who recently arrived in America as a representative of the War Relief Society of Lithuania to collect funds for the Society, was held in the Brighton Park district of Chicago last Tuesday, July 13. The principal speakers were Mr. Simkus and Attorney F. P. Bradchulis.</p>
   <p>The meeting was hurriedly arranged and received very little advertising. However, thirty dollars was collected at the meeting for the relief of the war-stricken people of Lithuania.</p>
   <p>Last Wednesday, Mr. Simkus went to Milwaukee and Sheboygan, where the Lithuanians of Wisconsin arranged meetings in his honor. He was accompanied by Bruno K. Bealutis, editor of the Lietuva. Later, Mr. Simkus went to Painesdale, Michigan, in answer to a strong appeal from the Lithuanians of that town. From there he will return to Chicago and immediately leave for Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where he is scheduled to participate in a mass meeting on July 20.</p>
