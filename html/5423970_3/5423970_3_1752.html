   <p>Rev. Krawczunas again sued the publisher and the editor of Lietuva. The priest and his followers were not satisfied with the previous two criminal cases against us. In these two cases the priest was unable to prove that the statements of Lietuva were not true, so the cases were dismissed. Now he sued us in the civil court for damages, resulting, as he contended, from our ruining his business.</p>
   <p>The priest has admitted that the church is like any Jewish store. The little man (the priest) tried his best, with the help of the sheriff, to lock up the publisher and the editor, but all his efforts went with the dogs. Now the priest himself is under a bond of $20,000 in this civil case against us.</p>
