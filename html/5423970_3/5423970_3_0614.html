   <p>The Lithuanians have been living in this vicinity for over 20 years, and for a long time we hardly ever heard about them. Six years ago the progressive movement started. Now there are two mutual benefit societies; the Lithuanian Alliance of America, Branch 74; the Lovers of Fatherland Society, branch 75; and the Lithuanian Socialist Party of America, branch 32. We have had lectures and speeches on various subjects and problems. We also gave financial help to the revolutionary movement in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>On the 21st day of October at Mr. Medelis' son Algirdas baptism, Frank Kazlauskas brought up the question of helping the revolutionists in Lithuanian. A collection was made. They collected $13.13</p>
   <p>J. Tverijonas explained about the revolution and stated that the Lithuanian Socialist party helped the revolutionists in Russia and <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>Lithuania. Frank Arsauskas spoke about socialism.</p>
