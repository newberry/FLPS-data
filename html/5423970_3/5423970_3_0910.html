   <p>The Lithuanians of Chicago remember the lectures of last year that were arranged by the Aurora Society. Last winter's lectures were simply a test, but the test showed that the people appreciated them very much by attending. Those who have attended these lectures received much information on scientific problems, and with their paid admissions have helped the poor Lithuanian students.</p>
   <p>Seeing that the Lithuanian public is interested in the lecture forum, the Aurora Society has decided to give more lectures this coming winter. I will give the program which will be presented: before new year there will be given five scientific lectures. The first two lectures will be delivered by Dr. A. Rutkauskas. The subject of these two lectures is Physiology. The first lecture will be on October 27th, the second, November 10th. The third <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>lecture will be delivered by a student of Valparaiso University, S. Safranauskas. The subject will be, "The Air and its Complex Activity." It will be on November 24th. The fourth lecture, on December 15th, will be given by Dr. Butkevicius, the subject, "What we need." The fifth lecture, on December 29th, will be given by Mr. L. Radziukynas, the subject, "History of the Earth." All these lectures will be held at the Fellowship House, 869 33rd Place. Admission 10 cents. By buying in advance five lecture tickets, you can get them for 45 cents.</p>
   <p>As you see from this lecture program, such lectures are necessary to every man, educated or not educated. Therefore, the Chicago Lithuanians ought to come to these lectures. It will be of great benefit to all of us. By attending and paying the admission, you will help with your small admission the poor Lithuanian students fund.</p>
