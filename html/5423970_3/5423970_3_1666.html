   <p>The Providence of God Parish will hold a massmeeting on August 4, 7 P. M., Saturday, in the hall at 778 S. Halsted St.</p>
   <p>All parishioners are invited to come because we have a very important problem to decide. Rev. Peza is collecting money for himself in the name of the parish; therefore we must decide this problem without delay in order to protect ourselves from such a collector, who would destroy our parish.</p>
   <p>All the parishioners must come to this meeting without fail.</p>
   <p>The Providence of God Parish Committee.</p>
