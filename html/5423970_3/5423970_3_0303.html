   <p>About two months ago much was written in the Lithuanian press on the newly organized society, Gabia Sorosis (Gabia Sorority), which was founded by the following Chicago Lithuanian ladies: Miss M. Brenza, Miss Rudauskas, Miss Toleikis, Miss Urbis, and Miss St. Ciurlonis. Some praised the society, but some opposed it on the ground that there are already too many Lithuanian societies in Chicago. Nevertheless, the society still exists and is steadily growing stronger.</p>
   <p>It is sad to note that instead of aiding and encouraging our young people to organize for the benefit of Lithuanianism, our older people ridicule and obstruct their efforts. People of other nationalities respect their young people, are proud of them, and aid them in every possible manner. Why cannot we do as they do?</p>
   
   <p>When a member of any other nationality arrives in a large city he or she is widely introduced among people of his or her nationality in an effort to keep that person from leading an isolated and monotonous life; every effort is made to help that person to feel at home. However, this is not done among Lithuanian-Americans. Lithuanians who have been residing in Chicago for a number of years and who live in close proximity hardly know one another. Even after they are casually introduced to one another they soon forget, and when they meet again it is necessary to introduce them all over again.</p>
   <p>That is the reason why a group of Chicago Lithuanian ladies have organized this new society, the Gabia Sorosis, whose purpose is to introduce and acquaint the young Lithuanian ladies of Chicago with one another. Later, it will probably be possible to expand the activities of the society into other fields. But first we desire to acquaint our young people with one another. That is not an easy thing to do in Chicago. For that purpose we are sponsoring dances, which offer an excellent opportunity for the young people to become acquainted. It is difficult to understand why some people should oppose and make sarcastic remarks about our activities and view our purpose and aims with suspicion.</p>
   <p>Some of our newspapers have conceived the idea that the purpose of the society is "to be happy and make others happy". That is probably one of the aims of the society, but not all people have the same understanding of the word "happiness". A drunkard feels happy when he has plenty of intoxicating liquor to drink; others do not care for intoxicating drinks. There are persons who feel happy when someone glances at them with a lovely smile or showers them with lovely phrases. Then there are people who feel happy because they have never harmed anyone. In other words, not all people feel happy for the same reason.</p>
   <p>Therefore, when a group of young ladies assemble and engage in pleasant conversation, they also feel happy. As for "making others happy," there can be no doubt that if everyone behaves properly then all others will be happy. All unfavorable comment in our press about our society has now subsided and we hope it will not recur.</p>
   <p>The society is still very young, but its members are craving action. We can hardly accomplish anything without outside assistance. A decision was made at the last meeting of the society to do something to make some orphans happy during the Christmas season. Everyone anxiously waits for that great holiday. During the shopping period before Christmas we all purchase beautiful gifts for our children, relatives, and friends. However, very few people remember the orphans, who never receive any presents. They, too, would appreciate gifts, but they never receive any.</p>
   <p>For the above purpose, the Gabia Sorosis will give a grand ball on October 23 at the Unity Club Hall, Chicago, Illinois. The ball will commence at 8:00 P. M. All the proceeds will be used to purchase gifts for orphans and other destitute children. It is highly desirable, therefore, that a large number of people attend this ball and in that manner aid the society to achieve its purpose. This matter should interest not only the young but also other kind-hearted Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>A financial report of the proceeds from the ball will be published in our press. Anyone who desires to aid the cause by donating money or clothing are invited to communicate with Miss St. Ciurlonis, 1728 North Wood Street. All individual donators will receive a report, with the names and addresses of the families that were aided by their individual contributions. We believe that all those who will donate gifts to orphans will feel happy because by doing so they will make others happy.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let us help one another, open our hearts, and share our happiness with others.</p>
