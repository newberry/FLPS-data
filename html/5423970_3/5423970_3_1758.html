   <p>We, the undersigned, of the Catholic church societies of Chicago, are appealing to the good wishes of our Lithuanian parishioners of St. George's parish, and urging all of you to sign your names on the petition to demand that the bishop give us a better priest in the place of Rev. Krawczunas. We have no doubt that the bishop will fulfill our demand. All the signatures bring to the committee president, J. Jonaitis, 3254 South Morgan Street. Already many good Lithuanian Catholics signed their names, therefore we are urging others not to slumber, but without delay bring your signatures and help us save our church, that we have built with our bloody hands, while the bad priest is sinking our church into debt.</p>
