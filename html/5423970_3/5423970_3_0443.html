   <p>John M. Tananevicius, whose private bank went bankrupt in the latter part of 1916, was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison. He was charged with accepting deposits after his bank was no longer solvent, and he received the maximum penalty for the offense. Besides the jail sentence, he was fined $28,000, which was twice the amount of the deposits he accepted after his bank became insolvent.</p>
   <p>It was disclosed at the trial that the bank's loss was about half a million dollars. In other words, after the receivers and fees are paid, there will be hardly anything left for the depositors. It was further revealed by the testimony of a representative of the Central Trust Company of Illinois, receivers of the bank, that the bank had more than two thousand depositors, mostly Poles and Lithuanians, and about $470,000 in deposits.</p>

   <p>The state's attorney insisted that Mr. Tananevicius be given the maximum penalty "as a warning and lesson to every private banker". The verdict of guilty was returned by the jury in one hour, after which his bond was raised from seven to ten thousand dollars and he was denied a new trial; however, he plans to appeal his case to a higher court. Thus, the testimonies of the witnesses for the defense, who stated that the bank was solvent when it was closed by the government, were for naught. Mr. Tananevicius was defended by Attorney Kwasigroch, a Pole, and two assistants; the case was tried before Judge Hugo Pam.</p>
   <p>All assets of the bank were sold at public auction last Thursday. However, results of the sale could not be obtained in time for publication in this issue.</p>
