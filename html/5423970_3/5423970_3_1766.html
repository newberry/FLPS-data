   <p>In the Lithuanian and the Polish parishes, the parish rector is the treasurer. Such an arrangement brings misunderstanding and dispute among the Lithuanian and Polish parishioners because the rectors refuse to give an account of their parish budgets.</p>
   <p>These disputes between the parishioners and their rectors, many a times bring a lot of trouble, fights and riots. When anyone demands an account of the parish budget the priest calls him an infidel.</p>
   <p>A capitalistic monopoly does not permit its workers to interfere with its business affairs, because the workers did not put money in this business. But with our parish affairs is different. When the parishioners are donating their money, they should have the right to look into the affairs of their parish and watch how their money is being spent. But the rector controls the parish affairs just like the monopoly owner,and he does not permit the parishioners to look into the affairs of their parish.</p>
   
   <p>Now, let us look at the German Catholic parish affairs. The Germans have trustees who control the parish budget. The rector of the German parish has no right nor power over the financial affairs of the parish. The parish business is taken care of by a special committee and the trustees.</p>
   <p>According to the statement of our rector that those who want to control the parish budget are infidels, all the German parishioners must be infidels, because they do control the parish budget.</p>
