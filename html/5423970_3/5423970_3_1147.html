   <p>May Day was commemorated by Lithuanian workers on May 1, at Meldazis Hall, 23rd Place and Oakley Avenue. The celebration was sponsored by the Grand Duke Gediminas of Lithuania Society. A variety of features made up the program which consisted of orations, recitations, theatricals, songs, etc.</p>
   <p>The first number on the program was an oration by Mr. J. A. Chmieliauskas, who is a member of the editorial staff of the Lietuva. He stated that the first thing the workers in America must do to improve their standard of living is to become citizens of the United States.</p>
   <p>After the oration Miss K. Burdulis recited a Lithuanian poem. Then followed the presentation of the one-act play "Meiles Parodijos" (Parodies of Love).</p>

   <p>The play was staged by the dramatic section of the 28th branch of the Lovers of the Fatherland Society. Generally speaking, the performance was good. The girls did not display enough liveliness; the men played their parts well.</p>
   <p>A one-act comedy entitled "Stepukas Su Stepuku" (Stephen and Little Stephen) was presented by Mr. Brusokas and his young partner. The Sietynas Chorus entertained the audience with songs.</p>
   <p>After the program there was dancing. A capacity crowd attended; everyone seemed happy and pleased. It is a pleasure to note that the society which sponsored the affair contributes towards the support of the local (West Side) Lithuanian library. The Society will also donate half the proceeds from this affair for the benefit of the library.</p>
