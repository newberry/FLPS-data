   <p>Now that the Lithuanian movement for the independence of Lithuania is steadily growing in scope and importance, it would be a good idea to call attention to a widespread evil among Lithuanian-Americans. This evil is the practice of changing Lithuanian names to foreign [non-Lithuanian] names. No people of any other nationality distort and mutilate their names as do the Lithuanian-Americans. A good writer could write a long comedy on this Lithuanian-American practice.</p>
   <p>When a Vincas Sukaitis comes to America from Lithuania, we find that in a very short time he becomes William Schultz; a Kazys Jonaitis soon becomes Charley Johnson; a Jurgis Matulaitis becomes George Matthews. In some cases, a Jonas Bagdonas attaches a Polish "tail" to his name and becomes John Bagdanowicz; similarly, a Jonas Urbikas becomes a John Urbikowski; and so on, without end.</p>
   <p>When reading the English language press, we often see names that apparently are German, Polish, English, or Irish, but later we find that they are names of Lithuanians who have changed their names to foreign names. Thus, among Lithuanian-Americans we find many names such as White, Johnson, Brown, Schultz, Smith, and a long list of other foreign names.</p>
   <p>In the local news section of this issue of the Lietuva, there is an interesting news item explaining how one Lithuanian-American, in a "miraculous" manner has been dubbed with the name "Shigezu Mibu".</p>
   <p>What is true about Lithuanian-Americans is also true of those Lithuanians who have emigrated to other countries. Whenever any Lithuanian sets his foot on foreign soil, he immediately begins to change his name to one of the names very common in the country in which he lives. That indicates that many Lithuanians are suffering from the disease known as "inferiority complex", and that there is a great lack of self-respect among Lithuanians. Lithuanian-American merchants, especially, show an unusually great inclination to change their good Lithuanian names to Polish, English, German, and even Russian names; they change their names to those of every nationality except the Lithuanian, although a great many good Lithuanian names, such as Rimkus, Rudis, Stogis, Molis, Pukas, Banis, Kurmis, Grenis, Urba, Narkis, Baltis, Stulga, Tamulis, Slenis, and Tilkis are just as beautiful and convenient as the best Anglo-Saxon, Teutonic, or Scandinavian names.</p>
   <p>It is true that the parents of some Lithuanian-Americans [who are therefore not responsible] have mutilated their names, but most Lithuanian-Americans have themselves distorted their names.</p>
   <p>The changing of Lithuanian names to foreign names causes much inconvenience. For example, in a war casualty list of the dead, the injured, and the captured, it is impossible to tell who are Lithuanians and who are not. A good Lithuanian name can easily be identified, because the spelling of a Lithuanian name is altogether different from that of names typical of any other nationality in the world, with the exception of some Greek names. However, when Petkus changes his name to Pietkiewicz, and Stankus becomes Stinkiewicz or Stink, then it becomes impossible to identify them as Lithuanians. Furthermore, when the post office issues a list of the letters that are being withheld because of incomplete addresses, it becomes impossible for Lithuanian newspapers that desire to publish the list to distinguish the Lithuanian names from the non-Lithuanian names. But the most important thing is that the distortion and changing of Lithuanian names to foreign names indicate a very weak national consciousness among our people. The German, French, Irish, and even the most ignorant Italian immigrants never change their names. Among Lithuanian immigrants, however, this damnable practice has become a custom.</p>
   <p>We should inaugurate a big campaign against this custom. Brother Lithuanians, always spell your names in the characteristic Lithuanian manner! If your name is Petkus, then spell it Petkus and not Pietkiewicz; and if you name is Narkis, then spell it Narkis and not Narkiewicz, Norton, or any other foreign spelling.</p>
   
   <p>It is interesting to note that some Lithuanian-Americans have realized their mistake, and are now re-Lithuanianizing their names. In Chicago, for example, we know of a number of such cases: Szimkowicz changed his name back to Simkus; Slapikowski, to Slapikas; Globe, to Globis, etc. Some have even gone to court to make the necessary changes legal; this is a comparatively easy thing to do here in America. When Lithuanians obtain their naturalization papers they should pay special attention to see that their names appear on the citizenship papers in the original Lithuanian spelling. It is a little more difficult for an established Lithuanian merchant to re-Lithuanianize his name, but it is a very easy matter for all other Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>When so many of our people are changing their names to Herman, Miller, Johnson, or to Shigezu Mibu, then it is about time we paid more attention to this mad practice.</p>
