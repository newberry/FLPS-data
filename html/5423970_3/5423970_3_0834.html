   <p>February 26, the St. Vincent a Paulo Society gave a banquet and program at Stancik Hall, in Kensington. "The Unbindable Knot," a farce written by Petrulis, was presented.</p>
   <p>After the play young boys and girls delivered declamations. The choir, under the direction of Mr. Pocius, sang several national songs. Miss Klimaiciute sang a few songs very beautifully. She was given a lovely bouquet of flowers. The hall was packed. The program was very good.</p>
