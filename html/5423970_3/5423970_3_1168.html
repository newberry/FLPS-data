   <p>Every nation remembers the more important events in its history with a small or a large ceremony.</p>
   <p>Fifty years ago the Russian government decided to Russianize its subordinate nations, the Lithuanians and the White Russians, by forbidding them to publish written material in their inborn language. Only after forty years, May 7, 1904, the press was allowed or, to say it more truthfully, it was regained through suffering and battle.</p>
   <p>To commemorate this important victory of ours, the regaining of the press, the Chicago chapters of the Lovers of the Motherland Society, uniting with other societies, is preparing a great ceremony with speeches and a <span class="page-break">2</span>concert, at the Mark White Square Hall, 29th and Halsted Streets, Sunday, May 10. Participating in the program will be the more outstanding Chicago Lithuanian speakers and singers: Mrs. M. Janusauskas, Miss Horodeckas, Mrs. and Mrs. P. Sarpalius, Frank Jakutis, the Misses Rudauskas, and the large Birute Chorus under the direction of Mr. A. Pocius.</p>
   <p>Everyone interested in our nation's past and who wants to know more about the causes of the suppression and the liberation of the press, is invited to attend this anniversary commemoration.</p>
   <p>Admission is free to all.</p>
