   <p>A meeting was held last Sunday in the church hall by Lithuanian Republicans. They paid the priest for the hall, but the priest demanded that those undesirable to him be not permitted to speak. Of course, the priest's demand was met, otherwise the priest would have made commotion and fight at the meeting with his followers that would look bad in the presence of the American candidates. And such persons dare to call themselves spiritual leaders. Politics and religion do not mix. Why, then, does the priest stick his dirty fingers into politics? It is not his business! Does he want to monopolize all the Lithuanian activity? Such a monopolization would be detrimental to Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>Our Lithuanian parish rector, Rev. Krawczunas, at last understood that his fair was held in order to make the people drink, and we have been stating for a long time in our newspaper Lietuva that such business is not right for the Lithuanian spiritual leader, that name is usurped by our priest, he is proudly praising himself at every opportunity, as drinking is condemned by the bishop. Our uncle-priest took our suggestion for good and shortened the time of his fair to stop the spreading of drunkenness. The fair's time was up in November 27, but our rector shortened the time and last Sunday the fair was closed. Of course, our priest has pity on the people's health.</p>
   <p>If he would educate himself he would see that the extortion of money from the people, for his own benefit, is not moral, as when he made the people drink at his fair. If we could make him understand that the Polish nuns are not reliable to teach Lithuanian children, then we could quit calling our little uncle-priest a servant of the Poles.</p>
