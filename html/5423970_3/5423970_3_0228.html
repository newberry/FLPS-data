   <p>We will have a Lithuanian Day (a tag day) on November 1, 1916. Such a "day" can do us much good, but it also can do us much harm. Everything depends upon how we Lithuanian-Americans behave and how much common sense we show.</p>
   <p>At this time, while preparations are being made for Lithuanian Day, it would be a good thing to keep before our eyes the example of the Poles. Polish-Americans also had a tag day, a Polish Day. There are about seven times as many Poles as there are Lithuanians in the United States. Nonetheless, they succeeded in collecting only seventeen million dollars. All the Poles had good intentions, but they were not properly organized; they quarreled among themselves and were unable to agree on the division of the collected funds. The results were sad.</p>
   <p>Thus far, we are traveling the same road which the Poles traveled. We all appear to have good intentions, but we are quarreling over an empty bag, over partisan <a name="p2" class="page-break">2</a>prestige. Therefore, the same thing can happen to us that happened to the Poles: our partisan quarrels will become known to non-Lithuanian Americans and as a result will collect an insignificant amount of money on Lithuanian tag day.</p>
   <p>Let all active leaders of all Lithuanian-American factions keep the example of the Poles in mind. If we cannot learn from that example, we cannot learn from anything else.</p>
