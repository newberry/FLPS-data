   <p>In last year's statement was given all the details of the three years income and expense of the Aurora Society and explanation about Grazis, V. D., V. M., F. M., A. V., and now we are introducing to the public the new students A. L., J. K., and P. R.</p>
   <p>A. L. is well known to the American Lithuanian public on account of his work in the national field. One of his last publications is the Lithuanian-English and English- Lithuanian Dictionary. At present he <span class="page-break">\3</span>is attending university in Switzerland and is studying economical and philosophical subjects. He is receiving $150, a yearly stipend.</p>
   <p>J. K. is a graduate of the Chicago Art Institute. He has great ability in art. He wants to go further with his studies; so he appealed to the Aurora Society for more help. He gave to the Aurora Society his reproduction of the picture "Return from the Market." At present he wants $150 to go on with his studies. The picture, given for raffle, would bring the money back to the Aurora Society. The Aurora Society has accepted this proposition.</p>
   <p>P. R.is a student of art at the Cracow Art Institute. He has great ability as an art student, and the future is bright. His painting will be a benefit not only to the Aurora Society, but to the Lithuanian nation as well. The majority of the Aurora Society members voted to give $50.25 to that student.</p>
