   <p>Last Sunday the Aurora Society held a meeting at the drugstore of Dr. Graiczunas, at which the following officers were elected:</p>
   <p>Dr. Graiczunas, President</p>
   <p>A. Lalis, Financial Secretary</p>
   <p>Szernas, Secretary</p>
   <p>Olszewski, Treasurer</p>
   <p>At this meeting it was decided to get in touch with the Ziburelis Society, which has the same aim in Europe as the Aurora Society, and with the Lovers of Fatherland Society in America, discuss various plans to make one strong organization instead of three small ones. Such small organizations cannot accomplish the desired results. At the same time all three <span class="page-break">\2</span>societies, without knowing it, could be helping the same student, while other students in dire need and worthy of help get nothing.</p>
   <p>The Aurora Society received several applicants for help in their studies. They are worthy of help, but for lack of money we cannot help them. During the coming year we will be able to help only one Lithuanian daughter, to whom $10 a month will be donated.</p>
   <p>Money is very essential to this society. Therefore, it appeals to the Lithuanian public, asking them to donate to this great educational cause of our youth, who are seeking a higher education. You can help by donating or joining the society. It is desirable that a cluster be organized in every Lithuanian colony. The society has established a fund to help Lithuanian students, and it invites all to donate for this cause.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>The names of the donators will be published in the newspapers. At present the society has $53. It is too small an amount for such a great cause.</p>
