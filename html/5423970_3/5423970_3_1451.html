   <p>The leaders of all Lithuanian-American factions take advantage of every opportunity to emphasize the point that if Lithuanians wish to survive as a national unit then they must strive to attain that goal with united forces. We are being constantly reminded that unless we unite our forces, which are already weak because of the small number of our nationals, there can hardly be any hope of surviving the struggle for national existence.</p>
   <p>The faction which does the most talking about the need for national unity is probably the rightist (Catholic) faction. It is said that the middle (Nationalist) faction also does plenty of talking on this subject. However, the Clericals (Catholics) excel the middle faction in this respect. Let us examine how the Clericals really promote unity.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\2</span>
   <p>Unity is attained through compromise. In other words, those who enter into a united front agree to certain necessary restraints in order not to harm or antagonize one another; everyone retains a certain number of rights which all others agree to respect.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanian nationality is composed of a variety of idealistic persons, who possess a variety of different religious, political, and other viewpoints. In the religious field we have Catholics, Protestants, atheists, etc. In the political field we have Clericals, Nationalists, Socialists, and others. When these various idealists and factions of different shades of opinion agree to enter into a united front, they will not thereby renounce any of their basic principles. No one is even asking them to do so. They all have the right to adhere to their religious or other beliefs, and they have the right to expect other to respect them. Otherwise, if the rights of others are not respected, they would be insulted, quarrels would ensue, and that would be the end of the united front.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>Although our Clericals, under the cloak of Catholicism, are talking of unity more than others, nevertheless, their actions make it impossible to form a united front among our people. They are proclaiming that the Lithuanian nationality is composed only of Catholics. It is very clear that their claim is contrary to fact. Everybody knows that there is a large number of Lithuanian Protestants. It is estimated that in Greater Lithuania there are about fifty thousand Lithuanian Protestants. The percentage of Lithuanian Protestants in Minor Lithuania is very large. There are a number of Lithuanian Protestant parishes here in America. It is difficult to estimate the total number of Lithuanian Protestants. However, their number is undoubtedly large and they deserve attention.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, there are many Lithuanians who cannot be classified as Catholics or Protestants. These are generally known as Freethinkers.</p>
   <p>By building our national ideals on a Catholic foundation our Clericals interfere with the rights of Lithuanians of other religious beliefs, and in that manner they violate the fundamental principle of unity. The <span class="page-break">\4</span>Protestants are unwilling to renounce their Lithuanianism, but they will not accept that form of Lithuanianism which is clothed with Catholicism. The same is true in regard to the so-called Freethinkers.</p>
   <p>We all know how strongly everyone adheres to his or her religion. We also know from the annals of history that in the past many major and, frequently, bloody religious quarrels took place and engendered intense hatred among the people of the world. Therefore, the mixing of religion with national affairs must be looked upon as a dangerous step, which can do much harm to our nationality.</p>
   <p>We have interviewed a number of leaders of Lithuanian-American Lutherans. They all confirmed the above statements. We were informed that Lithuanian Lutherans are glad to participate in Lithuanian public life and that many are doing so. We hear very little about their activities because they do not mix their religion with public affairs. Lithuanian Lutherans who do not participate in Lithuanian public life complain that the public <span class="page-break">\5</span>activities of Lithuanian-Americans are permeated with Catholicism. We received the impression from the interviews that if our public life is to be labeled with the letters "R. C.," as our Clericals are trying to do, then the Lithuanian Protestants will completely refuse to work in unity with other Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>No one can logically state that the above-mentioned viewpoint of our Protestants is wrong. Their viewpoint is based on true fundamental principles of unity. What is true in regard to Protestants is also true in respect to other non-Catholics. We venture to say that even among intelligent Lithuanian Catholics there are many who realize that the mixing of religion with national affairs is fraught with many dangers to the welfare of our nationality.</p>
   <p>By building our national ideals on a religious foundation, our Clericals are preparing the field not for Lithuanian unity but for complete discord.</p>
