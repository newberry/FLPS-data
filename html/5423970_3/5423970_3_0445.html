   <p>The good people of the 18th Street colony should turn their attention to the fact that a large number of various types of hoodlums have gathered in this vicinity. Though attacks occur around 18th Street very often, some people are so afraid of the hoodlums' revenge that they do not report them to the police. In this manner, the whole section of the city is being controlled by about twenty hoodlums. Such hoodlums usually pass their time in saloons. The saloon-keepers even put up bond for them and sometimes use politics to help such hoodlums out of jail when they are caught.....</p>
