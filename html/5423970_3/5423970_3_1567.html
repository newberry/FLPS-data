   <p>An article by a "Lithuanian Priest" appeared recently in the Chicago Polish daily Dziennik Zwiazkowy (Alliance Daily). This priest, who is probably a denationalized and traitorous Lithuanian, depicts the Lithuanians as a people of low moral and intellectual standing. He especially censures Lithuanians for daring to argue and quarrel with the "Szlacht" Poles, higher caste Poles, According to this "Lithuanian Priest", the low moral and intellectual standing of the Lithuanians is due mainly to a shortage of Lithuanian priests.</p>
   <p>An answer to this "Lithuanian Priest" by J. J. Hertmanavicius was published in the Dziennik Zwiazkowy. He pointed out that the moral and intellectual level of American Lithuanians is not lower than that of the Poles, and that in some respects the Lithuanians are even ahead of the Poles. However, the article of Mr. Hertmanavicius did not explain everything.</p>

   <p>There is some truth in the statement that the moral level of Lithuanians in America is lower than that of Lithuanians in Lithuania. However, that is not only true about Lithuanians, but also about all other nationalities in America; even American Poles cannot brag about a high moral level....America differs in this respect from Europe. Here there is not much morality even among the priests, and for that reason they are unable to raise the moral standard of the people.</p>
   <p>The cause of the immorality among American Lithuanains is not due to a shortage of Lithuanian priests, but to the fact that we have too many priests like Juodisius and Masiotas. These priests cannot raise the morals of the people, because they themselves are in need of moral reform. The people look up to the priests not for words, but for good examples. However, most of our priests are busily engaged in efforts to catch dollars; they have neither the desire nor the time to be concerned with their morals or that of their parishioners.</p>

   <p>It is true that Lithuanians should strive to attain a higher intellectual level. However, we cannot turn to the local Poles for such enlightenment, because the Poles do not have enough of this oil for themselves, and for that reason are unable to give any to Lithuanians. The Lithuanians are already seeking intellectual development, only not in Polish but in American schools. The number of Lithuanians who are seeking a higher education is not smaller than that of the Poles.</p>
