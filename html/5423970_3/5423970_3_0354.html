   <p>p.3.... A certain Lithuanian family, consisting of a widow and three daughters, the youngest only eighteen months old, is badly in need of a stove to heat their flat. The mother, who was widowed two years ago, cannot afford a stove because she has been unemployed for some time on account of an ulcerated foot. The League of Chicago Lithuanian Societies hereby appeals to the Lithuanians of Chicago to assist this poor family. Anyone who has an extra stove or wishes to assist the family should apply at the office of the League at 3112 So. Halsted St.</p>
