   <p>There are about fifty thousand Lithuanians living in Chicago. It is estimated that there are about five hundred thousand Lithuanians living in the entire United States. Therefore, one-tenth of all Lithuanian-Americans live in Chicago. No other town or city in the entire world has such a large Lithuanian population as the city of Chicago. Even in Kaunas and Vilnius, the two largest cities in Lithuania, the Lithuanian population is less than that of Chicago. Therefore, as far as the size of the population is concerned, Chicago may be considered the capital of the Lithuanians.</p>
   <p>In Chicago we have eight Lithuanian churches, two newspapers, the largest Lithuanian business establishments, the largest Lithuanian bank (that of A. Olsevskis), and many other institutions. This shows that Chicago is the center of Lithuanian-Americans. In Chicago the center of Lithuanians <span class="page-break">\2</span>is that part of the city known as Bridgeport, in the neighborhood of 35th and Halsted Streets.</p>
   <p>Bridgeport has the largest Lithuanian parish (St. George's), the most beautiful Lithuanian church, the largest and most modern Lithuanian parochial school, the largest Lithuanian bookstore (that of A. Olsevskis), the largest Lithuanian bank (that of A. Olsevskis), the largest Lithuanian newspaper office (that of the Lietuva), the largest Lithuanian clothing store (the Bridgeport Clothing Company), the largest real estate company (that of A. Olsevskis), and the largest fire-sickness-death insurance office (that of A. Olsevskis). Bridgeport has a large number of all kinds of business establishments, drug stores, doctors, many societies and other institutions. Therefore, Bridgeport is the real center of the Lithuanians of Chicago and undoubtedly will always remain so.</p>
   <p>Since Bridgeport is the real center of Chicago Lithuanians, then every building and lot in Bridgeport ought to be in the hands of Lithuanians.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\3</span>
   <p>All Lithuanians who have saved up some money should purchase buildings and lots, and continue to do so until not a single foreigner remains in Bridgeport, and until all business establishments are in the hands of Lithuanians. This would not only improve the general welfare of our people, but it would also increase Lithuanian prestige.</p>
   <p>The foreigners (non-Lithuanians), seeing that in a short time the Lithuanians will become the masters of Bridgeport, are hurriedly moving out and are selling their homes and other buildings to Lithuanians at very low prices, Nearly all the homes and buildings on 33rd Street, on Auburn Avenue (now Lithuanica Avenue), on 33rd Place, and on Halsted Street are already owned by Lithuanians. This year many homes were sold to Lithuanians on 35th Place, Emerald Avenue, Wallace Street, Lowe Avenue, Union Avenue, and on other streets that are located farther away from the Lithuanian church (33rd Street and Auburn-Lithuanica Avenue). This shows that in a short time the Lithuanians will occupy the whole of Bridgeport.</p>
   <span class="page-break">\4</span>
   <p>Since the foreigners are now selling their property at very low prices, now is the best time to buy. Nearly all the homes of foreigners in Bridgeport are listed for sale at the real estate office of A. Olsevskis, 3252 S. Halsted Street. The bank of A. Olsevskis makes loans for purchasing homes. Anyone, even with a small sum of money, can purchase a good home at a reduced price.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians will find it to their advantage to purchase homes and lots through the largest and best Lithuanian real estate office (that of A. Olsevskis), which is located in Lietuva's building, 3252 S. Halsted Street.</p>
