   <p>April 23, the Birutes Society presented the five-act tragedy, "Keistutis." This play deals with events taken from the history of Lithuania.</p>
   <p>The drama is a trying one, and difficult to play. The actors, who are not professionals, have devoted much time and energy to the presentation of this difficult play. This arduous task was accomplished under the direction of our composer, Mr. M. Petrauskas. Thanks to his devotion, the Chicago Lithuanians had a chance to see this beautiful play.</p>
   <p>After the performance, the Birutes Choir, under the direction of Mr. M. Petrauskas, sang several songs, including, "I Have Planted the Ruta --(Translator's note: The flower Ruta--Rues, among Lithuanians, is the flower of virginity.) Also, "Oh My Mother", -- "Oh That Old Man", -- and "Oh Thou Eva."</p>
