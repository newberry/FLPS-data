   <p>At this meeting nothing concrete was decided, because the delegates had no instructions from their societies. It was discussed in what way to help the Aurora Society. All the delegates acknowledged the benefit of the Aurora Society, whose purpose is to help the young Lithuanian students complete their education in order to have the Lithuanian intelligentsia to work for the national cause.</p>
   <p>It was proposed either to charge the society members 25 cents per year or to have collections at every meeting of the societies, and to give the money to the Aurora society. These propositions will be submitted by the delegates to their societies. They will announce their decision.</p>
   <p>At this meeting for the benefit of the Aurora Society, $2.75 was collected.</p>
