   <p>Katalikas says that our statement taken from the German newspaper Der Westen about the St. George's church new loan of $40,000 is not true. Further, the Katalikas suggests to us that the documents about the loan should be stated not from the German newspaper but from the county records. Very good then, we will produce for Katalikas the county records.</p>
   <p>Here is the evidence: The loan, $40,000, on the St. George's church is taken from the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company, recorded December 20, 1900; Recorder's book 7174- p. 335. Document 3046045. There was a mortgage of $15,000 previously. Total $55,000.</p>
   <p>Is this a lie, Mr. Katalikas? We have proved to you by official documents and yet the Katalikas is lying by trying to deny the new debt on the church by its boss, Rev. Krawczunas.</p>
