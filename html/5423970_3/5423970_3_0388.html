   <p>Up to the present time, the representatives of the Lithuanian Science Society of Vilnus, Dr. J. Basanavicius and M. Yeas, have collected $5,000 in Chicago and its suburbs, for the erection of the Lithuanian Science building in Vilnus.</p>
   <p>From almost every Lithuanian colony in the United States, letters arrive revealing cordial support of the mission of our honorable guests from Lithuania. Every colony is trying to raise more money, to get on top of other colonies. This is a very good omen in that the Lithuanian Societies of America are taking such honorable action to support the mission of those two culture bearers of our nation.</p>
   <p>In America, so far as we know, there are about four thousand (or more) <span class="page-break">\2</span>Lithuanian societies, clubs, circles, etc. Some of the societies are rich, while others are in fair standing; it would be easy for them to buy a "share" of the Lithuanian science building of Vilnus. Let us have as our motto: "We, the American-Lithuanians, will not let our guests depart with less than $50,000!"</p>
