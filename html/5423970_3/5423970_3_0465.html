   <p>We were told that last Sunday two young Lithuanians had a fight. Both of them were drunk. The dispute was, which of them can speak better English. After a few minutes of hot words they found out neither knew the English language and that both of them were wrong. Then they began to fight.</p>
   <p>This is a disgrace to Chicago Lithuanians. Up to this time Chicago Lithuanians did not fight among themselves. Don't spend your money on drinks. Read newspapers and books, show other nations that we Lithuanians are cultured people.</p>
