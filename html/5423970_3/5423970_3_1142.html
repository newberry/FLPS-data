   <p>The Association of Englewood Lithuanian Societies, which has been instrumental in raising several hundred dollars for the relief of war victims in Lithuania, sponsored a commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Congress of Vilna on Sunday, Nov. 14, in Auburn Hall, 79th Street and Lowe Avenue.</p>
   <p>[Translators note: The Congress of Vilna, which was composed of delegates from all parts of Lithuania, met in the city of Vilna, the ancient capital of Lithuania, in 1905, immediately after the defeat of Russia in the war with Japan, to demand political freedom for Lithuania.] Proceeds from the affair were donated to the fund for the relief of war victims in Lithuania.</p>
   <p>There were many interesting features on the program. Mr. Bruno K. Balutis, editor of the Lietuva, delivered a short oration. He spoke about the war situation in Lithuania, about the probable future of Lithuania, and called for greater unity of Lithuanian-Americans. A long musical program, consisting <span class="page-break">2</span>of twenty numbers, entertained the audience. The best Lithuanian musical talent of Chicago participated in the program. Among the performers were Miss Rudauskas, Mr. Zolpis, Miss Rakauskas, Miss Baltis, the Sarpalis brothers, Mrs. Ona Pocius, the Bigelis trio, and two non-Lithuanian musical artists, Miss Okon and Dr. Finn.</p>
   <p>Inasmuch as there were many non-Lithuanians among the audience, Attorney F. P. Bradchulis delivered an address in English. He spoke on the history of Lithuania.</p>
