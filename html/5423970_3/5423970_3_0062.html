   <p>A group of Chicago Lithuanian women, who organized and established a children's day nursery in Bridgeport a few years ago, gave a New Year's Eve party at Milda Hall, 3140 South Halsted Street, for the benefit of the nursery. A large crowd attended the social, and they had a good time while awaiting the arrival of the New Year. It is believed that a fairly large profit was realized.</p>
   <p>The cost of operating the day nursery amounts to about one thousand dollars a year. However, the women have always succeeded in raising enough money to maintain the institution.</p>
