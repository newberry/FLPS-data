   <p>On Sunday, March 4, 1906, the parishioners of the Providence of God parish will hold their public meeting at Freiheit Turner Hall, 3417 S. Halsted St., at 1:30 P. M. At this meeting will be told why fights were started at the church, what the fights were for, how many people have been shot, beaten and arrested, and what the court has done with the arrested people. We invited all men and women to come and learn the truth, to express your views, as to why this priest, with the help of police, is slugging and arresting his parishioners.</p>
   <p>The Parish Committee.</p>
