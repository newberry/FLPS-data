   <p>A group of active people as A. Jocius, S. Dambro, S. Vitkus, A. Maziliauskas, M. Uzunaris, V. Patupas, A. Lanrutenas, J. Jukelis, Peter Kucinskas and J. Rasinskas held a meeting on Sept. 14, 1935, at the home of J. Rasinskas, 209 E. 107th st.</p>
   <p>They organized a relief fund for Rev. M. X. Mockus. (Translator's note: Rev. M. X. Mockus is an ex-priest of the Independent Roman-Catholic religion. He become a freethinker and he is very good speaker. He is the Lithuanian Robert G. Ingersoll.)</p>
   <p>They decided to have a picnic for the benefit of M. X. Mockus on the 20th day of September. It rained on that day and they were unable to <span class="page-break">2</span>hold this picnic, so later a banquet was held in the hall, the proceeds of which were $47.87. There was also collected $29.50. The question then came up (as to) who should take care of this Mockus relief fund. It was decided that a Lithuanian Freethinkers branch should be organized. The group kept this name until the month of June, 1936, when it was changed to the Lithuanian Freethinkers Ethical and Cultural Society. This group grew from 10 to 121 members.</p>
   <p>Cultural Activity. This organization has had three lectures on various subjects and gave a banquet to Dr. John Sliupas, who came from Lithuania in 1936 to America for a three months visit. This organization held lectures jointly with other organizations; joined also in the upkeep of the Lithuanian youth school in Roseland, and in the work of the congress which has for its purpose the return of democracy to Lithuania. This movement is being sponsored by American <span class="page-break">3</span>Lithuanians. It is actively working against reactionary government in Lithuania. Two concerts have been given (interspersed with speeches), two picnics, and one evening dance.</p>
   <p>A meeting was held for Joseph Stilson, who is in prison in Pennsylvania for anti-war activity during the World War (now pardoned by President Franklin D. Roosevelt); $13 was collected for the Stilson's Fund. Twenty-five dollars were sent to the Lithuanian Freethinkers Ethical and Cultural Society in Lithuania. The proceeds from the banquet for Dr. Sliupas ($51) was given to him.</p>
