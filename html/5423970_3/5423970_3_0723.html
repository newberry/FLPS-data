   <p>A branch of the Lithuanian Workers' Literary Society was organized last Saturday, May 13, in the West Pullman district of Chicago. It is believed that this branch will meet with great success because there are many Lithuanians in that district who are interested in and sympathize with that organization.</p>
   <p>It is noteworthy that although no advertisements appeared in the press and no call was issued for a mass meeting, about twenty people joined the branch at the first meeting. They came to the meeting in response to invitations that were personally made by two Lithuanians who recognized the need for such an organization in that district. As soon as the branch receives a charter, a call will be issued for a mass meeting to further the interests of the organization.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the branch will take place next Friday.</p>

   <p>Good luck to the new branch.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The Lithuanian Workers Literature Society is a cultural, not a benefit society. It is similar in all respects to the Lovers of the Fatherland Society. The membership body consists almost entirely of Lithuanian Socialists. It is nation wide].</p>
