   <p>With the adoption of a constitution yesterday, the German-American Historical Society of Illinois was permanently organized. The officers elected are as follows Wilhelm Vocke, president; Max Eberhardt, vice-president; Dr. G. A. Zimmermann, vic-president; Alexander Klappenbach, secretary of finances; and C. Hermann Plautz, treasurer.</p>
   <p>According to the organization's by-laws, officers must be elected by balloting. This procedure was disregarded at yesterday's election. All the officers were elected by acclamation. According to the organization's statutes, the secretary whose position is one of the most important ones, carrying a great deal of responsibility, has to be elected by the Board of Directors. It was proposed unanimously, that Mr. Emil Mannhardt, should be elected secretary of the organization. According to statutes, the regular annual membership fee will be $3.00, but a life membership can be obtained for $25. Communities as well as various societies can become members of this organization by the advance payment of $12 annually. Their representation at meetings will carry 4 votes. In addition they will receive an annual report on activities of the <pb facs="5418474_8_0419.jpg" n="2"/>organization, also, material on the research work, free of charge....</p>
   <p>The directors are given the right to make grants, not exceeding $1,000. If an undertaking requires a larger appropriation, the approval of such must be preceded by discussion at a general meeting....</p>
