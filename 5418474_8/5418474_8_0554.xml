   <p>An odd sort of mass-meeting was held yesterday afternoon at Zepf's Hall of stockholders, subscribers, and other supporters of the Arbeiter Zeitung, the Anarchist newspaper. It was called as a family meeting to confer as to the best means of bettering the paper, increasing the influence and subscription, and advertising patronage. The hall was crowded.</p>
   <p>All those prominently in sympathy with anarchistic ideas were present. Fritz Benthim presided. Speeches were delivered by Messrs. Braunschweig, Weber, Urbon, and several others. The session was stormy. Every one wanted his own ideas incorporated into the paper. It was reported on the street that the paper was in danger of discontinuing publication. This was vigorously denied by all its friends. It has been redacted in price to one cent per copy.</p>
