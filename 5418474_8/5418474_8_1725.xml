   <p>Although a cloudburst preceded the opening of the celebration, members of the Schwaben Society and their well-wishers did not have the slightest intention of submitting to the whims of the elements.</p>
   <p>Ballmann's orchestra and the Schwaebian Singing Society, under the direction of H. A. Rehberg, arranged a very entertaining musical program,made more delightful by the participation of Corvin Westermeier, violinist, and Miss Gertrude Clauss, a singer of repute.</p>
   <p>The guests were welcomed by Mr. Julius Klein, president of the Society. There then followed the bestowal of the mark of distinction upon members who, this <pb facs="5418474_8_1726.jpg" n="2"/>year, celebrate their silver jubilee as associates of the organization. These are: Leonhard Wirth, Jakob Hepperle, Otto Nast, William Ziegler, William E. Ruder, Alfred Schmidt, William Jauss, E. F. Schutz, Jacob Frank, J. Eisenbeiss, Jacob Faude, William Schurr, H. A. Sundmacher, Edward G. Holl, Charles Mammel, Fritz Schaffert, Fritz W. Schnabel, Hermann Rahn, F. R. Huber, Frank Thuemling, and J. Brauen.</p>
   <p>The spokesman for the honored members who were decorated with a silver medal, was Mr. William Jauss. He said that the celebrants were indeed proud to be associated with this splendid organization which has a membership of four thousand,and which is functioning in the interest and for the benefit of the people.</p>
   <p>Contributions were given to the following institutions during the past year: Alexian Brothers Hospital, South Chicago Hospital, Rose Hill Orphanage,....</p>
   <p>Translator's Note: and twenty-seven other institutions; no amounts were given.]</p>
