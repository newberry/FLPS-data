   <p>The German-American Historical Society of Illinois, presided over by Vice President Otto C. Schneider, held its annual meeting last night in the hall of the "historical Society." As a rule, this meeting always takes place on Lincoln's Birthday every year.</p>
   <p>The report of he administration board, submitted by Secretary Mannhardt, is giving the following essential statements: The Society is in existence for eight years and during 1907 had an increasing of 34 members, while 20 members left or died. The financial standing of the Society has improved, due largely to generous contributions of prominent German-Americans. The year 1908 was started with a cash-balance of $473.67. The Society is deploring the loss of 3 friends and members by death-Wilhelm Bocke, Wilhelm Rapp and E. F. L. Gauss. The following new (members) officers were elected: Otto C. Schneider, President; F. G. Dewes, Vice President; Emil Manahaust, Secretary; A. Holinger, Treasurer while F. C. Habicht and E. W. Kalb were chosen new members of the administration board.</p>

   <p>Before the beginning of the meeting, Professor Dr. Paul Clemen, from the University of Bonn (Germany), gave a very interesting lecture about "Purpose and Goal of Modern Art in America and Germany." A warm applause rewarded Professor Clemen for his enlightening talk...</p>
