   <p>Last night, before the members of the Germania Association of Chicago, at the Fullerton Hall of the Art Institute, Martin Schuetze, Professor of "German History and Literature," at the Chicago University, spoke about the modern German Drama and its principal representatives. He showed in a most fascinating manner, the three directions of drama in modern Germany and selected a few dramas, analyzing their fundamentals. The three classes, Prof. Schuetze showed, comprise the following:- naturalistic, social dramas and the historical group. The greatest representative of the first is Gerhardt Hauptmann, to the second category belongs Hermann Sudermann, and to the third, Ernest V. Wildenbruch. The most important is the naturalistic; its conception may be regarded as the year 1889, at the Lesing Theater in Berlin, when his Play, "Before Sunrise", was given its initial performance. In this drama, (the naturalistic class) the materialistic philosophy is expressed. Fundamentally, it proves that the individual is the product of environment, the pawn of circumstance, that the cannot be held for the eventual, final outcome. He is powerless to liberate accountable himself from the past. Mental derangement, sexual digression, inherited disease, and intemperance predominate...</p>

   <p>The disappearance of the individual (in contrast to the "hero" plays), is shown in his great success "The Weavers." Its object is to give a photographic picture of life, in action, speech and so forth. Its themes are taken from the lower class strata. The social drama: more interesting but not so profound. The historic drama: its characters are not stark reality, but patriotic conceptions, not the works of poets. Fulda is its exponent, referred to as: "a clever imitator."</p>
