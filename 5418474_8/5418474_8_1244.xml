   <p>What even the most daring optimist would not have dared to hope, became a realization. More than 100 sports enthusiasts came together in the Lincoln Turner Hall, to organize a sport club. With tremendous enthusiasm the German Sport Club of Chicago was organized. The strict objectivity of the debate, and a sincere desire to accomplish something distinctive in the field of sport, ran like a red thread through the entire meeting. In them lies the guarantee of a good future for the organization. It is to be hoped, that later they will act as the strong talisman for the young German sporting element.</p>
   <p>It shall be the task of the German Sport Club, to gather the German sporting elements around their banner to continue the work of physical education, which was begun in the old homeland. The difficulties are not to be minimized. But such are only there to be overcome.</p>
   <p>The elected committee will endeavor to attend at first to the necessary organization of its new members. So far a quick survey has been made, and it shows that the predominating interests are swimming, light and heavy <pb facs="5418474_8_1245.jpg" n="2"/>athletics, and all lawn sports, therefore the practices of same should begin at once.</p>
   <p>The question of where the sports events should be held, and other similar questions, will be decided shortly.</p>
