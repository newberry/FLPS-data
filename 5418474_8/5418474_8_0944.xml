<title level="a">PROFESSOR SCHERGER LECTURES ON SCHILLER'S IDEALISM AT GERMANIA CLUB.</title></bibl>

   <p>Martin Luther, the great reformer and Martin Durkin the murderer, "Billy" Sunday and "Abe" Lincoln, Charles Darwin and William Jennings Bryan, they all and many more were cited yesterday evening by Professor George Scherger, to show the characteristics of the great German poet and idealist Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller before an audience in the Germania Club.</p>
   <p>The lecturer spoke of the thoughts of liberty, which enthused Schiller in his life and creations which compelled him to fly as a youth from the Karl school, and to which he gave expression in his "William Tell", and "Don Carlos". Said Professor Scherger, "The conviction was similar which compelled Luther to rebel against Latin usage and dogmas, which he considered as robbing him of light and liberty."</p>
   <p>A daring jump from the days of the middle ages, to the unsafe asphalt of today's Chicago, brought the speaker to Martin J. Durkin, the modern desperado, for whom a whole army of policemen are hunting thoroughly, but unsuccessfully. Schiller, he says, embodies the belief that goodness, the beautiful, and truth, <pb facs="5418474_8_0945.jpg" n="2"/>will triumph over the bad and meanness, that there is no crime without an adequate punishment, even if this punishment consists in the despair of a torn heart, and in the torture of a bad conscience. "Do you believe that Durkin is now satisfied and enjoys his life, knowing that a price has been set on his head, and that his conscience has to carry such a burden?" asked the professor.</p>
   <p>The speaker mentioned Billy Sunday, Lincoln, Bryan and Darwin in the course of his discussion of Schiller's personality, and his idealistic entry of the three conceptions, liberty, virtue and confidence in the heavenly will.</p>
   <p>With a warning cry to the Germans of Chicago to cultivate the cultural works and the language of their homeland, beyond the ocean, to value it more intensively as was the case before, Professor Scherger concluded.</p>
