   <p>The well-known German-American poetess, Miss Dorotheas Boettcher of Chicago, recited last night at the Germania Clubhouse, before a numerous and intelligent audience, an interesting selection of her own recent creation. Her latest products are evidence of her real poetical talents and of her very sensitive mind, and also of a keen ability to observe and characterize. She is, indeed, equal to the best of the German-American poets. The poems recited touch every human sensation. Her new creations possess to a very impressive degree-even surpassing her former products, the quality of real poets, where mere form is subservient to the spiritual contents. This fact also proves her real poetical talents and abilities. But she is also master of form which is clearly demonstrated by the beauty of form in her latest creations. It is hoped that Miss Boettcher will have her new poems printed soon, so that all can enjoy the same. It is certain that they will find a warm reception everywhere among lovers of poetry.</p>
   <p>Mrs. T. Brentano likewise recited a poem written by the poetess, Miss D. Boettcher.</p>
