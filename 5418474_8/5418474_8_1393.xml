<title level="a">THE INCLUSION OF TURNING (GYMNASTICS) IN CHICAGO'S PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. A RESUME EDITED AND PUBLISHED BY A BRANCH OF THE CHICAGO TURN DISTRICT. A REMINDER FOR THE CLUBS FROM OTHER TERRITORIES.</title></bibl>

   <p>During a meeting of the Chicago District Council on April 28, 1889, the Turn Club Vorwaerts (Forward ) offered the following motion: "That the Chicago District Council should write a treatise about the inclusion and adoption of gymnastics and their development in the public school system of Chicago; to publish a sufficiently large number of copies, in order to supply this information to all the affiliated clubs, the Turnverein Worwaerts."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1394.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The suggestion was accepted and the committee members who signed this request were deputized to write and gather all the facts. It was then decided to print the brochure and distribute it to the various clubs.</p>
   <p>The report:</p>
   <p>"A Sane Mind In A Healthy Body!"</p>
   <p>As an educational principle this sentence never has been questioned, yet there are very few educational institutions, where a practical compliance with this serene thought has been realized.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1395.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The North American Turner Alliance is the only organization throughout this vast land, which has made it its mission to bring the subject of neglected physical development to the attention of the public, and to create, by procuring the necessary apparatus and training of instructors, a harmonious development of body and mind, thereby giving proof of the beneficial results derived from such instructions. This is a great and noble task, and we are pleased to be able to report that general recognition of these ideas is now manifesting itself among the educated class of Americans who regard this German contribution to America as a valuable present whose intrinsic worth steadily increased the longer it remains in use.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1396.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Athletic clubs and Gymnastic societies that have come to life, hundreds, of them during the last ten years, their costly equipment, the participation of various religious sects for the same cause, and especially the Young Men's Christian Associations, give definite proof of the truth of our assertions. To crown this work with adequate success, it behooves us to have it adopted in all public schools.</p>
   <p>There were difficulties, mostly a lack of a trained teaching personnel, possessing command of the English language. Many of the specialists in this branch expressed the opinion that, after all, it was fortunate for the Turner movement (gymnastics) that the propaganda for its inclusion in the public schools did not take root until recently, that is, the past few years.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1397.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Thanks to our excellent Gymnastic Teachers' Seminary, which supervises the educational training of suitable teachers, and the liberal support the Alliance gives to this institution, that one great difficulty is now eliminated. If the American public would only appreciate our efforts to promote this ideal, by individual German clubs and the Alliance, to create a mentally and physically healthy youth for America (for only a healthy body begets a healthy mind), how we fought for this realization for 30 years and the sacrifices we made, it will not refrain from giving us its recognition.</p>
   <p>The propaganda in favor of gymnastics consisted mainly in exhibition performances and was resorted to in former years. Often great feats were performed on a par with circus dexterity. This was enjoyable to witness but its cultural <pb facs="5418474_8_1398.jpg" n="6"/>physical advantage was not conveyed; and instead of creating suitable publicity to include gymnastics in schools, these displays often produced the opposite effect. One desired and recognized the necessity of having healthy children, the public believed in the advisability of regular exercise, but no one cared to develop children into "circus artists." The latter view was not founded on correct deductions, but the impression derived from such performances gave hardly any alternative.</p>
   <p>This error brought a change in methods. It was decided to give a great children's, or student, mass performance, at least once a year. This emphasized the cultural value of body development. If ever a resolution produced great blessings, it certainly did in this instance. It brought a veritable revolution in the public's conception of gymnastics. Thus we inaugurated group "turning"; from the elementary classes by gradual stages to exhibitions of exemplary skill.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1399.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>A wise provision stipulated the abolition of entrance fees. These innovations changed the attitude of the public, the prejudice disappeared and progress was assured. After this preliminary work, and when we felt convinced that we would find a favorable response in important circles, we ventured to take steps for its introduction into the regular public school curriculum. Turner Frank Wenter, a member of the school board and also of the Turnverein Vorwaerts (Forward), offered a motion:</p>
   <p>"The school board should build suitable halls for physical exercise; further, the committee on textbooks and instruction should hold a consultation on the addition of gymnastics to the regular school course, at the next meeting, and give their report."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1400.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>This encompassing program terrified the committee members and they asked for a continuance to consider such a momentous question.</p>
   <p>During the interim, the Chicago Turn Community offered a more modest but practical suggestion: "The school board should give permission to hold a gymnastic performance in one of their schools." A classroom in the Ogden school was selected and the performance was announced for the latter part of June.</p>
   <p>This trial was such a success under the leadership of instructor Heinrich Suder, (who later held the post of superintendent of gymnastics of the Chicago Public Schools), that it brought eventually inclusion of gymnastics in the public and high schools of Chicago. At present there are 85,000 children, and 15 teachers under the jurisdiction of Mr. Suder, and gymnastics are taught in compliance with a standardized plan. Surely an accomplishment to which the German Turners of Chicago can look with pride, since it must be conceded that their constant agitation brought this realization.</p>
