   <p>Mr. L. Wiener announces the publication of a new semi-monthly magazine called the "Freeminded" (Radical). It will not fight religious or other opinions, and will not force anybody to its convictions. Its purpose is not to fight and convert but to entertain and educate. It will practise strict toleration and its motto will be, "Respect every individual opinion as long as it is an honest conviction and not against civilization". It will however, fight hypocrisy, immorality and fanaticism, the main maladies of our times. This was, also the standpoint of our principal poets Schiller and Lessing. Everybody who wishes to work with us in that sense is heartily welcome.</p>
   <p>The following changes have been made in the choice of our coworkers: For the arts and sciences, Dr. Otto Dietrich has been chosen: for Pedagogy and Philology, Prof. Leo Wiener of the Missouri State University.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wiener, who had a long journalistic career is to be congratulated on his undertaking and on the principles of same, which is a good proof of the spiritual price <pb facs="5418474_8_0672.jpg" n="2"/>progress of our nation. The subscription price is $1.50 per year. Orders for the Radisal can be placed with Messrs Koelling and Klappenbach, 102 Randolph Street.</p>
