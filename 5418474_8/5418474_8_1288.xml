   <p>On occasion of a banquet which the Press Club had arranged last night, it was discussed about the introductory steps to the preparations for the olympic Games that shall be held in Chicago in two years. The first of these games were held in Athens, the second in Paris, and now Chicago has been selected as the place for the third games.</p>
   <p>The costs of this arrangement to which all sport fans in which all parts of the world will be invited are estimated at $2,000,000.00. Mr. B. J. Rosenthal expressed in an address his positive expectation that the raising of this fund will offer no difficulties and that also foreign governments are willing to carry a share of the costs.</p>
   <p>Henry J. Furber, president of the Olympic games Association submitted a plan by which the games are divided into rubrics. The first division includes all games of International character, the second National games of the different nations, the third consists of pure athletic performances, the fourth Military exercises, the fifth consists of an exhibition of Turning and Sport <pb facs="5418474_8_1289.jpg" n="2"/>implements and the sixth is the Congress in which the games find their conclusion.</p>
