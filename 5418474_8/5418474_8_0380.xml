   <p>The year book of 1914 of the German American Historical Society has been published. This attractive 700 page book of interesting historical news is well suitable for the lay man as well as the scholar.</p>
   <p>In reference to its contents, letters of Karl Fallens sent to the Court Counselor Herman Haupt, the best connoisseur of the history of the German student's association, and transmitted to us, reflect a new light upon the life of the man whose influence in the educational and political development of this country has been tremendous.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0381.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A leader in the anti-slavery movement, the intellectual liberator of the more intelligent class of American people, in his day, he was considered the greatest German American of the last century. The anthology of German poetry by H. A. Ratterman, collector of German-American history for many years, is a very important work. Although affected with blindness, the collection has been put together with ardent devotion and we see deep into the religious and intellectual life of our German-American forefathers of the 18th century.</p>
   <p>Miss Viola E. Knoche shows us in a profound manner the influence Richard Wagner reflected upon the spirit of the American people.</p>
   <p>Herman Eliaseoff brings us in his article very interesting details, concerning German-American Judaism, which up to the present has attracted but little attention in the sphere of German-American culture.</p>
   <p>The essay, which contains abundant detail, deserves particular attention for the overcoming of prevailing prejudices.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0382.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The works of Otto Lahr are always interesting. His articles about German-Americanism of 100 years ago and the war of 1812 - 1815 will not disappoint his readers.</p>
   <p>Prof. F. J. Harriott has presented an important work. Although a full-blooded Yankee of French descent, he is appreciative of value of the German-American, and his works should be widely distributed, especially at this critical time.</p>
   <p>The membership fee or yearly contribution of the German American Historical Society amounts to only $3.00.</p>
   <p>Anybody, with a feeling towards Germanism, should assist the Society. <pb facs="5418474_8_0383.jpg" n="4"/>Only through effort to bring into prominence works of German culture, room can be made for the recognition of German thought and character.</p>
   <p>Knowledge of the history of the cultural work of the German pioneer is necessary, as it enables the German-American to counteract slander and, at the same time, work for enlightenment.</p>
   <p>The Anglo-American newspapers, through their poisonous editorials, sowed bad seed. It is common knowledge: the superficial education of the average American, the absence of fundamentals, and therefore, it should be easy to succeed if the American is presented with facts; of the accomplishment of the German-American in regard to their adapted country; of their influence upon education, social and intellectual life, and of the benefit to be derived for one and all.</p>
