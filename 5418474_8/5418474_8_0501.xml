   <p>Champ Clark, Speaker of the House of Representatives, made a highly important statement on Thursday, May 16, and gave representatives of the press full authority to gives wide circulation to his words.</p>
   <p>The speaker said, that the public and the readers of American papers printed in the German language, need have no fear on congress ever passing a law to suppress these papers providing they observe the existing laws.</p>
   <p>He further stated, that congress has no power to pass such a law, and that the movement for the suppression of the German press would not be countenanced in congress. He added, that of course local authorities in states and cities and the power to stop official advertisements in any other than the American language.</p>
   <p>He claimed, that in St. Louis (in his own state), the movement was a question <pb facs="5418474_8_0502.jpg" n="2"/>of business rivalry, and that he supposed the same was true concerning other communities.</p>
   <p>He called the German language newspapers loyal and said, that the government, itself, was most benefited by them, and that the government fully appreciated the services rendered by them.</p>
