   <p>The next number of the Sunday paper of the Abendpost will bring the beginning of a novel in which a former German officer describes his experiences in our country, and for which the Abendpost bought the copyright. We especially call attention to this novel "Zehn Jahre in America" by Waldemar V. H.- because it stands in our opinion above the average.</p>
   <p>The author has travelled much in our country and had all kinds of experiences and was a keen observer. He understands how to talk pleasantly and interestingly and avoids the usual rash judgment. He describes things and conditions as they appeared to him in modest but captivating terms and will not place everything extraordinary as typical for the "wild land" or of the "country of the wild man", as our Republic must seem to readers of the stories of simular travellers. The story breathes freshness and natural truth and is rich in interesting descriptions and unusual humor.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0324.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Chicagoans will find in it much of local interest because the writer staged for a longer period in the metropolis of the West and knows to report many interesting and gay events of this time.</p>
