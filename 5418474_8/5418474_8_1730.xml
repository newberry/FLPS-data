<title level="a">APOLLO LODGE I.O.O.F. CELEBRATES GOLDEN JUBILEE. HARMONY SINGING SOCIETY GIVE PROGRAM.</title></bibl>

   <p>The golden jubilee of Apollo Lodge No. 165 I.O.O.F. belongs to the past. The great success of the festival held in the Northside Turner Hall should be cnsidered proof of the Lodge's vitality. The attendance was distinguished, the program of a large variety, and inspired by artistic sensibility. A real festival spirit prevailed. The Lodge received a number of congratulations from other lodges of the I.O.O.F. among them Palm lodge, the Germania and Goethe lodges which served as a proof of the mutual understanding that prevails among them. A bright point of the performances was the gala exercises of the united Palm Lodge and the Johanna Rebekah Lodge, under the command of Capt. John Schmidt and Capt. Anna Wischoeffer. About 60 men and women, all dressed in white, appeared on the stage and received much applause.</p>
   <p>The president of the festival, Wm. Alfred Hecht, gave a well received speech, in which he described the development of the lodge from the time of its beginning up till the June days of this year. It is actually unjust, to mention only a few <pb facs="5418474_8_1731.jpg" n="2"/>numbers of the rich program. Still if we do it, perhaps it is in the first place due to the offerings of Misses Wilma and Emily Bieber on the piano, the artistic dances of Miss Helen Stefans, and the song performance of the Saxon Men's chorus. The performance of the Misses Bieber, who played fourhanded on the piano, betrayed a good deal of direct feeling and excellent schooling. Chief patriarch John Schmidt made a humorous speech, which generated a cheerful tone. In connection with the program, a ball followed.</p>
   <p>Musical gounmets, who appreciate good singing, were fully rewarded, when they attended the song evening of the Harmony singing society, yesterday evening at the auditorium, which was followed later by the celebration of the 36th anniversary of the society's founding. No false note disturbed the Harmony and under the direction of Karl Rekzeh, a rich program was offered. Especially pleasing were the "Corsairsong" by Baumann, "Sing Little Bird" by Baldamus, and Weinzierl's "Today is today" which, upon request of the audience has to be repeated several times. The chorus of the Harmony was the old compact mass, as which it is known, ever ready to follow the inspiration of its leader. Of the solo numbers, the songs of the soprano Senta Horst, the violinist Marshall Gosson and the pianist Miss Lillian Karish should be mentioned. The festival was followed by a ball.</p>
