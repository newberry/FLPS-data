   <p>Mr. Henry Schmehl, the German sprinter, returned from California a few days ago and has completely recuperated. He says, concerning his contest with O'Leary in San Francisco, that although many had promised to take care of him, he had received nothing to drink but ice water on the first day. On Monday he was two and one-half miles behind. On Tuesday he did not feel well and was told by a physician to rest for several hours. On Wednesday, O'Leary had an advantage of 271/2 miles over him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Schmehl states that he is not discouraged but is still convinced that he can beat O'Leary. This explanation will be a comfort to his many admirers. O'Leary has admitted that Schmehl was beaten by illness and not by himself, and has refused to accept the reward.</p>
