   <p>Such is the unassuming title of a work of more than three hundred pages. The book contains an almost complete collection of Caspar But'z poems. The author is a Chicagoan.</p>
   <p>We have few poets here. Poetry, somehow, does not thrive on our American soil, and among our German-Americans there are only a few who excel. Caspar Butz belongs to this small group. It appears that fate selected him, in this land of sordid materialism, to carry on German tradition, and to remain undismayed by environment. His book gives ample evidence that he ardently dedicated himself to his work.</p>
   <p>Every page shows inspiration and rare talent, and betrays his nostalgia for his homeland and foreign ideals, but also gives the impressions his newly adopted country has made upon his discerning mind. A true German-American, who professes profound enthusiasm for liberty as exemplified by America, and yet <pb facs="5418474_8_0722.jpg" n="2"/>bears reverence to his native heath! He speaks of the Rhine and the vintages, the red soil, and memories of the long ago; of Germany's awakening and unity, the insolence of France and its vanquished armies, of Germany's victory and rise.</p>
   <p>Many of his poems deal with our Civil War of 1861-65, and give a vivid picture of that period.</p>
   <p>Here is a versatile work in which are recorded the observations of a quarter-century.</p>
   <p>We hope that this will not be the author's only work.</p>
