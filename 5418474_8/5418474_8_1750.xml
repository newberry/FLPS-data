   <p>During the hot months of July and August, the office of the Association will be closed after two o'clock in the afternoon. We ask all who intend to order provisions for foreign delivery, to kindly call in the forenoon, or to send the request by mail, enclosing a check.</p>
   <p>A call for help reached us from the Heppel Foundation, in Limburg an der Lahn. Unobtrusive sufferers, the timid poor, generally represent the most oppressive form of poverty, and are worthy of support. To this category, undoubtedly, belong the various private benevolent institutions and homes; they constitute Germany's greatest philanthropic endeavors. A singularly tragic fate hovers over these organizations. Founded to conform to the humane attitude of their originators, who endeavored to ease the sorrows of others, these homes now face dire distress. Their closing hour approaches, due to the lamentable aftereffects of the War. One of these foundations, the Heppel Establishment, is hard <pb facs="5418474_8_1751.jpg" n="2"/>pressed to obtain current funds. This home originated through the magnanimity of the Heppel family. It provides shelter for single, destitute women. The seventy-five year old founder is not enabled any more to carry the financial burden, since his fortune dwindled through the present devaluation crisis. He beseeches all who are inbued with a sacrificial spirit to give temporary help.</p>
   <p>[In the following two paragraphs twenty tragic cases of abject poverty and sickness are tersely described; also two acknowlegements wherein recipients express gratitude for provisions and clothing. Translator]</p>
   <p>Honey may be purchased at our office, likewise, beautiful hand-made articles from Germany. The proceeds therefrom will be sent abroad. The books of Professor Rohrbach are still for sale for the benefit of starving students. Address: 128 North LaSalle Street, Room 47, Telephone: Franklin 0339.</p>
