   <p>The Vahteich matter, which occasioned so much dissatisfaction among the North Side Turners a short time ago, has taken a new phase with the decision of the National Executive Board of the Turnerbund of St. Louis, read Wednesday night. Instead of the breach being healed it has been widened, and no matter how it turns out now a big defection from the Turners' ranks is inevitable.</p>
   <p>When the North Chicago Turngemeinde ousted Socialist Vahlteich he appealed to the district Board. That board suspended the Turngemeinde. The latter appealed to the National Executive Board; and after long deliberation that body reached a conclusion. This was that the District Board tried in suspending the Turngemeinde, but that the Turngemeinde must take Vahlteich back as a member until the National Board had examined into his case.</p>
   <p>This decision was read at the Turngemeinde meeting in the North Side Turner Hall Wednesday night. It created a storm of indignation.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1372.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Many members said that if Vahlteich were taken back even for a moment they would resign. A resolution was adopted refusing to countenance, Vahlteich, repudiating the decision of the National Executive Board, and appealing the matter to the national convention, which will meet at Washington next year.</p>
   <p>The Turngemeinde members say a split is inevitable now no matter what steps the national bodies take. It is quite likely that matters now will be more complicated by the suspension of the Turngemeinde by the National board for refusing to obey its decisions.</p>
   <p>The Turngemeinde officers having in charge the erection of the new Turner Hall have not yet fixed upon the plans for such building. The arrangementsfor a gymnasium, however, have been decided upon. It is to occupy the building by itself and will cost $75,000.</p>
