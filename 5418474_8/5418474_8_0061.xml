<title level="a">PARADE AND PICNIC OF THE LEHR- UND WEHRVEREIN</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Judge Barnum decided that the militia law is unconstitutional, and this decision induced the Socialists to celebrate. The Lehr- und Wehrverein (Education and Defence Club--a division of the Socialists) and several other Socialist organizations paraded through the city prior to their picnic at Ogden's grove. Threatening weather helped to dampen the ardor of our Socialist soldiery.....</p>
   <p>The parade, led by H. Presser, started about ten o'clock, at Randolph and Halsted Streets. The brass band of the Lehr- und Wehrverein was at the head of the parade, followed by the labor guard; then came the grim-faced Bohemian sharpshooters, who carried empty rifles; next, the well-dressed hunters with breech and muzzle loaders; then the Lehr- und Wehrverein in all its glory, with Captain Bielefeldt as its most prominent member. Finally came the peaceful-appearing furniture workers, with a band in the vanguard.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0062.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The entire parade contained about six hundred men. The Socialist soldiers showed that they were well trained. At least they appeared to much better advantage than the capitalistic hordes and "Calico Brigade" which marched a few days ago; the Socialists certainly showed that they knew the meaning of subordination. [Translator's note: "Capitalistic hordes and 'Calico Brigade'" refers to the pageant given by the Schwabenverein, a burgeois affair, several days previous, when streets and buildings were decorated with bunting.]</p>
   <p>The parade went east on Randolph Street to Clark Street; north to Chicago Avenue, then to Wells Street; from there to Larabee Street and North Avenue; west to Clybourn, and finally to Ogden's grove. Aside from the many red flags carried by the men, a few German flags were seen.</p>
   <p>Ogden's grove presented a rather uninviting appearance at first, but when the sun came out the crowd was happy. Labor, as represented by Germans from various districts of the Reich, Bohemians, French, a few Irish, and a couple of Americans amused themselves in the picnic grounds, which were somewhat too <pb facs="5418474_8_0063.jpg" n="3"/>large for the size of the crowd. The Socialist soldiers stacked their guns in true military style, while sentinels marched back and forth.... The soldiers danced....and drank beer. Everyone present seemed pleased that the right of the people to carry arms had again been established.</p>
   <p>Then came the speeches, three altogether, all expressing the same thing. The first speaker was Mr. Auliffe, professional agitator, who congratulated labor on its victory and envisioned, in Judge Barnum's decision, the dawn of a new era calculated to promote the happiness of the masses by providing equality.</p>
   <p>Then came the principal speaker, Paul Grottkau, who addressed the crowd in German. He told how the exploited people realized, a few years ago, that action was necessary, and organized unions at first, then became involved in politics, and finally started military organizations.</p>
   <p>"The people realized that these organizations were necessary, that labor <pb facs="5418474_8_0064.jpg" n="4"/>must combine against capital, that solidarity in political matters was essential if labor wanted to have a voice in Congress, and that proficiency in the handling of firearms was imperative, so that the rights acquired by peaceful means could be defended if the need arose. Capitalists, being cowardly, conspired to pass a law in Springfield denying the people the right to form military organizations. The despised law is the so-called militia bill. The people appealed to the courts, as a preliminary measure, to seek protection against the encroachments upon rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The people triumphed, at least in Cook County. But that does not end the matter. At present the people's right to carry arms in Cook County is established. But we must not rest until this right is unequivocally recognized throughout the nation.</p>
   <p>"To realize the ideals of modern socialism we must have men who are willing to die for their principles--men who sacrifice themselves for the people; such men I expect to find among the members of the Lehr- und Wehrverein. We must not, under any circumstances, entrust the leadership of our party to <pb facs="5418474_8_0065.jpg" n="5"/>men whose reputations are not above reproach. Another thing we cannot sanction is the despicable conduct of those who hail a leader today and denounce him tomorrow. We must choose, as leaders, only men who are thoroughly convinced and sincere in their attitude towards socialism. Only in that manner can socialism be realized.</p>
   <p>"Why does the Lehr- und Wehrverein carry arms? Not for play, to be sure. The time will soon come when the subjugated, exploited masses will arise for a fight to the finish, and thus abolish the rule of the few. As class distinction becomes more acute, when seventy-nine out of a hundred lose their possessions, when the great mass of the people at last realizes the hopelessness of its existence, then is the time when associations like the Lehr- und Wehrverein must show their mettle."</p>
   <p>Grottkau spoke for about twenty minutes, and was frequently interrupted by applause.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0066.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Captain Frank Bielefeldt, the man who was saved from jail, spoke in English. He publicly thanked his lawyers, [Harry] Rubens and Story.</p>
   <p>The people then enjoyed such amusements as the grove provided. Dancing followed. The celebration ended about midnight.</p>
