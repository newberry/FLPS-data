   <p>When choosing an educational institution, the first question we ought to ask is: who are the heads of the institution and what is their reputation?</p>
   <p>Balatka Musical College, which is located in the Auditorium Building, 431 South Wabash Avenue, and to which six readers will receive a scholarship, is known beyond the boundaries of Chicago as a first-class institution.</p>
   <p>Established in 1879 by Hans Balatka, this school has made the name of its founder famous in Chicago. For twenty-one years he was the active leader and the chief teacher at the institution. His son and successor, Doctor Christian F. Balatka, received his elementary instruction at the school. His father later sent him to Europe to continue his studies. Upon his return he assumed active leadership of Balatka Musical College, which is still under his personal supervision.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0431.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The other teachers who are instructing at the institution are, without exception, men and women who have had an excellent musical training and have taught in the best conservatories of America and Europe.</p>
   <p>Six scholarships, having a total value of $1,800, will be granted. The first condition for participation in the competition is that the applicants must be regular readers of the Abendpost and the Sonntagpost. They must send the coupons which will appear every day for one week, beginning Sunday, to out office by February 3.</p>
   <p>Scholarships will be awarded solely on the basis of talent displayed at an examination; so no preference will be shown with reference to the time applications are received.</p>
