   <p>The members of the Ladies' Auxiliary of the Chicago Turngemeinde observed the fortieth anniversary of their organization last evening in the dining room of the Nordseite Turnhalle (North Side Turner Hall).</p>
   <p>The members' husbands and some intimate friends also participated in the celebration, which began at eight o'clock and consisted chiefly of a banquet, various recitations, and dancing. President Isabella Carr requested Mr. Ernst Kusswurm, the first speaker of the Turngemeinde, to act as chairman, and he acquitted himself of the task with credit, although he was not prepared to perform the duties involved. Having presented a pretty bouquet to the auxiliary in the name of the Turngemeinde, he thanked the ladies for performing many tasks on various occasions, and especially for their distribution of gifts during the Christmas season. The male chorus of the Turngemeinde assisted in entertaining the guests with several well-rendered vocal selections. Others who contributed to the enjoyment were: The Misses <pb facs="5418474_8_1268.jpg" n="2"/>Elsa Guhler, Grace Meyer, Frieda Brehmer; Mrs. Charlotte Kremser, Mrs. Marie Schultz, Mrs, Carr, Mrs. Sophie Schumann, Mrs. Bianca Dreyer; Messrs. Charles Eichin, Herman Dietz, George A. Schmidt, Charles Appel, Kusswurm.</p>
   <p>Greetings were sent to Mr. Adolph Georg, only male member of the Ladies Auxiliary, who is confined to his home by illness. News of his gradual recovery was received with great joy.</p>
