   <p>p. 4.. It has become a source of constant dissatisfaction to note that our German-American youth is gradually being Americanized, that the German language and customs are gradually relegated to oblivion. The public school with its predominating Anglo-American attendance and the limited time which is given to German instruction, is hardly able to ameliorate the situation; neither does the home influence always suffice.</p>
   <p>The solution therefore depends upon the private schools. These institutions then must educate our German-American yourth according to German principles, and must give it a true appreciation of the linguistic beauties and of the wealth of the German language. This must be accomplished without neglecting English and the other subjects required in this country.</p>
   <p>Parents who wish to give an education to their daughters, a culture which enables them to feel at home, here and abroad, will do well to entrust them to a German-American boarding school. A particularly suitable one is the Minerva Institute, of Mrs. Amalie Ende, in Ravenswood. There they learn not to despise housework while acquiring knowledge. Many become teachers, while <pb facs="5418474_8_0782.jpg" n="2"/>others continue their studies at universities. Many prominent German families have sent their daughters to the Minerva Institute.</p>
