   <p>Of all the German educational institutions of America the Kindergarten has received the least attention; Chicago, especially seems to take very little interest in this matter. Rumor is circulating that there are three or four such institutions proposed for Chicago but, as Chicago has a large number of children under the age of six years, we doubt whether these few new schools for the very young ones would be sufficient. Such lack of interest is hard to explain. If the reason is that the Kindergarten teachers are not qualified or because of lack of funds or location, the question is asked, how can this be remedied? We consider that the education of our children up to the age of six years is only a preparation for later education. Until then, the normal child naturally longs for activity, which it finds only in play. Many parents, although loving their children, do not have the necessary intelligence to guide them, so it would be advisable to entrust our youngsters to competent care. While the child plays it learns and while it learns, it plays. The teachers in Germany made the observation that children who received Kindergarten instruction are much alert and their desire for learning greater.</p>
