  <body>
   <p>Last Friday, the Swabian Athletic Club held its semiannual general conference, with election of officers. It was well attended and it was harmoniously conducted.</p>
   <p>The managers of the individual teams made their reports: they were favorable throughout. The first team, directed by their manager, Hutsch, was the first German team to win the championship of the International League. The be satisfied with its achievements. Quite successful were the lightweight athletes of the club. They achieved victory at the meet of the Schutzbund on the 4th of July in a about under the direction of S. Goetz and E. Stopelfeldt, and for the first time won the Fritz Weis Memorial trophy. The old-timers definitely succeeded in wresting the Curtiss Candy cup for this season.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1181.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All in all, these are successes of which the Swabian Athletic Club may well be proud.</p>
   <p>The social activities of the Club, which have always been crowned by success showed that the entertainment committee has been hard at work. The report submitted by the treasurer was quite favorable.</p>
   <p>The chairman read the names of the outgoing board of directors, who were given permission to resign by the assembled delegates. The election of "new" directors was swiftly accomplished, because all members of the board were re-elected by acclamation. The board of directors of the Swabian Athletic Club is composed of the following:</p>
   <p>President, Hermann Trumpp, 1924 North Karlov Avenue; vice-president, Hans Hansen; Secretary, Robert Epplen, 2517 North Mozart Street; treasurer, Hans Fuchs; secretary-treasurer, Kurt Ulrich; manager of first team, Franz Kutsch, <pb facs="5418474_8_1182.jpg" n="3"/>755 Cornelia Avenue; manager of second team, Ernst Bubeck, 2714 Maplewood Avenue; manager of third team, Otto Springmann, 3823 North Monticello Avenue; supervisor of football, Karle (sic!)
