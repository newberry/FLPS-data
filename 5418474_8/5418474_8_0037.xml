   <p>After a period of rest of hardly two weeks, Chicago again will appear decorated with flags, and this time they are the gay Swabians, who are active to make all arrangements to make their third Cannstadter People's Festival a really elaborate one.</p>
   <p>The roomy Ogden's Grove Garden has been chosen as the place of festival and the festival committee is already busy to arrange the installation of the stands and boxes of the great fair and make all other necessary preparations. The Swabians are very anxious to excel what had been offered by the Platt Germans and they have proved already in former years what they are able to do if they take matters seriously. The first day of festival a Sunday will be especially dedicated to the great festival parade which has been planned by the Committee with very great care and which has been arranged according to artistic sketches. The well known artist, Theo Studle, has designed the sketches and if the parade according to these is actually put in operation it will surpass by far everything which had been done to the present.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0038.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first part of the festival parade will represent in various groups agriculture and farming and in this department will also be found the cart with the statues of the four allegorical figures, Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter.</p>
   <p>Then comes the representation of the individual yearly periods; first the Spring with the Goddess; "Flora" who is flying from a giant lily and is encircled by nymphs beneath a foliage of flowers. In the parade are the plougher and the harrow, the sower and the mower; Then follows the Summer with a cart richly decorated containing hay. Autumn is represented by Bacchus who seated in a golden wine cart is surrounded by a group of drinkers, followed by other cider and wine carts. The Winter is symbolized with a spinning room and a hunting party. The flag cart following has 21 different bearers with their National flags rounded on a platform on which the Goddess of Liberty is found. The marching route of the parade will be made known by announcements in the Press.</p>

   <p>Arriving at the place of festival a welcome speech will be given by President Jos. Schoeninger. The German festival speech will be held by Mr. William Rapp and the English one by Mr. Carter H. Harrison. Then follows a grand concert of 30 of the best musicians of Chicago. In the evening will be shown large pictures, scenes from Wurtemberg public buildings, statues, etc. which have been made especially for this purpose.</p>
   <p>The finish of the evening is dedicated to a large Summer-night's festival with park illuminations.</p>
   <p>The second day people's and juvenile plays will be held. The program for this day also includes a big cock-dance, the big Shepherds run of Urach and crownings at the fair.</p>
