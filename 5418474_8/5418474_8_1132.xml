   <p>The Socialists of the Northwest Side met last night at Nutzhorn's Hall. The Subject of the debate was "Our newest Achievement"and the Illinois Coporal Punishment Law. All the speakers taking part in the debate condemned the newly established "middle ages" in America.</p>
   <p>To maintain the lave system, the workers are denied schools and education, therefore one should not be surprised, when occasionally one of these individuals becomes rough and brutal. But to think that brutality could be conquered with brutality ! To establish a punishment like that, would have a demoralizing effect onthe people. Corporal punishment would be inflicted only on the lower classes, it would never be resorted to on a wealthy man. This punishment intended at first only for the wife-beater, would soon take on larger dimensions if once established.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1133.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At times when unemployment reigns and thousands of unemployed (given the name of tramps) wander through the land it would be an every day occurrence, to punish the misery by a public exhibition like that. The meeting decided to send a petition to our legislators against establishing this kind of punishment.</p>
   <p>Then Comrade Spies reported on his agitation trip to the East. According to his opinion revolutionary Socialism enjoys favor everywhere. There are locals in all the larger cities which are growing rapidly. Several of the Van Patten associations have declared themselves tired of the milk and water policy of the "Knights of Labor and will soon join the Federative Socialists. It is a strong demand for an information bureau in Chicago. Spies then gave a vivid sketch of the agitation which is planned for the coming summer. His proposals met with general favor. It was suggested to request the Central Committee to call a general meeting at which the information bureau shall be established. The proposal was accepted.</p>
