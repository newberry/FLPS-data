   <p>The "German-American Young Ladies Institute", the well known girls school, under the supervision of Mrs. Amalie Ende, 605 North Clark Street, arranged a Shakespeare evening last Friday at which many relatives and friends of the pupils were present... The execution of the program began with a piano solo played by Mamie Ryan. Following was the fairy scene from the "Midsummer nights dream", beautifully executed by a group of girls eight years of age. Then came a scene from "As you like it". Miss Pick the recital teacher at the school acted the part of Orlando and later portrayed "Lady Macbeth's" sleep-walking. This in itself was sufficient to convince us of her efficiency as an instructor. The Rosalind in this scene was acted by Miss Lizzie Siewers who delivered her part very satisfactorily. Next was a piano recital by Miss Emilie Schlather, an "Elegie" by Schubert, then a monolog from "Romeo and Juliet" recited by Minnie Roesch and the madness of "Ophelia" recited by Nannie Ryan, which was especially well received. At last but not least we want to mention the recital by Mrs. Cometer and Mr. H.F. Scully who of course are not pupils of the school. Mrs. Cometer sang a soprano solo by Schubert and Mr. Scully enacted a scene from "Julius Caesar".</p>
