   <p>The gymnastic club"Washington" which had been founded August 2nd of last year, with a few members has, worked in this short time with such success, as has never happened before in the history of gymnastics - at least not in Chicago. The membership of the club has increased to such an extent that the club now possesses an active gymnastic class, a pupil's class, an old age section, a fencing class, drum and ladies section. The club has achieved such results, that they now have been able to possess their own home. This new gymnastic hall 2106-2108 N. Clark St. was inaugurated Saturday and Sunday and the celebration will be continued today. The festival was opened with a great gymnastic demonstration and the inauguration took place yesterday. In the afternoon the clubs taking part, marched with song and music from their old place to the new home. The transfer was made by Mr. Philip Nuernberger, President of the building committee. The gymnastic demonstration was participated by members of the "Vorwaerbs" the "Aurora"; the "Progress" and the "Young Ladies Athletic Club. The program contained performances of various singing clubs. Tonight will be held a great raffle and dance, and the inauguration will be continued the 19th and 20th.</p>
