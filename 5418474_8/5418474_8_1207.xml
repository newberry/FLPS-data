   <p>The lion's share of all prizes went to the Chicagoans, victors at the Turner festival. The magnificent festival is over; the thirty-fourth festival of the American Turners' Alliance in Buffalo was brilliantly concluded with a final festal display at the All High Stadium yesterday afternoon. The wonderful weather favored the performances; 15,000 people were present when the speaker of the Bund, Seihel, began the distribution of prizes.</p>
   <p>The Lincoln Turner Society finished with honors and won with 230.73 points the third prizes. The Chicago Turner Society won sixth place.</p>
   <p>Chicago Rich in Honors</p>
   <p>The Turner festival was a tremendous advertisement for German gymnastic exercises, and the Turner Bund can rightfully be proud of the success of the festival, which was held in Buffalo. For the Chicago Turners [especially] <pb facs="5418474_8_1208.jpg" n="2"/>this festival was a great success. Even though some [individual] societies had perhaps greater hopes before the festival, still the [total] result exceeded all expectations. Chicago carried away the lion's share of the prizes. No other city can be compared with Chicago.</p>
   <p>The officials of the North American Turner Bund are George Seihel, president; Dr. Herman Groth,vice-president; William Voelker, secretary; Ernest Herklotz, assistant secretary; and Henry Thier, treasurer. The festival committee consisted of Dethloffs E. Klein, president; Emil Wohler, vice-president; Anthony M. Paul, secretary; John Steger, assistant secretary; Emil Lene, treasurer; Clarence G. Zangerle, assistant treasurer; and Andrew Lascari, manager of performances and director of the field meet.</p>
