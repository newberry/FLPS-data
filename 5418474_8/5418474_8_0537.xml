   <p>On the occasion of the completion of its 25 years existence, the "Freie Presse" appeared today in a 40 page festival edition. It contains, besides an abbreviated History of Chicago, and a compressed review of the economic and social life of the city, a very interesting retrospect of the papers origin and development. From relatively modest beginnings, the "Freie Presse" has under the approved direction of its Editor in Chief, Mr. Richard Michaelis, in spite of many difficulties and vicissitudes succeeded in raising the paper to its present assured and respected position. Better than protracted descriptions, this fact could be illustrated by the following camparison: In February 1872 the editorial staff consisted of only 3 persons. Mr. Michaelis wrote the editorials, and was at the same time his own telegram-Editor, while Mr. Leopold Schenk, had, with another reporter, to attend to the balance of the <pb facs="5418474_8_0538.jpg" n="2"/>paper. Today, Mr. Michaelis has a large number of collaborators at his side, and the total of those employed, including composers, delivers , etc. amounts to nearly 150 people.</p>
   <p>With justified pride, can the founder look back at this great success, due to his indefatigable aim.</p>
