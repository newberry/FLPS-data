   <p>The bazaar which the Turnverein Vorwaerts held for the benefit of its free Sunday school came to an end yesterday. On the last day a dance was given. The Club had hopes that Chicago Germans would give hearty support to the cause, in view of the purposes involved. Although many prominent Germans displayed an active interest, all in all, participation was rather poor. Let us stress the fact that many parents of children who were benefited by the school were absent.</p>
   <p>On Friday evening the ballots were counted according to schedule. At the various voting booths interest became heightened shortly before closing time as friends of the various candidates appeared and hailed the mounting votes.</p>
   <p>The winners: Among the beer brewers, Mr. H. Gottfried, who had a majority of about nine hundred.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0191.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dry goods and clothing stores: J. Klein's New Central Dry Goods and Clothing Store obtained a majority of about 450 votes.</p>
   <p>Of the four Turnvereine which competed for a prize, it was found that the Chicago Turngemeinde received nearly all the votes.</p>
   <p>In regard to yesterday's ball, which was the finale of the fair, one must say that such a pleasant gathering has not been noted at the Vorwaerts Turner Hall for a long time.</p>
   <p>All objects not sold at the fair were offered at auction....and the splendid articles....will always serve their present owners as delightful mementos of the occasion.</p>
   <p>The prominent contestants were given their prizes in a festive manner and Turner Harry Rubens expressed thanks for the generous support.</p>
   <p>We hear that the Turnverein Vorwaerts does not intend to give up the Sunday <pb facs="5418474_8_0192.jpg" n="3"/>school--in spite of the fact that the proceeds of the fair were small. This is additional proof that the ambitions of the Verein are worthy and laudable.</p>
