   <p>The Hunter's Association Picnic, was a very successful one. With the arrival of the Hunter's Society and, the lovely music played by the Germania Band, the festival commenced. At 3:30 P.M. Mr. Gustav Lyser delivered his festive speech, the principle points of which, we cite here:- "To-day is the anniversary of Lassalle's death; one who through his intellect and energy created the impulse of the modern labor movement."</p>
   <p>The speaker also spoke of the attempt planned by the ruling classes for National disarmament, through martial law. The speaker ended with a Hoch for the right of National Armament. With great satisfaction, we point the following of his speech: "The corruption of all the newspapers is evident. Watch and see, who the writers for newspapers are, and who are the persons, who find it beneath their dignity to write for them."</p>
   <p>The closing of the festival was marked by a Tableau, "The Last Barricade."</p>
