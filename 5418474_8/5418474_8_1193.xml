   <p>At the request of various swimmers, and through the intervention of one of them, it was possible to obtain one of the best private swimming pools for the training of members of the Schutzbund (Lifesaving Club). This is the swimming pool of the Mid-West Athletic Club on Hamlin Avenue and Madison Street. The pool is sixty by twenty-five feet, has a high and low jumping board and all modern sanitary equipment. Bathing suits are lent to the swimmers.</p>
   <p>Lessons in swimming will be given for the first time Tuesday, December 6, from 8 to 10 P. M. to ladies and gentlemen. Admission has been fixed at fifty cents for the present, but with sufficient participation a considerable reduction is to be expected. One of the Athletic Club's swimming instructors volunteered his services free of charge. The swimming pool of the Mid-West Athletic Club is easy to reach by either the street car or the elevated. The main entrance is through the basement. The superintendent of the Schutzbund expects many <pb facs="5418474_8_1194.jpg" n="2"/>participants, and he asks all who are interested in swimming to make their appearance.</p>
