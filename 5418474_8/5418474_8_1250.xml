   <p>The S. F. C. Victoria, founded by a few young Germans in 1916, changed its name to the "German Club Soccer Football Team", with the approval of the board of governors of the German Club, at a meeting in March. It is now a branch of the German Club, Chicago. It will be the endeavor of the club's administration to continue along its regular lines, even under the new name. It sees, as its foremost task, the educating of its members to become, mentally and bodily, healthy individuals by furthering and exercising lawn sports, especially soccer football, light gymnastics and swimming, also by fostering self discipline and comradeship. That in this endeavor it may count on active support on the part of the German Club becomes clear from the fact that the latter has nominated a committee, for the protection of these interests, composed of Judge Walter P. Steffen, Albert W. Weinberger and Reynold Oeschler. But to all German countrymen is issued the call: "Lend us your aid to give the <pb facs="5418474_8_1251.jpg" n="2"/>German popular sport in Chicago its due status."</p>
   <p>The headquarters of the German Club Soccer Football Team is at 201 west North Avenue. Meetings are held every Friday at 8:30 P.M. Friends and patrons are at all times cordially welcome.</p>
