   <p>Each day "Fagin" Storey is hounding his "artful dodger," Bill Sykes, and other vermin of that ilk to "pitch into" A. C. Hesing and the Illinois Staats-Zeitung. At the same time, in the editorial columns of his paper (otherwise devoted to the interests of prostitution, gambling, abortions, and wife murder by abortion), he endeavors to make his readers believe that he knows something about the ways of European civilization. Now, as to that, we wish to tell him that he cannot know anything about that subject. He is laboring under the erroneous impression that in Europe he and his boys would be treated according to the rules which prevail in general intercourse with men. And that is where he is badly mistaken. In any country but America he and his henchmen would be looked upon and treated as vermin. Nobody expects a man to compare weights before killing or scotching a rattlesnake or a bed-bug, or to refrain from killing or scotching a venomous reptile or insect <pb facs="5418474_8_0614.jpg" n="2"/>because it does not weigh as much as he.</p>
   <p>Now, therein lies the point. The rules of fairness governing a fight between two men do not apply in a fight between man and beast. The editor of the organ of sodomy, abortion, and prostitution, W. F. Storey, is not a man at all, but a wild beast let loose upon society for some inscrutable purpose of providence. No rules pertaining to the intercourse, friendly or unfriendly, between two men could apply to the intercourse with such a wild beast and its cubs. Has a man ever been called unfair for killing a skunk weighing only one tenth as much as he does? Not to our knowledge, neither in Europe--if they have skunks there--nor in this country.</p>
   <p>Hence, if "Old Fagin" speaks about "the way they do in Europe," he speaks of which he knows nothing. Creatures of his kind are unknown there outside of the state prisons and the insane asylums. A creature like W. F. Storey would never have a chance to see a part of any civilized country except America, and then only through the strong bars of a cage. He would never have a chance to publish a directory of all the brothels in a city, in order to anticipate <pb facs="5418474_8_0615.jpg" n="3"/>the publication of a city directory [Translator's note: Translated verbatim but lacks clarity.]; or to use one of the best physicians of a great city as a scapegoat for the murder of a married woman by abortion; or to proclaim a respectable and virtuous young woman a prostitute. He would not, because he would be branded an hanged or caged long before he had come to the end of his tether and dived to the lowest depths of iniquity. For "they manage these things better" in France, or in England, or in Germany, or in Russia, or even in Timbuctoo for that matter.</p>
   <p>Whatever vilification "Old Fagin" prints in the Times about Mr. A. C. Hesing or the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, we shall henceforth consider the harmless raving of a caged wild beast. For we do not care a snap about any two-legged being who is willing to regard "Old Fagin" as a man, or to look upon his "artful dodgers" as anything but filthy vermins.</p>
