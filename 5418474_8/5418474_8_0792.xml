   <p>Froebel's Kindergarten Society with their headquarters at the Lincoln Turner Hall, Lake View, makes the following appeal:</p>
   <p>The Froebel Kindergarten Society is in a position now to expand its activities. The training, which is a blessing to the home and the school, is carried on in accordance with the principles and methods of that incomparable teacher and friend of children.</p>
   <p>We have now enlarged our institution, and made room for twenty more children. We would like to extend this privilege to needy children, although the parents must be respectable and worthy. In order to make this possible, we appeal to the benevolence of the German people.</p>
   <p>Our active members, who pay $12 to $18 per year to have one or two of their children in our institution, are not able to furnish additional funds for the proposed needy children. We have therefore arranged to accept passive members. With this membership is connected an annual fee of $3.00, which can be paid in <pb facs="5418474_8_0793.jpg" n="2"/>four installments of 75 cents each. From these fees we hope to be able to cover the additional expenses.</p>
   <p>The training of the children, who are between three and seven years of age, is strictly conducted according to F. Froebel's method and ideas. The Kindergarten is a nursery of German, to guide new generations into those paths, which parents, and teachers think desirable for the cultivation of the mother-tongue and German customs and traits.</p>
   <p>We will report every six months about the success of our activity and the spending of funds at our disposal. This will be done at the semi-annual general meeting and through the German press. We will likewise arrange social gatherings, and the members will have an opportunity to investigate the results of our methods, and become acquainted with each other.</p>
   <p>Not only do we ask for regular and free-will contributions for this undertaking, but we also request addresses of children who wish to come to our kindergarten. We trust the Germans will recognize their responsibility in regard to this <pb facs="5418474_8_0794.jpg" n="3"/>humanitarian German institution.</p>
   <p>Chicago, June 15, 1892.</p>
   <p>Respectfully</p>
   <p>Directors of the Charity-Committee of the Froebel Kindergarten Society....</p>
