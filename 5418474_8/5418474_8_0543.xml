   <p>The German Press Club moved into its new home in the Schiller Theatre, Saturday evening. The call went out to the members, to appear in large numbers, to celebrate the day worthily. And most of them were present. About 200 assembled after 8 o'clock in the Concert Hall, which dressed in palms, served as Reception room. At 9 o'clock sharp, they sat down to a banquet, which was served in the large dining room. President Max Henius acting as toastmaster, welcomes the quests, with a few pleasant words, and presented the speakers to those present. Next speakers were Messrs. L. F. Thoma and Alfred Oehler of the New York Press Club, who spoke about the National Union, its aims and goal, then the first Vice President Mr. Theodor Jansen expressed his pleasure and satisfaction, about the development of the child, to which he was a Godfather less than 30 months ago, and closed with a cheer for the German Press Club.</p>
   <p>Amid shouts of approbation, Professor von Holst began a long speech, about the <pb facs="5418474_8_0544.jpg" n="2"/>the theme"America." He said, among others,"The most prominent characteristic of American life is the absolute Freedom of the Individual. That is the secret of the incomparable development of this our country. If a man arrives in this country, thousands of ways are open to him, to develop all the talents, which should slumber in him. But he must be energetic, he must swim or he will sink. He must go forward or backward. Naturally, if this principle of "Help yourself" had been the only principle, which put its stamp on America, its history would be an endless battle, a battle of all against all. But another principle prevailed, the principle of selfmade laws. When the Pilgrims came to this country, they left their homeland, because they desired to be free, free, not like animals of the forests, but free like civilized people. They knew, that liberty meant restraint, that nobody can be free, who does not shoulder responsibilities. And in this way the people of America learned, that "one for all and all for one" have to stand, like a herd, which defends itself against a pack of wolves. Head on head, they stand together, well knowing, that if one should fall it would mean the destruction of all. The true idea of liberty lies in the conviction of having done one's duty. The enthusiasm, which followed the speech of the famous Historian was such, that the strains of the music, playing America, could scarcely be heard.</p>
