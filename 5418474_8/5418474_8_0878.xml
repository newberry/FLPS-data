   <p>This week's chief topic of conversation in our neighborhood is the question of the reopening of the Sunday-school at the Vorwaerts Turnhalle. We cannot understand why the project is not acted upon-or at least only temporarily postponed--in view of the lively interest manifested. We admit that the Turnverein is not able, during the present hard times, to incur the sacrifices which the reopening of the school, would entail, but this active association [Turnverein] can devise means by which to attain its ends--as experience has shown--methods which were successful whenever the Turner were willing. The lack of interest shown by the citizens at last Sunday's meeting is no reason whatever for disconsolately dropping the project. This attitude is unworthy of so capable an association.</p>
   <p>We, the undersigned, therefore take the liberty of suggesting to the Turnverein Vorwaerts that it hold a fair for the benefit of the Sunday-school. Undoubtedly many ladies and liberal-minded citizens and businessmen of this part of the city will support the fair and work to further it.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0879.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Besides, the Turnverein has experienced members on the arrangement committee and commands talent for entertainment purposes. Hence, on with the work; the lofty purpose will give assurance of success.</p>
