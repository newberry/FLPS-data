   <p>Property owners of Goethe Street appealed to the City Bureau of Streets and Alleys yesterday to change the name of this street to Boxwood Place. They argue that most people could not pronounce the name Goethe and that, as a consequence of the incorrect pronunciation, many errors have occurred. Their spokesman and representative, Fred A. Cary, who appeared together with Alderman Earl J. Walker of the Twenty-First Ward, where Goethe Street is located, emphatically denied, in reply to a question of Alderman Henry Ficks, that the German nature of the name "Goethe" was the underlying factor which had caused the desire for a change. But this statement appeared in a rather peculiar light when, shortly afterward, this gentleman remarked that "Boxwood" was a good English name.</p>
   <p>The desire of the property owners to change the name of the street was apparently not regarded with favor by the members of the council committee. <pb facs="5418474_8_1598.jpg" n="2"/>Alderman Coughlin of the First Ward dampened the enthusiasm of the petitioners quite a bit when he proposed that, if a change of name had to be made, the street be called "Busse Place," after the former mayor.</p>
   <p>"Fred Busse," said the city father of the First Ward, "was born and reared in that neighborhood. He made a good name for himself as an excellent mayor. It is no more than fair that the city perpetuate his name, and here is a good chance to do so. The family of the deceased mayor would also be happy."</p>
   <p>"Besides," added the city father, "the system according to which streets were named made it necessary that the name to be chosen started with a 'B'."</p>
   <p>Cary did not want to hear anything of Alderman Coughlin's proposal. He said that the suggestion would not meet with the approval of the property owners, who had decided on the name "Boxwood Place". When asked by Alderman [John] Toman whether the property owners were willing to assume <pb facs="5418474_8_1599.jpg" n="3"/>the cost of the change of name, he said that he himself was willing, of course, but that he would have to talk it over with the other property owners.</p>
   <p>Alderman Walker came to Cary's assistance. When he realized that Alderman Coughlin's proposal to perpetuate the name of the former mayor in this way made an impression, he reminded the committee that a year ago he had proposed naming one of the new streets in the Streeterville district, east of Lake Shore Drive, "Busse Street". He tried very hard not to give the impression that the name "Goethe" was objectionable to him because it was German, and declared that no other German name was as suitable as that of Goethe, who had had nothing in common with German military ideas. On the other hand, the desire of the property owners should be respected.</p>
   <p>J.D. Riley, superintendent of the Bureau of Maps, informed the city father that the proposal to name a street in Streeterville, which ran at right angles to Madison Street, after the former mayor was not feasible since <pb facs="5418474_8_1600.jpg" n="4"/>it did not fit into the scheme of names, according to which all names of streets in that section had to begin with an "E".</p>
   <p>On the motion of Alderman Coughlin the whole problem was postponed to the next meeting of the committee to be held in January.</p>
