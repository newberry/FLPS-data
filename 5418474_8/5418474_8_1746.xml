   <p>An American woman residing in Germany since the death of her husband, invested her dowry in reliable German bonds, but they are worthless today. She begs for help, particularly clothing,as she has no money to buy any....Marie Knobloch, Ettingen Str. 29, Muenchen.</p>
   <p>The friends of Mrs. M. Knapp-Finkh, (a lone, blind, ninety year old lady, affluent at one time), cannot help herself any more, and therefore, asks that aid be given to her. Alters-Inselheim, Berg-Stuttgart.</p>
   <p>Miss Clara Stadelmann, teacher in Duesseldorf a. R H., [on the river Rhein] Rheinstr. 79, sends an urgent appeal for provisions to help the following institutions: (1) Evangelical Orphanage; Waiseneltern <pb facs="5418474_8_1747.jpg" n="2"/>Jarke, Duesseldorf A. RH. Pempelforterstr. 68. (2) Evangelical Hospital, Superintendent: Sister Ella Disselhorst....(3) Sanitarium Johannisberg....(4)Home for the Aged Friedheim, [Home of Peace].... (5) Home for the Aged Luisenstift, [Luise Foundation]........................</p>
   <p>An old gentlemen, formerly a physician, Doctor George Siebold, in Potsdam, asks some benevolently inclined person, perhaps a distant colleague, to send him a used warm winter suit; something that is still in fair condition. He hopes that his appeal finds response.</p>
   <p>Adele Voltmer, Dresden A., Albrechtstr. 43, a war widow with two children, has a monthly pension of twenty-two marks. Formerly sold electrical hearing aids to augment her income, but the increase in living costs <pb facs="5418474_8_1748.jpg" n="3"/>precludes the possibility of sales. She begs for consideration, some donation. She is in need of clothing also.</p>
   <p>The children at the Ambulatory for the Tubercular, in Berlin, N. W. 7, have received a donation through the intercession of the Red Cross. The Superintendent, Doctor Kaethe Schwarzer,.... sent us a grateful acknowledgement. "You can hardly conceive just how welcome your gifts have been and how you help in ameliorating suffering. Thousand thanks...."</p>
   <p>The directorate of the Kreisrealschule No. 3 asks for books with English text: Picturebooks, fairy-tales, history, also good English periodicals, and works on geography, are a welcome contribution for poor students whose parents cannot afford to buy them during the present era of high prices. Money donations would also help defray the tuition costs for many a poor child.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1749.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Welfare urgently asks for monetary contributions, and clothing for children of all ages. Also shipments of provisions prove particularly desirable, as many foodstuffs can be bought for less in America than in Germany. 128 North La Salle Street, Room 47, Telephone,Franklin 0339.</p>
