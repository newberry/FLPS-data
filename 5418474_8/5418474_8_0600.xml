   <p>Last Saturday saw the first issue of the new afternoon paper Der North-Westen supposedly the organ of the German Democrats. We partly reprint that newspaper's program: "Chicago is a big field for a sound Democratic newspaper, based on Democratic principles. So far the Democrats of the Northwestern metropolis did not have an organ of their own, although the majority of German voters of the city and State were for years connected with the Democratic party. The "North-Western" will defend Democratic principles as did Thomas Jefferson seven years ago...</p>
   <p>We wish to make this remark: When the majority of German voters of the city and State associated for years with the Democratic party did not have an organ of their own, is evidence enough that there was really no necessity for such an organ because the Illinois Staats Zeitung,met with the demands of the German people publishing an independent and politically non-partisan newspaper to the satisfaction of everybody...</p>
