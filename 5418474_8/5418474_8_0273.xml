   <p>The attendance at the Soldiers' Fair is increasing from day to day, and consequently the receipts for the benefit of the widows and orphans of soldiers who died in the defense of the Republic are also increasing. Thus it may be safely assumed that the Fair will be a success. As announced in yesterday's Illinois Staats-Zeitung, the Germania Maennerchor, whose excellent singing is recognized also by our native Americans attracted a large crowd to the rink last night. Every seat in the large hall was occupied when, at nine o'clock, the chorus opened its program with "Das Deutsche Lied," under the direction of Hans Balatka. Although the acoustics of the hall are poor, the performance was loudly applauded.</p>
   <p>The chorus also rendered the "Ave Maria," and the "Pilgrims Chorus" from "Tannhaeuser".</p>
   <p>We hope that the example set by the Germania Maennerchor will encourage other <pb facs="5418474_8_0274.jpg" n="2"/>choruses, such as the Concordia Maennerchor, the Freie Saengerbund, and others, to do their share toward attracting visitors to the Fair, and thus increase the receipts.</p>
   <p>It has been reported that the Chicago Turngemeinde (Turner's Association) will give a performance this evening, and we do not doubt it will add to the honor of the Society and to the success of the Fair.</p>
