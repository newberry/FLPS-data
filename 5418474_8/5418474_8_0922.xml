   <p>A thrilling appeal to German-Americans, to show their colors, and to remember those great men who have performed such wonderful things in the past for America, formed a considerable part of the lecture Professor Scherger held yesterday evening before a large crowd in the Germania Club.</p>
   <p>"Only last Sunday," he said,"nearly 10,000 Poles celebrated their heroes Kozciusko and Pulaski. Even Vice-President Dawes found it opportune, to be personally present at this celebration. But what are the German-Americans doing? They stand modestly aside, keep silent and look on.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0923.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We could almost believe, that they have forgotten that there were men among their ancestors, who did more and greater things for America, than those Poles. Is the time not ripe yet for German-Americans to rise to similar great and proud demonstrations?</p>
   <p>"The first newspaper appearing in the United States, was of German origin. Everywhere bearers of German culture, marched at the head, as shining examples and in the pioneer times of American history, there were powerful men, of German extraction. Although now, after many decades, an association has been formed, which with all its strength is trying to arouse the Germans, and has already achieved considerable success, through its work, a general consciousness of German nationality - of which we must be proud - is still lying in a deep, hypnotic sleep."</p>

   <p>The audience which was more than double the size of that at the speaker's first lecture, listened to his explanations with the greatest attention.</p>
   <p>Then the speaker came to his main theme. He described, with eloquent words, the uncommon iron energy of the great American general, born in Magdeburg in 1730, who a began a brilliant military career at the age of 27 years. The news of the American struggle for freedom, inspired him to such an extent, that he came to North America in the year 1777, where in 1778 he entered the service of the United States Army as a major general and general inspector. In spite of his great merits, and his ability, which even Washington acknowledged, von Steuben had to wait seven full years, after the end of the war, for Congress to grant him his rightful claim. A few clever anecdotes from the life of von Steuben, who never learned to speak the English language correctly, ran through the interesting lecture in a humorous vein.</p>
