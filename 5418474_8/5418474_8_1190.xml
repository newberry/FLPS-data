   <p>In July of this year, the Vienna Football Club looked back upon ten years of its existence. This gave occasion for a celebration last Saturday at the Lincoln Turnhalle.</p>
   <p>The program was launched by Angelo Lippich. His offerings were well received. The "five enemies of work" were heartily applauded for their numbers.</p>
   <p>The president of the Vienna Football Club, Hans Jansch, gave a brief recapitulation of the Club's history. The first football crew of the club occupies at present a leading role among the amateur players of Chicago. It may properly look forward to the championship. Years ago the Club occupied a like position, but a change in the direction of the professional league threw the club considerably to the rear; but now it has again worked itself to the top.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1191.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Hanns Kroiss, president of the Schutzbund (sic) of German sport organizations, tendered the Vienna Football Club the congratulations of this organization and of all German athletes of Chicago. He expressed the hope that the Club would be the first among the German organizations to win the championship of the International League.</p>
   <p>Various other features contributed to the entertainment of the guests; Mohr's orchestra played dance music. The German athletic organizations have all sent representatives.</p>
   <p>The attendance at the entertainment was, considering conditions, quite good, although one might have expected a full house at the anniversary of Chicago's oldest German football organization. What was lacking was the honoring of the founding members, of whom many were present at the festival.</p>
