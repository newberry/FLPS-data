<title level="a">FREDERICUS REX FILM IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Of all the great German moving pictures of the last few years, "Fredericus Rex" (Frederic the Great, popularily nicknamed "the old Fritz"), may claim to be the greatest box-office success in Germany. Admission tickets were sold weeks in advance, the film then ran for months and months with all seats sold.</p>
   <p>This German talking film, which has only recently been released in America, is now coming to Chicago to be shown in Orchestra Hall, 220 South Michigan Avenue, at a gala performance on April 26. In dazzlingly beautiful pictures and mass scenes, in which more than 3,000 actors participated, the struggle between father and son, King Frederic William I, hard as iron, and his genial successor, Frederic the Great is shown, a struggle which finally wound up with the reconciliation of father with son.</p>
   <p>Frederick the Great, the Old Fritz, is one of the greatest historical personages of the German people; he is the darling of them all, regardless of party <pb facs="5418474_8_0745.jpg" n="2"/>creed. To see him in the movies is the yearning of all Germans all over the world; it signifies love for the old homeland.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the urgent appeal gees out to all Germans of Chicago to show, by their appearance on Monday, April 26, at Orchestra Hall, a united German front; it is for the honor of the great German national hero, for the Old Fritz!</p>
   <p>Anticipating a large crowd, it is advisable to secure seats in advance. Admission tickets: 50c, 75c and $1 on the balcony, $1 and $1.50 in the orchestra. Tickets are available at Koelling's Bookstere, 206 West Randolph Street, at Schlesinger's Music Store, 535 West North Avenue, Anhalt's Bookstore, 1710 Belmont Avenue and, after April 15 at Orchestra Hall.</p>
