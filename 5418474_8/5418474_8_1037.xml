   <p>In the Fullerton Hall of the Art Institute the Germanistic Society of Chicago opened last night its second series of lectures. Dr. Alexander Franz of the Commercial School of Frankfort A. M. gave a lecture about Jena and Sedan. Speaker declared that those days which expressed the deepest disgrace and the highest glory for Prussia on the one side and for the Napoleonists on the side, had been caused by conditions, which in 1806 were in Prussia nearly the same as 1870 in France. The Prussian Army in 1806 rested on their laurels from the time of the great King. The knowledge of the art of war was missing. No reserve system for officers and men was kept, the officers were old and unfit for service. The recruiting system was still in force and 2/3 of the army were Poles, who did not understand German. Napoleon had the best men acquired by conscription. They were well paid. The chance to be advanced to a field marshal and the enthusiasm for the Emperor made every soldier do his best.</p>
   <p>In the year 1870 the picture reversed to the favor of Germany. Napoleon <pb facs="5418474_8_1038.jpg" n="2"/>had no equal army to the German conscription. The French Chassepot rifle however, was superior but the equipment of the Prussian troups was superior. The French were too sure of their victory and Napoleon confined himself to the defense. The French army of Mar Mahon at Sedan was encircled by the 3rd and 4th army, lead by the crown princes of Saxony and Prussia.</p>
