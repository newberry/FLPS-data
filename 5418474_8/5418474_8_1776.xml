   <p>The annual meeting of the Schwaben Society of Chicago, conducted by its president, Mr. Eugen Niederegger, was held at the North Side Turner Hall yesterday. The splendid work of the society during the last year was revealed by Mr. Julius Schmidt, secretary of the Association, when he read the report stating that the Association donated $8,555 for charitable and other worthy causes. The sum of $3,230 was granted by the General Assembly, October last, supplemented by later grants as follows: the sum of $100 toward the erection of a monument, in memory of the fallen warriors at Champigny, near Paris; $100 toward the funds for needy veterans of German wars, now residing in Chicago; $250 toward the celebration of the silver wedding anniversary of the King of Wuerttemberg; the German-American Teacher's Seminary in Milwaukee, received the sum of $115; and the Goethe Monument <pb facs="5418474_8_1777.jpg" n="2"/>fund of Chicago $5,000. In addition, smaller sums were also granted for the benefit of the sick, the unemployed, and various other humanitarian causes.</p>
   <p>The election of a new president will take place at the North Side Turner Hall Wednesday next.</p>
