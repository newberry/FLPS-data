   <p>The German Book and News Company has declared itself unable to meet its liabilities. Although this fact does not concern us any more than a cold which the man in the moon might have. it is indicated from certain quarters that we are interested in the failure. The facts in the case are briefly as follows: In the year 1878 the German Book and News Company understood the publication of the Deutsche Warte, and not thoroughly understanding the newspaper business, they lost up to December 1879, some $13,000. Although successful in securing a large circulation for the paper, they failed to bring the undertaking on a paying basis. This large loss caused the German Book and News Company to become far behind on their payments and as the Deutsche Warte was still losing money for them, they made an arrangement with the Volksfreund Publishing Company, where by the Deutsche Warte was published as the weekly edition of the Volksfreund. This arrangement, however, was canceled before assignment of the German Book and News Company was made. The main shareholders of the Company. The capital stock of which is $30,000 are: H. Enderis $10,000, A. Knobel $7,000 and Mr. Betz, brother-in-law of Mr. Knobel $5,000. Mr. Knobel having also induced number of friends to subscribe for the stock of the German Book and News Company has bought the Deutsche Warte; thereby securing its further publication, and will on his own accord indemnify his friends by according them full former financial interest in the papers.</p>
