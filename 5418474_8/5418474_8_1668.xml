  <body>
   <p>I read in the issue of June 20th of the Staats Zeitung, that the monument committee is undecided in regard to the location of the statue, whether it should be in Humboldt or Lincoln Park. I do not happen to be a low German, I am a Thuringian, yet, Fritz Reuter is my favorite poet, and you will therefore pardon me, if I write a few words in this matter.</p>
   <p>I am of the opinion, that we Germans should be proud of a real Plattdeutschen, (low German, northern German dialect) who has created such a splendid work for our city like the magnificent Humboldt Park. I refer to Mr. F. W. Karnatz, who has been the superintendent of that park for years, who has done so much for its beautification, and who convented a desolate, monotonous waste amidst unfavorable soil conditions, into an imposing park by sheer magic. Besides, one must consider, that Mr. Karnatz often had to contend with malicious American ignorance and considerable animosity whilst performing these labors. I would like to appeal to the Fritz Reuter Monument Committee, and especially to my friend, Mr. Trark, to place this memorial in a <pb facs="5418474_8_1669.jpg" n="2"/>park, which has been created by a compatriot of Fritz Reuter's, a garden which has been treated with such care, that it is comparable only to a father's love for his favorite. According to my view it would be also very proper, to place an inscription on the monument, which immortalizes the accomplishments of Mr. Karnatz.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>E. J. Koebler,</p>
