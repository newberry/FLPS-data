   <p>Yesterday, death closed the career of the well-known and highly esteemed Louis Morris, brother of Nelson Morris, the multi-millionaire. The deceased was born sixty-five years ago in Hechingen, Hohenzollern. He was a popular figure here, where his death is widely mourned, especially by members of Military Societies. Mr. Morris was well known for his kind heart and irreproachable character, and in contrast to his wealthy brother, his social intercourse was purely German.</p>
   <p>The departed was a member of the Rahma Lodge No. 80 of the B'nai B'rith Order. He was also a member of the German Army Veteran's Alliance, and of the German Veteran's Association of Town of Lake. Mr. Morris functioned for a number of years in the capacity of treasurer for the Central Alliance of German Military Societies of Chicago and suburbs, under whose auspices the funeral will be conducted.</p>
