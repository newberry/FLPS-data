   <p>The German Literary Society of Chicago held its organization meeting yesterday evening at the Bismarck Hotel. For this purpose a number of ladies and gentlemen were present. Mr. Oscar Illig, who sent out the invitations, welcomed those who appeared, and explained the purpose of the meeting.</p>
   <p>Dr. Kurt Baum came over from Milwaukee; he has for many years belonged to the leading personalities of the sister city's literary society. He reported about the activity of that organization, and explained in a clear, intelligible manner its principles, aim and working methods. He pointed out that the organization arranges about six lectures every year by prominent personalities, and in this manner is instrumental in showing to its members the progress of German spiritual life.</p>
   <p>The organization of a German literary society in Chicago seems very appropriate at the present time, because during the next year, on the <pb facs="5418474_8_0287.jpg" n="2"/>occasion of the 100th anniversary of Goethe's death, Goethe celebrations will take place all over the world. Dr. Baum stressed the fact that the organization must have at least one hundred members, if it wants to work with success. He gave many points worthy of consideration in regard to the development of the new organization, and suggested the advisability of arranging occasional lecture evenings, to which the public should be invited. He also mentioned that the professors of the German sections of the two great universities should be drawn into the organization, and should become members of the board of directors. After that Dr. Baum dispelled Mr. Emory Heidke's fears, that the literary society would become a competitor of the German Art Society. Consul General Michael Girten, who presided; Doctor Otto L. Schmidt; Professor Ziegelschmidt; Mrs. Emil Eitel, and a few other ladies and gentlemen gave a few friendly send-offs to the newly born child.</p>

   <p>Another meeting will be held on October 21, when an executive committee will be elected for the purpose of working out the statutes of the new organization.</p>
