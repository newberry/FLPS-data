   <p>Alderman Buhler presented the Mayor and City Council with the following letter:</p>
   <p>Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>On May 29, the citizens of Chicago are going to celebrate the restoration of peace in Europe. The undersigned committee has been instructed to invite you to participate in the celebrations. The restoration of peace between so highly civilized nations as Germany and France, after a horrible and bloody war the like of which neither ancient nor modern times have seen, must surely elicit the strongest expression of sympathy from any right thinking citizens. we therefore hope, honored gentlemen, that you will accept our invitation.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>George Echneider, Committee Chrmn.</p>
   <p>Franz Arnold,</p>
   <p>Charles Probating, Secretary,</p>
   <p>Henry Greenebaum, Feast Marshall</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0259.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After some opposition by Alderman Carney, the invitation was accepted by acclamation. The following motion, proposed by Buhler, was adopted:-</p>
   <p>"In as much as the citizens of Chicago have decided to celebrate the passing of war between France and Germany and the restoration of peace between the two countries.</p>
   <p>"Inasmuch as for this purpose a great celebration is planned to take place on May 29, 1871, and</p>
   <p>"Inasmuch as the world historic questions which were solved by the outcome of the war, especially however, the early conclusion of the war, deserve a public acknowledgement.</p>
   <p>"Be it therefore resolved that on May 29th, 1871 all city offices without exception be closed for the whole day."</p>
  </body>
