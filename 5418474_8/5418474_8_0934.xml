   <p>"I am a mother." These plain but <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> words, represent the whole defense, which Marie Antoinette made, when she was placed before the Paris blood thirsty criminal court on October 14, 1793, not only accused of treason and the inciting to civil war, but also of the lowest moral offenses, and the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> of her own <gap unit="words" extent="7" reason="illegible"/>.</p>
   <p>Two days later she was dragged to the scaffold amidst the curses of the rabble, and just when the clock of the near by <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> church struck twelve, her beautiful aristocratic head was severed by the cruel guillotine. Head and trunk were thrown into the same fire pit, which, <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> months before, had receive the corpse of her husband, Louis the sixteenth.</p>
   <p>Of the tragic end of the young queen, her origin and her marriage at the age of fifteen yearsf, about her sojourn in the French court, which was rich in intrigue, and the general conditions, which in those days finally led to <pb facs="5418474_8_0935.jpg" n="2"/>horror, revolution and blood, Professor Scherger spoke in his lecture in the Germania club.</p>
   <p>He depicted the marriage of the Austrian, who from the beginning was hated by the people, to a king, whose weakness and helplessness has no equal, and those greatest talent seemed to be, to "do the wrong thing at the wrong time." "What help was it to Louis the Sixteenth and his wife," said he, "that they were the most virtuous royal couple, who in that century stood at the head of France, that at heart they wanted to do a lot of good, although they were hindered by their surroundings and conditions in carrying it out?</p>
   <p>"When they ascended the throne, the measure of revolt and exasperation of the people was already full, and it only needed a trifle, a small incentive, to make it overflow. With their lives and blood did they have to expiate the sins which their predecessors on the throne, the whole court and the aristocracy of the country, committed against the people, against nature and against virtue.</p>
   <p>"And so it came to pass, that the youngest daughter of the great Maria Theresa, in the Paris market place was spit upon and reviled by screaming <pb facs="5418474_8_0936.jpg" n="3"/>fishwives, that she was publicly accused of the grossest monstrosities, that the head of her most intimate friend was thrown into the death cell of the concierge, that they killed her husband, snatched away her passionately beloved son, to hand him over to a <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> Jacobin shoemaker, who tortured the delicate child in the most incredible manner, undermined the boy mentally as well as physically.</p>
   <p>And finally that she was placed in a round dray, her white neck severed by the guillotine, while half <gap unit="words" extent="4" reason="illegible"/> the bloody executioners, and the market women sat around the guillotine, and knitted - knitted - knitted. Really Professor Scherger was not wrong when he added to his theme, "Marie Antoinette" the words: "the unhappiest queen in all history."</p>
