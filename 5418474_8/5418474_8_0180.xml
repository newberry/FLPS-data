   <p>Yesterday, at six o'clock in the morning, the musicians packed their instruments and the multitude, still numbering thousands, went home to rest. Aside from the exceedingly uncomfortable crowding, everything went off in a highly orderly fashion. The crowd, after all, consisted mostly of simple workers and their families, who endeavored to substantiate Goethe's proverb, "Dismal weeks, joyous festivals," and only an imaginative or malevolent person could see, in this crowd, the dregs of humanity or the criminal element. Lieutenant Baus, who was stationed at the festival with twenty select German policemen, vouchsafed that it was not only the largest, but the most orderly gathering (considering its size) which he ever supervised in his line of duty; in fact, the general conduct was better than at most picnics.</p>
   <p>Only one arrest was necessary; a drunkard gained admittance, and an officer piloted him from the hall, whereupon the inebriated man started a fuss.</p>
   <p>After midnight, when the ranks had thinned somewhat, diversion was found in <pb facs="5418474_8_0181.jpg" n="2"/>dancing and moderate drinking of beer; thus was presented a scene such as Goethe might have imagined in the market scene of "Faust."</p>
   <p>Yesterday noon there began a "celebration celebrating the celebration," which was not such a crowded affair as the main event, but nevertheless about eight thousand people were present; probably four fifths of those present were men. The people danced, drank, and enjoyed a very sociable picnic. The Instruction and Defence Club, as well as the Hunter Companies, were represented, and their simple but becoming uniforms brought color and variety to the scene. Various singing societies were also present and found the atmosphere just as satisfying as that of a picnic ground. All in all, the festival was a great, orderly, successful picnic, in a roof-covered enclosure to be sure, and nobody need feel ashamed of it, unless one sees a "bloody revolution" in every meeting frequented by workingmen and adherents of Socialistic doctrines.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, not all the participants were members of the Socialist party; quite the contrary, the majority's political views were of an undecided character.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0182.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Inquisitive politicians were also present; with the exception of these latter, no one attached any political importance to the occasion, regardless of the intentions the originators of the affair might have had.</p>
   <p>The festival ended at six o'clock in the evening; the still numerous crowd was homeward bound, and departed in as orderly a manner as that in which it arrived.</p>
   <p>The Socialist Labor party, in arranging this festival, as well as last summer's picnic, disappointed the "revolution snoopers," and made a good bit of money for propaganda purposes--which probably was the main idea.</p>
