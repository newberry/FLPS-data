   <p>The Turnverein (Gymnastic Club) Vorwaerts [of Chicago] gave a banquet yesterday evening in honor of its members, Messrs. John Gloy, Carl Zapp, Joseph Hochberger, Carl Heidweiler, A. Hoffeldt, John Ebert, and Emil Henry, the winners in the New York City [turners] meet. The council chamber was used for the occasion, since all the other clubrooms are being cleaned and redecorated.</p>
   <p>Festive wreaths, flags, horns [Translator's note: Usually horns of cattle, which in former centuries served as gunpowder containers; the horn became an emblem of victory], and other tokens of former conquests graced the walls .....The greatest attraction, women, was absent, but nevertheless the festival proved jovial, respectable, and delightful. Mr. Krambs, physical instructor, was the chairman and opened the festivities with a salamander. [Translator's note: A student ceremonial centering on beer.]</p>
   <p>Then followed the reading of Turner Dubsky's newspaper, Kneidzeitung, wherein <pb facs="5418474_8_1529.jpg" n="2"/>Turner Riecker's song appeared; it met with much acclaim when sung.</p>
   <p>We quote the lyric:</p>
   <p>Come, ye Turners, to the friendly sport,</p>
   <p>To the refreshing, strengthening meet.</p>
   <p>Only by serious endeavor can ye reach the goal,</p>
   <p>Dexterity and bodily strength!</p>
   <p>Serious effort will reward you,</p>
   <p>Giving vitality, courage, and energy.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: All together seven six-line stanzas are printed, depicting the club life of Turners, young and old.]</p>
   <p>A humorous letter by Louis Kindt and the short notes about the Alliance festival [Turners' Alliance] by Dubsky were also well applauded.</p>
   <p>Then followed speeches, songs....and Mr. Ruben's admonition to the club not to <pb facs="5418474_8_1530.jpg" n="3"/>rest on its laurels but rather to feel encouraged by the victory and to strive for new achievements, etc.....</p>
   <p>It was a delightful reception for the successful Turners of the New York meet, and it will help....create new enthusiasm for the Vorwaerts Turnverein.....</p>
