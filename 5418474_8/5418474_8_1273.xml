   <p>Turning [German form of gymnastics] is still being practiced here in Chicago, and Chicago still appreciates gymnastic prowess.</p>
   <p>Still? Why, more than ever it seems! That was the impression gained last night at the great jubilee celebration held in Dexter Pavilion by the Illinois Turner District.</p>
   <p>The old timers--and many of them had come--who a generation or so ago had steeled body and mind with various gymnastics, and who had kept up a lively interest for the art, considering themselves experts, probably came to the conclusion that at no time was there better turning than yesterday, and hardly ever that good. And their hearts must have beat faster as they glanced about the huge hall with its thousands of seats filled, as they watched the <pb facs="5418474_8_1274.jpg" n="2"/>exhibitions with tense interest, and then listened to the singers and beheld the happy crowd milling about the arena, shouting greetings to old friends and exchanging memories. And many a one may have had tears in his eyes, or felt a lump rising in his throat, trying hard to conceal his emotions from the crowd.</p>
   <p>Never before have we witnessed such a celebration, such an enthusiastic crowd as yesterday. An evening like that had not recurred in the history of the Illinois Turner District for ages.</p>
   <p>It was a beautiful German celebration, with a great idea behind it. A celebration of a splendid German institution; the golden jubilee of organized German efforts for physical and mental health, efficiency, orderliness, comradeship, and mutual assistance, here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This can be said without reservation: Yesterday's Turnfest of the Illinois Turner District, with its splendid exhibitions, in conjunction with the <pb facs="5418474_8_1275.jpg" n="3"/>participation of the German singers of Chicago, with its great German attendance, making it a wonderful success was a surprise for most of the people, including the Turners and the sponsors of the festival themselves. And thus it should be, because the heroic struggle of the German people against a world of enemies points unmistakably to the sources of German strength and the valiant spirit of the German people; German turning is the fountainhead of this strength. These grave times reminded Chicago Germans again of the extraordinary value of German turning which they had almost forgotten during the long years and decades of quiet and peace; how much the German people were indebted to it, how necessary its cultivation was here in America, for the benefit of the German idea, and for the benefit of the entire nation.</p>
   <p>And if that is so, we may well claim that, March 14, 1915, when the Illinois Turner District celebrated its golden jubilee, will become a milestone in the history of German turning, in the city as well as in the state. It will be the starting point for a new and invigorated forward movement of turning.</p>
