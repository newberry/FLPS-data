   <p>The Central Committee of the Chicago Schuetzenverein (Marksmen's Club) held its session yesterday at Klare's hall to make arrangements for the Bundesschuetzenfest (Alliance Marksmen's Festival). President Hartmann presided; sixteen members were present.</p>
   <p>The Committee on Entertainments recommended that only concerts be given on Wednesday, June 25, and that, on other days, concerts and dance music should be offered. For Sunday evening, a ball is to be arranged.....On the various days there will be the usual target shooting, and prizes will be given; regular foot races, and races where the runners' legs are tied in a bag, are also proposed. If possible, rope-walking will be included on the program. On Sunday evening, at twilight, the "Battle of Sedan" is to be performed under the command of "General" R. Hendricks. (The two last items were stricken but otherwise the report was accepted.)</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0175.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It was decided to arrange the route of the parade as follows:</p>
   <p>From the headquarters south to Michigan, thence to Dearborn, north on Dearborn to Ohio, and from there to Clark, and thence to Chicago.</p>
   <p>West on Chicago to Wells, south on Wells to Illinois, on Illinois to Clark, next to Lake and from there to Wabash, south on Wabash to Jackson, then to Clark, where the mayor will give a welcoming address. From there north to Washington, thence to Fifth, and to Randolph. On Randolph to Halsted, and return to Desplaines, Lake, Clinton, and on the latter to the depot.</p>
   <p>"Field Marshall" W. Seipp announced that C. G. Trieglaff will be his Adjutant General, and that the following gentlemen have been chosen as adjutants:</p>

   <p>[Translator's note: 115 names are listed]</p>
   <p>The following "subscription circular" was read and accepted:</p>
   <p>"To our Fellow Citizens:</p>
   <p>"We feel confident that we will be enabled to provide generous prizes for the winners during the marksmen's tournament to be held in Chicago from June 25-29, 1879, which event will induce many persons to come to this city. Therefore, we appeal to the recipients of this circular to provide a donation.</p>
   <p>"Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>"The Central Committee,</p>
   <p>"F. Hartmann, president,</p>
   <p>"C. Schotte, secretary."</p>
   <p>The Reception Committee announced that hotel rates for out-of-town guests will <pb facs="5418474_8_0177.jpg" n="4"/>be greatly reduced. At the Park (Schuetzenpark clubhouse) rooms and board can be had for $1.75; board and cots in the hall will be available for $1.50 per day during the festival.</p>
   <p>The Committee requests that all out-of-town clubs should communicate with the Chicago Schuetzenverein, so that all arrivals may be given a proper reception. Time of arrival, and the number of persons, and other details should be given. Please send information to Otto Mutschlechner, 118 Fifth Avenue.</p>
   <p>The ribbons and rosettes which the Committee on Insignias suggested for officials, honorary guests, reporters, and others, were considered suitable.</p>
   <p>The Committee on Decorations estimated its expenses at $65, and will give an itemized list at the next session....</p>
   <p>The Committee decided that the Chicago marksmen should all wear similar hats.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0178.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Upon Mr. Boese's motion a music committee was nominated; Messrs. Boese, Karsten, and Grimm are the members.</p>
   <p>Aside from the fourteen targets, which have been provided, an additional eight targets and stands will be erected. About three hundred marksmen will compete for prizes.</p>
   <p>The Committee than adjourned until Thursday, June 5, 8 P. M., same place.</p>
