   <p>We agree with other newspapers that an athletic club exists for athletic purposes. But it is just as bad to play politics or use the club for political purposes, as it is to permit propaganda of socialism. The clubs may have lectures about subjects of general interest or they may exercise their mental faculties on all sciences and in their midst every decently Athletic League expressed view-point should have free play, but proselytism does not belong there. The majority of the club-members are young men and they are not able to improve the American constitution or reform the world. The Athletic League has won great merit, in this country and in particular by the "German-American," and their ruin would appear as a calamity. If Socialistic elements disturb the peace too much then they ought to be excluded.</p>
   <p>However, they should not be too sensitive. Because socialistic phrases are no cannonballs.</p>
