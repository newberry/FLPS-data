   <p>The Speaker is a member of Loyola University, a far traveled observer of the conditions of the workers of almost the whole world. The speaker's quotations of statistical statements of unemployment and pitiable wage conditions, which are the results of economic, moral and ethical disadvantages, claimed extraordinary attention.</p>
   <p>He condemned the donations of our millionaires, Carnegie and Rockefeller, which are the overwhelming proofs of the enrichment of these people to the detriment of the industrial workers.</p>
   <p>The attack upon the price of petroleum and the starvation wages in Gary, Indiana was greatly applauded. He compared this situation with the conditions of the workers in Germany which he was in spite of the war and even of Roosevelt's <pb facs="5418474_8_0971.jpg" n="2"/>antagonistic feelings towards Germany, forced to praise enthusiastically.</p>
   <p>The conditions prevailing here are the source of socialist propaganda, therefore, the speaker explained, it was the duty of all citizens to give their attention and support to a law, by which the minimum wages would be established.</p>
   <p>Over fifty five per cent of the workers of this country earn less than $600 a year, a condition which must injure the strength of its people.</p>
   <p>Formerly, the worker had his own tools and could work wherever he chose. Today he is chained to the factory by its machines.</p>
   <p>While in Germany thirty three per cent of the workers work by hand, only three per cent work by hand in America.</p>
   <p>Upon the solution of this question depends the future of this country and the peace of its citizens.</p>
