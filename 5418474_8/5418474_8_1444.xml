   <p>Notwithstanding the heavy rain, the procession and picnic of the "Lehr and Wehrverein" "The Hunter's Society" and other organizations, has taken place yesterday to celebrate the victory over the usurpation of the militia law. To celebrate this triumph, men with weapons and men without them, marched through the streets in spite of the rain, but the sun's rays came finally through and shone down upon the multitude, engaged in different entertainments.--</p>
   <p>At 10 o'clock the procession led by Commander Presser was on its way. At the head of the procession was the "Lehr and Wehrverein's Band", followed by the "Irish Labor Guard" under the leadership of Captain Boland, next came the two companies of the "Bohemian Sharp-Shooters, led by Prokpp Hudek. The shooters in their becoming uniforms showed smartness and military carriage. Following this group came the "Hunters-Society" (150 men) with Colonel Wendt leading. They carried the weapons, after hunters' fashion, the muzzle downward. <pb facs="5418474_8_1445.jpg" n="2"/>In conclusion of the military procession, came the "Lehr and Wehrverein" (about 500 men) with Commander Presser on horse-back and three officers on foot. Then came the "Shoe-makers Society", the Joiner's of North Chicago," the "French Section" and the "Bricklayers Union."</p>
