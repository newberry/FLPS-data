   <p>Through the munificence of F. I. Derves, a wealthy German brewer of the West Side, Humboldt Park will soon be beautified by a statue of Friedrich Weinrich Alexander Von Hamboldt, after whom the park was named.</p>
   <p>The statue arrived hero last Saturday, and as a work of art, is said to befit the fame of the great naturalist, scientist and traveler. It is of bronze and copied after a noted work of art in one of the public squares of Berlin. The statue is of life size and represents the famous naturalist in an erect and thoughtful attitude, his left hand resting on a globe and his right hand holding a tiny flower. The dress is that of the last century; long coat, Knee breeches, and buckle shoes. While the features are rough, they represent great strength and intellectual power and acumen.</p>
   <p>Next month, after the return from Europe of Mr. Derves, the statue will be unveiled, the German societies of this city assisting in and giving significance to the occasion. The statue costs 12,000 marks, or about $3,000, and will be an artistic study in the park</p>
   <p>The program for the unveiling and dedication of the statue has been arranged and will include, besides the presentation speeches, music and choral singing.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1662.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These exercises will take place Oct. 16th. Near the statue is another but much smaller work of art. It is a bronze statuette and dedicated to the German Mannerchor, but none of the members of that club knows anything about it. The supposition is that it is a gift from some friend of the society.</p>
