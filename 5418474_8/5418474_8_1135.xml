   <p>Yesterday, at "Bohemian Hall", an agitation meeting was held. About twenty-five persons were present. Comrade Nothdurff was elected as President. Comrade Aug. Spies reported, in a long discussion, the development of human society. He indicated as our history shows, that all Nation's efforts were due to the fundamental motive of association, and through this, that our development resulted.</p>
   <p>We always were under the impression that freedom in politics, in the sense in which it is used in this country, was to end all slavery. But experience has taught us how deceptive this belier has proved. Corruption can never be wiped out through reform, of anti-monopoly parties, however much one may try. All attempts in this direction are bound to fail because corruption is the inevitable consequence of our economic system.</p>
