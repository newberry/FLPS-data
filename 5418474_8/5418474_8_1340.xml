   <p>In several special trains arrived this morning 10 o'clock at the depot of the N. W. Railway close to 3000 Turners to Chicago. In spite of the great exertions which the League-Tournament afforded, the disciples of "Jahn" made a good impression. Nowhere could be noticed the slightest sign of fatigue. Under the leadership of District Turnwart (Instructor) of the Chicago District, Mr.John Koelling,. The parade soon formed at Market Street, between Randolph and Washington Streets, and the marching line went in excellently disciplined order through Madison, Franklin, Adams, State, Lake Streets, Wabash Avenue and Van Buren Streets to the depot of the Illinois Central R.R. line, from where all departed to the Worlds' Fair grounds. The parade was a beautiful sight, and was greeted by the public repeatedly with noisy applause.</p>
   <p>Shortly before 3 o'clock the entire crowd went in an orderly way to the fair grounds, where the gymnastic exercises soon commenced in the large arena which was especially erected for this purpose at the pavillion of the cattle exhibition. The following is the program.</p>
   <p>1.) Gymnastic Exercises.</p>
   <p>2.) Fencing with foils.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1341.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>3.) Swinging of clubs by Turners over 40 years.</p>
   <p>4.) Class gymnastics of 24 turner clubs who won prizes at the Milwaukee festival.</p>
   <p>5.) Monster stick exercises by all 3000 Turners who trained for this during the last six months.</p>
   <p>Tonight there will be elaborate fireworks, in honor of the turners and the traveling salesmen meeting here which will surpass anything ever shown.</p>
