   <p>The gymnastic lessons in the public schools, the introduction of which is mainly due to the German element, seems to share the fate of the German lessons, which are subjected to so many obstructions that they are getting less and less. On the recommendations of the Committee for Grounds and Buildings, the School Board resolved at its meeting yesterday, to add five new schools, or annexes, to existing schools, for which contracts already have been let and planned to either omit the gymnasium entirely, or to use a class room of about 13 feet height.</p>
   <p>School Commissioner Greifenhagen, who also promoted the interests of the German lessons, protested in vain, stating that the question about the gymnastic lessons should be solved by the Committee of Education. <pb facs="5418474_8_1283.jpg" n="2"/>Commissioner Downey achieved his object, though Commissioner Greifenhagen has the right to bring in the subject at the next meeting. The reason for the restriction of gymnastic facilities is a want of means. In the opinion of Commissioner Downey the money could be used for a better purpose.</p>
