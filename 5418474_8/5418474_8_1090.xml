   <p>The German Ambassador in Washington, Baron von Holleben made a short speech, after which the principal festival speaker, Mr. Carl Schurz was introduced. Mr. Schurz is well known as an excellent orator, but to our regret, his voice was not very clear, consequently a large part of the audience was unable to understand him. He spoke in an accomplished way about German's progress in every sphere, seasoned his speech with cleverly applied humor and achieved great applause. He spoke in extract as follows: "This is the German day of honor in the peaceful competition of the nations on the hospitable soil of the American Republic. From far and near have we come, to pay our homage to the genius of the German nation. When I received the great honor of a call, to give expression in the name of my countrymen of this homage, I found many obstacles in my way. But the German blood in my veins, has not prevented me and here I am to unite my voice with yours in the joyful salute to the old Fatherland. Now little our clan over there know us, if they think that the heart of the German born Americans grew cold in selfish chase after the almighty dollar and does not feel with the old country any more. Today they may hear the language of the heart." After the speaker pointed to the fact that the German-Americans, in spite of <pb facs="5418474_8_1091.jpg" n="2"/>their attachment to the land of their origin, are doing their full duty towards their new fatherland, he continued as follows: "We look back upon those dark days of the Civil War, when the union seemed to stagger on the verge of ruin, when our armies ware suffering defeat, after defeat, when not only our enemies and the envious, but also our weak hearted friends in the old world prophesied with certainty the division of the great republic, when the credit of our Republic was at its lowest ebb, when the hope of even the most courageous was shaken. With joyous satisfaction do we remember that of all nations of the globe, the Germans alone did not lose their confidence in the final victory of our just cause and the future of America, that it cheerfully loaned its savings by the millions to our hard hit Republic enabling it to start the fight with new strength. This was the real friend in need, who helped the friend in his trouble, and was gratefully rewarded for doing it. To uphold this friendship between the nations of the old and new world, is the sincere wish of the German-Americans and which he no doubt also discovers in the heart of every noble minded native of this country. He who does not honor his old mother, can never be true to the young bride, he who does not respect his old father-land, is not worthy to be a son of a new one. These words caused a great applause among his listeners, which subsided only when Mr. Schurz, after a <pb facs="5418474_8_1092.jpg" n="3"/>short pause took up the thread of his speech, and with eloquent words described the beauties of the dear old country, on the other side of the ocean, every foot of which is precious to us, the dark woods of the black forest, the Bavarian Alps, the Dunes of the North Sea, the thousand year old oaks in red earth, the beech trees on the Baltic Ocean and then turned to the time of the great war against the arch enemy and said the following: "That was a glorious time. Wherever there was a German heart, it beat with admiration and gratefulness towards the race in the old country, and wherever the German tongue was heard there rose in joyous chorus the great word. The German has again a fatherland." Every German breast rose with self respect, and every drop of German blood was heated at the sight of the new sun of German honor and great ness. Many years have passed Since and we see now the Germania in the laurel wreath, this time not the bloody laurel, won on distant battlefields, but here, on our grounds, under our own eyes, the Germania decorated which the citizens crown, which they conquered in peaceful competition of inventions, the art, the productive labor, the fruitful struggle of civilization. Here she stands, not mixed with the large crowd, taking no back seat from anyone but far ahead of most; she heard it and read it. What Germany is able to produce, in peace time, that can be seen now. The speaker referred now to the present exposition, its wonderful success, which the fainthearted, after the experiences with the <pb facs="5418474_8_1093.jpg" n="4"/>Philadelphia Exposition, never ventured to hope.</p>
