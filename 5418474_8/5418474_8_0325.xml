   <p>So one would like to cry out with Uhland regarding the German-American poetry by seeing the beautiful and so far unique book of Dr. G. A. Zimmermann, that has been published in its second edition, enriched and considerably improved. Every educated German-American, and every Chicago German, particularly, has cause to welcome this work with gladness and pride, and to further its success to his best ability.</p>
   <p>It was a real hazardous enterprise of the "Germania Maennerchor" and the publishers Eyller &amp; Co. here, to bring such a book on the market. America is so often called the land of the restless and inconsiderate dollar-hunt; that is, of the most prosaic struggling that this civilization seems to be the most unfavorable for the blooming of true poetry, especially by the element that immigrated <pb facs="5418474_8_0326.jpg" n="2"/>during the last decades, torn away from the mother-soil.</p>
   <p>Not even the old German fatherland itself is the present time a flourishing period for poetry.</p>
   <p>Many times a reader finds in the daily press verses of German-American origin; but the gold nuggets are hidden under such a big pile of straw that it takes an extraordinary comprehensive survey to recognize the real German-American poetry as a whole and to value it fully.</p>
   <p>The book represents the first expert attempt of sifting and collecting, and thousands may receive through it a true conception of the development of German-American poetry (to their own astonishment). The book is a German-American book of honor in the truest sense of the word.</p>
