   <p>Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld, well-known psychologist, gave a lecture on sex entitled "Wrong Ways and Sufferings of Love."</p>
   <p>The lecture, in German, arranged by the friends of nature and expected by the people with great tension, took place yesterday evening in the Social Turner Hall before a crowded house. This was proof of the great interest there is in the colony for a topic of this nature.</p>
   <p>Privy Counselor Hirschfeld chose as his subject sexual degeneration; the practice of which in the social sphere comes into collision with the laws of a nation, even though degenerates should not be held responsible for their abnormalities. He pointed out the danger of sadists to society, as from their ranks the sexual murderers originate.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0917.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These people should no doubt be treated by specialists. Experience has shown that degenerate criminals reform after castration and never again return to their old habits. It is not only to sexually abnormal people that castration brings a cure. Modern medical science records other results obtained through this process.</p>
   <p>The lecturer, an expert in medico-legal procedure, dwelt in an understanding manner upon all sexual intermediate cases such as Homosexualism, Hypererotism, Fetishism and Metatropism. His lecture was illustrated with slides. Most of these abnormal sexual types come more or less often in conflict with the penal code, and in this respect we are still in the Middle Ages, even if today, compared with the times of three or four decades ago, an essential change is noticeable.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0918.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>When Counselor Hirschfeld concluded his lecture with the words of Goethe, "all earthly crimes are expiated by humanity," he was acclaimed by the audience.</p>
