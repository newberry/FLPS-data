   <p>A group of prominent German-American citizens held a conference at the Germania Club rooms yesterday, at which a decision was made which is important to every German, living in the State of Illinois. The incorporation of the German-American Historical Society of Illinois has been decided upon. The object of this is to search for material which will unveil the story of the part played by German-Americans in the development of the American nation. But the main purpose is, to collect statistical as well as other data for this contemplated book which is to disclose the history of the German-Americans and their influence upon every phase of public life, in the history of the state of Illinois. The meeting was called by Messrs. Wilhelm Vocke, Judge Max Eberhardt and Dr. G. A. Zimmermann. After Mr. Vocke the provisory chairman explained as to the aim of the meeting, a lively discussion developed, into which all those present joined.</p>
   <p>The incorporation of the new organization and the name were decided upon. A committee was then appointed, composed of Mr. Wilhelm Vocke, Judge Eberhardt, Dr. P. H. Matthei, Dr. Zimmermann and Dr. O. L. Schmidt, whose duty it was to draw up the articles of incorporation, and to outline rules and regulations.</p>
