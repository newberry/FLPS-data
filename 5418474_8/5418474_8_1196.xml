   <p>For many years repeated attempts had been made by the German athletic movement of Chicago to provide German boxers with a suitable place to train. Although these attempts were made by qualified persons, and although they found many who were interested, the enterprises were either shelved or provided facilities for only a limited number of persons. To have regular classes and training periods the boxing sport requires, above all, a well-furnished training hall or gymnasium and much equipment which is quite expensive. Large sums are necessary to create a boxing organization. It was this financial problem which until recently had hindered all similar enterprises.</p>
   <p>There is obviously an enormous interest in boxing within the German or German-American sport movement of Chicago. This is best proved by the many inquiries <pb facs="5418474_8_1197.jpg" n="2"/>made by friends of the sport, and also by the great interest shown the German amateurs in their interstate match in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The news that at last German boxing in Chicago has found a proper training place will certainly be greeted with joy by all pugilistic fans. So many have responded to a few advertisements which recently appeared in Abendpost and Sonntagpost that the founding of the Deutsche Box Club (German-American Boxing Club) has been made possible.</p>
   <p>It is especially fortunate that from the start the club will have at its disposal a gymnasium of its own which contains all the paraphernalia expected in a training hall of this kind. The credit for this gymnasium, and for giving the German boxing movement an even chance belongs to one man, Mr. Bernhard Hessling, a well-known German boxer, who, as an amateur and a professional, has enjoyed a splendid career.</p>
   <p>His great achievements as a boxer, and the experiences the gained through the sport, qualify Bernhard Hessling--or "Bernie"--to act as leader and guide of <pb facs="5418474_8_1198.jpg" n="3"/>the Deutsche Box Club. In our day and age we rarely find a man who is as devoted to an ideal--in this case the fostering of boxing among Chicago's Germans and German-Americans--as Hessling. Up to the present time he has been bearing all the expenses of the enterprise, but the beginning he has made is nevertheless exemplary.</p>
   <p>His experiences as a boxer of many years' standing have served him in good stead. The recollection of gymnasiums in the many cities he visited throughout his career helped him when he was selecting equipment for the German Boxing Club.</p>
   <p>The German gymnasium is on the North Side, on the second floor of 953 Belmont Avenue, in the heart of the Chicago German settlement. It is the building on the southeast corner of Belmont and Sheffield Avenues, quite close to the German Victoria Theater. The gymnasium is open daily from 11 A. M. to 10 P. M. The equipment may be described as excellent. Beside a modern boxing ring of <pb facs="5418474_8_1199.jpg" n="4"/>regular dimensions, there are all kinds of apparatuses for training and use: sandbags, punching bags, footballs, tugging machines, rowing devices, training bicycles, and all the other necessary equipment. To sum it up, the equipment is superior. The men in training also have access to baths and dressing rooms.</p>
   <p>In the few days since its opening, training has taken an enormous upswing. Under the constant supervision of their leader, Hessling, German amateurs are training diligently. Our hope is at last to become a reality. For once, German sport will be honorably represented in the great tournaments and bouts. The training of boxers by a capable instructor gives rise to great expectations.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that Bernhard Hessling's work will find recognition, and that out of the new foundation a strong movement will develop. To an extent this is already true, for other German amateurs have decided to resume their training in the German Boxing Club. A large group of German-American boxers, headed by the well-known trainer, Karl Steinmetz, have already moved into the German <pb facs="5418474_8_1200.jpg" n="5"/>gymnasium. Now there are two teachers available to the students.</p>
   <p>We recommend that all German friends of the sport pay a visit to the German Boxing Club. The costs of training are low for amateurs, and many will find it easy to exercise there. As has been stated, the gymnasium is open on week-days from 11 A. M. until 10 P. M. and on Sundays from 11 A. M. until 3 P. M.</p>
   <p>Beginning next week there will be several exhibition bouts in the gymnasium every Wednesday.</p>
