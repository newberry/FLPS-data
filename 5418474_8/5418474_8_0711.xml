   <p>Various German authors of editorials, lectures, novels, poems, etc are complaining bitterly again, that their work is reprinted here in the United States without any permit and in spite of their German copyrights.</p>
   <p>This situation is to be regretted from the legal standpoint, but cannot be remedied at present, as German literature, originally written in Germany, is protected in America only, if printed and subsequently registered for copyright in this country.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, most of those German authors and scientists would be completely unknown in this country without the unauthorized reprint of their work. The latter has proved to be a probably unintentional propaganda, which later has been used with skill and advantage by German publishers in Germany for the benefit of the wronged authors.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0712.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Finally, it is up to the German Government to check up on all clauses of their agreement with the United States concerning copyrights and eventually change all points, which are harmful to the German authors.</p>
