   <p>The first double game announced by the German Chess Club was given on November 15, in due conformity with the program.</p>
   <p>At this meeting in the new club room of the Lincoln Turner Hall, twenty-nine persons were present. Charles Elison, president of the club and its greatest exponent among the members, played eleven games simultaneously, winning in every instance.</p>
   <p>The second double game was given on November 21, at the Club's headquarters, 4522 North Ashland Avenue. Due to the bad weather, only fifteen persons came to this game, including three women. Mr. Csemiczky, who replaced Mr. Elison because the latter was indisposed, played eight parties, winning four games, losing two, and making two ties. As a result of the performance, seven guests joined the Club, including one woman.</p>
