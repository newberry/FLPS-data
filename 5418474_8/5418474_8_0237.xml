   <p>Haase's Park, situated so close to the city that it is almost part of it, but on the other hand contrasting to it so pleasantly by its country air and its landscaping-Haase's Park has yesterday for the last time been used for a festivity.</p>
   <p>The occasion was the merger of the Germania and the Concordia Singing Societies who belong to the biggest associations in the West, if not in all of the United States.</p>
   <p>The high point of the program was the "Hymn to Music". The effect was overwhelming; the public was carried away and applauded tempestuously...Mr. Floto, the President of the Male Choir then made a speech, quoting the old verse:</p>
   <p>"Where you hear a song, you may rest your wing,</p>
   <p>Evil people have no songs to sing!"</p>
   <p>(Wo man singt, da lass dichrnhig nieder</p>
   <p>Bose Menschen habenkeine Lieder!)</p>
   <p>and continuing: "Ladies and Gentlemen! Should our American fellow citizens be able to subscribe to these words? I beliebe not.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0238.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>I rather fear they will regard it as an act of impiety that we spend our fine Sunday in the open air, singing and laughing and enjoying ourselves instead of going to church. Blinded by habit and custom they cannot comprehend that we, too, are endeavoring to safe guard public morality, without however submitting to church hypocrisy."</p>
   <p>Finally the Male Choir sang a composition by its director, Mr. Schmelz, called the "Rhein Wine Song." It is a composition of the well-known dithyrambic by Herwegh.</p>
