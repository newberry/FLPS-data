<title level="a">THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE "GERMAN AMERICAN HISTORICAL SOCIETY". A CULTURAL BATTLE.</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Many members appeared, to listen to the annual reports, also to discuss the welfare of the society and elect new members for the coming year.</p>
   <p>The President of the Society, Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, referred first to the changed distribution of the Year Book, which was taken over by the Chicago University Press, while formerly the books were delivered directly by the Society. The Chicago University Press also took over the small remnants of former publications, and only a few of the old annual sets are left.</p>
   <p>The Year Book of 1914, which was published last year, found as much approval as the previously published Year Books of the Society. It appears as if a steadily increasing demand for the Year Books develops, especially in university and scholarly circles in spite of the present state of mind of the prejudiced and hostilely influenced circles against everything that is German or that reflects upon German culture.</p>
   <p>In spite of the progressive cultural work of the Society the membership <pb facs="5418474_8_0376.jpg" n="2"/>cannot show such favorable signs, as according to the secretary's report the society consists of only 190 members and to put the Society on a paying basis the membership should increase to 500, at least.</p>
   <p>The Society, in its endeavor to produce the best in the field of German-American research, is in fact the only active German American historical Society in the United States. It is not surpassed by any similar Society.</p>
   <p>Prof. Julius Goebel of the Illinois State University, is the Editor of the Year Book. The excellent, scientifically treated original articles, which are published in the Year Book, present a valuable source of information for the historians. Nevertheless a movement is on foot to publish general articles on German - American pioneers in America, which are known to the history writers.</p>
   <p>Also they will give the immigrants self-confidence and will strengthen them in the battle against falsified history.</p>
