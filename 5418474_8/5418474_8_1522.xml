   <p>The final arrangements for the bazaar of the Vorwaerts Turnverein were completed yesterday. While the bazaar still presented an unfinished appearance on the first day, the hall was surprisingly impressive on the second evening. Everywhere additional decorations and new stands were added with diverse displays to attract purchasers. Every taste was catered to. Of course, as far as the gentlemen were concerned, the greatest attraction was the wine bar and cigar stand which were erected near the entrance at the south side of the hall.</p>
   <p>Assorted wines and different brands of cigars, combined with courteous service, proved a great attraction to the male contingent.</p>
   <p>The youngsters were mostly to be found in the vicinity of the toy stands, which displayed a great variety of dolls and other articles. The other tempting assortments also found many admirers and buyers.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1523.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The messengers whom the post office sent out swarmed untiringly through the hall; the wheel of fortune was in constant operation; and the ladies who sold chances for various articles were so pleasant in their manner that one soon bought something--just to make sure that their pleasantness would not disappear.</p>
   <p>Very zealous and relentless was the ladies' police in the fulfillment of its duty--and who would not consent gladly to follow such pleasing officers of the law, and to appear before the stern judges of the tribunal, where heavy penalties were exacted forthwith?</p>
   <p>Not far from the entrance was a billiard table where the younger gentlemen amused themselves....Nearby, at the fish pond, good-looking lady wardens often induced passers-by to try their luck at fishing.</p>

   <p>At the southwest end of the hall was the voting place where a lively contest was in progress, involving three presents. For each present two candidates apply and whoever receives the most votes wins. The first is a liquor service set of French gold, valued at $250. Messrs. H.H. Greenebaum and B. Loewenthal are the candidates. The second present is a beautiful wine service set of Bohemian crystal, valued at $100. Messrs. [Peter] Schoenhofen and M. Gottfried are the candidates. Putnam's Clothing Store and the New Central Clothing Store are the contestants for the third prize, an elegant bronze clock worth $100.</p>
   <p>Among other objects we must mention parlor fittings, sleeping room cabinets, a piano, a pair of silver vases, parallel bars, and other items.</p>
   <p>The main attraction of yesterday's program was a gymnastic exhibition, and the Vorwaerts Turner, as usual, gave an outstanding performance.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1525.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This evening's program:</p>
   <p>1) Overture; 2) Great gymnastic exhibition by the Bohemian turners; 3) Pantomine; 4) Gymnastics, parellel bars; 5) Concert; 6) Gymnastics, trapeze; 7) Concert; 8) Gymnastics, horizontal bars; 9) Concert; 10) Gymnastics without apparatus.</p>
