A lively debate was provoked about the question of arming, which resulted in establishment of an armed section.</p>

The election of officers resulted as follows: Recording Secretary: P. Bulian; Financial Secretary; Fehler; Delegate to the General Committee: R. Hirsch; Comptrollers: A. Fischer; O. Reh and H. Brettschneider. Comrade Fehling held his announced lecture in a satisfactory manner. He described how, through development of technic, the small capitalism received its death <pb facs="5418474_8_1118.jpg" n="2"/>blow, on the other hand that monopolism made great strides towards perfection. Further more, he proved how speculations and creation of false values by capitalists, made worthless, the working faculty of the wage slaves.</p>
