   <p>The Southwestside Club No. 3 held its well attended Agitation Meeting on the 25th inst. in Heine's Hall, (formerly Sachse's Hall)cor. 19th St. and Hoyne Ave., at which Comrade Kiesling presided. As there was no reporter present, Comrade Scholz was requested to speak about any subject he choose, respectively to start a discussion on same. The reviewer selected:</p>
   <p>1. "Is it possible that we could exist without laws?"</p>
   <p>2. "Is it possible that we could carry through an absolute freedom?" At the end of his lecture, the reviewer was accorded an acclamation by his audience. Comrade Kiesling complemented his lecture. Furthermore the meeting elected comrades Legh and Scholtz as a committee, which should get in contact with the arrangement committee of the next picnic. An invitation of the furniture joiners union to their picnic was accepted and participation promised. After finishing current business matters, and admitting new members, the meetings was adjourned.</p>
