   <p>down magnificent bouquets and wreaths. One of the wreaths had the word "Kosmos". That is the name of Humboldt as a honorary member of the "Schlaraffia Chicagoana Club".</p>
   <p>The statue is 10 feet high and represents the great world explorer in an upright position. It was manufactured by the young Berlin artist, Felix Goerling, and shows proof of his splendid talent. Mr. Hesing dedicated the statue in good form to the president of the West Park Commissioners Mr. Harvey L. Thompson, who responded with many thanks and expressed his pleasure over the new ornament of the Park. The speech was received with great enthusiasm also of the next speaker Mayor Washburne. Dr. Henins held the festival speech as President of the German Press Club. It was a masterpiece of rhetoric.</p>
   <p>Professor Albion W.Small of the University of Chicago held a short speech. Several resolutions were passed, thanking all persons who had assisted at the final arrangements.</p>
