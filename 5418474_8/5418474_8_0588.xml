   <p>There is nothing which provokes a German-American newspaperman as much as the conduct of the German press abroad. These foreign newsmongers suppress any favorable news about the United States in order to check emigration. Every other country, even Brazil, where pepper grows, or Patagonia, Central America, Sumatra, or the South Sea islands, are boomed, and emigrants are advised to go there; but the United States--that is a country to stay away from, because the Germans would be absorbed and become Yankees! This reason, so far as it is based on honest conviction (which is not always the case), shows how uninformed German newspaper writers are about the United States.</p>
   <p>There is sufficient proof available to show that these chaps of the foreign press don't want to be informed; anything about America causes only a derisive smile, and they pride themselves in being ignorant of the activities of <pb facs="5418474_8_0589.jpg" n="2"/>German-Americans here.</p>
   <p>According to these writers, the Germans were assimilated by the Yankee element, and any proof to the contrary goes into the waste basket.</p>
   <p>And so it was possible for the great "stay at home" traveler, F. von Hellwald, to send an exhaustive account of the German press in the United States to Becker, who published the statements in his tirade about America. The samples of German newspapers in America consisted of a small Washington sheet, a struggling Pennsylvania farm paper from Williamsport, and an 8 x 12 size weekly from the southernmost part of California! And that included just about all one could find of the German press! Even a man like Scherzer, who actually travelled in America, wrote an article for Rundschau [a newspaper] describing German activities in the United States, and he ignored almost all the facts, mentioning only what has been known for the last thirty years. And, of course, the Germans were advised to seek a home in semicivilized Guatamala rather than in the United States. Gegenwart even published an <pb facs="5418474_8_0590.jpg" n="3"/>article about South American conditions, and it becomes quite evident that Brazil is boomed to induce settlers to go there; and, as far as the daily papers in Germany are concerned, they simply exclude news from the United States and substitute, instead, the most sordid tales published in American papers.</p>
   <p>Small wonder then, that German-Americans feel incensed when reading such articles in foreign papers! And it is no consolation to us that this deplorable propaganda is the result of childish hope that the Germans settling on foreign soil might form German colonies. Silly aspiration! as long as political conditions in Germany continue unchanged, German emigrants will show no enthusiasm to found foreign colonies and to make them dependencies of Germany.</p>
   <p>This reminds us of the story about the last elector of Hessen: He asked one of his councilors how the extensive emigration to America could be stopped, and received the significant reply, "My Lord need only tell the people that <pb facs="5418474_8_0591.jpg" n="4"/>America is now a Hessian domain--and not a soul would then manifest a desire to go there!" This would also apply to the proposed German colonies.</p>
   <p>The German tax system, Prussian officialdom, compulsory army service--none of these would be attractive to Germans who leave the homeland. But the German administration would never consider a colony without the afore--mentioned adjuncts. Germany would use its customary methods of control--and that would be the last thing the emigrants want. It may hurt German pride, but it is a fact, nevertheless, that the Germans are as little suited to start colonies as the French because, during the last two centuries, political and social conditions have been such that the prerequisites to start successful colonies could not develop in the people. The essentials are a strong sense of independence, the capacity for forming a government, resourcefulness and indifference to risks. The history of the United States gives us the best proof that the German immigrants are highly suited to improve an existing free government--an established nation--because of the Germans natural diligence, persistence and a frugality which tends to provide a <pb facs="5418474_8_0592.jpg" n="5"/>balance against the frenzied speculative tendencies and haste of the English-speaking factions. But the Germans are woefully lacking in certain qualities--when compared with the Americans--in colonizing new territories and creating nations.</p>
   <p>Whoever doubts the aforesaid need only peruse the history of exclusively German settlements in the United States (or such localities where Germans predominate)--and one finds these places readily enough in Illinois, Wisconsin, or Missouri.</p>
   <p>The evidence shows clearly that German accomplishment reached its highest development when combined with the English-American element. German emigrants, during the last fifty years, have preferred the United States to any other country, regardless of all the foreign propaganda designed to dissuade emigration to this country. And this tendency will persist, in spite of the attitude of the German press abroad.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0593.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>It is the height of ingratitude for Germany to disregard entirely its immense trade increase, thanks to commercial relations with the United States, and to ascribe this entirely to the Yankees. Perhaps it is just plain German stupidity. The German Reich would not obtain one half of its present profits if it depended on the trade provided by a handful of struggling overseas colonies.</p>
