   <p>President Wilson and the German Ambassador have promised to be present at the dedication ceremonies of the Goethe Monument, June 13th, in Lincoln Park. Mr. H. Rubens and Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, who were sent as delegates by the committee to present to President Wilson the official invitation, were very cordially received at the White House. The President listened with great interest to the story about the monument and the plans for its dedication. He declared himself well pleased with the invitation, and that he would be glad to come to Chicago for the festival provided important official business did not prevent him.</p>
   <p>The special delegates went to the Ambassador of Germany, also, and handed him an official invitation. Count Bernstorff promised to attend the dedication ceremony during the afternoon and also the evening festival at the auditorium, and to give a speech at both occasions. Official invitations will also be sent to Governor Dunne and Mayor Harrison.</p>
