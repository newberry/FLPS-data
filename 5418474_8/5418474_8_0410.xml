   <p>The regular monthly meeting of the German-American Historical Society was held yesterday. In view of the fact that on this occasion a highly interesting report was given by Mr. Emil Mannhardt, secretary of the organization, a great number responded to the invitation to attend. The report was as follows: Since our last meeting three weeks ago, public interest has increased in our organization. Several new members have joined the society for life. Another interesting thing is that a philanthropical member of the society, who wishes to remain unknown, made the publication of the German-American Historical periodical possible with a donation of $150. The first issue of this paper will appear next January. Through that medium the society hopes to propagandize to gain new members as well as collaborators.</p>
   <p>The Committee for Historical Research has sent us its flattering approval with the assurance of its assistance.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0411.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After the reading of the report, Mr. Mannhardt gave a lecture on "The First German Alderman of Chicago," and on the "First German Settlers of Chicago on Record."</p>
   <p>It was a lecture for which painstaking preparation and study was required. He took his listeners as far back as 1825.</p>
   <p>The first known German to settle here was Peter Piche, but nothing else could be learned about him. The records show further that among the voters of 1830, were thirty-two Germans; at least judging by their German names, such as Peter Friyue, Jos. Bruske, Mathias Meyer, and Fred Mattel. In 1832 the names of Moritz Baumgarten, and Jos. Hundorf were added, and still later in 1833, we find the names of Theresa Schandler, Nic. Klinger, Platte, Helm, Schellhaus, and Moras. The list of voters of 1837 already contained the names of Burg, Bant, Malzacher, Berg, and Stose.</p>
   <p>Carl Sauter, presumably from Bavaria, was Alderman of the second ward in the early forties. He was an enterprising and energetic young man; helpful <pb facs="5418474_8_0412.jpg" n="3"/>wherever help was needed. He was intensely interested in progress. To him belongs the honor of having been the first postmaster of Strassburg riding on horseback in the mail service, between New Strassburg and Chicago. Sauter, according to records, also held several other public offices during his lifetime. He showed a keen interest in his fellow-countrymen. Death claimed him in 1877 at the age of 66 years.</p>
   <p>The lecturer, Mr. Mannhardt, then gave a vivid sketch of the means of communication between New Strassburg and Chicago in those days when railroads were and unknown thing. A team of oxen was used for mail service, requiring 48 hours to cover the distance between the points of communication.</p>
   <p>The first German physician, Dr. Bomino, established himself in this city in 1837. This, however, is all we do know about him. Nevertheless, judging by a newspaper advertisement of those days, he was able to cure all illness from toothache to tuberculosis with herbs. Thus, advertising was already then flourishing. The lecture was greatly appreciated.</p>
