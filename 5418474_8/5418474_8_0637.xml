   <p>Today, for the first time since the great fire, the Illinois Staats-Zeitung appears again in the old size of thirty-six columns. Since the somewhat smaller script permits us to put somewhat more type into the same column length, the reappearance of the paper in the old size, actually amounts to an enlargement by one-sixth - that is to say our increase from thirty-six columns of the former type and length to forty-two such columns. Of all Chicago dailies the Staats-Zeitung is the first to return to the nine-column size. Only the Tribune adding to the thirty-two columns of its main section - a sixteen columns supplement - equals in the amount of printed space the Illinois Staats-Zeitung. The Times, the Republican, the Evening Journal, the Evening Post, the Union and the Mail are outdistanced.</p>
   <p>It is today exactly seven weeks since the Illinois Staats-Zeitung appeared for the first time after the devastation of Chicago as a scanty sheet printed only on one side.....</p>
   <p>The river was still limned for two miles by burning mountains of coal when the wholesale trade founded itself a new headquarters and close nearby the newspapers established their bivouac.</p>

   <p>Among the papers, the two whose publishers did not lose their private homes (The Tribune and Journal) had a small advantage before the others, whose whole personnel fled aimlessly on Monday before the onslaught of the fire demon. But already on Tuesday morning two or three members of the dispersed personnel of the Staats-Zeitung, met accidentally in a restaurant, corner of Clinton and Madison Streets, and there, in the midst of a "country-fair" hubbub, the first copy of the paper was written. The manuscript was sent to Milwaukee, to be printed there, and then a suitable business place had to be located. After not a few vain efforts the present one was found, and the Illinois Staats-Zeitung had the satisfaction of being the first in this favorable anchorage. It was followed by the Evening Post, Walsh's Western News Company and soon also the Times.</p>
