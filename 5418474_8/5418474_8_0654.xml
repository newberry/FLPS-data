   <p>We hear from a friend in Chicago regarding our assertion in the last issue of Atlantis about the many interests which confront the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, which aroused some very definite suspicions. We do not believe that we can be misunderstood, that our statements may be construed as an aspersion to the paper's independence and honorableness or an intent to cast doubts upon it.</p>
   <p>The expression which we used might not have been very fortunately chosen, but we only desire to convey the impression that in such a large city of diverse German interests it becomes exceedingly difficult for a single paper to do justice to all, and this difficulty is undoubtedly recognized by the editors of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung.</p>
   <p>How many questions arise on the political horizon within a year! What a diversity of problems among the Germans; all need representation.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0655.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Temperance, the German home, German society, tunnel, banking matters, and other affairs affecting Germanism in particular, enough to eliminate political affairs for a time, but this does not justify censure. However, if we created such an impression then we hope that these lines will prove an adequate explanation. After all, nothing could be more disagreeable to the editor of this publication than a prevailing belief that he intends to arouse suspicions about an honest, liberal-minded paper like the Illinois Staats-Zeitung.</p>
