   <p>Professor Sophus Tromholt, the well-known Norwegian astronomer, gave a lecture at the Turnhall under the auspices of the Intellectual Entertainment Committee. His subject proved most interesting. As it was given in an easily understand-able form, it is bound to make a lasting impression upon his audience, especially through the addition of imposing lantern slides 8 X 10 ft. square, which provided magnificent illustrations. . . . . His lecture was admirable, and the scientific investigations which he explained in modern terms proved fascinating. Copernicus, that gigantic crater of the moon, with its countless smaller extinct volcanoes, was shown with plastic realism. . . . . Mount Vesuvius was also reflected on the curtain by the magic lantern giving a comparative picture. . . . .</p>
   <p>The Chicago Turngemeinde deserves great commendation for having selected such exceptionally entertaining, scientific subjects for its intellectual evenings, and it is to be hoped, that Professor Tromholt will present the lecture on the <pb facs="5418474_8_1086.jpg" n="2"/>planetary system and our sun, to complete another program for us. The large lower hall was crowded, and every available seat was taken. The Male Chorus of the Turnverein and Fidelia gave choice vocal selections, which were welcome additions to the enjoyable occasion.</p>
