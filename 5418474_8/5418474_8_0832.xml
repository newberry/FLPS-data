   <p>The German-English School Association is re-opening its school at the newly-erected building today. Great care has been taken in regard to ventilation. It was intended to make this building one of the best in the United States as far as sanitary conditions are concerned. Although it is built, not by public finances, but by private means, it is very pleasing in appearance, and well furnished.</p>
   <p>This private school has been active for nearly two years, and during this short period it has progressed very rapidly. It is hoped that many more scholars will enter the new school. There is an urgent necessity for a school which will develop mind and soul. At the same time the German children retain the mother tongue. This new school is adequate enough to meet the ever-increasing demands of a certain class of our German population. Achievements are such that discriminating parents send their children to this school from a comparatively far distance.</p>
