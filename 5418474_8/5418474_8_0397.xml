  <body>
   <p>The "German American Historical Society of Illinois" has held its 6th annual meeting yesterday in the magnificent and suitable associations home at the "Chicago Historical Society", which has given same to the disposal for this purpose. The meeting was very well attended. As representative of President Boacke,. who was prevented from appearing personally by illness, the Justice of the Peace Eberhardt opened the meeting. He presented the purpose and the goal of the society and showed what had been achieved by same up to the present. Especially he mentioned the merits resulting from the work of its conscientious and busy Secretary Emil Mannhardt. The society collects historical facts for a great work which will show future generations the cooperation of the element of Germans in the cultural work done in the new world. At the end of his speech Mr. Eberhardt introduced Dr. Hermann Oncken, who at present teaches German history at the University of Chicago and had the distinction during his visit to be called to the Professor's chair at the University in Gessen, held before by his famous uncle Wilhelm Oncken. Dr. Oncken invited by the <pb facs="5418474_8_0398.jpg" n="2"/>Secretary of the Historical Society for a lecture has accepted in a very amiable manner and has fulfilled his promise last night.</p>
   <p>Dr. Oncken's Lecture</p>
   <p>"I have been asked to speak about the cultural work of the Germans in the United States of America. Not being sufficiently versed in this theme I had to refuse. I have chosen a theme which also concerns the mass immigration of the Germans to the United States of America even as a sporadic appearance in the endless floods of the stream, which moves the people of the earth and which is called "World history collectively." I will speak about the Germans as nomads. The migration of Nations of which we have learned at school to have started about 375 years after Christ in reality had no beginning which could be determined with historical accuracy and never had or will have an end. The Germans were first heard of in the year 100 before Christ as the Teutons and the Cimbrons tried to run down the Roman Empire. They were repulsed but notwithstanding continued to be a danger for Rome, which was bound to take the offensive.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0399.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The defeat they suffered in the Teutoburg forest put an end to their attacks. For hundreds of years the battles raged here and theretill Rome fell. German armies went through Italy right into Africa. Vandals and Visi-Goths established themselves in Spain and knocked down the native population of these lands with their barbaric fists. Later on Gallia was conquered by the Franks, as settlers of the New World.</p>
   <p>Germans took no part in the beginning. The immigration to the United States of America was very active and will be stronger in the future. In the old country it was believed that the immigrants to the United States of America would be lost for Germany, but today a different opinion reigns. The German element in the population of the great Republic is a strong tie between both countries. As regards the relations of the German immigrants to their new Fatherland they would serve its interest best, if they try their best to maintain for the, selves and their descendants that, which is good and honorable with their National traditions.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0400.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Mr. Eberhardt expressed the gratitude of the assembly for the speech and announced that it would be published in the quarterly publication of the association. In the following general meeting of the historical society Dr. Oncken was elected as a honorary member of the society.</p>
   <p>Pres. Max Eberhardt; Vice Pres. Dr. Otto L. Schmidt and Otto C. Schneider, Treas. Al Klappenbach. Directors: F. Bormann, Von Quincy, Dr. G. Loelkes, Von Belleville, Otto Kieselbach, Von Mendota, H. Warkerbarth and A. Halinger of Chicago.</p>
