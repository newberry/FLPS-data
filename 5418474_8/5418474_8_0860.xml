   <p>I have read Mr. Hailmann's answer to my recent article in this newspaper concerning the German Teachers' Seminary, which Mr. Hailmann is calling the National German-American Seminary. To defend myself, I must mention that all information pertaining to my statements was given to me from several active sponsors of the project. There might have been a misunderstanding in regard to the fund of $10,000 - which (possibly includes all collections in St. Louis) might have reached by now the figure of $20,000. To get a clear picture on this subject, it must be understood in the first place, that there is a fair difference between donations on the paper and cash gifts or cash collections.</p>
   <p>We all know that many magnificent plans of German conservatories and Germanistic institutes have collapsed in the very beginning through mismanagement and dishonesty. These failures of the past have left an atmosphere of distrust, for which I cannot apologize, as long as the project of the National German-American Seminary does not show a more substantial progress.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0861.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>I am admiring the perseverance and truly German ideals which have been the underlying forces towards the realization of the project.</p>
   <p>I hope I have been mistaken with my statements, published recently, and I sincerely wish that all generous sponsors of the Teachers' Seminary will be successful in their efforts to see the plan carried out. The organizing of the Seminary in September will be the best reward for the confidence, which so far has been shown by the Germans of America.</p>
