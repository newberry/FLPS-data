   <p>The gymnastic Club, "Vorwaerts" makes the following appeal to the gymnastic clubs of the West and South side. It has been acknowledged by all civilized persons, that bodily exercise is absolutely necessary to create physically and mentally healthy individuals, and it is therefore important to give every man, woman, young and old the opportunity, to exercise the body by gymnastics and sports.</p>
   <p>Nothing would be better for this purpose than well installed open exercised places, where those exercises could take place in the open and fresh air. The gymnastic club "Vorwaerts" is agitating for the erection of a public exercise place in Douglas Park, combined with a swimming pool. The necessary plans have been drawn and a resolution to the park board has been worked out. Personal contrast with some members of the park board has been established and we are assured, that if the matter will be presented in a business like manner, it will be given due consideration.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1326.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Park board has already estimated $20,000.00 for this purpose. The various associations are requested to endorse this proposal, with their signatures and seals and return same to us with the statement of the number of their members.</p>
