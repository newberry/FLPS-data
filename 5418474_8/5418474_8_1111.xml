   <p>Club No. 3 of the Southwest Side held a well attended Agitation Meeting on Saturday evening, May 31st in its Hall at 633 Blue Island Avenue. Comrade Rudolph presided. Comrade Grottkau held his announced lecture and choose as his theme "The Rule Of The Upper Classes." In the course of his lecture, the reviewer spoke about free competition and business risks, and came to the conclusion that the whole system has to be dropped, because to-day's methods of production are nothing but gambling.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of his lecture, he touched upon absolute freedom, and proved, as the club did in its last meeting, that this is impossible. Immorality was pointed out as an example. The speaker was loudly acclaimed at the end of his lecture. The following took part in the discussion: Comrades Meeske Kiesling, Rabusch and others.</p>
