   <p>The special benefit performance, which was proposed during first year's session, was a financial success. It was given in the exposition building for the "Relief" of the Johnstown flood sufferers. The splendid, technical displays of the Turners were most gratifying and brought unstinted applause. The affiliation with the League for Personal Rights was one of the most important steps of the year. The district clubs acquiesced and accepted the recommendations which were made, last year, at the regular business meeting. This result is not only of great significance to the local clubs but its moral support also has affected the League tremendously and given it such mighty dimensions, that its just demands must be seriously considered in the future. Since the education of our youths is one of the paramount issues among the Turners, it is considered a duty to mention a few facts at the meeting, incidents which have raised considerable dust here in Illinois and Wisconsin. It is the movement in regard to the school question. There appears to be a general discrepancy about state rights, since one side claims: the state not only has the right, but it is its duty to provide for the education of the growing <pb facs="5418474_8_1386.jpg" n="2"/>generation, and, on the other hand, we hear that this question must be settled by the parents. Whatever the views of the two factions may be, it seems clear to me, if the state holds individuals responsible, then it must also provide for their education. It is an interesting problem and our reports should clarify our position in this matter.</p>
   <p>Treasurer's report: receipts $3,922.31; expenditures 1,739.20; surplus, $2,183.11. Reports from other department officials are likewise very favorable. The central committee shall furnish speakers to all clubs when the latter desire it and it also shall suggest themes and questions.</p>
   <p>The Newspaper.</p>
   <p>A motion was made, that every new member should be given the current member of the paper, gratis. Therefore a resolution the passed that the names and the addresses of all new applicants of the various local clubs should be forwarded to the editor.</p>
