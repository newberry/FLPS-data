   <p>The special benefit performance, which was proposed during first year's session, was a financial success. It was given in the exposition building for the "Relief" of the Johnstown flood sufferers. The splendid, technical displays of the Turners were most gratifying and brought unstinted applause. The affiliation with the League for Personal Rights was one of the most important steps of the year. The district clubs acquiesced and accepted the recommendations which were made, last year, at the regular business meeting. This result is not only of great significance to the local clubs but its moral support also has affected the League tremendously and given it such mighty dimensions, that its just demands must be seriously considered in the future. Since the education of our youths is one of the paramount issues among the Turners, it is considered a duty to mention a few facts at the meeting, incidents which have raised considerable dust here in Illinois and Wisconsin. It is the movement in regard to the school question. There appears to be a general discrepancy about state rights, since one side claims: the state not only has the right, but it is its duty to provide for the education of the growing <pb facs="5418474_8_1386.jpg" n="2"/>generation, and, on the other hand, we hear that this question must be settled by the parents. Whatever the views of the two factions may be, it seems clear to me, if the state holds individuals responsible, then it must also provide for their education. It is an interesting problem and our reports should clarify our position in this matter.</p>
   <p>Treasurer's report: receipts $3,922.31; expenditures 1,739.20; surplus, $2,183.11. Reports from other department officials are likewise very favorable. The central committee shall furnish speakers to all clubs when the latter desire it and it also shall suggest themes and questions.</p>
   <p>The Newspaper.</p>
   <p>A motion was made, that every new member should be given the current member of the paper, gratis. Therefore a resolution the passed that the names and the addresses of all new applicants of the various local clubs should be forwarded to the editor.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1387.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Important recommendations: The delegates were instructed to help promote the founding of a Father John Orphanage, (Father Jahn, more appropriately, Mr. John, was the originator of the Turner movement in Germany,) by appealing to their consituents; to sanction the publication of the Turner club paper: That no German Turner alliance should ever become associated with a similar American organization; to induce the Administration of the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition; to employ only union labor; to recognize the eight hour work day; to allow admission to the public on Sundays; to permit refreshments of all kinds to be consumed on the Exposition grounds. Other resolutions provided for agitation towards the adoption of adoption of the Australian election system. The Labor Question was referred to another committee.</p>
   <p>The School Question: The consensus of opinion from district members shows, that the Republic has the right and it is its duty to provide schools and that the general principle of school education must be controlled by law. That is necessary, in view of the aforesaid, that the private schools supported by the state must be subject to inspections, so that a certain guaranty should exist that thoughtless, careless parents do not deprive their children from acquiring a necessary <pb facs="5418474_8_1388.jpg" n="4"/>education and that a definite minimum standard is maintained. The ideal of cultural liberty will not be jeopardized, thereby. However no laws shall contain any paragraphs, which are not lucid, and might be construed in such a manner that misunderstandings would arise, as well as mal-application by zealots and over ambitious administrators. We therefore consider that a revision of the present statutes is absolutely necessary. Such laws should be so worded, that if any school meets the required level, its teaching of any other language must not be questioned or inhibited; likewise, in certain subject matter, the English language should not enjoy a complete monopoly.</p>
   <p>The delegates adjourned at 11 o'clock.</p>
