   <p>p. 2.. Newspapermen, unlike other groups or societies, have to celebrate their festivals indoors, even if it happens to be the May festival. Nevertheless, it was one of the most animated entertainments this club has had during the eleven years of its existence. After an excellent piano solo by Mr. Keuffer, the president of the Press Club, Mr. Theodora Janssen delivered the welcome address. Mr. Fritz Glogauer followed with a lecture on the German-American press at the beginning of the next century.</p>
   <p>The speaker was certain that the dawn of the twenty-first century would not have any use for a press of any type, in the sense we use them today. Electrical engineering will have replaced the present "paper age". Through megaphones as well as other varieties of phones, kinematographs, etc., the public will receive the news as soon as the news bureau can transmit it. That century will find man situated so that he will receive news of all sorts immediately, through his own direct contact with the world.</p>
   <p>Mr. Janssen then gave a humoristic sketch, about the development of the German press. Several more speeches followed, after which an interesting musical program and dance concluded the celebration.</p>
