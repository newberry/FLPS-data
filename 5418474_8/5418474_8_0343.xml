   <p>The board of directors of the public library, in order to know which books and magazines are mostly read, has checked the number of times each one of them has been taken out. The results brought to light are most interesting.</p>
   <p>It appears that the Germans are faithful visitors of the library and German reading material was as much in demand as English reading material, if one takes into consideration the much greater number of English speaking people. During one month, the Kolniscke Zeitung was requested fifty-two times the Wiener N. Fr. Presse, fifty-one times, the London Times 152 times, Harpers' Weekly 219 times, and the Gartenlanbe 85 times.</p>
   <p>In view of their small number, the French go to the library frequently. The Revue Ves Veux Mondes was requested thirty times and the Illustration twenty-eight times.</p>
   <p>The Scandinavians also were very frequent visitors of the library. If French magazines are read also by people of other nationalities, the same cannot be said very often of Scandinavian literature. Many Scandinavian magazines are <pb facs="5418474_8_0344.jpg" n="2"/>read from nineteen to thirty-four times a month. The number of Scandinavian magazines at the library is very limited and we believe that the Board of Directors would gladly get more, if good ones were recommended by competent persons.</p>
