   <p>To the Socialist Turn Society!</p>
   <p>About a year ago, a number of Turners myself included broke off our connections with the Lincoln Turn Society as the outcome of disagreements over the protest question. To establish a new Turn society was in our opinion the most important step to be taken, and should be founded upon the following basis: The platform and the resolutions of the North American Turn Federation shall not be only a meaningless scrap of paper which was written on, but it shall also be acted upon. We were convinced of the need of a new Turn society and used all of our energy to establish one. Thus the Socialistic Turn Society came into existence. Considering the fact, that our society depended almost entirely upon the laboring classes and, that this was a year of financial hardship for the radically inclined working men, the newly established <pb facs="5418474_8_1409.jpg" n="2"/>society can justly boast of great success.</p>
   <p>The society's membership list reveals the satisfactory figure of 165. During the last six months 35 new members have joined the society, all of whom are persons believing in principles and in the execution of such, and did not join it for any selfish business reasons, as this is so often the case with turn and various other societies.</p>
   <p>The choice of Mr. Moritz Schmidt as turn teacher was never regretted. The turn school is so far restricted to very small quarters, which fact makes itself felt in the success of the school. During the last six months our active turners have participated in thirty seven turn exercises. Our cultural committee should be praised for the intellectual and cozy evenings, arranged by the committee once every month, on which occasion lectures, debates, etc., were followed with great interest by our audiences. As proof, that our society has remained true to its principles, we wish to point out the society's call for a protest mass meeting, following the Illinois Supreme Court's sanction of capital punishment imposed on the anarchists, <pb facs="5418474_8_1410.jpg" n="3"/>and the presently called for mass meeting to protest against the proposed new immigration banishment laws. And we also wish to state that the Socialistic Turn Society was the first one of the turn societies to arrange a festival for the benefit of the defense fund....</p>
