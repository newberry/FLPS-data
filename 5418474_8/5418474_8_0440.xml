   <p>Whoever was present at the gala affair of the German Press society in the Bismarck Hotel did not think much of Ash Wednesday. The gay evening was a success. The attendance was larger than ever before, the artistic presentations were above criticism, and the crowd was in a jovial mood. Naturally, the evening stood for Richard Wagner, whose 50th memorial day was celebrated by the whole world.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0441.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But the artists, who dignified the festival with their performances, did not confine their music exclusively to Wagner but presented several numbers of lighter vein. Best of all, it was pleasing to note that a mutual contact existed between the artists and the public. Theo Mahr's orchestra started the evening with the Tannhauser "Phantasy"; Siegfried Vellstedt played an act from the Walkure and Florence Kaiser sang Elizabeth's song, "Dich teure Halle." The audience was so enthusiastic that it demanded an encore. She sang "Cacilic" by Richard Strauss. Wilma Moesly sang from Strauss, Wolff, and Abt, which was also appreciated.</p>
   <p>Mark Oster sang an aria, seldom heard in this country, from the opera, "The Golden Cross." As an addition, he chose one of his great numbers, <pb facs="5418474_8_0442.jpg" n="3"/>the aria from "Figaro" in the "Barber of Seville." As the evening progressed, Mark Oster sang again the song of the Dark Brown girl and other beautiful songs. Siegfried Vollstedt played "Jolly Brothers" waltz composed by his father.</p>
   <p>During the intermission dancing was enjoyed. It was observed that the youth was well represented, a proof that the German Press Society exerts a strong influence upon the second generation of German-Americans.</p>
