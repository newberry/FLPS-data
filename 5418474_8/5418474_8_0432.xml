   <p>Yesterday evening, in the Bismarck Hotel, the Verein Deutsche Presse gave an entertainment which was extremely well attended. Professor Martin Schuetze of the University of Chicago was guest of honor. Professor Schuetze talked about his observations and experiences as a teacher of the German language and literature, and also about his efforts to interest wider circles of the German community in cultural endeavors. The professor spoke very frankly about the unwarranted peculiarities of the German-Americans, and illustrated his lecture with countless anecdotes and experiences of his own.</p>
   <p>The audience listened to the professor's remarks with obvious interest, and clapped him heartily when he and concluded. The president of the German Day Association, Mr. Gustav E. Brand [Translator's note: The usual form of the name is "Gustav A. Brand"], spoke in the interest of German Day, and at the same time <pb facs="5418474_8_0433.jpg" n="2"/>recounted all sorts of interesting experiences which he had had. He also spoke at length about his plans for this year's German Day, and urged those present to lend their active co-operation to the success of the affair.</p>
   <p>Laura van der Locht, a concert singer who has been well known and popular in German circles for years, was greeted by the members of the Association and of the ladies' auxiliary as a beloved old friend. She sang a few songs by Schubert and Schumann, and by her understanding interpretation earned enthusiastic applause. Her accompanist, Mr. Theo. Mohr, was excellent. Mr. Mohr also favored the audience with a few solos on the piano, which won great applause.</p>
