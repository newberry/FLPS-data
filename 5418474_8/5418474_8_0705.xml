   <p>Four years ago German science was shown a great honor by the University of Chicago, they having sent over for this purpose their representatives, Professors Joseph Kohler, Eduard Meyer, Berthold Delbouck and Paul Ehrlich. Big receptions and festivities took place on that occasion, and the German element of the city's population took a lively part in the demonstrations, in honor of the above named champions of German intellectual culture. The events of those days were an occasion for Mrs. Katharine Seipp, who is well known for her magnanimity in behalf of German efforts, and also through her philanthropy - to found three prizes in memory of her late husband, the brewer Conrad Seipp, - for the best historical works, about: "The German element in the United States, with special consideration of its political, moral, social and educational influence."</p>
   <p>It was decided that the works of the competitors, after the expiration of three years, should be submitted to Professor Cutting of the University of Chicago <pb facs="5418474_8_0706.jpg" n="2"/>and then - without mentioning the names of the authors - should be forwarded to prize judges, to be selected by Dr. Wever, German Consul, in order that they should appraise same, and so it happened accordingly. The prize judging commission, consisting of Professors Hammo Deiler, of the Tulane University in New Orleans, Frederick Turner of the Wisconsin State University in Madison and Karl Detler Jessen of the Girls' Academy in Bryn Mawr, has now completed its work. For the submitted, voluminous eight compositions, the following were awarded prizes:</p>
   <p>First prize, $3,000 to Albert Bernhard Faust, Professor of German Literature at Cornell University; second prize $2,000 to Mr. Rudolph Cronan, New York; and the third prize to Mr. Georg von Bosee, Philadelphia.</p>
   <p>The works winning the awards, will go to the University of Chicago, in accordance with Mrs. Seipp's decision, and at least the first one will be multiplied in print, in order to be accessible to the public.</p>
