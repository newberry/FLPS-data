   <p>Mr. Legner, the first speaker at last night's meeting, gave a very satisfactory report. He said that the Aurora Turn-Society made progress during the past six months, surprising even to the members. The attendance at the meetings was very good and the participation in debates exceedingly spirited. The growing membership is looked upon with much satisfaction. January 4th, 1882, the Society had 105 members; today the list of members shows an increase to 150. The library disposes of 650 books. There are 319 pupils enlisted at the Turn school. August Zapp is turn teacher. Mr. Zapp can justly be proud of his accomplishments despite the difficulties which he encounters. The Turners and the Germans of the North-west side are appreciative of his work. I expressed my opinion in the last report that compulsory exercises were against our principles and harmful to the Society and have been proven correct. These paragraphs were suspended last July for a period of six months with a satisfying result. My advice to the Turn-Society is to abolish entirely the paragraphs for compulsory exercises. We propose that at the end of every meeting a few articles from the "Freidenker" (Free thinker) shall be read. This for the mental relaxation of the Turners and also to introduce to our new members, Turner Boppe, who is the excellent manager of this newspaper. On one of those occasions, Peter J. Ellert lectured on the hero Garibaldi. This was followed <pb facs="5418474_8_1419.jpg" n="2"/>by a debate of much interest in which many of the turners participated.</p>
   <p>Turner August Spies gave at the December meeting a lecture on "Socialism and the Right of Women to vote". At the District Turn celebration at Ottawa our turners were awarded great honors. The six turners who composed a champion team, were awarded seven prizes. This was a great honor, indeed, inasmuch as there was hardly any time for preparation and not one of the members of the team had ever before participated at a turn festival.</p>
