   <p>The German newspaper establishment, Die Freie Presse, which was quite recently forced into bankruptcy under an indebtedness amounting to nearly $14,000, was yesterday knocked down to the highest bidders, under the sheriff's hammer. There was not a very large attendance upon the sale, there being, besides those who were directly interested in the old concern and two or three bidders, but few spectators to the sale. It was evident that nobody wanted the material as an investment. Martin Best, deputy sheriff under Tim Bradley, mounted a beer keg in the composing-room of the establishment and began his harangue.</p>
   <p>The entire fixtures of the concern, which cost about $3,000, were sold for $196.15. It is understood the paper will be reissued under the title of Neue Freie Presse. (New Free Press.)</p>
