   <p>The Athenaeum Music School, under the direction of Professor Fuchs, opens its first course January 6. Last night an entertainment was given at the large hall of the Athenaeum to introduce the staff of the Music School to the public. In spite of the extremely cold weather a large crowd attended.</p>
   <p>Judge Henry Booth, President of the Athenaeum gave the opening address. This was followed by Beethoven's Overture, "Die Weihe Des Hauses," which was presented by Messrs. Fuchs and Dyhrenfurth, and which was immensely enjoyed by the audience.</p>
   <p>When Mrs. C. Koelling, who appeared next on the program, sang the aria, "Ich Weiss, Dass Mein Erloeser Lebt," the audience was left with no doubt of her excellent musical ability. Mrs. Koelling is endowed with a soprano of great range and of pleasant tone color, and she also has a depth of understanding which enables her to make her presentations in an appealing and convincing <pb facs="5418474_8_0859.jpg" n="2"/>manner. Her mode of singing is excellent, and proves that she is fully capable of utilizing her natural gifts.</p>
   <p>Then followed a lengthy address by Reverend Thomas, after which Mrs. Koeling sang the "Elviren-Arie" from Mozart's "Don Juan". Her rendition, which was given in an expressive and ingratiating manner, was enthusiastically received, and the audience insisted upon an encore.</p>
   <p>The last selections consisted of a number of piano recitals[given by their pupils] in which Messrs. Fuchs and Dyhrenfurth displayed virtuosity and gave evidence of their ability.</p>
