   <p>As in this year's annual convention of the League Clubs at Brooklyn, the Technical Society of Chicago was elected as an auxiliary of the German-American Technicians League, the new officials constitute at the same time for the next Club year the Board of the League which is combined with about 1000 members of the eight technical clubs: Baltimore, Brooklyn, Chicago, Newark, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburg, and Washington. The purpose of the German-American Technical League is the furtherance of the technical sciences and arts, and also of the spiritual and social interests of the fellow associates.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_0394.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The members come chiefly from German academic circles and are by their trades practicing Technicians, Architects, Civil - Machine - Mine and foundry Engineers, Chemists, Manufacturers, practicing Artists; in short all those whose trade is founded on the study of the Natural Sciences. In the next year the annual convention of the League Clubs will take place in Chicago and extensive preparations for a worthy reception and entertainment of the guests will be made. The Technical Society of Chicago has its regular meetings on the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of each month at the Hotel Bismarck.</p>
