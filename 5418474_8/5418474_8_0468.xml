   <p>The German-American press will be represented in a most prominent way at the International press exhibition in Cologne, Germany, if the propositions made by Dr. Ernst Esch, correspondent of the Abendpost to the president of the exhibition, Dr. Horst Weber, go through.</p>
   <p>The German ambassador, Baron von Maltzahn is very much in favor of it. On the occasion of a luncheon at the German embassy, which was given in honor of these two distinguished gentlemen, plans for the development of a German American press program were discussed. Among the guests were also the correspondent of the Cologne News in Washington, Dr. George Barthelms, and Dr. Max Jordan of the Berliner Tageblatt who are representing the German Press in the capitol.</p>
   <p>Dr. Weber as well as Dr. Esch are ardent promoters of a large representation <pb facs="5418474_8_0469.jpg" n="2"/>of German-American newspapers at the Cologne exhibition. Dr. Esch admitted, that in Germany hardly any German-American newspaper is known by its name. Even professional men are unaware of the fact that in America almost 200 daily and weekly newspaper are published in the German language.</p>
   <p>He also admitted that an exhibition of the German press of America would not only be in the interest of the German public in general - which would thus gain a picture of the activities and ideals of the Germans abroad - but also to the American visitor, it would prove of great value, because he would thus become acquainted with the importance of his fellow countrymen in his homeland.</p>
   <p>The gentlemen were not a little surprised to learn that in 1732 Benjamin Franklin published the first newspaper in the German language in the Colonies, namely in Philadelphia, and that since 1739 the publications of the German press of Christopher Saur's in Germantown were established firmly. They also learned of Saur's printing of the bible in the German language, and also of the wonderful prints of the German cloister Ephrato and many others.</p>
   <p>They learned that the Philadelphia Democrat printed in the German language was <pb facs="5418474_8_0470.jpg" n="3"/>founded in 1836. They also learned of Abraham Lincoln's proprietorship of a German newspaper in Illinois - which probably is only known to a few. There is no doubt in the minds of Dr. Esch and Dr. Weber that the German-American "Press Pavillion" would create the greatest amount of interest.</p>
   <p>At the tea which was given in the evening at the German embassy, only gentlemen were invited. There were representatives of the great American news agencies, correspondents of newspapers from New York, Baltimore and other cities, representatives of the departments of state and commerce, of the congressional library, the American "Chamber of Commerce," and interested associations.</p>
   <p>The Ambassador received the thanks of all the guests for the pleasant entertainment and also for the energetic furtherance of the exhibition, which will be a medium to bring the press of other countries in closer contact and at the same time create a journalistic Locarno, - to wit, a spiritual disarmament in the newspaper world.</p>
