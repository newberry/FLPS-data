   <p>The Socialist Club of the Northside held night before last its regular business and agitation meeting. Comrade Herman presided. Because Comrade Spies was prevented by illness to be present, Comrade Schwab gave a short lecture about "accidents". He spoke extensively about the causes of such accidents and proved that they were nothing but indirect murders.</p>
   <p>Nobody thought of blaming the rich and well educated murderers, but if a poor unfortunate creature was expelled from society, driven by hunger and misery to desperation and holds up somebody on a street corner, then the people are at once ready to morally condemn him. The latter should be held less responsible for his action, than the former. He (Schwab) personally could not shed any tears, if for once an exploiter, like a stock exchange robber meets with the same fate that he caused others because until such a scoundrel amasses a fortune, would a number of people be ruined. Many of these who are thus ruined commit suicide or still worse become incurably sick and demented.</p>

   <p>and the husband of his victim (Count and Countess Herbersberg and their supposed nephew, Rudolph von Sternan). He thought that he was just about to get into possession of money when his step-sister, the former fiancee of Count Herdersberg, who broke the engagment, accused her of being the mother of the child of his future wife, Auer told him about the true situation and immediately after, met his son. The son, despairing over the disgrace, although the innocent victim, decided to end his life before the eyes of Auer, in order to punish him for the attempt to make money in such a disgraceful way, but was prevented by his mother's appearance. Auer gives his promise to his step-sister to become a better man, and she herself was cleared of suspicion; even Rudolph's mother was forgiven by her husband, for the secrecy of her misstep.</p>
   <p>Whether Rudolph won the hand of his cousin, the daughter of Auer's stepsister, was not quite obivious, although the ensuing dialog would give us this impression. The strength of the play lies in the exquisite protrayal of the "Revolver Journalist." Mr. Ravene, who portrayed the "Revolver Journalist", was excellent.</p>
