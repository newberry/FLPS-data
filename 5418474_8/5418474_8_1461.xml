   <p>"Fellow Citizens!</p>
   <p>"The Turnhalle (Turner Hall) on North Clark Street, center of German activity, pride of the progressive liberal-minded element of the city, our building and all it stands for, may be lost to us.</p>
   <p>"The members of the Turngemeinde (Turner Association) worked zealously and successfully for years to preserve the building in the interests of Chicago's Germans. But now the Association is unable to continue without the help of the people. The Chicago Turngemeinde needs twenty to thirty thousand dollars to pay the mortgage and debts.</p>
   <p>"We are appending the plan adopted at a general meeting.</p>
   <p>"The sum seems large but can be easily raised, if everybody does his share.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1462.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>May everyone who reads these lines remember that the Turnhalle is an institution which benefits all Germans, as well as the people in general.</p>
   <p>"The residents of the north side in particular should consider the fact that, in rebuilding the Turnhalle after the Chicago Fire, real estate values in that district rose considerably.</p>
   <p>"The Germans raised $37,000 six years ago, at a time when Chicago was a smoldering ruin and, let it not be forgotten, this money will be wasted unless everyone contributes his mite. Let us not abuse the confidence Turner G. Freygang of New York had in us when, years ago, he contributed $20,000 without security, to finish our building. All should give now, and emulate a good example!</p>
   <p>"Committees will be appointed to call on citizens. we ask you to receive these delegates in a manner befitting men who work unselfishly in the <pb facs="5418474_8_1463.jpg" n="3"/>interests of the people and to maintain the prestige of the Germans in Chicago!"</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>The Publicity Committee</p>
   <p>Adolph Schoeninger, president;</p>
   <p>A. Boese, secretary;</p>
   <p>H. J. Christoph, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The $30,000 Bond Issue of the Chicago Turngemeinde,</p>
   <p>2nd Series</p>
   <p>is to be issued for the purpose of redeeming the second mortgage of $20,000 and all interest on debts (with the exception of interest on the first mortgage of $55,000).</p>
   <p>1.) Bonds will be issued for $30,000.</p>
   <p>2 ) Bonds are valued at $100; stock may be had for $50 and $25 (sic).</p>
   <p>3 ) In order to give everyone an opportunity to participate, shares <pb facs="5418474_8_1464.jpg" n="4"/>will also be issued in denominations of $10, $5, and $1.</p>
   <p>4) Bonds and stock are noninterest bearing.</p>
   <p>5) All persons buying a $25 bond or more will be considered stock-holders of the Chicago Turngemeinde.</p>
   <p>6) For the redemption of the bonds and stock, one-half of the year's net receipts will be set aside.</p>
   <p>7) A lottery is to be drawn at the annual dance of the stockholders of the Chicago Turngemeinde to decide which bonds shall first be redeemed.</p>
   <p>8) Bonds and shares will be redeemed until none are outstanding.</p>
   <p>9.) All bonds and stocks will be declared void twelve months after the last bonds and shares will have been redeemed. This clause shall take effect three months after giving public notice three times in three German newspapers.</p>
