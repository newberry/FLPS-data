   <p>At its monthly meeting held yesterday, the Advisory Board of the German American Society of Illinois, reported through its secretary, Mr. Mannhardt, that the local German Consul informed him as to the actions and recognition which the Prussian minister of culture accords to this Illinois Association. He utilizes its historical papers in the Universities and libraries of his district, calls attention to their importance for German-American data and recommends them highly. His action resulted in orders from the University library of Berlin, Goettingen, and Bonn, the Kaiser Wilhelm library of Posen, as well as book-stores in New York, Hanover, Leipzig, and Bonn. Also the Court library of the duke of Gotha subscribed to the historical pages. The secretary also stated, that twenty-one additional American libraries ( inland institutions) are now procuring these writings. Furthermore, he endeavors to induce the large libraries of the United States, Germany, and Austria, to become subscribers. Although printing costs have increased, the total expenditures of the association are less than last year, and since 125 members are in arrears with their dues, it is reasonable to assume that this years' accounting will also show a surplus.</p>
