   <p>The seventh anniversary of the Germania Broadcasting Company, which serves the public with German programs, was observed last Saturday at the Steuben Club. The celebration was on a large scale; not only the large ballroom on the twenty-fourth floor was used, but also space on the twenty-first, twenty-second, and twenty-third floors. The chief attractions were a Munich rathskeller, a "Likoerstube" (cocktail lounge), a Viennese cabaret, a Suabian saloon, and a Rhenish beer garden.</p>
   <p>The Program</p>
   <p>Festivities began early in the evening with a concert in the large ballroom. The first number on the program was a march entitled "Deutschlands Ruhm" (Germany's glory), played by an orchestra under the direction of Siegfried Vollstedt. Then Mr. Angelo Lippich rendered a prologue appropriate to the occasion. Thereupon the orchestra played the "Gold und Silberwalzer," by Franz Lehar.</p>

   <p>Mr. L. Klein, the president of the Germania Broadcasting Company, then spoke a few well-chosen words in behalf of the work which his organization was doing, and expressed his pleasure at the unexpectedly large number of guests.</p>
   <p>After the orchestra had rendered another selection, Lucie Westen sang the aria "Wie Nahte Mir Der Schlummer," from the opera "Der Freischuetz," by Carl Maria Von Weber, and Willard Andelin followed with the aria "In Diesen Heilgen Hallen," from the opera "Die Zauberfloete," by Mozart. Both soloists received generous applause.</p>
   <p>The Schleswig-Holstein Saengerbund, and the Schiller Liedertafel, directed by Reinhold Walter, had also enlisted in the cause and rendered "Einsiedler An Die Nacht," by Kern, and "Ich Hoert' Ein Voeglein Pfeifen," by Schauss. The Viennese songs sung by Adolf Engel were highly appreciated. The performance of the two radio artists, Mrs. Suess and Mrs. Sauer, together with Helen Holstein, climaxed the program. [Translator's note: The writer does not note the nature of their performance.]</p>

   <p>Angelo Lippich then rendered a selection from the operetta "Der Zigeunerbaron," and aroused considerable mirth. In conclusion, Lucie Westen, Helene Holstein, Max Bratt, and Angelo Lippich, gave the audience proof of their vocal and histrionic art, when they rendered several melodious parts of the operetta "Zigeunerliebe," by Franz Lehar, and they received cell-earned applause.</p>
   <p>After the chairs had been removed, joy and pleasure reigned supreme. It was impossible for your reporter to take advantage of all the vocal and instrumental music that was offered in various rooms. John's Dance Orchestra was in the large ballroom, the Germania Trio in the Rheinsh beer garden, the Viennese cabaret with Angelo Lippica as master of ceremonies, the Theodor Morsch Ensemble, and the Accordian Duo in the Suabian saloon, and Steiner Brothers and Otto Teubner's Bavarian Ensemble in the Munich rathskeller.</p>
