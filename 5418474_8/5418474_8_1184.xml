   <p>A committee meeting was held Saturday, December 10, at the hall of the Chicago Turnverein. Eight members were present.</p>
   <p>Turner Saltiel opened the meeting. The minutes of the last meeting were approved as read. Turner Saltiel read an answer from the State Board of Health. This public office is well aware of the unsanitary conditions. on the Fox River. The towns of Cary and McHenry have a already made plans for a modern system of canalization. These plans, however, at the present time cannot be materialized, because of financial difficulties.</p>
   <p>The secretary reported that, up until now, only the Grand Crossing Turnverein found it necessary to send in a list of its members. It is to be regretted that the organizations give so little heed to the resolutions of the meetings making it difficult for the suburb to start the necessary <pb facs="5418474_8_1185.jpg" n="2"/>propaganda for the cause of turning (sic).</p>
   <p>The two turn-warders (sic) Klafs and Brookmann from the Indianapolis meeting of turn-teachers (sic) report that the meeting was the best attended so far. Quite instructive were the performances by the students of the Seminary, showing various systems of turning. What the two turn-warders had to say convinced the members of the suburb that a congress of turn-warders and teachers is of great value to the turn organizations and that, in the future, every turn organization should be represented by a teacher or warder.</p>
   <p>By the director of the Seminary, Turner Rath, we were given assurance that he would not refuse his co-operation in case the district should perform publicly at the World's Fair. Resolved: To show only mass performances at these public affairs. The members of the suburb, camp committees, and the speakers of the organizations will have to deal with the program at greater <pb facs="5418474_8_1186.jpg" n="3"/>length at the meeting of January 7. In order to be able to make a workable propaganda for the cause of turning, Turner Koenig is entrusted with working out a few things.</p>
   <p>Turner Klafs reports that our crack turners participated at the German performance of the Carnival of Nations. Resolved: To defray the expenses accrued from the installation of apparatuses.</p>
   <p>The members of our crack organizations have decided to arrange an evening of entertainment toward the end of February.</p>
   <p>Frank Berndt of the Turnverein Lincoln was elected member of the camp committee.</p>
   <p>It was further resolved to have an Eskimo picnic in our camp on the day of the ski meet in Cary. The turners Koenig, Wild, Kraft, Klafs, and Brockman will make all preparations.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1187.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>A letter of thanks from Mrs. Jahn was read.</p>
   <p>Present at the meeting was the teacher, E. Hall, who told of conditions prevailing in Chicago schools. He told of the work of a so-called citizens' committee. He said that there was danger that, because of financial difficulties, such subjects as art, music, and gymnastics would have to be dropped. Resolved: To work out a fitting protest to be sent to the mayor and the board of education.</p>
