   <p>Amidst the general economical depression and unemployment, the tradesman who is an immigrant has to suffer to a much greater extent than one who is a native. While every craftsman, after his arrival in this country, is able to fill a position in his profession, the clerk or tradesman, until he learns the language of the country, is forced to take any position, or, what happens often today, has to stand in the streets without being able to earn anything. The German-National Clerks' Association, which already for quite some time extended the payment of old-age pensions to local groups abroad, has decided to carry out such measures of assistance as are worthy of recognition here in America also.</p>
   <p>The unemployment relief, which up to the present time benefited only members of the D.H.V. who were subjects of the German Reich, is now to be extended, beginning January 1, 1951, also to American local groups.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1711.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Due to the high rate of exchange the amount which will be donated here in America for assistance will be doubled in comparison with that in Germany.</p>
   <p>The unemployment relief will be for the benefit of the members of the D.H.V., without an increase of dues being asked for.</p>
