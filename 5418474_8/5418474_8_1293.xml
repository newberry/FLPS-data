   <p>"At the instigation of the German Athletic Clubs in Chicago, physical culture was finally introduced into the public schools of our city in 1884. after the clubs had long and persistently fought for it. Since that time physical culture has been recognized without interruption, as one of the regular courses and has been praised by teachers and laymen alike as a most desirable accomplishment. However, the candidate for Mayor of the Republican Party thought it necessary to attack it; thereby exposing his limited understanding and narrow-mindedness.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hanecy, the candidate for Mayor expresses himself in the Chicago Evening Post of March 8, as follows, 'Here is another outrageous appropriation of $10,400; - for salaries of teachers of physical culture'. This is sufficient proof of Mr. Hanecy's attitude, and what the citizens of Chicago in general, and the German Americans in particular can expect of him, in case he should be elected by similar thinking and feeling patriots.</p>
   <p>We consider it as our duty to acquaint the citizens of Chicago with Mr. Hanecy's attitude, to enable them to effectively repulse his infamous attack upon our principles, and our public schools, by voting against him."</p>
