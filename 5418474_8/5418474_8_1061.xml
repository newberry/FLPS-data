   <p>Professor Hermann Schumacher of the University of Boun, held his last lecture on Friday. In the course of it, he said trusts in Germany, would become just as important a factor, in its commercial life, as in this country. Regarding the consolidation of banks, Professor Schumacher declared, that they were a necessary counterpart to the National development of Germany. Without the present banking system in Germany, commercial life could not be active. Consolidated strength, helped in the development of industries during their infancy. It created competition and finally business prosperity.</p>
   <p>About the relative importance of the wholesale manufacturers and the big banks, Professor Schumacher said, in refard to the question, which are the most inportant factors, power of capital, organization and personality have to be taken into consideration; but everything points to the fact, that, big industry is the main power of Germany's business activity.</p>
