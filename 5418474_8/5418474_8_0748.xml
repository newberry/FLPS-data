<title level="a">SIEBEL INSTITUTE ENTERS INTO ITS 60TH YEAR OF TEACHING</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>With the expiration of this year, a technical school of German origin, the Siebel Institute of Technology, 958-966 Montana St., Chicago, will have to look back together with a third generation, to the time of its foundation, which occurred sixty years ago.</p>
   <p>Through the establishment of his scientific research institute for the development of the yeast industry in 1872, under the name of "Zymotechnic Institute," the late Dr. J. E. Siebel, became the pioneer in this still undeveloped field of Chemistry of the middle west, and established thereby Chicago's fame as a center of research pertaining to food production.</p>
   <p>At the beginning, the school gave only courses in brewing, malting and refrigeration; later there was added to these branches the bakery school, which today is widely known.</p>
   <p>During his life, Dr. Siebel found general acknowledgment for the research <pb facs="5418474_8_0749.jpg" n="2"/>service accomplished in his institute. He was constantly asked for advice by the bureaus of food industries of the government and was in 1916, at the time of the enforcement of the Pure Food Bill, appointed to the office of a chief chemist of the Department of Agriculture, which he resigned however, in favor of his friend, Dr. Harvey Wiley, now deceased.</p>
   <p>Steady Growth of the Institute</p>
   <p>In 1893 the management was taken over by the five sons of the founder. With the increasing technical progress in the baking and milling industries, more branches of instructions pertaining to these fields were added, which in later years became the most important.</p>
   <p>Today the entire institute is divided into five separate departments, namely; a department of professional education known under the name of "Siebel Institute of Technology," and the departments of engineering, production, merchandising and research service which are bound together under the name of "J.E. Siebel <pb facs="5418474_8_0750.jpg" n="3"/>Sons &amp; Co."</p>
   <p>Also Self-Education</p>
   <p>In accordance with the demands and necessities of time, a correspondence school was also established for the purpose of enabling the employed workers to broaden their education in the technical side of their professions through self-instruction.</p>
   <p>For the same purpose, the Siebel Manual for Bakers and Millers, by Dr. F. P. Siebel and the late Dr. Fred Stuhlmann, was published and was introduced and favorably received in the bakery trade. The Siebel Technical Review published by the alumni of the school keeps up the connections with the profession and brings always valuable scientific contributions in regard to problems of related industries.</p>
   <p>The reputation, which the institute enjoys in professional circles, makes it <pb facs="5418474_8_0751.jpg" n="4"/>easier at the present time of unemployment, for the graduate to be placed into a leading position. For this purpose an employment office was established which is free of charge to the students.</p>
