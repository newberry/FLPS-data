   <p>The German fraternity "Harugaru" is holding at present their semi-annual conference at Mahnke's Hall. The planning of the orphanage and the old People's home is one of the most important matters the 66 delegates have to arrange. A German-American multi-millionaire of the middle West has promised to add $25,000.00 and more as soon as that amount has been matched by the members. This German-American is well known for his generosity, but he does not wish that his name be mentioned in connection with his generous gifts.</p>
   <p>The members of the lodge have up till now a total of $1625.00 collected. This movement has started only recently and there is no doubt about its ultimate success. The plans are being considered already by the delegates. The German Old People's Home of Chicago has been recommended as a pattern, with the exception of the size, as the one to be built will be smaller.</p>
