   <p>The Hungarian National Sick Benefit Association, 1502 Sedgwick Street, Chicago, in conjunction with the German-Hungarian Worker's Alliance of Cincinnati, requests all German-Hungarian Societies, regardless of their individual plans or pursuance, to recommend the founding of a German-Hungarian Alliance. The advocates of that plan point out the deplorable economic and political conditions in Hungary, which are directly responsible for the ever increasing emigration of that country. In order to prevent a repetition of such conditions for the immigrants in this country, namely; to enjoy neither right nor protection,as is the case in their native land, it is superlative that the proposed organization should receive the necessary support.</p>
   <p>The creation of the Alliance in question is undeminably important, and the fact alone that a great many societies with chiefly humanitarian interests <pb facs="5418474_8_1775.jpg" n="2"/>have been already founded leads to the strengthening of the plan. The following points are considered essential in the activity of that organization: The first concern of the Alliance must be the protection of all German-Hungarians living in the United States, assisting them in obtaining personal rights and respect, which is its close ally. The protection of the citizen's rights for any member of any society, united with the German-Hungarian Alliance. A representative of that organization shall be stationed at Ellis Island to assist their countrymen in eventual difficulties, and whose plight could possibly culminate in deportation to their respective homelands. The organization shall refrain from political activities, except when the German-Hungarians are involved. And, of course, it would be within the rights of the Alliance to protect the interest of labor, if such should be jeopardized. Death benefits are also proposed for the members of the association, details of which have yet to be announded. However, the contributions will be determined according to the number of members. The German-Hungarian societies are thus requested to give earnest consideration to this issue, and be represented at the next meeting of delegates.</p>
