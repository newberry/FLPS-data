   <p>Four of the largest German Athletic Clubs, having separated themselves from the "American" Athletic League, have decided to form an alliance. All Socialists and anarchists who are trying to force their ideas upon the other members, shall be excluded. Many of the members are tired of being annoyed by the propagandists in their proselyting attempts;the athletic Club is to be devoted to Athletics only. Of course, these members have a right to do so. The great majority of people have not accepted socialism. Whether it contains the scentific truth potentially or it is only an empty dream, its teachings do not at all harmonize with the purpose and aims of the "American Athletic League."</p>
   <p>It is just as wrong for the Socialist to proselyte among the members of the Club as it would be for devoted Catholics to work among members of the Club, for their faith. To acquaint mankind with their teachings and their hopes, the Apostles of Socialism have unlimited opportunity in this land of free speech and free press...The actions of the socialists in the "Athletic League" must be considered a misdemeanor.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1364.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Every Socialist, of course, scoffs and sneers at the priests who attempt to convert people even if these are on their deathbed. But no priest has ever been more concerned about the soul of a person, than a geniune fanatic of Socialism is anxious to enlighten his stupid fellow-citizen. A Jesuit is not more convinced, that he alone has the keys to heaven, than the "Marxist is that his teachings are irrefutable. Followers of both of these extreme viewpoints are bound to convert others anywhere. Only the Jesuits, working for the salvation of men, are gentle, patient, polite, but the Marxist, who thinks he must enlighten people, is tactless, passionate and rude.</p>
   <p>The Socialists are unquestionably free to exercise mentally as well as bodily, but they have no right to engage in Socialistic propaganda in any Athletic Club, as a fellow members. It makes no difference whether their teachings are right or wrong, good or bad, they have no right to try to force it upon those who are not interested in them.</p>
   <p>Proselytism may have its place, but under certain conditions it is absolutely out of place.</p>
