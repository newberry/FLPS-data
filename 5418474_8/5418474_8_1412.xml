   <p>It was a gorgeous procession arranged by the Sharp Shooters.... The endeavors of our Germans to cultivate the ways and customs of the Fatherland meet oftentimes with criticism, but the cultivation of the sharp-shooting art of our German-Americans is equal to that of the old Fatherland, in some instances, they even exceed in this art their German brother.... In this country time means money, therefore, the Americans are not satisfied to indulge in the sport of sharp-shooting just for the exercise connected with it; They combine "Sport" with honor and money. The great achievements of our sharpshooters are largely due to the fact that time is not spent without compensation. The officials of our German-American Sharp-Shooting only, are always in a controversy with the sharp-shooters whose ambition is roused, mainly by the prospect of money making. Happily this seems to be on the wane.... The Chicago "Sharp-Shooter's Society" has helped greatly towards the establishing of the "federation of sharp-shooters" in the western hemisphere in 1879.. The festivals as mentioned in succession, St. Paul. 1881, Highland, Ill., 1883, Indianapolis, Ind., 1885, out did each other in the achievement of success and there is no doubt that the present festival held in Chicago will be the most glorious one ever held so far. Twenty Sharp-Shooting Societies with about 2,000 members are connected with the Federation.</p>
