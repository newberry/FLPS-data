   <p>The society known to us as the "Turners" was founded in the year 1812. Chicago is the head parters of the national society, and has the executive authority, which includes the following prominent German citizens; Fr. Zachner, President; A. Gottleib, vice-president; W. Berblinger, H. Von Langen, secretaries; A. Furstenberg, treasurer; Charles Zotz, A. Oberndorff, Charles Mayer, directors.</p>
   <p>The society has a library of 1,000 volumes, comprising standard German authors. The initiation fee is but $5.00 and the annual dues $6 more. There is a special fund for the relief and care of the sick members. The society points with pride to the fact that it sent two companies to fight for the union, and that the men fought nobly, 24 of more of them dying under the stars and stripes.</p>
   <p>After the fire the society did not step to lament, but at once put up a temporary structure, somewhat like a huge shanty, wherein the usual meetings were continued. About $1,200 was invested in this "relief house". The society became the disburser of the German relief fund, distributing a large amount of money among the burnt-out Teutons, of whom there were thousands.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_8_1532.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The dedication of the new Turn hall, built on the old side, places the society in fine quarters once more, and brings the history of their changes down to date.</p>
   <p>"Mens sana in corpore sana" was the old Latin maxim. With this saying of the stern old Roman in view, Vater Jahn founded his schools at the beginning of this century, encourage all the youth to join, and together with a sound, healthy body imbued the with liberal ideas, and when the great wars with Napoleon of 1813 and 1815 came he led them on to victory.</p>
   <p>Thus arose the Turner association. They have rapidly spread throughout Europe, and within the last quarter of a century have gained a strong foothold here upon our own continent, until they have spread into every small town, everywhere joining the very pivot about which all German-American sociability moves. And while the associations are originally German and partake principally of German characteristics, yet there is nothing in the organization itself at which any American can take offense.</p>
   <p>In this city there sprang from this organization numerous Turn-Vereins, not only German but Scandinavian and Bohemian. While these have their own halls also, the South Side Turn-Verein contemplates the speedy erection of a large <pb facs="5418474_8_1533.jpg" n="3"/>and beautiful structure.</p>
   <p>As Vater Jahn introduced his school for gymnastic training at Berlin, out of which grew the entire movement, so here Yale and Harvard have a perfect system of gymnastics with an experienced teacher for the same.</p>
   <p>All Americans can join the Turn-Verein; it is not an exclusive German-American institution, in which the greatest liberty, in every respect, is allowed, where social intercourse is one of the great elements that go to make up the Turn-Verein.</p>
   <p>Another decade and the West will have made gigantic strides toward a freer mode of thinking, another score and the shores of New England will reverberate the echo as it comes from the West and another half century and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from Maine to Florida, everywhere will be felt the benefits of the almagamation of the Teutonic element, for it has given the country strength, greater freedom, taught it the benefits of greater sociability, and bequeathed it to a firmer stability.</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen of the Chicago Turn-Gemeinde: Be ever mindful of your interests, let no political dissensions or petty discords ever distrub that unity and <pb facs="5418474_8_1534.jpg" n="4"/>harmony of action that has always existed among you. Continue the good work begun. Hold forever sacred this hall, ever cherish it as your fondest hope. Be jealous of the honor of the association, that it may stand where it has always stood, the leading, the represent active Turn-Gemeinde of Chicago; but stop not here, push it forward until it occupies the first position in the country, until throughout the land is respected the watch word of the Turners: "Frisch, Fromm, Frei!"</p>
