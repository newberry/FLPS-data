   <p>The Sickness Benefit League for German Musicians held its general meeting and election yesterday at W. H. Jung's Hall, 106 Randolph Street. The club has about 200 members and cash reserves of $2,700.</p>
   <p>The German Waiters Club of Chicago, to which many of our oldest and best known tavern-keepers belong, held its annual meeting and election at its headquarters, 164 Michigan Avenue. The Club was founded twenty-three years ago and is in a thriving condition according to its treasurer, W. H. Yung, who was re-elected for the 20th time yesterday. The cash reserves are $1,850 and last year $480 were paid in death premiums and sick benefits. All former officials were re-elected by acclamation.</p>
