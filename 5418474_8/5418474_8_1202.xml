   <p>In the first rounds of the contest for the Mayor Cup an eleven selected from the German football teams met a team of Norwegians and Danes yesterday. When the regular time was over the result was one to one. Even after the match was extended the outcome was still undecided, with the score two to two. The match will probably have to be repeated.</p>
   <p>The match was quite interesting and showed that the Germans had good playing material at their disposal. The combined Norwegian and Danish team opened the game at a lively pace and immediately began dangerous attacks. The game had scarcely lasted a minute when the Norwegian-Danish combination attained its first success. A left wing ran from the center toward the outer left and drove the ball into the net in fine style. The umpire failed to see, however, that the player was already offside before he ran the ball. Then the Germans came into the picture, carrying the play into enemy territory, but could make no scores in the first half.</p>

   <p>In the second half also, the Germans had the edge on their opponents. Kramer managed to even the score. Although the Germans continued to have the advantage and at times completely tied up their opponents, the winning score was denied them.</p>
   <p>As the game continued the Norwegian-Danish combination again made a tally. For the Germans Kramer again tied the score. Toward the end both teams tried to gain the victory, but both were without success.</p>
   <p>In general the Germans outdid the Norwegian-Danish combination, but they often failed to play together. The umpire overlooked many crude misplays by both teams, arousing vociferous disapproval from the onlookers....</p>
