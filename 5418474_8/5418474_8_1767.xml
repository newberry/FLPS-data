   <p>A great celebration, in which a number of other associations also took part, was held yesterday by the George Washington Benevolent and Aid Society, formerly Kaiser Friedrich Gegenseitiger Unterstuetzungsverein (Kaiser Friedrich Mutual Aid Society) in the Social Turner Hall. The occasion was the consecration of a magnificent new flag, dedicated by the members of the Society. This solemn act became an impressive and patriotic ceremony. As the flag was carried through the hall to the stage, on which the flags of other associations were grouped in a picturesque manner, the audience, which filled every seat, sang the "Star-Spangled Banner", accompanied by the band. The actual celebration began with the singing of "This is the Day of the Lord" by the Polyhymnia Ladies' Chorus and the Edelweiss Ladies' Chorus of the South Side, conducted ty Mr. Tegtmeyer. Mr. John Gross, of the administrative council of the association, made a patriotic address and handed the flag over to the president of the association, Mrs. Margarete Scholz, <pb facs="5418474_8_1768.jpg" n="2"/>who, in the name of the association, accepted the beautiful present with words of thanks and appreciation. She then turned it over to the care of the color-bearer, Mr. W. Mueller. The associations, Tue Recht und Scheue Niemand (Do what's right and fear nobody) and the United American Social and Aid Society, were in charge of the solemn ceremony of consecration. The Polyhymnia Choral Society enhanced the ceremony by singing several songs. In conclusion "My Country "Tis of Thee" was sung by all present. Besides the above-mentioned associations the Fiedlia No. 1, the Schwabish-Badische Frauenverein (Swabia-Baden Women's Association), the Hindenburg Association, the Hindenburg Association, the Carnation Aid Society, and others, were also represented. Before and after the consecration of the colors there was much dancing and hilarity.....The celebration was skillfully conducted by Mrs. Margarete Scholz, president; Mr.Edward Rentz, treasurer; Messrs. John Gross and Charles Giese, and Mrs. Franziska Ewert, treasurer, who were assisted by the subcommittees.</p>
