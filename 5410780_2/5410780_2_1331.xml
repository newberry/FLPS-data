   <p>Every Dane in Chicago, whether he is a sportsman or not, knows that Christian Christensen is the president of the Danish-American Athletic Club, and is also the organizer of this society.</p>
   <p>No doubt it will be interesting to know more about this sportsman. Ever since he organized the D. A. A. C., Christensen has made history in the world of sports here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Today he is one of the leading sportsmen in America. In the past few years he has made his specialty distance running. His distance is usually between five and ten miles; but naturally he has won many one and two mile races.</p>
   <p>In 1915 he ran about forty races, won fourteen cups, one gold watch, sixteen gold medals, five silver metals, and two bronze medals. He has also won four <pb facs="5410780_2_1332.jpg" n="2"/>world's records to date.</p>
   <p>Since 1912 his totals are: One hundred races, forty cups, about eighty gold, silver, and bronze medals.</p>
