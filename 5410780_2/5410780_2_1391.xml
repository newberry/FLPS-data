   <p>During the World War the Dania Society made itself pleasantly conspicuous by doing certain work which was definitely outside of its sphere of activity. An extensive campaign for the sale of Liberty bonds turned out to be a great success, and during the War Dania was constantly in touch with the many Danish-Americans in overseas service. In this fine work Charles Wilde, Christian Baun, and Peter C. Bjerrehus should be especially mentioned, and the Danish-American veterans who returned from the World War will never forget Dania and those conspicuous names.</p>
   <p>In connection with the War, it is with justifiable pride mingled with a sad regret that we call attention to the fact that eighty-eight Dania boys fought for democracy and the ending of all wars on the shell-torn battlefields of France, and that two of these boys never returned to their homeland, but are now resting in foreign soil among many, many thousands of others who met a similar fate. Would that this tremendous sacrifice had brought better results.</p>

   <p>The two young men who fought for that which appeared to them a great and beautiful cause, were William Bjerrehus and Harold Michelsen; their pictures, with the gold stars attached, now adorn the walls of Dania Hall among the eighty-six who returned.</p>
   <p>During the World War the Dania Young People's Society was founded. It never came up to expectations in its work within Dania, and, as had been predicted, it ceased to exist after a short, colorless life.</p>
   <p>Many great events took place in the period between 1914 to 1920. Dania arranged an evening of homage for Oda Nielsen, Johannes Herskind, Saxtorh Mikkelsen, Olaf Fonns, Niels Juul, Henry L. Hertz, Dr. Max Henius, Kristian Baun. and others.</p>
