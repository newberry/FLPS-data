   <p>The Society for the Danish Old People's Home had its meeting in Dania April 25. John W. Hertz was the chairman. Since the committee appointed by the last meeting had agreed on all the bylaws, the meeting proceeded to the election of officers.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Toft and Mrs. A. Christensen were nominated for president. Mrs. Toft was elected with sixty-one votes against Mrs. Christensen's forty-one votes. John W. Hertz and Mrs. Sophie Riter were elected first vice president and second vice president, respectively. Mrs. George Olsen and Peter J. Noer were nominated for treasurer. The former was elected with fifty-one votes against forty-seven, which made Mr. Noer very angry. Mrs. Wm. Nielsen was re-elected financial secretary, and Charles Wilde was elected secretary. Consul C. H. Hansen, Henry L. Hertz, and Mrs. P. M. Lagoni were elected for three years, two years, and one year respectively.</p>
