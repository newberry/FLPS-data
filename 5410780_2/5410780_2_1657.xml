   <p>The Danish Old People's Home Society held its annual autumn ball last Wednesday night in Wicker Park Hall, which was attended by such a large and select Danish public as we have ever seen in Chicago. All the good old standbys who never let the Home down, were there, and we also noticed many fresh additions, particularly pretty young ladies in festive attire.</p>
   <p>It seems to be the rule of this society to introduce in its program an English language number, which might well have been skipped last Wednesday without detracting from the enjoyment of the evening. On this occasion, Miss Olga Kargau, who undoubtedly is just as talented as she is pretty and charming, recited a scene from "Madame X," which she was unable to put over, partly due to the peculiar acoustic conditions in the hall. This stage is not suitable for debutantes and inexperienced amateurs, and <pb facs="5410780_2_1658.jpg" n="2"/>should be used only by seasoned, well trained actors, such as those of Dania's Dramatic Club of Racine. Their presentation of "On the 3rd Floor," a farce depicting a succession of comical misunderstandings and cases of mistaken identities, was excellent, and the self-assurance and technique with which they played their roles was a revelation to Chicago Danes, whose own dramatic art is right now going through a period of decline. Let us hope and work for an early revival; we certainly have a long way to go before we can even begin to compare with our Racine brethren in the sphere of the drama.</p>
   <p>First-class concert and dance music was furnished by Hans Schmidt's orchestra, and the buffet supper arranged by the ladies' committee was, of course, above all criticism.</p>
   <p>A memorable affair!</p>
