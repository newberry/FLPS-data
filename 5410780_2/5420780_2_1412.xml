   <p>In January 2nd last year 20,000 Danes in the United States celebrated the Golden Anniversary of the Danish Brotherhood of America. This celebration, in commemoration of it's birthday, January 2nd, 1882, designates one of the most important events in the history of Danish-Americans.</p>
   <p>The celebration extended into Canadian territory and to the shores of Denmark, for there are subsidiary lodges of the Danish Brotherhood both in Vancouver and in Copenhagen. As a matter of fact, the lodge in Copenhagen has the distinction of being one of the most important links in the fellowship chain of the organization.</p>
   <p>The Danish Brotherhood is primarily a sickness and death benefit society, but it also embraces a system of old-age pensions, and number <pb facs="5410780_2_1375.jpg" n="2"/>of other benevolent features.</p>
   <p>"The Danish Brotherhood" functions under the management of a Supreme Board of officers, elected at the national conventions. The Supreme Board has headquarters at Omaha, Neb.</p>
   <p>The organization also has several District Boards. There are elected by different groups of lodges in different districts of the country. This district division is non-compulsory and without official authority on questions of national scope. The purpose of these district boards is to promote general welfare of the order through social and fraternal cooperation. The District Boards are usually designated as "General Committees". They are elected at yearly conventions by delegates representing the lodges belonging to the district organization. At these conventions proposals for amendments to the national constitution are discussed as well as other matters which are of local importance or have particular interest <pb facs="5410780_2_1376.jpg" n="3"/>to the lodges in the district. In this way the local viewpoints are given a fair hearing and thoroughly sifted before presentation at a national convention or through referendum.</p>
   <p>In fifty years "The Danish Brotherhood" has shown a continuous healthy growth in both human and financial assets, except, of course, during the recent years of economic and industrial depression. The following comparative table of figures tells the story:</p>

   <p>As of December 31, 1932</p>
   <p>The Danish Brotherhood's official organ is issued on the first day of every month and is mailed to every member in the organization. Its <pb facs="5410780_2_1377.jpg" n="4"/>circulation is over 19,000, and it is safe to state that it is read by at least 40,000 brothers and sisters and their children. It has eight pages of well written text, both in the Danish and English languages, consisting of news items of special interest to the members. N. B. Nelson of Spokane, Wash., is editor and manager; Svend Petersen of Askov, Minn., is business manager, and H. Jacob P. Enemark of New York is advertising manager.</p>
   <p>The Eastern Brotherhood and Sisterhood Lodges have a home for aged brothers and sisters. It is situated in a very beautiful spot at Metuchen, N. J. It consists of a large building, barns and other farm buildings. It also has a large wooded lot which is used by many Danish societies for their summer picnics. Plans have been drawn for a new building which is to be several times larger than the present one. The officers of the home and the Building Committee hope to raise money enough in the near future to erect this proposed building.</p>
