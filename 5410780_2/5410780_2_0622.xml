   <p>Hendrik Ibsen's drama "Hedda Gabler" was presented last Tuesday at the intimate and stylish Little Theatre in the Fine Arts Building.</p>
   <p>What made the occasion of special interest to Scandinavians was the fact that the Norwegian-American actress Mrs. Borgny Hammer made her debut on the American English-speaking stage before an American public, in the title role.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Hammer's performance was a success, as she, from the very first scene, with a perfect mixture of strength and delicacy and with artistic understanding, portrayed Ibsen's masterly creation. Her "Hedda Gabler" ruled the stage, and when poor "Hedda's" sorrow-filled heart, in the final scene, stopped in death, Mrs. Hammer's art was victorious, in spite</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0623.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>of the fact that she had linguistic difficulties to overcome; her Norwegian accent and, at times, a too pointed pronunciation were noticeable.</p>
   <p>The Little Theatre is particularly well suited for the presentation of Ibsen's problem dramas due to its excellent stage and acoustic arrangements. The performance was worthy of the great dramatist, and was followed with intense interest by the large audience.</p>
