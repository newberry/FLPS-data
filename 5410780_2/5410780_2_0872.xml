   <p>Emanuel Johansen's play, "Den Kare Familie" (The Dear Family), will be presented twice today at Bjorgvin Hall. It is anticipated that the Hall will be crowded both at the afternoon performance at 2:15 P.M. and at the evening performance at 7 P.M.</p>
   <p>In a poetry competition held in connection with the play, sixty-eight songs have been submitted, from which a committee has made a selection; it is thus clear that the competition has been keen. The first prize is five dollars in gold, to be awarded for the poem judged best by the press; two gold medals will be awarded for the second and third best poems. The music for the various songs has been written by Mrs. gnes Mathiesen, and it is said that the melodies are bright and lively.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0873.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The cast of "Den Kare Familie" consists of about thirty actors, including our very best talent. Both the decorations and the costumes will be up to date.....</p>
   <p>In the evening "Little Nitusche" will be performed as an added attraction.</p>
