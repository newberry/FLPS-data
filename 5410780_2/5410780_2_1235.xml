   <p>The Chicago Daily News mentioned our countryman Christ Christensen in a rather glowing article a few days ago.</p>
   <p>"Christ Christensen is perhaps about equally as well - known in local athletic circles as Cameron, of the Illinois Athletic Club. For a period of many years he ran under the colors of the Danish - American Athletic Club, was its president for a time, and was mainly instrumental in bringing that organization into the public limelight as one of the leading units in amateur sports. Although this club never did have any regular headquarters with facilities for training its athletes, it made use of public parks on the Northwest Side. Christensen helped in the development of some of the greatest runners and athletes the unit has ever produced. Virtually every <pb facs="5410780_2_1236.jpg" n="2"/>time a track meet of some kind was held the Danish - American A. C. could always be counted on being well up among the leaders."</p>
