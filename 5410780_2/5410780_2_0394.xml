   <p>p.2.Col.4........On February 28, Waldemar T. Hansen one of Chicago's most prominent Danish-Americans, passed away. Mr. Hansen who was well known in business and social circles was sixty-eight years of age and is survived by art adopted daughter and two brothers, one in California and one in Denmark. His wife died while on a visit in Copenhagen in 1894 and is burried there. Mr. Hansen will be taken to Copenhagen for burial.</p>
   <p>The deceased came to America in 1864. He has held many responsible positions. He began by being a traveling salesman for ladies garments, then be became a teller. He advanced again and became a cashier in the Milwaukee Bank; then Danish Vice-Consul at Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>In the early eighties be came to Chicago where he started a real estate office. He bought and sold a great deal of Minnesota and Iowa farm lands. This venture <pb facs="5410780_2_0395.jpg" n="2"/>was so successful that he was finally considered one of the most wealthy Danes in Chicago. Mr. Hansen was a member of the Dania Lodge and of the Danish Old Peoples Home Society, To the latter organization he contributed generously.</p>
   <p>However, due to poor health, during later years he seldom attended meetings of any kind. A few years ago he even retired and returned to his mother country where he intended to live the rest of his life. He purchased a beautiful villa there with a magnificent ocean view. But a restless urge for activity drove him back to business life in Chicago again; he literally "died in the harness." Mr. Hansen's whole career is an example of the industry, patience and initiative that characterizes the Danish-American citizen of Chicago.</p>
