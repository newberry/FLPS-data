   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>How fortunate you Danes in Chicago must be, having a poet like Anton Kvist in your midst. Do you know how proud the city of Logstor is of its son Johan Skjoldborg, and Salling of Jeppe Aakjaer? Even Saeby is happy because Harold Bergstedt lives there despite his battles with the local police and liquor dealers which, however, have resulted in his books finding their way into every home of the town as do Aakjaer's and Skjoldberg's books in their respective home towns and surrounding territories. And do you remember how beloved Holger Drachman was in his native Skagen?</p>
   <p>But how is it with you Danes in this marvelous city of Chicago? Do you really appreciate the presence of your great author? Well! I don't know and would not dare to criticize, but I hope you do.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0978.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>I can hardly imagine a Dane in Chicago who appreciates spiritual value in life would fail to become the owner of Anton Kvist's collection of poems particularily if he can afford to spend the two dollars for the sake of literary beauty.</p>
   <p>While writing about Anton Kvist I should not forget to mention how happy I was to sing his wonderful Hiemlandssang with music composed by Sextus Miskow at the dedication of the "Hill of Memory" last summer. Also in America it has been a great pleasure for me to sing this song the beautiful words of which should appeal to every Danish born American. I hope that this song will be sung, not alone by all your professionals(here I think particularly of one who is gifted with real talent, namely,Laurids Christensen), but also by all Danes in their homes. I hope it will be reserved a permanent place on the piano in every home for mama and the children to play and sing when papa comes home from work tired and exhausted.</p>
   <p>It is therefore to be appreciated that, as announced by you last week, a new shipment of Hjemlandssangen has arrived from Copenhagen inasmuch as the first printing sold "like hot cakes",as we express it.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0979.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The aged composer Sextus Miscow whose works: Den Spillemand Snapped Frolen Fra Vaeg and Lille Ellen are known everywhere Danish is spoken must surely be delighted to see his composition to Hjemlandssagen be so popular both at home and abroad.</p>
   <p>But when admiring his composition, do not forget the author, Anton Kvist.</p>
   <p>Should I therefore, in closing, combine my Christmas greeting with a sincere hope for my countrymen in America I would say this: I wish that Anton Kvist's Hjemlandssang and Sextus Miskow's melody must be found under every Christmas tree in all the Danish homes where it is not already present.</p>
   <p>Merry Christmas!</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>Johannes Fonss.</p>
