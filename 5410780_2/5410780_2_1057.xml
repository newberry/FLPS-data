   <p>A revolver duel took place on Easter Day between two Danish editors, Mr. [Christian] Botker of Revyen, 2639 West North Avenue, and Mr. Edward Peterson of Chicago-Posten, 154 West Randolph Street.</p>
   <p>An article had appeared in Revyen, signed "N.P.," which made fun of a speech by Mr. Peterson. The latter demanded that Mr. Botker either reveal who N.P. was or meet him on the field of honor; he had the choice of swords or pistols.</p>
   <p>The duelists met at Riverview Park at ten o'clock in the morning. Mr. Botker's seconds were Anton Kvist and Andreas Frandsen. Mr. Peterson's seconds were Thorvald E. Sommer and Peter Pram. Two cartridges were placed in the revolvers; cotton, gauze, and surgical instruments were laid out in the grass. On the <pb facs="5410780_2_1058.jpg" n="2"/>count of three, two shots rang out; no one was hurt. The duelists smiled at each other and the whole company went to the nearest road house and drank a toast to peace and health.</p>
   <p>This episode nearly had serious consequences, as duels are forbidden in Illinois.</p>
