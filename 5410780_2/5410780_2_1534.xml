   <p>The Danish Relief has now been in existence since 1889, four years and has done very good and praiseworthy work among the needy Danes in Chicago. The Society has seventy-five paying members and figures to have an annual income of $500.00, but that amount is by far too small to meet the year's expenses. In various ways the officers have tried to make both ends meet, and so far they have succeeded. In the four years that the Society has been in existence it has helped five hundred and twenty-eight people at a cost of $3,160.44, while the income has been $3,436.43. The Society's cash balance is $300.00. But the winter is coming and it looks long and cold to the poor. The officers, therefore, have arranged an entertainment on Thanksgiving Day in Scandia Hall.</p>
