   <p>(The Chicago Daily News, America's foremost evening paper, published on September 22 and September 28 several articles on surtaxes and incomes which, whether or not one agrees with the author as to their practicability, seem to constitute a well-planned, and convincingly presented plan to help solve present-day problems.)</p>
   <p>by</p>
   <p>K. B.</p>
   <p>I</p>
   <p>Mr. Lewis A. Garman, chairman of the revenue subcommittee of the Illinois Constitutional Convention, says in an article in the Daily News of August 1 the following about the proposed new revenue article:</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0161.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"It has been the practice of governments to graduate the income tax: the federal government does; all the states imposing such a tax do; this state does in its inheritance tax. The graduation here is very conservative. It is justified by the principle that such a tax may be imposed in such a way and at such varied rates as, within reason, to cause the least amount of hardship. One who has an income of ten thousand dollars can pay a tax of three hundred dollars more easily than can one who has an income of one thousand dollars pay a tax of ten dollars. Usually the former would simply have the amount of his surplus reduced, while the latter may be deprived of the necessities of life."</p>
   <p>Now, will it not be just as true that one with an income of one hundred thousand dollars can pay a tax of nine thousand dollars more easily than can one with an income of ten thousand dollars pay a tax of three hundred? The former would still have ninety-one thousand dollars for living expenses and investment, while the latter will have only nine thousand seven hundred dollars.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0162.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>However, such a progressive tax, when carried out to the extreme, would, at times, reach one hundred per cent of a persons income, and would thus become so manifestly absured and unjust to persons with large incomes that its adoption would be out of the question.</p>
   <p>But the problem could be justly and equitably solved with a surtax of a fraction of one per cent on each one thousand dollars of an income over a certain tax-exempt limit. If this limit is set at three thousand dollars, and the surtax on each additional thousand is fixed at one-fourth of one per cent, according to simple differential calculus, it would be as follows: $4,000, at ¼%, $2.50; $5,000, at ½%, $7.50; $6,000 at 3/4%, $15; $7,000, at 1%, $25; $8,000, at 1¼%, $37.50; and $403,000, at 100%, $200,500.</p>
   <p>If the tax on an income of $403,000 was $200,500, this would leave the taxpayer $202,500 net, and since the surtax had reached 100%, no larger amount could be retained by any taxpayer.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0163.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>If found reasonable, the surtax might be reduced to, say, one-eighth of one per-cent, in which case the 100% tax would be reached on an income of $803,000, making the tax-total $400,500, and leaving the taxpayer $402,500. Of course, all tax-exempt securities should be taxed in order to allow such a tax measure to work equitably.</p>
   <p>The one hundred per cent surtax might not be called a moderate tax, or even a compromise, but still some such step may be needed to alleviate present conditions and to ward off widespread discontent and tendencies toward revolution. In the first place, this tax would check the accumulation of enormous fortunes and the growth of the leisure class, now sponging upon, and always craving a huge tribute from, the workers and producers in the city and country. Not handicapping an individual's initiative or enterprise--at least not up to the point now reached by only very few people--such a tax would save the best features of the present system, and might be destined to establish the golden rule between rampant capitalism and visionary schemes of socialism and communism now nursed by many people having but little understanding of either <pb facs="5410780_2_0164.jpg" n="5"/>economics or human nature.</p>
   <p>By adopting the one hundred per cent surtax, as would be proper, the national government might distribute part of the proceeds, proportionately, to the respective states and municipalities, so that very few, if any, local taxes would be necessary.</p>
   <p>Danish Times, Oct. 20, 1922.</p>
   <p>One of the main features of the present economic system is that every dollar, properly invested, will always earn from four to eight per cent interest annually, and, to that extent, will be passed on to the present and future generations. To be sure, not every dollar is properly invested and many fortunes are squandered, but, in the main, the system tends to create enormous fortunes and a class of people who, as bond holders and shareholders, exact a <pb facs="5410780_2_0165.jpg" n="6"/>certain evergrowing tribute from the real workers and producers in city and country.</p>
   <p>The farmer not only pays interest on the actual mortgage on his farm, but also, indirectly, pays part of the dividends to holders of securities in transportation companies, mills, warehouses, and industries that supply all his necessities. The workingman pays interest on his mortgaged house, or if a tenant, pays rent to the landlord, besides helping to pay interest on dividends on capital invested in his employer's business, as well as in commerce generally; so does every other home-owner and consumer. In other words, capital exacts a certain return from all useful activity and production, and part of this tribute is reinvested and exacts new tribute.</p>
   <p>In this manner the civilized world is gradually becoming so encumbered with debt to capital internationally, nationally, and individually that finally a situation will be reached, as we are now witnessing in Europe, where the apparent economic breakdown is considered the underlying cause the late War, rather than <pb facs="5410780_2_0166.jpg" n="7"/>its consequence. If this were not so, the War's economic damage could have been repaired in less time than the Peace Conference lasted. Young America, with its still enormous natural resources, may be a long way from the European abyss, but it is undoubtedly traveling in that direction and will travel faster, the worse conditions become in Europe, even if we do have spasmodic periods of relative prosperity.</p>
   <p>The one reform needed is a measure that will benefit all workers and every useful effort by restricting the tribute to capital, without, however, abolishing capital's fundamental position or hindering private initiative or enterprise. Such a measure is the surtax graduate to one hundred per cent, which would prevent the accumulation of colossal fortunes and check the growth of the non-producing leisure class by returning part of capital's present huge income to the public treasuries for the benefit of society in general.</p>
   <p>As capitalism obviously has become top-heavy, every country shows a more or less clearly defined tendency, which the great War has prevented, to enforce a wider <pb facs="5410780_2_0167.jpg" n="8"/>distribution of wealth through, either a limited graduated income tax, or the still more efficient surtax.</p>
