   <p>At the meeting of the Danish National Committee, held last Monday night, the subject of finances was brought up for discussion. The profit from our annual festival appeared to be $2,456.01. From this sum, $1,000 was donated to the Aid and Relief Fund, $300 to the Danish Old People's Home, and $500 to the Danish Children's Home. The remaining $456.01 were added to the Guarantee Fund, which now amounts to $1,863.</p>
   <p>The National Committee sponsored a collection for the benefit of the suffering inhabitants of the flooded districts in Southern Illinois; $628.50 was collected and turned over to Mayor Dever's Flood Relief Fund.</p>
   <p>The Danish National Committee's Aid and Relief Fund, which was organized for the benefit of Danish people in need, spent a total of $2,076.15 during the last year. It has a balance of $3,403 on hand, besides the <pb facs="5410780_2_1741.jpg" n="2"/>thousand dollars donated annually by the National Committee; but the calls for help seem to increase in number.</p>
   <p>The annual Bazaar made a net profit of $2,984.44, and the film enterprise $669.10. From the Danish (Workmen's) Singing Society's "Review" (theatrical affairs) the Aid and Relief Fund received $531.85. In addition the Fund received donations from the Ansgar Church Ladies' Society, through Mrs. Louis Hanson, Jens Larsen and Mrs. Mogensen.</p>
   <p>The National Committee agreed to sponsor the Joh. Fons concert in Orchestra Hall, and to aid it to the best of their ability. With this in view, a special committee was appointed, consisting of John Smith, 4208 Armitage Avenue; Mrs. Johanne Nielsen, 1339 Winnemac Avenue; Mrs. Marie Sanze, 2464 Armitage Avenue; Mrs. L. Eriksen, 1521 North California Avenue; and Mrs. Charlotte Mogensen, 2235 Lawler Avenue. All members of the committee will sell tickets for the concert.</p>

   <p>Members recently elected to the national Committee for next year, will meet next Monday, November 2.</p>
