   <p>A Dane in Chicago, Mr. Axel Larsen, who makes his living as a cigar manufacturer, has recently made his mark in the world of Science by discovering a simple method of photographing lightning, and thus establishing certain scientific facts hitherto unknown. Mr. Larsen has only a grammar school education acquired in a country school in Denmark and later supplemented by evening school in Chicago.</p>
   <p>He has however, been studying physics and chemistry privately for a long time; particularly these last three years since discovering the possibility of photographing a lightning flash simply by moving the camera in the opposite direction of it and crosswise. The negative thus obtained appeared so interesting to him that he decided to send it to the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. From that Organization he modestly inquired whether or not scientists there would consider it of any value. As a reply Mr. Larsen received almost immediately a scholarship from the Institute which enabled him to continue his experiments and to get expert assistants who were well able to help him in the construction of a camera suitable for that particular purpose. Recently the Smithsonian Institute, under auspices of the government, has issued <pb facs="5410780_2_0293.jpg" n="2"/>a publication containing information about Mr. Larsen's experiments. The publication is edited by Mr. Larsen himself. In it he states that a lightning flash is not a single unit as has been thought hitherto and as it also appears to the onlooker. It consists of a number of more or less parallel flashes. A number of new and interesting facts about lightning phenomena are accounted for in this publication. Mr. Larsen's discoveries are of importance only from the standpoint of science, of course, and are measured in so infinitesimal terms as a two-thousandth of a second. Besides his experiments with lightning photographing Mr. Larsen has among other things in physics also invented a primitive barometer which is well known in the world of science and called the Larsen Barometer.</p>
   <p>Backed by the Smithsonian Instituted and the United States National Museum, he has studied the contents of the atmosphere and made interesting discoveries pertaining to air substances (gas) and light-waves radiating from certain mineral and chemical matters. At present he is occupied with the idea of photographing electric sparks and X-Rays etc. according to principles established by himself.</p>
   <p>Mr. Axel Larsen is a brother to our well-known society leader, Mr. L. Bendix Larsen, president of the Singing Society Magneten (The Magnet). Mr. Larsen went to Denmark a couple of weeks ago where he will enjoy a vacation.</p>
