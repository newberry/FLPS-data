   <p>Carl Bush, Danish-born composer and conductor of Kansas City, has closed his engagement for this season as instructor in musical theory in the Chicago Musical College's summer term, an institution regarded as one of the largest and best of its kind in the United States.</p>
   <p>In the above-mentioned institution's yearbook of 1925 we find a biography of Carl Busch; and the following is an excerpt indicating the standing which he has in the American musical world:</p>
   <p>"It is with great satisfaction that the Chicago Musical College is able to announce the connection of Carl Busch with our staff of teachers. Carl Busch's musical production has been manifold and significant. His compositions, including numerous choral songs, are known and listened to by the greatest audiences in America as well as in Europe. 'The Indian Rhapsody' by Carl Busch, was part of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra's regular program during the last season.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0477.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Carl Busch is exceptional in the fact that his musical creative ability seems to be combined with the gift of communicating his knowledge to others. As a composer this distinguished master of music won fame long ago, and as a teacher his success is undeniable. Carl Busch's contribution to the musical world may be compared to that of Jens Jensen to the art of landscaping. Both are in the first rank where Danish art and culture are known and honored in the United States."</p>
