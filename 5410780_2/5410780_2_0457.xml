   <p>Seventy-seven illustrations, two perspectives and seven plans are found in the book, "A Greater West Park System, " and published by the West Chicago Park Commissioners, after the plans of the Danish landscape architect, Jens Jensen.</p>
   <p>The periodical, "Park and Recreation," writes the following: Jens Jensen is a true poet. He writes his poetry on the landscape, making nature's creative impulses visible. That is the function and the proof of the true artist.</p>
   <p>But as Jens Jensen dresses the hills, dales, and the river banks, as nature would like to see him do it, so does he also dress his thoughts. "Gardens," says he, "create a love for the soil in the minds of the children that will develop into a desire for better, cleaner, and healthier homes in the mind <pb facs="5410780_2_0458.jpg" n="2"/>of the adult. They appeal to the fine feelings of mankind, and elevate the depressed in soul and mind to a higher place in the human family, and to a greater appreciation of the responsibilities of free born men and women. When the psychological conditions of a race, through the influence of environment, reach a point where this influence develops into consciousness and thus can be understood by the human mind, new and different thoughts and ideas are born, and the race, as a whole, raises its standards of civilization accordingly."</p>
