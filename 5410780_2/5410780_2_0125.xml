   <p>It seems curious that the Danish Times, with offices so near Humboldt Park, knows so little about the demonstration that took place only a couple of blocks away from their office. The Danish Times gave a very garbled report which was subversive and lying.</p>
   <p>Who was it that demonstrated at Humboldt Park? It was the unemployed and starving people living near the park. There were a few who are party members, but the majority does not belong to any kind of organization.</p>
   <p>Why did the unemployed demonstrate? As a protest against the rotten food the Emerson Relief Station was distributing among relief recipients.</p>
   <p>Who started the Riots? The Police Department, which first stopped a peaceful demonstration and then chased the people through the streets as if they were animals, clubbing as many as they could.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0126.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Who was it that objected to being chased like dogs? Not the screaming Jewish women, but militant Danish and Norwegian workers who would not let the police club them without defending themselves.</p>
   <p>Who asked for money from the Police? No one would be that childish, but the demands were that fresh, not rotten, food be distributed.</p>
   <p>Who wanted to smash windows in the stores on North Avenue? No one. The only object was to demonstrate in front of the Relief Station at Humboldt Park. The demonstrators had no axe to grind with North Avenue's business men. We wonder who it was that wanted to smash windows, so that the business men would become antagonistic toward the workers.</p>
   <p>What did the unemployed gain by the demonstration? No more rotten surplus, but certificates that could be used in any food store, so that the unemployed can buy what they want.</p>

   <p>The readers of the Danish Times object to false propaganda.</p>
