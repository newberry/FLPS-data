   <p>A painting portraying the discovery of America by Leif Ericson has been donated to the Jefferson Park Field House by Olaf Ray. The painting is by Emil Bjorn.</p>
   <p>We print a quotation from the lecture by Olaf Ray. "In the year 449 the two brothers Hengist and Horsa, Jutish Vikings from Jutland, Denmark, with a large following of Jutes, landed at Ebbsfleet, England, about sixty miles east of London. In 455 the Jutes defeated the Britons at Aylesford, about twenty miles southeast of London. Horsa was killed in the battle, but the establishment of the Jutish Kingdom of Kent resulted from the victory.</p>
   <p>"Ireland was discovered in 870, Greenland in 981. After that Leif the Lapp discovered America in the year 1000. Three years later, an expedition set out under the leadership of Thorfinn Karlsefni, whose son Snorre was <pb facs="5410780_2_0564.jpg" n="2"/>the first white child born in America.</p>
   <p>"There is no doubt the records of the Norsemen were known to Columbus, because 'Columbus because 'Columbus visited Iceland in February, 1477.' He must have paid his respects to the officials of the church as a student of geography. Some time after his return and report, his royal patrons promoted him to admiral The contemporary pope, monks, and clergy had complete knowledge and records of both of the Greenland settlements and of the existence of Vineland as a component part of the bishopric of Greenland. It must be assumed that Columbus made inquiries of those most likely to know about the possibilities of his contemplated venture.</p>
   <p>"Gunpowder had just been brought to Europe by the Moors and firearms invented, so Columbus had a great advantage over the bow and arrow of the days of Leif Ericson.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0565.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"There cannot be two original discoveries of anything. To Leif and the Greenland settlers belongs the discovery and to Columbus the occupation and permanent settlement of America.</p>
