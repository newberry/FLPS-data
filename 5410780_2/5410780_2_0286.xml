   <p>Ludvig Hektoen, of Chicago, a Norwegian physician, informs us in an article published by Lutheraneren (The Luthern) that in 1892 the Scandinavian Medical Society of Chicago unanimously adopted a resolution of which we quote parts as follows;</p>
   <p>"The Scandinavian Medical Society has repeatedly discussed at its meetings the possibility of how to stop a disgraceful practice of which, we regretfully admit, nearly all Scandinavian papers over here have taken advantage - namely that of inserting misleading advertisements paid for by quacks and crooks thus spreading false propaganda among an unsuspecting public by promising to restore health, though these charlatans know in advance that they are unable to do so. As a rule the quack will appeal very strongly to sick persons coming to him in response to the ad, urging them to use this or that particular <pb facs="5410780_2_0287.jpg" n="2"/>remedy which he sells and which, so he maintains will not fail to have the desired effect. He will extend his appeal to the friends of the unfortunate patient to take up a collection for his benefit. They will contribute in good faith and with confidence in the integrity of their paper. The whole scheme is sheer humbug, sponsored not alone through advertising, but through recommendations with more or less editorial backing. The papers think they can afford such practice because these advertisements pay much higher rates than others. It is therefore extremely difficult to stop this illegal traffic. Through all these years there has been in existence a virtual conspiracy between these swindlers and the papers, a deliberate attempt to exploit an unsuspecting public through false and misleading advertising. Partly as an organization and also through its individual members the Scandinavian Medical Society has approached several papers in order to try to induce them to put an end to this nuisance; but it has been all in rain because in many instances the papers actually depend upon these swindlers for existence. Editors claim they are not responsible for what is being advertised, <pb facs="5410780_2_0288.jpg" n="3"/>which attitude leaves the public exposed to a well organized system of exploitation. The whole matter is a black mark against the Scandinavian press and against the integrity of people who lay claim to the honor of being regarded as respectable citizens of our community."</p>
   <p>Continues Dr. Hektoen: "Ever since that time nothing has happened that can serve to change my opinion as to the damaging effect of such advertising. At that time we were not aware of how great an amount of alcohol these "famous remedies" contained; otherwise we would have called attention to that danger also. In my opinion the most important point in the resolution should have been to condemn one particular type of these advertisements, namely those that appeal especially to men and have caused young men unnesessary suffering and loss of money. It would be a blessing for the young generation if parents would prevent papers carrying that kind of advertisements from entering their homes. For one thing they deal with abhorrent subjects which respectable people do not want their children to be interested in, furthermore, <pb facs="5410780_2_0289.jpg" n="4"/>these subjects are presented in such debauching language as is commonly used by "specialists for men." And yet it is the "family paper," which oftentimes brings that kind of literature into the homes. When young men read the deliberately misleading ads edited by the infamous specialists for men they begin to brood over imaginary diseases and, on order to get relief, they will sooner or later consult the "specialist" whose object is to lead his patients from bad to worse. When I think of this aspect of the problem, and of the fact that this damnable traffic is objectionable to all decent citizens, I feel we are justified in saying that quack advertising is a stain on the Scandinavian press."</p>
   <p>"Recently we have made progress in our fight against this illegitimate practice and various forces have been coordinated to that effect; nevertheless, the evil is far from having been rooted out. In certain places it is flourishing worse than ever. I am informed that such advertising has long been prohibited in Norway."</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0290.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Parents, teachers and ministers are jointly responsible for the protection of the young generation; they should be aware of the demoralizing effect of such advertising and should exclude from their houses papers which are carrying it."</p>
   <p>Commenting on Dr. Hektoen's article Lutheraneren writes in an editorial;</p>
   <p>"The subject Dr. Hektoen deals with this time is the worse kind of swindle from the point of view of honest advertising. It is the kind that is aimed at young men. Fortunately there are but a few Norwegian papers carrying such advertising. There are some, however, and we agree with Dr. Hektoen that the matter is a stain on the Scandinavian press of America. A more abominable traffic than that of destroying the morals and character of youth can hardly be imagined. The papers guilty of such crime should be banned from the homes."</p>
   <p>"Speaking on the subject of advertising, we think that the kind of advertising which promises gold and green pastures to those investing money in mining enterprises should also be put on the black list. Such enterprises are often <pb facs="5410780_2_0291.jpg" n="6"/>organized for speculative purposes with a tendency to end in sheer humbug, not differing much from the other kind in character."</p>
   <p>During its meeting of June 13, the Scandinavian Medical Society adopted a new resolution concerning the above subject and announced its determination to continue the fight against illegitimate, false and misleading advertising carried on by the Scandinavian American press, The Danish Pioneer in particular.</p>
