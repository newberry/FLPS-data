   <p>Denmark Lodge No. 908 of the Odd Fellow Order observed the 10th anniversary of its founding last Saturday with a festive gathering in Walhalla Hall. The large attendance testified to the steady progress this lodge has made, particularly during the last few years.</p>
   <p>Noble Grand Christensen delivered the welcoming speech and appointed Carl W. Larson toastmaster; he had quite a job keeping track of all the speakers.</p>
   <p>The Danish author and poet, L. C. Nielsen, who is in America on a lecture tour, was present as a special guest, and was heartily feted by his Chicago countrymen.</p>
   <p>Between speeches, M. Henningsen entertained the guests by showing and <pb facs="5410780_2_1412.jpg" n="2"/>explaining some of Dr. Henius' famous lantern slides; a team of folk dancers demonstrated a number of old Danish dances, and finally a few lodge members, dressed in the uniform of the old Guard Corps, with bearskin caps and all other accessories, marched around the dining room, led by a drummer, beating his drum. They were wildly applauded.</p>
   <p>A fine printed program had been prepared for the occasion, containing a brief summary of the history of the lodge and pictures of its founders.</p>
