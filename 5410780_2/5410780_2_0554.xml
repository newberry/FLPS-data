   <p>"We Stand by Uncle Sam, A Million Boys in Blue" is a new war song written by John Volk and published by A. E. Johnson and Volk. In the east it made a hit at once, and deservedly so. The text is spirited and in harmony with the buoyant Danish air that will lighten the weary marches for our boys in blue as it has ever quickened the steps of the Danish soldiers since 1848, when it burst upon the Danish army as a sudden revelation of the reawakened enthusiasm and rising national spirit of the people. The tune is a favorite, not only with the Danes, but also with Norwegians and Swedes, and as our Scandinavian citizens are well represented in most of our camps the familiar refrain will be take up by them and thus catch the ear of the army. That is all that is necessary to insure its popularity. The quick-step stanzas of the text compare favorably with other war songs of the day, and the striking air is in keeping with our national temperament and high-spirited and optimistic character of the present war.</p>

   <p>Here in Chicago the Skandinavians are shouting this song at the tops of their voices.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: This song was written by a Dane by the name of Volk, who at that time resided in Chicago. A. E. Johnson lived here at that time also.]</p>
