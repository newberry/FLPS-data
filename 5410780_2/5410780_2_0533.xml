   <p>p.4.col.3.... The festival of the Danish Old Peoples Home Society at Wicker Park Hall on Wednesday drew its customary full house. The announcement, by Henry L. Hertz, giving the details of the controversy with Mrs. Rosenberg, made the audience disgusted with that lady's ego and it is safe to say that she has eliminated herself as our entertainer in and around Chicago.</p>
   <p>However, Mr. Saxtorph-Mikkelsen endeared himself to the Danish colony by appearing as a substitute for Madam "Big I". Not only did the gentlemen please his audience, he fascinated them with his art and personality and when it was announced that he had volunteered his services without pay he earned</p>
   <p>for himself a position in the love and respect of his countrymen that few have ever dreamed of attaining. Lunch and dancing to music by Schmidt's orchestra followed the program.</p>
