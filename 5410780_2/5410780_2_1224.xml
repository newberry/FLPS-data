   <p>The famous Danish journalist and author, Jacob A. Riis, gave a lecture in Dania, December 2. He was introduced by Louis Henius, president of the entertainment committee. Mr. Riis spoke about his visit to the king of Denmark, and how he got his father, the old physician, the cross and decoration of the Danish order, Ridder of Dannebrog.</p>
   <p>Jacob Riis, who was a carpenter by trade, came to Chicago right after the Great Fire, and he got a job here as salesman of flatirons. A relative and old friend of his, John M. Petersen, who is now a druggist on Fullerton Avenue, was his assistant, and they sold many of these irons. Later Riis went to New York, where he started out as a newspaperman on a paper in Brooklyn. He then worked on the New York Tribune, and finally was police reporter on the New York Sun. Soon he started to help the poor in the great slums of New York. He is the author of such well-known books as How the Other Half Lives, The Children of the Poor, A. Ten Years' War.</p>
