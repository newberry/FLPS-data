   <p>December 17, 1898, was a great day for the Danes on the South Side, for on that evening Walhalla Hall, at the corner of Wentworth Avenue and 37th Street, was dedicated. It is a three-story building on a lot 50 by 150 feet. It has a great hall with a gallery, a smaller hall, a reading room, and a bar. The cost of the building is $35,000, of which $20,000 has been paid out. Walhalla Society was started March 17, 1883, and now has 450 members. For several years it has been the biggest Danish society in Chicago.</p>
   <p>One thousand were present at the dedication. P. Herlov, president, was chairman. O. H. Postle, architect, handed the building over to A. Olsen, chairman of the building committee. Claus Petersen gave a short sketch of the history of the Society. Niels Juul spoke on "The Danes in America".</p>
