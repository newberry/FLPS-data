   <p>"Please remember that Germany is not only fighting her own battle against Russia, but she is also fighting the battle of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and civilization. If Russia defeats Germany, it is only a matter of time when the Russian Bear will occupy Norway, Sweden, and possibly Denmark. Give your moral, financial, intellectual support to Germany and civilization, Fight against Russia, the Knout, Siberia, and darkness.</p>
   <p>"The English people, for mercenary reasons, will dig a grave for their future children, if they assist Russia and the Slavic races to defeat <pb facs="5410780_2_0084.jpg" n="2"/>Germany and civilization" (Adv).</p>
   <p>The above advertisement is copied from the Aug. 16, Sunday edition of Skandinave, where it has been inserted presumably by someone who feels that such an appeal is needed.</p>
   <p>The appeal will be in vain, we know, if meant to solicit good will for Germany in the bloody war just started by the Kaiser or by others. Most of the Scandinavians sympathize with the German people, but not with the Kaiser and his iron rule of reaction and militarism, under which the nation has groaned for years, and which, being more or less copied by other rulers, has been a menace to peace, constantly pointing to the <pb facs="5410780_2_0085.jpg" n="3"/>terrible carnage now going on.</p>
   <p>If Germany has advanced in civilization, in material and spiritual power, this has been achieved in spite of the "war lord" rule which at the same time has reduced economical levels to the point of dog meat on the bill of fare of the poorer classes. And no doubt, if the Kaiser triumphs in the war, his menacing system will be continued still more mercilessly and the diet for the mass of the people will be reduced perhaps to the Chinese collie's standard of rice and rats.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, if the Kaiser's great war plans should miscarry, he would most probably lose his job of Kaisering in a hurry and there might be chance for a new era of social and economic reform, for real Teutonic civilization.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0086.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>As we have said before, we hope this will be accomplished without too great sacrifice of life and property for the good German people that now, more or less against their will, have been driven to this dreadful manslaughter.</p>
   <p>And so, if real civilization, freedom, brotherhood, and justice triumphs, the great German nation will stand stronger than ever and need not fear any danger or darkness from Slavic or any other people.</p>
