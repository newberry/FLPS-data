   <p>p.4.col.3......Antonius Holm, eighty-three, died of a heart attack in his home on Tuesday Feb. 16. During the day he had been out on several errands and upon his return settled himself to enjoy a little reading. A few minutes later he collapsed and passed away before a doctor could reach him.</p>
   <p>Mr. Holm was a veteran of the Danish-German War, serving as Sergeant-major 1848-50, afterwards he became a Master sheet-metal worker in Fredericia, Denmark. He came to Chicago in 1869, working for a number of years in his son-in-law's factory.</p>
   <p>A few days before his death he had received the annual payment of 100 crowns awarded veterans of the first Danish-German War, as an honorary stipend.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0397.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Being well known in church social circles and loved by all who knew the kindly old veteran, his funeral was attended by many, both at the home service and at Mt. Olive where the interment took place.</p>
   <p>He will be sadly missed by Mrs. Holm and their eight children who survive him; as well as many friends both in Chicago and in the old country.</p>
