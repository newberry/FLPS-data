   <p>The Danish football club Thor, which is now beginning to prepare for spring training, is inviting all Danes interested in sport to a meeting in Humboldt Hall next Monday at 8 P. M. for the purpose of increasing its membership and the popular interest in the club.</p>
   <p>Thor was established in 1912 and has now thirty members. It wound up last season in third place in the Chicago Soccer Football League, which Thor was instrumental in organizing, and which comprises twelve clubs with an aggregate active membership of 300. In this league, games are played according to rules prevailing in Denmark.</p>
   <p>The jeweler firm Olson &amp; Lebann has donated a 22-inch-high silver cup for which the league members will compete.</p>
   <p>During the last week of March, the Chicago Athletic Club will arrange a <pb facs="5410780_2_1256.jpg" n="2"/>great sports meet in the Coliseum, during which a team picked from Thor, the Norwegian Club Fram, and the Swedish Sparta will play a team selected from the nine other clubs of the league. The game will take place on March 27.</p>
