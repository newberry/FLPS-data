   <p>We can not speak too highly of the concert given by organist Dupont-Hansen's pupils last Saturday.</p>
   <p>The charming young ladies performed without any visible nervousness, and with great artistic understanding and self-assurance.</p>
   <p>If we should mention any outstanding performance, it would be that of Miss Mary Storgaard, who with excellent technique played Beethoven's quite difficult "Adagio and Ronda" from "Sonate Pathetique." Miss Margaret Nialsen played Schubert's "Impromptu" beautifully, and Leslie Baggessen did Very well with Mendelsohn's pompous "March Funebre, and also with "Consolation."</p>
   <p>Added to the enjoyment of the concert, and a real artistic treat, was the <pb facs="5410780_2_0276.jpg" n="2"/>pleasure of wearing Mrs. Bartholsy Daum's well trained soprano in a couple of songs by Brahms and Gounod, and also her rendition of Mr. Dupent-Hansen's own wonderful little composition, "Ashes of koses," which she sing with great foiling.</p>
   <p>The concert gave ample evidence of the able instruction the pupils are receiving, and further strengthened Mr. Pupont-Hansen's reputation as a music teacher.</p>
