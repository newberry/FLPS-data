   <p>The meeting for the Society for the Danish Old People's Home at Dania on April 10 was very lively. Mrs. Toft, the president, made the welcoming speech and appointed John W. Hertz the chairman of the evening. The opposition protested, but without any result. He showed himself to be fair and square.</p>
   <p>The fight of the evening was between the proposal of the majority and that of the minority. The majority wanted a board of seventy-two members that was to elect the president and the rest of the officers of the Society. The minority, led by Chas. Wilde, L. N. Schmidt, Wald. Bauer, Chas. Ryberg, and Westengaard, did not want a little group of members to control the whole Society; the minority therefore wanted the board and the president elected by the Society in pleno. The proposal of the majority was brought before the meeting by Mrs. Toft and Dr. Max Henius. The result was a compromise, proposed by John W. Hertz: a board of twenty-seven members, which was to include the president and the rest of the officers, all to be elected by the Society in an open meeting.</p>
