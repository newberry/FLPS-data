   <p>A well-known national weekly with a penchant for the new and misty kind of "liberal" socialism recently advocated old-age pensions, and now comes out in favor of subsidized unemployment insurance. The following is a quotation:</p>
   <p>"The next great field for insurance is to provide protection against unemployment. At the recent conference of state executives, Governor Franklin Roosevelt of New York came out in favor of unemployment insurance to be provided through contributions from employers, employees, and the public treasury.</p>
   <p>A few years ago, this would have been considered a radical idea in the United <pb facs="5410780_2_0149.jpg" n="2"/>States. Such suggestions were termed socialistic. Just why that term was employed is not precisely clear since unemployment insurance was first developed in Germany during the days of Bismarck, and in Great Britain in the days of Lloyd George, both arch enemies of organized socialism. A sound movement cannot, however, be stopped by an epithet, and it is fairly certain that at no very distant day unemployment insurance will be firmly established in this country. Already, pioneer experiments have been made in a few industries and by a few far sighted corporations".</p>
   <p>To the average person, if not to all erudite writers of editorial buncombe, it is a plain fact that "organized socialism" has its more or less masked dangerous, twin brother of "state socialism" installed from above by officialdom and demagoguery as benevolent experimentation, or because of bureaucratic <pb facs="5410780_2_0150.jpg" n="3"/>urges for increased power and opportunity, or, again, as an attempt to checkmate organized or party socialism, although the ultimate effects of the one kind of socialism are hardly different from, or less, calamitous than the other. State socialism was exactly what Bismarck propagated in Germany with unemployment insurance and other measures intended to parry the offerings of Bebel and company, and what Lloyd George (for the present, by the way, succoring the so-called arch enemy) has helped along in Britain. This ought to make it precisely clear why unemployment insurance in the United States, if partly or wholly financed by the public treasury, is rightfully termed "socialistic", as are other paternalistic blessings which we have already or may expect to have if the liberals who are most liberal with the taxpayer's money shall have their way.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0151.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>That already pioneer experiments have been made in a few industries and a few farsighted corporations, is fully true, and commendable, but such steps have been accomplished without raids on the public treasury, and so has every other kind of insurance enumerated by our national weekly as arguments for unemployment dole!</p>
