   <p>At a meeting held April 28, 1920, at Harmonien's Hall, it was decided to discontinue the united choral practice with Dansk Arbejder Sangforeningen (the Danish Workingmen's Singing Society) and Magnetan. In this united chorus, which had been in existence since August, 1909, Harmonien had twenty singers. The reason for Harmonien's decision to terminate the arrangement was the fact that at this time it was contemplating a trip to Denmark with its own chorus, and felt that it would have more freedom if it were not associated with the other singing societies.</p>
   <p>One result of this split was a great deal of fighting in the Danish-American press. The practical result, however, was that Dansk Arbejder Sangforeningen bought its own building, and that Magneten, in February, 1920 [sic], joined with this singing society. Before long Harmonien, also, took under serious consideration the purchase of its own building, a step which it took some years later.</p>
