   <p>p. 4.. Last Sunday the Norwegian Theater offered its patrons a very pleasant evening. Mr. Hammer played his role excellently and Mrs. Borgny Hammer was charming as the niece, and happy, newlywed matron. Her love for her distinguished, scholarly husband, as well as her sympathetic consideration for the old, lonesome uncle in "Sunset" was genuine.</p>
   <p>She twittered beautifully in "Fritz and Lise" and looked lovely in the national costume. Mr. Hammer was a regular Don Juan, and he must have thought so himself, since he later on appeared in an aria of "Martha" in the same costume. Mr. Hjalmar Clausen in "Sunset" would have been better if he had spoken a little louder, particularly in those scenes where he tells of his disappointments and his wasted life; after all, he should not keep it secret to his audience.</p>
