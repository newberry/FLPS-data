   <p>J. Christian Bay, of our book section. He came to America, in about 1900; later he became a teacher at the Ashland College, under Kristian Baun, the principal. Later Baun, through correspondence with Jacob A. Riis, secured Bay an appointment to the Library of Congress, which he held for some time. At the present time he is assistant Librarian of the John Crerar Library.</p>
