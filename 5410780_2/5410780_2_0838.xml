   <p>The United Scandinavian Singers of America was started by a businessman in Philadelphia, Mr. C. M. Machold. Five societies met in New York City May 16, 1886, and formed the union. Its aim was to unite all Scandinavian singers at great festivals, to bring Scandinavian composers and their work to the attention of the American public, and, finally, to show America the culture of the Scandinavians, and especially their musical and vocal gifts.</p>
   <p>The first festival was held in Philadelphia, in 1887. One hundred and twenty singers took part. In 1889 they met in Chicago, where twenty-four societies, and six hundred singers, participated. The festival of 1891 was in Minneapolis. Fifty societies, and one thousand singers, participated. [Translator's note: The splendid union broke up in about 1905, when the patriotic feelings of the Swedes and Norwegians were aroused by Norway's electing its own king, a Danish prince, after Norway and Sweden had been united since 1814. King Oscar II of <pb facs="5410780_2_0839.jpg" n="2"/>Sweden refused to send his army against the Norwegian nation.]</p>
