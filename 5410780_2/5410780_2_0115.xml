   <p>In dilating upon the Wirt episode, the Daily News, Washington dopester Paul Mallon, seems inclined to agree with average young radicals in whose estimation the Gary educator is a rather naive, obscure person, in no way equal to brilliant brain trusters. It does not matter, of course, that presumably each and everyone of these were unable to earn much more than one-tenth of the salary Dr. Wirt receives and earns. Naturally, when marshalled into the administration for the purpose of devising new deal ways and means, their recompense underwent a magic rise, but even then it is no more than a fraction of what the lowly Gary pedagogue collects in a free market.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mallon submits that Dr. Wirt is behind time because the Roosevelt revolution is about over. What then, about the Roosevelt sanctioned stock market bill that would thwart and partly kill not only the stock market, but every <pb facs="5410780_2_0116.jpg" n="2"/>business whose shares are listed, if this has not been accomplished already by the securities act, stamped by the U. S. Chamber of Commerce as in all respects a harmful and useless piece of legislation? What about the Wagner bill that would strait jacket employers and create untouchable nonunion labor caste? What about unemployment insurance by was of a new heavy tax upon already overtaxed business? What about the officially endorsed regimentation and socialization of agriculture, industry and finance in general, and particularly in the communication and utility field? And what about the tragic air mail mess, the initial stages of which under ordinary parlimentary rules, would have called for a quick change of administration, but here is stubbornly adhered to and augmented at irreparable loss of life and business?</p>
   <p>Mr. Mallon doubts if Dr. Wirt could get any two brain trusters to agree on any method of procedure about anything. Perhaps so just as to methods of procedure, but so far, all the administration brain trusters seem as one in <pb facs="5410780_2_0117.jpg" n="3"/>aiming to curb and destroy individual initiative, thrift and the profit motive, in fact everything incompatible with the soc-mill (sic) theory of society, the fulfillment of which means coercive communism.</p>
