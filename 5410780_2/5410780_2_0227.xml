  <body>
   <p>Dr. Henius early in life recognized the necessity of applying science to the practical affairs of life which is comparatively a new thing in the history of culture. To it is largely due the phenomenal development of industry, which in turn demands an expansion of scientific research. In this pursuit, science also recognizes those who pursue what is called pure science.</p>
   <p>While fully appreciating the mind devoted to research for the sake of knowledge only, and indeed with proper reverence for that kind of work, it was left to him to take the findings of scientific research and apply them to the practical problem of the Brewing industry, thereby leading pure science to the forefront.</p>
   <p>Through years of labor in helping the brewers to understand the why and wherefore of manufacturing operations, and placing prevailing operations <pb facs="5410780_2_0228.jpg" n="2"/>on a firm scientific foundation, his inquiring mind saw many ways in which the prevailing practices, largely derived from centuries of rule-of-thumb operations, could be simplified and improved so as to lead to greater efficiency of operation, richer yields, better quality of the products, or the industry, and heightened stability of such products. He advised new methods of manufacturing beer whereby the materials at hand were more thoroughly exhausted and waste was curtailed, uniformity of the product assured, quality raised to that pitch which would give beer those properties which would entitle it to the position of the most popular beverage, at the same time guarding the health of the public. The methods he devised would shorten the time required for production--to prevent spoilage with its losses to the manufacturer and the potential injury to the consumer.</p>
   <p>One of the conspicuous qualities of Dr. Henius was his gracious personality. He carried this quality not only into his intercourse with the <pb facs="5410780_2_0229.jpg" n="3"/>brewery owners and the operators, whose technical advisor he became, but also, and perhaps to a more effective degree, into his teaching of those who attended the Brewing Institute of which he was one of the founders. His students admired his brilliant mind, the clarity of his teaching, and the personal interest he showed in their advancement. The many graduates of the Institute, scattered as they are in all parts of the United States, cherish the memory of their school days not only with admiration, but with pride and affection.</p>
   <p>Dr. Henius was a leading figure in the rational movement for temperance. He believed with the backing of eminent men in science and sociology that the best way to promote habits of temperance in the use of alcoholic beverages was to promote the use of beer as against the strong spirituous liquors. On this subjects, he delivered addresses, and published several pamphlets which I believe, had much to do with bringing about the recognition by Congress and State legislative bodies of legal alcoholic beer <pb facs="5410780_2_0230.jpg" n="4"/>as a non-intoxicating beverage, and giving it a preferred place in legislation for the taxation and regulation of the business for the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages.</p>
