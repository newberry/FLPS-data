   <p>A committee appointed by the Illinois Senate is investigating whether or not prostitution and white slavery can be attributed directly to the fact that the wages paid to female help in stores are incredibly low and whether conditions could be improved by establishing a minimum wage by means of legislation. A very active member of this committee is our countryman, Niels Juul.</p>
   <p>Owners and managers of department stores and mail order houses in Chicago have testified and admitted that while their business establishments have brought millions of dollars in profit annually, wages paid to young girls <pb facs="5410780_2_0171.jpg" n="2"/>are as low as $3.00 a week if they live with their parents, and $6.00 if they pay for board and room elsewhere, which, of course, may be called starvation wages, and a reason for hundreds of young girls going astray.</p>
   <p>Several of the business men who were called upon to testify, have also admitted that their establishment would be able to pay considerably higher wages and still produce handsome dividends. As a result of the investigation, it is possible that a bill calling for a minimum wage will be introduced in the Illinois Legislature.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0172.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Similar measures are being taken in other states where starvation wages to female help are beginning to be regarded as a social evil. National legislation to the same effect has also been contemplated. The Illinois commission is going to visit several other bit cities, where conditions will be investigated and a conference with President Wilson is being arranged.</p>
   <p>If the efforts result in the enacting of a law establishing a fair minimum wage for female help, it would be a great forward step in social progress. Furthermore, the theory of the employer's right to buy his labor at the lowest possible price, regardless of social consequences, is going to be blasted.</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0173.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Of course, a proposal to establish a minimum wage will be met with violent opposition. But the mere fact that the problem has been taken up for consideration by the capitalistic parties reveals the approach of a complete breakdown of the capitalistic system and that we, in America, are moving in the same general direction as the rest of the civilized world, namely, toward socialism.</p>
