   <p>At this time, William Jennings Bryan is the target of much bitter criticism for his radical protest against a policy which he does not agree with as he fears it may lead this country into war with Germany.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bryan's idea about peace and war may be essentially right and may also be sanctioned by the most sober-minded American people. Not many of them are inclined to sympathize with war mad Germany. But still fewer would like to see the United States, with no vital interest at stake, engaged in war with that country.</p>
   <p>Most Americans surely do not want war on any theoretical or sentimental issue or war that would be a disavowal of the Monroe Doctrine. If we cannot stay away, our war might just as well be directed against England who has been interfering with natural commerce and whose blockade against Germany has been <pb facs="5410780_2_0077.jpg" n="2"/>the cause of, or at least the pretext for, Germany's submarine activity, including the sinking of the Lusitania.</p>
   <p>Unhappily we have our "Jingo" patriots and those who think America is destined to a role in the world of militarism, and very likely this class of Americans may be stimulated to new efforts and find more followers just because Mr. Bryan has just now left his seat next to the president. In other words, Mr. Bryan has probably furthered just what he intended to hinder, and has once more established his position as the Don Quixote of American politics.</p>
