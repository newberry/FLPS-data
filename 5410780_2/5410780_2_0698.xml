   <p>Harmonien celebrated its thirty-fifth anniversary on November 6, 1921, with a concert in the Garrick Theater. Only seven hundred of the twelve hundred seats were taken. The guest soloist was Miss Mary Lenander, contralto, who was born in Copenhagen, and received her musical education in Copenhagen, Leipzig, London, and Paris. At present she is at the Royal Opera in Saxony, Germany.</p>
   <p>The concert, of which Ernst Lindblom was director, was followed by a dinner in Dania. Orla Juul, who had been president of Harmonien since 1919, was presented with a gold lyre studded with diamonds from an unknown admirer.</p>
   <p>At this time Harmonien had two hundred and fifty members, of whom fifty were active singers.</p>
