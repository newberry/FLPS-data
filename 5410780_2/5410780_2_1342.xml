   <p>p.4..........The monument erected by Denmark Lodge. No. 112, Knights of Pythias, at Mt. Olive Cemetery was unveiled Sunday September 20, at noon. A great number of people, mostly Danes, gathered and took part in the procession from Kolze's Place to the cemetery, preceeding the ceremony.</p>
   <p>Mr. P. M. Markussen officiated, and following the invocation, Department Grand Chancellor J. M. Omo in a speech paid tribute to the lodge, the order of Knights of Pythias, the monument and to the name Denmark which the lodge had chosen, pointing out that this lodge is the first one of all K. of P. lodges in Illinois to obtain the permission of the Grand Lodge to erect a monument.</p>
   <p>The Danish and American flags, covering the monument, were then pulled aside by two young ladies, carrying boquets and dressed in the Danish and American <pb facs="5410780_2_1343.jpg" n="2"/>colors, and the great and beautiful monument stood there unveiled. Professor Eriksen's orchestra played "Nearer my God, to Thee" and a stirring speech by P. G. Representative. P. J. Noer concluded the impressive ceremony.</p>
   <p>The monument is the work of the sculpturer N. H. Henriksen, and is located on one of the most central spots of the cemetery.</p>
