<title level="a">THE DANISH OLD PEOPLE'S HOME IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>

   <p>On the 11th of March, 1891 twelve Danish ladies met in the home of Mrs. Emma Thorsen in Chicago for the purpose of forming a society, the sole object of which should be to collect a fund for a home for needy men and women of Danish descent.</p>
   <p>As a historical record I should like to mention here the names of these ladies who did the pioneer work for the Danish Old People's home in Chicago of which we are justly proud. They were: Mrs. Emma Thorsen, Mrs. C. Hanson, Mrs. C. Pfeiffer, Mrs. Alf. Rose, Mrs. Chr. Alstrup, Mrs. John P. Hansen, Mrs. George Sandier, Mrs. H. Skov, Mrs. Geo. Olsen, Mrs. Ed. Mikkelsen, Miss Mary Thorsen and Miss Wilhelmina Pfeiffer.</p>
   <p>At the end of 1891 there was a membership of 178 and the first 1,000 Dollar mortgage was bought.</p>
   <p>Eleven years later the Society was in a position to purchase a house with two <pb facs="5410780_2_1619.jpg" n="2"/>acres of ground in Norwood Park and eleven men and women were admitted at once.</p>
   <p>In October, 1914 the corner stone of a new larger building was laid, but it soon proved to be too small and a wing was added in 1925, making room for 56 old people.</p>
   <p>Since then the Home has been filled to overflowing and at the present time there are forty waiting to be admitted.</p>
   <p>Today the Society for the Danish Old People's Home have more than 600 members, but it is not nearly enough when we consider the number of Danes in Chicago and we must complete the work started so gallantly forty-two years ago.</p>
   <p>At the Christmas celebration this year at the Home an Old Danish hymn was sung in which these words just suited that little circle of courageous women who started the movement for a Danish Old People's Home in Chicago, and it <pb facs="5410780_2_1620.jpg" n="3"/>also fits the small group of Danish people in this city who can always be depended upon to help their aged countrymen and women.</p>
   <p>In this connection I want to say that we must not overlook the fact that we cannot keep on appealing to the same people to support the Home, We must help each other carry the load and as long as the Danish Old People's Home is not self-supporting there is work and to spare for all of us.</p>
   <p>Let us remember that to enjoy happiness is a great blessing, but to impart happiness to others is greater yet.</p>
