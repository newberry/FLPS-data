   <p>On Sunday, November 9, the Song Veteran, Professor Theodor Elberg, passed away at the Danish Old People's Home here in Chicago where his last days were spent in peace and quiet. The Singing societies have been considering raising a monument on his grave for a long time, and because many of the younger singers have not known Elberg and of his importance to Danish songs, we reprint an article by Fred Oppenhagen which appeared in this paper:</p>
   <p>Mr. Elberg was born in Copenhagen in 1840. He became a student at the <pb facs="5410780_2_0501.jpg" n="2"/>Metropolitan school in 1859. He was a musical genius, having been trained by three of Denmark's foremost musicians: Rung, Gade, and Hartman. He became a member of well-known triple quartet of the student's society, afterwards he was librarian for the society. We quickly advanced from a member of the Academic Sharpshooters to Adjutant, Major, and at last, Chief of Garrison school. Then he passed his examinations in Liberal Arts, majoring in Greek and Hebrew, and prepared for two of the best schools in Copenhagen: Borgerdyden and Mariboes.</p>
   <p>Elberg came to America in the eighties, and he soon became active in the musical field. He became director of several singing societies. Among them were: Freja, Valhalla, Harmonien, and the Norwegian society, <pb facs="5410780_2_0502.jpg" n="3"/>"Bjorgvin," in Chicago; Hamlet Society in Racine, and several German societies. Wherever he was active, we noticed progress in a musical sense. It was the hands of a master that held the reins.</p>
   <p>The long and beneficial activity of Elberg in this particular period was one of the luminous points in his existence, after he lost his sight, he went to live at the Old Peoples' Home, and whenever a singer visited him there, the discussion usually was music. The erect figure became more erect. His cheeks would flush, a warm, friendly smile would wreath his lips as he would begin to tell of his experiences. It was a pleasure to see how bright a bind he still had, even to the end. He was a human lexicon, who could remember and explain everything. As we sat and listened <pb facs="5410780_2_0503.jpg" n="4"/>to him, we saw the ardent expression on his face, we saw him in our mind as the student, the intelligent journalist, the happy, dynamic, conversationalist, and the excellent speaker. We then understood why he could train a chorus so harmoniously.</p>
   <p>The Danish Singing Societies met in hurmony at Elberg's bier with lowered banners, and now they put all their efforts to the task of raising a monument as a tribute to the man that was faithful to his art to the very end.</p>
