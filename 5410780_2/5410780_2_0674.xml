   <p>Harmonien has had many prominent members--Senator Niels Juul, for example, and Max Henius, the well-known chemist. Dr. Henius joined the Society in 1901 and was a member until his death, in 1935. He was very active when the singers went on their two tours to Denmark.</p>
   <p>Another prominent member was Postmaster C. P. Ditlefsen, who became a member in 1902. He was president of Harmonien for many years, and became well known for his wit and his excellence as a toastmaster.</p>
