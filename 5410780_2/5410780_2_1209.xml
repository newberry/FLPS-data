   <p>p.4. Col3........On Sunday March 21, the Danish Young Peoples Society had an open forum discussion upon the question, "What are the most important interests for Danes entering the U.S.A."</p>
   <p>Mr. Christian M. Madsen delivered a very able and forcible address wherein he urged that every effort be made to learn the language of the new country so as to obtain an understanding of its ideals,and so as to become an active participant in community efforts. He pointed out the mistake many had made in isolating themselves by continuing exclusively in the traditions and language of Denmark. He stated that one might still love and respect the old country while striving in every way to become better acquainted with the new. He especially urged an early acquisition of naturalization papers.</p>
   <p>Mr. Madsen speech was followed by others. Some of them in full accord with Mr. Madsen, others opposed his ideas. Those opposing Mr. Madsen urged the new <pb facs="5410780_2_1210.jpg" n="2"/>arrivals, first of all, to join their respective trade unions and the Socialist Party. So intense did the discussion become that when the president announced 10:00 o'clock and closing time, it was unanimously decided to continue for another hour. Due to the interest shown in their first open forum, the new Y. P. Organization plan to have such meetings frequently.</p>
