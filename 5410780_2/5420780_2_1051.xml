   <p>On March 4th, 1936, Christian Botker, then editor of Dansk Tidende, celebrated his 70th birthday anniversary. He was born in 1866 at Gunslev, Falster, Denmark. He studied to become a public school teacher at Blaagaards Seminarium in Copenhagen; and graduated 1885, but he soon left this profession for the newspaper game. He was assistant editor on "Venstrebladet" 1899 to 1891. In 1891 he left for America.</p>
   <p>During 1891 he worked in a terra cotta factory in Perth Amboy. In 1892 he came to Chicago, where he was for some time editor of Chicago-Posten and later wrote for Norden. In 1895 he started Revyen, which, until the World War, was the only private socialist paper in America. The first issue came out April 20th, 1895. In 1921 Mr. Botker sold Revyen to Frank Phillipsen, who later sold it to the Danish Times, Inc.</p>
   <p>Mr. Botker left the paper in April, 1936. He has been in Danish-American journalism for more than forty years. He is still living in Chicago at 1225 Jarvis Avenue.</p>
