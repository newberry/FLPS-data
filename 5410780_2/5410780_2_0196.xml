   <p>p.3.Col.2........A very good attendance is reported at the meeting in Dania Hall on Sunday Jan. 17, where the question of"Women's Suffrage" was discussed. Mrs. May Wood Simons who was scheduled as the main speaker was unable to be present. She was, however, ably represented by Mrs. Tower and Mrs. Allan D. Mejow who so enthusiastically presented the cause that, when Mr. Ad.Christensen, at the close of the meeting, submitted a resolution favoring "votes for women" the resolution was unanimously adopted. Between addresses Mr. Paul Hendricksen contributed to the entertainment by sinking several appropriate numbers among them the "Marseillais." This number was received with such thunderous applause that it fairly rocked the building.</p>

   <p>The assembly then moved into the basement where a delightful lunch was served. Short speeches by James Skallerup, Harold Hendricksen, Christian Madsen, Lauritz Olesen, Anton Krist, Mesdames Christenson &amp; Madsen were delivered during the session. When all appetites were satisfied the floor was cleared for another form of enjoyment and during the next two hours they danced to piano music by Mrs. Lauretta Krist. Most people pronounced a judgement of "an evening profitably and enjoyably spent."</p>
