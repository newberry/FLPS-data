   <p>As a juror in the Juvenile Court under Judge Mary Barthelme, who is in my estimation one of the best judges in this part of the country, I have learned many things that have set me thinking. I would like to pass on to the readers a few of these thoughts with the hope that they may have their interest aroused and be more mindful to the trials and tribulations of others.</p>
   <p>A visit to the Juvenile Court would open the eyes of many people, who would see things that are hard to believe. For instance, in one case the Court had to decide that the right thing to do was to take three small children, all under school age, away from their parents and home. It is hard to think that a home could be so filthy, so lacking in the neccesary willingness for the raising and care of children, so lacking in affection and responsible feeling for the family, as to force the Court to take these babies away and put them in an institution that they might be provided with <pb facs="5410780_2_0135.jpg" n="2"/>the necessities of life. In our everyday life we meet, more or less often, the case of a child who is not coming up to the standard set by his parents. Have you ever thought about how often the parents fall below the standard the child might have made, unconsciously, in his own way? Take for instance the case of a lad of thirteen years of age who is brought to the Court because he runs away from home. The case presents interest immediately because the boy is old enough to reason things out by himself. As the case develops, we find his record at school is of the best and his attendance regular. He sleeps in hallways at night or any other available place and appears at school the following day at the regular time, usually without breakfast. When questioned, he stands up for himself with amazing militancy.</p>
   <p>The family consists of his mother, sister, stepfather, and himself. The stepfather's frequent beatings, which made life unbearable to the child, were the cause of his leaving home. The boy revealed his character and his personality so effectively as to sway the judge to his side. He was told to return home to his mother, with the admonition that if he was punished again he could come <pb facs="5410780_2_0136.jpg" n="3"/>directly to the court and his stepfather would be sentenced to jail.</p>
   <p>So much for individual cases, mentioned only to create the necessary under-standing to grasp an idea of how the courts serve the public. Social workers are a great asset to the community, especially where the foreign element dominates and the living standards are far below the average.</p>
   <p>A thought now presents itself that I would like to bring up at this time. We all, when thinking of the foreigner, visualize a certain class of people. In our different minds, this vision will differ according to the class of people we have at some time or other been in contact with, usually the middle class or the proletarians. A visit to the courts will, I am sure, change this picture in the minds of most of you. When people come to this country, assume its citizenship, customs, and laws, they become part of this country and cease to be considered "foreigners." It is the people who refuse to do without the language, customs, and laws of their homeland and who live as though they were still there, that truly deserve the title of "foreigners."</p>
   <pb facs="5410780_2_0137.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Perhaps I have strayed a little from my topic, the Juvenile Court, but these are thoughts that have come from my experience here on the jury.</p>
   <p>In these depressing times, it would be a good tonic for many people to get away for a while from their own seclusion and take a glimpse at the real troubles and problems that beset the less fortunate. A visit to this court would prove educational and give a lot of people something to think about for many days.</p>
   <p>The court mentioned here is at Roosevelt Road and Ogden Avenue. I was a member of a six-man jury for five days, in which time I saw many types of people and saw justice done in many cases by the highly esteemed Judge Mary Barthelme.</p>
