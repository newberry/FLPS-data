   <p>At the death of the Old Song Chief,Theo. Elberg in 1913, the thought of erecting a monument on his grave in Norwood Park was discussed, but it was tabled for several reasons. During the organizing of Gades' Memorial, it was brought up again, and as we all know, it was stressed very much by Editor Myrup from Racine at the banquet in Bania Hall. A number of the members of old Gade committee at once started arrangements, and invited several Singing Societies to participate. The Ecko, Workers' Singing Society, and Harmonien, have already agreed, and it is expected that Illinois and Magneten also will cooperate. Dania Hall is rented for an affair on April 7, and with help from all sides, there is no doubt that the money <pb facs="5410780_2_1330.jpg" n="2"/>needed will be collected. The drawings for the Monument are on file at Heldt-Henricksen's firm in Dunning, and it must be said to the credit of the committee that they have been liberal in every way, and that they will create monument for the man whose ability and personality gave him the title of "Creator of Danish Songs" in Chicago. As it is arranged now, the monument will be unveiled Easter, May 27, in the afternoon.</p>
