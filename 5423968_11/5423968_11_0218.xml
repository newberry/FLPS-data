   <p>Note: On January 20, the main edifice of the Polish National Alliance College at Cambridge Springs, Pa., with its library museum, was destroyed by fire. That grievous calamity has evoked a benevolent response both among the Alliance folks and its friends, as may be seen in the form of moral and material reports, received by the P.N.A. College Board. One of numerous and vivid instances of such a benevolent attitude on the part of the Alliance College friends is quoted below.</p>
   <p>Professor S. Mierzwa, President of the Alliance College, has received from Dr. Mieczyslaw Marchlewski, Polish Consul General at New York, a very valuable gift for the College museum in the form of a bust of Stanislaw Staszyc, accompanied by a letter full of faith and confidence for the future of that institution.</p>
   <p>The letter of Consul Marchlewski reads in full as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0219.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>February 16, 1931</p>
   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>The news of the conflagration at the Polish National Alliance College has affected me with immense grief. But, soon after I learned with highest joy, that the catastrophe did not in the least weaken the beautiful and noble Polish endeavor, expressed in the maintenance of that precious educational institution. Not disheartened by the misfortune, professors and students have after only a short interval, taken up anew their beautiful work.</p>
   <p>I am sure that on the ruins of the old building there shall arise a new edifice, dedicated to the Polish learning and culture, an edifice, erected by the collective efforts of Polish immigrants, as has been the one consumed by flames.</p>
   <p>It is for that new edifice that I have the honor to presently send you, as <pb facs="5423968_11_0220.jpg" n="3"/>my personal keepsake, the bust of Stanislaw Staszyc, that Polish patriot and statesman, who, out of the ruins of our devastated country has built up a new edifice of Polish knowledge and culture and of Polish State power.</p>
   <p>To the Alliance School at Cambridge Springs, Pa., to its students and professors I forward my best cordial wishes. These are the wishes not of a private man only, not only a Pole, who has heartily grown together with and into the life of our immigration, out of which he draws strength and refreshment, but they are the wishes, likewise, of a man, who, has the honor to represent on the soil of Washington, that great and noble country, the Most Illustrious Republic of Poland.</p>
   <p>Please, accept, Dear Sir, the words of my deep respect.</p>
   <p>Dr. Mieczyslaw Marchlewski,</p>
   <p>Consul General, N. Y.</p>
