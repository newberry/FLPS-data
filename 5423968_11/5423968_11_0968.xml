   <p>Peter Kiolbassa, a leader among Chicago's Polish-Americans and formerly prominent in politics, died of blood poisoning at St. Mary of Nazareth's Hospital early yesterday morning. A slight injury to his foot, received nine weeks ago, brought on the complications which resulted in Mr. Kiolbassa's death.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kiolbassa met with the accident while attending a funeral and was confined to bed at his home, 625 Milwaukee Avenue, for a few days.</p>

   <p>Three weeks afterward, fire started in a building which adjoined his residenge, compelling him to hurry out at night. After this incident, he became rapidly worse, and was soon taken to the hospital.</p>
   <p>Funeral Next Tuesday.</p>
   <p>He is survived by his wife and his daughter, Mrs. Rose C. Kwasigroch, Funeral services will be held at St. Stanislaus' Polish Roman Catholic Church Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock. Interment will be in St. Adelbert's cemetery.</p>

   <p>Mr. Kiolbassa was born in Russian Poland Oct. 13, 1838. He came to the United States with his parents in 1855, settling in Texas. They organized the first Polish colony in this country, naming it Panna Maria (Virgin Mary), and erected the first Polish church. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Mr. Kiolbassa was forced to join the Confederate army. He was captured and brought to Illinois, where he enlisted with the Union forces in the Sixteenth, Illinois Cavalry, serving until April 15, 1864, after having attained his captaincy.</p>
   <p>Served On Police Force.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kiolbassa came to Chicago immediately after leaving the army, and secured employment on the police force. He was promoted to desk sergeant, and then to secretary to Chief of Police R. W. McClaughrey, during Mayor Wasburne's administration. He resigned that position to become enrolling and license clerk in the custom office.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0971.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>He was a member of the legislature in 1877-79, and in 1891 was elected city treasurer on the Democratic Ticket. He represented the Sixteenth Ward in the City Council from 1896 to 1898, and was building commissioner under Mayor Harrison from 1901 to 1903. He was appointed a member of the board of local improvements in 1903, holding that position at the time of his death.</p>
