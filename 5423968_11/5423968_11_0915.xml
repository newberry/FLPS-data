  <body>
   <p>The funeral of Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, well known to American Polonia as a pedagogue, dramatist, author, poet, and journalist, was held yesterday at the St. Stanislaus Kostka church. A modest group of friends and relatives attended. For all the work and sacrifice that he gave to the Polish element here, his funeral might have been a more imposing one. But--such is the reward of those who work with their pens, who give their talent, their hearts, and their souls for the enlightenment of the people.</p>
   <p>Several of the parish priests participated in the funeral ceremony, which was beautified also by the singing of the organisists' choir. The editors of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, Dziennik Chicagoski, and N. K. Zlotnicki, editor of Copy [The Flails] attended the funeral.</p>
   <p>The body of the deceased was laid to rest in St. Adalbert's cemetery. May <pb facs="5423968_11_0916.jpg" n="2"/>he rest in peace! Although he has passed from this life, there remain behind him many evidences of his fruitful work, for which, during his lifetime, he received no recognition.</p>
