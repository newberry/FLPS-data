  <body>
   <p>In the midst of the present terrible war attended by horrible misery, the demons of death and destruction struggle for supremacy of the world.</p>
   <p>Thousands upon thousands of soldiers are dying on the field of battle and millions of peaceful human beings are perishing of cold and hunger.</p>
   <p>Two countries have been more specially the victims of these sanguinary conflicts. Two countries, but yesterday prosperous, are now wastes of desolation. These are Poland and Belgium.</p>
   <p>The assistance given to Belgium does credit to humanity. Poland, my country, now appeals for aid.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0535.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>An area, seven times as vast as that of the realm of King Albert, has in Poland been crushed and devastated by the iron heel of war. The blood of our unhappy country cries out for Divine justice. Her sons, compelled to fight in hostile armies, slay one another in fratricidal combat. From the banks of the Nieman River to the summits of the Carpathian Mountains, fire has destroyed the towns and villages, and over the whole of this huge, desolated country the spectre of famine has spread its wings.</p>
   <p>All labor and industry have been swept away. The ploughshare is rusted, the peasant has neither grain nor cattle. The artisan is idle, all works and factories have been destroyed. The tradesman cannot sell his wares: there is no one to buy. The hearth is extinguished, and disease and misery prevail. The aged and infirm have no shelter from the cold and hardships of the winter weather. Little children, stretching out their arms to their mothers for bread, receive in answer only tears. Listen to me, Christian nations! Of such starving people, who are crying out for aid, <pb facs="5423968_11_0536.jpg" n="3"/>there are millions. Does Poland have no right to your assistance? Each unfortunate nation has such right in the name of Humanity, but the Polish nation has also other claims, to plead for her cause before the Universe. Conquered and torn asunder, she ever struggled against brutal force, remembering always her glorious past and ever affirming the sacred rights of Liberty. For centuries she was the rampart of civilization, the barrier of Christendom in its struggle with the crescent. She always fought side by side with all defenders of freedom. The names of Sobieski and Kosciuszko will be ever engraved on your memory. Where was any generous cause in which Poland did not freely shed her blood? Where was human suffering, which she did not attempt to alleviate? Our genius, our labor, and our creative powers have left their imprint upon many pages of the World's history. Our voices rose in unison with the great call of civilized humanity.</p>
   <p>Therefore, in the name of universal fraternity, in the name of a country ever faithful to that sacred principle, in the name of the teachings of <pb facs="5423968_11_0537.jpg" n="4"/>Christ, and in the name of our past and present sufferings, I appeal to your civilized nation.</p>
   <p>Help to save my country from her terrible distress. Let us cooperate in giving her population employment and bread; in restoring the farmer's strength and providing him with seed, wherewith to raise his future harvest. May Polish mothers be enabled to give their famished children something better than tears. May the Polish nation survive this hour of supreme trial and with renewed hope and strength await the dawn of her near Resurrection.</p>
   <p>Henry Sienkiewicz.</p>
   <p>General Relief Committee for the victims of War in Poland. H. Sienkiewicz, president; I. Paderewski, vice-president, Grand Hotel, Vevey, Switzerland.</p>
