After completing his studies at St. Stanislaus high school, Stanislaus entered the Metropolitan Business College. Shortly afterwards, he was chosen Senator to the Illinois State Legislature. He successfully completed his term in 1895. From 1895 to 1920 Mr. Kunz was alderman of the Sixteenth Ward.</p>
