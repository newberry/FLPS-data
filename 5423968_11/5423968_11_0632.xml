  <body>
   <p>We wish to remind our readers of our fellowman, Mr. S. Lapinski, whom the Central Polish Workers' Society Past Commander gave the important function, of representing the fighting Poles in America.</p>
   <p>Our comrade, Mr. S. Lapinski, when still a student, acquainted himself with socialistic endeavors and with his young and warm heart decided to join them, sacrificing himself for a battle to emancipate the people from bondage.</p>
   <p>His personal qualifications, his immense courage, suitable for this work, shortly won recognition and he soon found himself in the midst of the leaders of the P. P. S., and from then on we see him always as the leader in our daily strifes, at meetings, street demonstrations, parades; we see him as a very active man.</p>
   <p>He was also a leader on the editorial staff in Warsaw, an editor of the Daily Courier, also the Worker.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0633.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A PROFICIENT SPEAKER</p>
   <p>Those friends of ours, who already know of him, cant find enough words of praise for him as a speaker.</p>
   <p>He received recognition in the cities of New York, Pittsburgh, Cleveland etc. leaving a fine impression upon the minds and hearts of the people.</p>
   <p>Today in Chicago, in the Walsh Hall at 8:00 P:M, everyone will be able to hear him speak, paying homage to the fighting Poles, for whom he lives.</p>
