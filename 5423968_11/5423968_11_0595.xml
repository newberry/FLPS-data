   <p>An ideal plan for the freedom of nations is ripening and the decisive moment is approaching. The nation, a giant automaton, moving only at the command of tyrants, and ill-treated for centuries, heeds the battle-cry for human rights. Unable to obtain justice in terms of peace, it intends to fight for liberty; it failed often, but never admitted defeat.</p>
   <p>The Polish Nation is awakening for the battle of freedom. But the oppressed Poles, who so valiantly defended their independence, have lost. Poland was officially removed from the map of Europe as an autonomous country - temporarily - as the Poles again arise for their cause but now, conditions are more favorable than formerly.</p>
   <p>Ominious clouds of war are gathering over Europe which may overthrow the corrupt system of our oppressors. We, who are trodden today - can be free tomorrow.</p>
   <p>We must prepare for the coming events and should be ready to wield the cudgel when the proper time arrives. Therefore, let us organise the entire nation, without exception, and venture forth, side by side in defiance of our subjugators.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0596.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We, the Poles living in this <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> Country, cannot be indifferent spectators Give a helping hand and aid our brothers across the sea.</p>
   <p>The National Defence Committee has been organized in Chicago, with sub-committees in every community. Therefore, we, the temporary delegation, common every Pole to the mass-meeting which will be held on Sunday, February 23rd, at 2 P.M., Pulaski hall, 1715 South Ashland Ave, for the purpose of organizing the Local National Committee.</p>
   <p>All groups of the Polish National Alliance of the South Side are invited.</p>
   <p>S. K. Sass,</p>
   <p>W. W. Goralski,</p>
   <p>S. Lauferzki,</p>
   <p>I. P. Tyrakowski. Members of the Committee.</p>
