   <p>In the Gazeta Narodowa (National Gazette), published in Lwow [Poland] we read the following:</p>
   <p>"Mr. Adam Szwajkart, who represents the Central Committee of the Lwow Exposition, organized by Poles living in the United States, with headquarters in Chicago, arrived yesterday for the purpose of visiting our Exposition.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Szwajkart is a "Lwowian". He went to Chicago eight years ago at the request of his brother, Stanislaus, who emigrated to America some time ago.</p>
   <p>"As a businessman, he gained a prominent position in the commercial world. His business, however, did not interfere with his civic duties.</p>
   <p>"From the time of his arrival in Chicago, Mr. Szwajkart took active part in national work, which is very lively in American Polonia; and that he has <pb facs="5423968_11_0712.jpg" n="2"/>gained the confidence of the public may be proved by the fact that he was placed in charge of the Polish-American section of our Exposition. This section will represent accurately the life, customs, and occupations of our countrymen across the ocean. This will be very important and interesting, if only for the reason that, until the present time, our contact with American Polonia has been very limited. Establishment of the Polish-American pavilion at the Exposition is the first step on the part of our countrymen in America toward establishing closer relations with the homeland, which have been somewhat distant ever since Professor Donikowski's visit to America. This act of good will should be properly understood and appreciated by us, and it will be easy for us to appreciate it if we will not only see these exhibits but also study them in such a way that we may form an intelligent opinion about the life and activities of our brothers across the ocean.</p>
   <p>"Let this Polish-American section, on the one hand, have a good influence toward cementing relations between the motherland and her children who are obliged to seek a better lot in foreign lands; and on the other hand, let it <pb facs="5423968_11_0713.jpg" n="3"/>popularize the thought that the Polonia of America is not a separate branch, severed from the trunk of the tree, which withers, but a live one which remains green, and in time will bear fruit for the motherland.</p>
   <p>"Formerly, Szwajkart and I were good friends. After our first greeting, at which questions and answers were exchanged quickly and chaotically, naturally, I asked immediately:</p>
   <p>"'Did you come to the Fair?'</p>
   <p>"'Yes, I am the first one, but in a short time a large group of our countrymen from across the ocean will come, that they may draw from you new strength for further national work, and once more breathe their native air.'</p>
   <p>"'We will greet them cordially and they will be our best guests. With great pleasure we will clasp their noble, worn hands; our hearts will be opened to them and our thoughts will be united. Have you been to the Exposition grounds <pb facs="5423968_11_0714.jpg" n="4"/>yet?'</p>
   <p>"'I have.'</p>
   <p>"'How did our Exposition impress you, who not long ago saw the wonders of the Columbian Exposition?'</p>
   <p>"'Much better than you might have expected. It is true that I cannot compare it with the Chicago Fair, which was a World's Fair built by the immense wealth of the entire world; but I marvel at the design of the Lwow Exposition, which is beyond my expectation. In any case, this Exposition displays the great vitality, and inexhaustible spiritual power of the nation. It is a real triumph for a nation deprived of political existence. The general view of the Exposition is very imposing. I saw real architectural wonders. It would be an impossibility to describe every pavilion separately. Very seldom do we see architecture with such distinct outlines as, for example, the Art Building (Palac Sztuk Pieknych), a beautiful toy; or the Municipal <pb facs="5423968_11_0715.jpg" n="5"/>Building, or such wonderfully clear-cut architecture as the Pavilion of Architecture. The Commercial Building, characterizing our own [American] architecture, made a very pleasant impression upon me. The Exposition grounds are located at a convenient place. I introduced myself to the creators of the Exposition, Prince Sapiecha and Dr. Marchwicki. I was struck with their unusual vitality and energy, and I came to the conclusion that, under that kind of direction, this magnificent work will be a great success. Credit should be given to such leaders. We need not be ashamed of our Exposition in comparison to the Columbian Exposition or the one held in Antwerp, which I had an opportunity to visit during my voyage. I look at the Lwow Exposition with the eye of a Pole, and my first impression was very thrilling and joyful. This great Polish banquet, for which we are dressing up, this national festival, this tournament, into the ranks of which enter Polish agriculture, industry, education, and art, will present to the world visible proof that we have not perished.'"</p>
