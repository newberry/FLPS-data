  <body>
   <p>When the people of free nations entered the World War, and when the many free people of America joined their cause, we, the sons of parents who taught us to follow in the footsteps of Thaddeus Kosciusko and Casimir Pulaski, as true sons and citizens of America joined the forces of the United States Army and Navy, and to the very end performed our duties capably and willingly. The ideals for which we fought were and are the ideals of America, as well as of the entire Polish nation. We fought for America in the firm belief that Poland would come out of the war a free country, and that she would have free access to the Baltic Sea.</p>
   <p>Thousands of our colleagues have sacrificed their lives and lie peacefully in Flanders Field; thousands of others were wounded, and are now convalescing in hospital wards. Our performance during the war was that of true American citizens in whose veins flows Polish blood.</p>
   <p>The strength of the forces under the colors of the United States were so <pb facs="5423968_11_0259.jpg" n="2"/>powerful that they overwhelmed the hydra of Germany and Prussia, and severed its dominance over the world. The sacrifice of American lives and the spilling of American blood brought victory to the Allies, and freed Poland from the shackles of three nations.</p>
   <p>The freedom of Poland did not spell the termination of our work, because Prussianism, or Pan-Germanism, although considerably weakened, did not submit to the victory. It has fallen into its old ways, into its old technique of terrorizing, degrading, and oppressing the Polish people.</p>
   <p>The fulfillment of our obligations and our work as American citizens, and as the sons of Polish parents, falls into various categories. As American veterans and citizens, we see daily the damaging work of the enemies of the freedom and independence of Poland, who are spreading falsehoods and hypocrisy against the Polish government and people. We see how they are struggling to hide the facts of the actual history of Poland and the recent sacrifice of Polish life and blood against the attacking hordes of Bolsheviks, a sacrifice which prevented this attack from spreading over all of Europe. We see how these enemies are <pb facs="5423968_11_0260.jpg" n="3"/>spreading false rumors about the present events in Poland.</p>
   <p>As veterans and as American citizens it is not only our right but our duty to take a stand against this false and discrediting propaganda which has spread so far and wide against Poland and her people. It is our right and our duty to demand justice for the free and independent country of Poland, for the people of Poland and the Polish government, from our fellow-citizens and from the American government. It is our right and our duty to spread the truth and wipe out the falsehoods about Poland and her people. The spreading of anti-Polish propaganda by the enemies and the former oppressors of the Polish people is not only an act of injustice harmful to the Polish people and government, but it is also a blow against American principles. The American government, as well as the American people, has the right to know the truth about the Polish people and their government, and the false attacks and malicious propaganda of the enemies of Poland should be exposed, for these tactics are a direct challenge to the freedom and peace of the democratic nation of America.</p>
   <p>One of the questions which should concern us greatly is the question of the people of Upper Silesia. The begging and pleading voices of the destitute <pb facs="5423968_11_0261.jpg" n="4"/>orphans and widows have reached our frontiers and penetrated our hearts. An enemy is preying daily upon the workers, the women and the children of this ancient Polish territory of Silesia, just as it did before the World War.</p>
   <p>The Polish men of Silesia rose in arms against this enemy, and tried to defend their children, wives, and parents from its strangling clutches. Justly and valiantly they spilled their blood on the field of battle, and won a part of their land for Poland. However, over one million Polish men, women, and children remained under German rule.</p>
   <p>This mass of Polish people, although under German jurisdiction, has the right to ask and expect help from us. We must show to the people of the United States what is happening in Upper Silesia under the present system of government in Germany. It is our duty to reveal to the general American public the appalling conditions that exist in this territory under German rule. It is necessary that the world at large become familiar with the fact that when the League of Nations gave special rights to the Jews and other minor nationalistic <pb facs="5423968_11_0262.jpg" n="5"/>groups in Poland and other European republics, although such special privileges for the minorities were not necessary, because the Polish people and the Polish government never did oppress any foreign groups, there was no protection provided for the million Polish people living under German rule, nor any laws for the protection and accommodation of the other minorities in Germany. It is imperative that we point out to the people of the United States that laws for the protection of minorities are primarily needed in Germany and not in Poland.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, financial aid is needed for the many orphans and widows of the insurrectionists of Upper Silesia, and funds are needed for the upkeep of Polish schools. This also holds true of the Polish schools on the German plains.</p>
   <p>In order to bring to the attention of the people of Chicago the question of Upper Silesia, we are planning a meeting Sunday, December 18, at 2:30 P.M. This meeting will be held at the Colonial Theater, between State and Dearborn, on Randolph Street. We want every veteran of the war and every friend of the <pb facs="5423968_11_0263.jpg" n="6"/>veterans to attend. In the event that the turnout is too large, a similar meeting will be held in another hall. We will be prepared for this eventuality.</p>
   <p>On the program of this meeting there will be speeches by the delegates from Upper Silesia and by many prominent Americans. Singing, piano solos, and other musical solos will add variety to the bill. Admission is free to the public. The cost of the affair has been absorbed by the many Polish businessmen who have placed advertisements in the program.</p>
   <p>Admission is free, because we wish to have this demonstration a success. All members will not only receive tickets for themselves, but for their families and friends. Tickets will be available at offices announced in the daily newspapers. Before 2:15 P.M. Sunday, December 18, admission to the Colonial Theater will be by ticket only. After this time, if seats are available, those without tickets will also be admitted free of charge. In the event of an overflow audience, a place will be reserved where the program will be repeated.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0264.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Veterans! Let us get into action! Let our demonstration relative to the problem of Upper Silesia be an immortal remembrance to all.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Alliance of Polish-American Veterans of the World War,</p>
   <p>John Ciaglo,</p>
   <p>Commander in Chief.</p>
