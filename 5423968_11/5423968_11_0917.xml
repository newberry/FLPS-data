   <p>Szczesny Zahajkiewicz, writer, teacher, and onetime active worker in the Polish educational, dramatic, and youth organization fields in Chicago, died yesterday at 2:25 in the morning after a long illness. His name is well known in every one of the larger Polish settlements in America, especially because of the popular plays that he wrote, which were well adapted to the Polish amateur stage. In Chicago, news of his death has deeply touched his many friends, onetime pupils of his, who now occupy important positions in life, as well as a great many of his colleagues in the educational field and in many organizations.</p>
   <p>Szczesny Zahajkiewicz was born in Stanislawow in Galicia [Austrian-occupied Poland] in April, 1861. He received his elementary education in Kolomia and Horodenko, later attending teachers' seminary at Horodenko. From the thirteenth year of his life on, he was forced to support himself, which he <pb facs="5423968_11_0918.jpg" n="2"/>did by giving private lessons. He passed his examinations with high honors, however, and became a teacher, first in Dolina, later in Stanislawow and Jezupol, then again in Stanislawow, and finally, in Lwow. During this time, he wrote a number of books for the common people in the Polish and Ruthenian languages. His books were highly commended by the [Polish]National Educational Council. In addition to these writings, he contributed much to Polish humorous periodicals, and for several years was editor of Swiatelko [The Little Light], a periodical for children and adolescents which was first published in Stanislawow and later in Lwow.</p>
   <p>Zahajkiewicz Came to America and to Chicago in 1889; he was brought here by the Resurrection Fathers to take the post of teacher in the St. Stanislaus Kostka parochial school, and from that time on he worked usefully and fruitfully among the Polish people in Chicago. He became very well known in the first years of his stay here through his many literary compositions and his <pb facs="5423968_11_0919.jpg" n="3"/>work among the youth.</p>
   <p>The funeral will be held tomorrow, October 3, from the home of the deceased at 901 Newton Street. The body will be taken to St. Stanislaus Kostka church and then to St. Adalbert's cemetery.</p>
   <p>We extend sincerest condolences to his bereaved widow and children. May he rest in peace!</p>
