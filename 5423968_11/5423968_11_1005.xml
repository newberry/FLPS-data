   <p>Mr. Peter Kiolbassa, our new city treasurer, has received a great deal of publicity lately. During the municipal elections the press said nothing about Peter Kiolbassa, although columns were devoted to other candidates. They tried to prevent his election by ignoring him. The Polish press supported him, but he had few champions among the American journalists. Now however they are giving him publicity. They attack him first, because he was elected, second, because he succeeded in floating a bond issue with private citizens, despite the intrigues of his opponents, and finally because the "Day of Reckoning" has arrived. These gentlemen are angry because they cannot attack his character since it is irreproachable. It is amusing to observe the grace with which he handles his opponents and his erstwhile friends.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's Republican and Democratic newspapers told with sanctimonious indignation how Mr. Peter Kiolbassa had tricked the City Council. They claimed that <pb facs="5423968_11_1006.jpg" n="2"/>there were proofs of improper examination of his bonds and that they amounted to only a little over five million dollars instead of fifteen. The figures were correct. Last night's and this morning's papers, confronted with the facts, were obliged to admit their mistake by publishing the figures of Mr. Kiolbassa's bonds which amounted to over fifteen and a half million dollars.</p>
   <p>Last March the City Council passed an ordinance authorizing six local banks to receive the city's funds. Each bank was required to furnish a two and a half million dollar bond; multiplied by six, this amounted to fifteen million dollars. Now, Mr. Kiolbassa's attorney proved that this ordinance was illegal because no bank can furnish such a large bond, and since the bond cannot be split, the ordinance was abolished. The banks which refused to furnish bonds for Mr. Kiolbassa, thinking that they did not need his favor, discovered their mistake. The money deposited in those banks was withdrawn. What is more, Mr. Kiolbassa has undermined the syndicate made up of the six banks by the simple <pb facs="5423968_11_1007.jpg" n="3"/>process of depositing the city's funds in other banks. He caused the Corn Exchange Bank to leave the syndicate by making it a depository of city's funds. That bank, in conjunction with the Union National Bank and the American Trust and Savings Bank, furnished the fifteen million dollar bond for Mr. Kiolbassa and promised to pay more than two and a half percent interest, which is a better return than the city has had previously. These banks have already signed the necessary contracts and will receive the city's funds.</p>
   <p>The syndicate of six banks was broken through the withdrawal of the Corn Exchange Bank which will support Mr. Kiolbassa. For this reason the famous Dixon Bill cannot be revived.</p>
   <p>Republicans tried to discredit Mr. Kiolbassa by making all kinds of accusations, <pb facs="5423968_11_1008.jpg" n="4"/>by creating difficulties, starting lawsuits, etc. After several unsuccessful attempts they realized that they were harming only themselves and that they deserved his criticism.</p>
