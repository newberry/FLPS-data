   <p>Thursday. Nov. 24, 1904, Rev. Father John Radziejewski died after fulfilling his daily obligations. He was 6o years old.</p>
   <p>The parishioners of St. Adelbert, Chicago, feel the loss deeply. Father Radziejewski served St. Adelbert's more than twenty years. His death, which came as a shock to his parishioners, is felt not only by the Polish Catholics in Chicago, but in all Roman-Catholic churches of this country.</p>
   <p>A leader, Father Radziejewski, was unfailing in his care and personal admonitions for the church he served.</p>
   <p>The following are a few of the duties he performed before he died Wednesday night about 11:30 he was called out to visit a sick person, <pb facs="5423968_11_0978.jpg" n="2"/>this was always a solemn duty of his, regardless of the hour of day or night, he was already ready to perform the last rite for a person in their hour of need.</p>
   <p>It was said that on this night, he was not in the best of health, but he had his carriage and horses ready, and gathering all the articles needed by a priest on a call of this kind, he left for his destination. Arriving at his destination he stepped out of the carriage and took a few steps towards the house, feeling very sick and weak he returned to the carriage and with the aid of the driver was able to enter.</p>
   <p>He was hurriedly driven back to the priest home and assisted by his chauffeur to his bedroom, where he was left alone. The chauffeur returned to tend to the horses and the carriage, thinking that the priest would summon his aid. Father John left his bedroom and went to his office to lie down on the davenport. None of the caretakers who were sleeping were disturbed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0979.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Thursday morning shortly after 6 o'clock, Father Pajkowski and two attendants were searching for Rev. Father Radziewski to ask him about Thursday's business; they located him sitting in his office fully clothed. One of the attendants joked about Rev. Father John sleeping in a sitting position. A minute later it was found he was dead. Immediately a physician was summoned but to no avail. The news spread rapidly through the city. Poles were overcome by grief.</p>
   <p>There were very few who did not know this honest man. Wherever his name was mentioned many recalled his sympathy and teachings.</p>
   <p>He preferred his carriage to the street car, because while in it he could pray silently.</p>
   <p>One thing he did not approve of and that was to talk of his personal life or past.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0980.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We know that Rev. Father John Radziejewski was born in the year 1844 in Pozman, and attended school in Ostrowie, Poznan, and in Rome. In Rome he was ordained a Roman-Catholic priest, May 22, 1869. He performed his first duties in his native city of Poznan, but latter was transferred to Paris where he remained six years.</p>
   <p>June 15, 1881 he migrated to America.</p>
   <p>He first served at St. Stanislaus parish. He went to a parish in South Chicago and later organized and started the new parish of the Immaculate Conception of Blessed Mary. In 1884, the Bishop of Chicago ordained him head priest of St. Adelbert parish.</p>
   <p>He worked unceasingly in Chicago with Rev. Father Barzynski for <pb facs="5423968_11_0981.jpg" n="5"/>the welfare of the Poles in America, and Catholic work showed his undying love for them.</p>
   <p>He worked and helped organize the Polish Union Society; B. S. J. of America, where he was pastor for many years; organized the Polish Political Club, Polish League and the Polish Daily News, of which he was the pastor and director for many years.</p>
   <p>He also organized and helped finance the building of the following churches: The Immaculate Conception of Blessed Mary. Blessed Virgin Mother, N. P., in Bridgeport; St. Peter and St. Paul the Apostles; Sr. Casimir, and St. Anna.</p>
   <p>The members of the parish of St. Adelbert cannot express their sorrow for losing so gallant a leader, and may his devoted work be carried on.</p>
   <p>Rest in Peace!</p>
