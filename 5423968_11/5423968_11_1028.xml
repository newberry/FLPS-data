   <p>For a long time and now even werse in the Polish districts there is heard the "shouting" from the distributers of English newspapers, especially the Chicago American, about unusual ineidents, such as war, orime, robbery, etc.</p>
   <p>The public being interested buys these "extras," must pay two cents for this paper, which most of the times does not possess this "extra" information.</p>
   <p>Truthfully, this is a small affair, but we mention it as a common abuse. So for this reason, a few members of the Literature Cirele, in the name of A. Miekiowies, decided recently to send a letter of protest, in order to regulate the affair mentioned above.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_1029.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We received a satisfactory answer to our letter, the management does not approve of these distributors to demand two cents for any kind of an edition, portrayed as an "extra" or not.</p>
   <p>The public should report the names of these boys to the management, but the best results would be gained if they would not pay more than one cent for the paper.</p>
   <p>So we warn you again, our dear public, never to pay more than one cent for such an "extra."</p>
