   <p>Springfield, Ill. - State representative M. Geszkiewiez moved the following resolution which was next unanimously adopted:</p>
   <p>To the memory of Peter Kiolbassa, born Oct. 13, 1838 - died June 23, 1905. Whereas it would please the Supreme Judge who enacts the laws to remove from our circle the Honorable Peter Kiolbassa, who as a captain of the United States cavalry in the Union Army, during the Civil War, as member of the Thirtieth State Legislature of the State of Illinois, and various offices held by him in the city of Chicago; as a secretary of police, city treasurer, supervisor of West Town in the city of Chicago, alderman, building commissioner and member of the Beard of Local Improvements, always distinguished himself with patriotism, the care of public welfare, unselfish and faithful, worthy of public trust, and: Whereas because of his death the people of the State of Illinois lost an able, useful and exemplary citizen,</p>
   <p>Therefore be it resolved that we are sorry because of the death of Peter Kiolbassa and express to this widow and his grief-stricken family our expression of sympathy. Be it also resolved that the said resolution properly written be sent to the widow of the deceased.</p>
