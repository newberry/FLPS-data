   <p>The excursion of the Polish National Alliance (P. N. A.) youth to Poland, sponsored for this vacational season by the P. N. A. Educational Department, is awaking a great interest among the members of the P. N. A. Some parents are already making suitable preparations in order that their children may take a few weeks' sojourn in the land of their forefathers; they think that the best means of preserving Polish spirit in the Young Polish generation is to give the young people a chance to become acquainted with Poland by seeing that beautiful country, of which they have heard so much.</p>
   <p>The sponsors of the excursion pledge their word to all inquiring applicants that during the excursion particular care will be taken to safe-guard the well-being of the youth by appointing vigilant persons whom the parents may confidently entrust with their children.</p>
   <p>Realizing that it is assuming upon itself a great responsibility, the P. N. A. Educational Department has worked out the entire plan of the excursion very carefully, even to the smallest details.</p>
