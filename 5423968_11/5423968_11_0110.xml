   <p>Miss Mary Margaret Lee, a student of Chicago University, also secretary of the Women's Trade Union League, saved an immigrant girl from Poland, by the name of M. Kroslak.</p>
   <p>The Women's Trade Union League, New York, sent an advance notice of girls journeying from Europe to Chicago. Miss Lee received a list of the girls sent to Chicago. She then went to the railroad station to check the names, and, after counting them all, found that M. Kroslak, a newcomer from Poland, was missing.</p>
   <p>She started an investigation and, after searching for her several days, found her in a suspicious home. She tried to get in the house, but no one answered. Finally, after a long period of time, the landlord opened <pb facs="5423968_11_0111.jpg" n="2"/>the door and told Miss Lee that M. Kroslak was working in a boarding house and making good money.</p>
   <p>Miss Lee did not believe this and with the help of another member released her, and then had the landlord arrested.</p>
