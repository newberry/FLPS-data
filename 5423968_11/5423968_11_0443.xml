   <p>At the present time, all indications show that the reception to be held in honor of the general staff of the Polish Army on Sunday, March 3, at the Coliseum, Wabash Avenue and 16th Street, will be an impressive occasion. Since this is the first opportunity Chicago will have to greet the representatives of the Polish Army, all the Poles of Chicago and vicinity should participate. There should be tens of thousands of people in the parade to the Coliseum, and that great hall should be filled to capacity, for it will be a happy day for us when we see with our own eyes the commanders of the Polish Army in France--an army created by ourselves, of our own flesh and blood.</p>
   <p>The representatives of various Polish organizations, communities, and groups held a meeting yesterday in the Polish Women's Alliance Building to discuss the initial activities. Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National <pb facs="5423968_11_0444.jpg" n="2"/>Alliance, presided and John Wedda acted as secretary.</p>
   <p>Organizations and communities were represented as follows: The Polish National Alliance by C. Zychlinski, Joseph Magdziarz, Mrs. M. Sakowski, S. Dudek, and N. K.

Strzelecki; Avondale by Albert Danisz; St. Helen's [Parish] by John Rosa and A. Hibner; Polish Press Club by J. R. Piasecki; South Chicago by S.

   <p>The Executive Committee, with its president, Zychlinski, at the head, ascertained that the representatives of the general staff of the Polish Army in France would be officially welcomed by Americans, through the National Security League, which welcomed Joffre and other commissions of the Allies arriving in Chicago. The gathering was told that the participation of Poles in this reception would only be supplementary and that it really ought to be a political manifestation on the largest possible scale. To prove that we are worthy of having our Army delegation officially greeted by Americans, our <pb facs="5423968_11_0446.jpg" n="4"/>participation in the parade and in the mass meeting should be more extensive than ever before; so that the Loop will be filled with Poles as a sign that all Polish hearts beat together, that there is no Pole who does not cherish and work for freedom.</p>
   <p>After a discussion as to how the organizations and communities are to be represented in the principle committee, it was decided that this committee consist of fifteen persons. The following were named: Judge Jarecki as chairman, D. Hojnacki, S. Strzelecki, A. Hibner, Miss E. Napieralski, J. Jankowski, Joseph Spiker, A. Karczynski, Mary Sakowski, S. Dudek, M. Bereczkowski, T. Jachimowicz, Agnes Wisla, and W. Lubicz. Acknowledgement was made to the community of Town of Lake which has already begun preparations and will participate extensively in the manifestation.</p>
   <p>It was decided that each organization should issue to its members an appeal for the largest possible participation. The press committee is to consist of all the newspaper representatives who were present at the meeting.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0447.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Since such a mass meeting as this should be a greater manifestation than Chicago has ever seen before, it was decided that the pastors of all forty-five Polish parishes in Chicago be personally asked to appeal from the pulpit to their parishioners, the military and church societies, and to all parish groups to participate in the manifestation. Each member of the Committee of Fifteen will visit three parishes. A separate written invitation has been sent through the mail to the Polish priests of the National Security League.</p>
   <p>At the meeting of the Committee of Fifteen which followed immediately, the following parade committee was chosen: A. Wolski, N. J. Przymorski, Dr. Kuflewski, A. Ruszczyk and S. Kleehamer. Details of the parade will be decided at a meeting of the representatives of all societies, organizations, communities, and citizens' committees, which will be held on Tuesday at the Polish Womens' Alliance Building.</p>
   <p>It should be added here that on March 3 a banquet will be held in honor of the Polish Army delegation at the Morrison Hotel. Tickets may now be purchased <pb facs="5423968_11_0448.jpg" n="6"/>at two dollars a person. Representatives of organizations and communities should indicate at Tuesday's meeting how many tickets their particular organization or community can dispose of. All tickets must be paid for in advance.</p>
