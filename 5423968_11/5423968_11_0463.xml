   <p>At a meeting held October 15th in the Home of the Polish Women's Alliance, through the initiative of Mrs. H. Paderewski, there was established the Polish Army Aid Society, having as its aim (the desire) to provide the aforesaid army with the most indispensable needs, such as sweaters, socks, gloves, belts, etc., therefore I, the undersigned, have resolved to appeal to the Polish Roman-Catholic Union for a donation for wool, etc.</p>
   <p>So then at a meeting held October 30th, the administration of the Union resolved to assign the sum of $1,000 for the name of the said society, whereas there was to be held a celebration of consecrating Camp Kosciuszko, and because of this occasion the representatives of the Union should have been likewise present. After an understanding with the president of the Army Aid Society, there had been bought ready made sweaters and socks to the sum of $229.90, and have been delivered to the camp for the soldiers on November 3rd. Besides that, an order had been placed for sweaters amounting to $432.00 and socks amounting to $80.00 which likewise will be sent out in the name of the Polish <pb facs="5423968_11_0464.jpg" n="2"/>Roman-Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>All of this totaling to the sum of $741.90 are articles coming directly from the Union.</p>
   <p>The remaining sum of $258.10 has been placed in the hands of Mrs. A. Neumann, president of Polish Army Aid Society, for wool, which will be delivered in a short while.</p>
   <p>The women who would like to help us in our work, can call at the library of the Polish Women's Alliance on Tuesdays and Wednesdays after 9 A. M.</p>
   <p>While rendering the above report simultaneously as vice-president of that society, I am appealing to all Sisters of the Union to add their offerings, whether personal or those resolved at meetings of societies.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0465.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Remember, dear sisters, that our soldiers are offering their lives in defence of our Fatherland and that it is our duty to carry them such aid as is possible for us. All gifts and inquiries should be sent to the Bureau of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, into the hands of the vice-president.</p>
   <p>Mary Osuch.</p>
