   <p>Yesterday evening a meeting was held in the building of the Polish Women's Alliance on North Ashland Avenue to discuss the Chelm matter, which is attracting a great deal of attention and about which we have already written many times. The following organizations were represented at the meeting: The Polish Women's Alliance (by Mrs. A. Neuman, Mrs. E. Napieralska, Mrs. Kadow, Mrs. Szeszycka, Mrs. M. Kuflewska, Mrs. Z. Jankiewicz); the Polish National Alliance (by Messrs. Leon Mallek, N. K. Zlotnicki, and J. Szymanski); and the Polish Roman Catholic Union by Messrs. [S.] Adamkiewicz, and J. Czekala, and Dr. Anna Wyczolkowska, the authoress of the appeal). Mrs. A. Neuman acted as chairman and Miss E. Napieralska as secretary. The secretary read the appeal which is to be sent to the representatives of governments and other well-known personages, urging them to voice their opposition against this fourth partition of Poland.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the appeal, Dr. Anna Wyczolkowska addressed the audience to explain why the Polish women should be the first to voice their opposition <pb facs="5423968_11_0599.jpg" n="2"/>against this new political crime. She said that after annexing Chelm, the Russian government would want to annex the state of Suwalki, and then the state of Lublin. Dr. Wyczolkowska recommended that a general mass meeting should be called.</p>
   <p>Mr. Adamkiewicz recommended complete union on this matter so that the protest may be general. He stated that a general mass meeting should be arranged as soon as possible in order to arouse the interest of influential Americans in this matter.</p>
   <p>Mr. Leon Mallek, director of the Polish National Alliance, voiced the same opinion, recommending that a general mass meeting should be held as soon as possible. Mr. N. K. Zlotnicki was also in favor of a mass meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Szymanski, director of the Polish National Alliance, suggested that a mass meeting be held for the purpose of electing a committee composed of members of all the Polish organizations in Chicago, this committee to prepare a resolution which should be announced in the papers. Similar mass meetings should be arranged <pb facs="5423968_11_0600.jpg" n="3"/>throughout the United States.</p>
   <p>Those gathered were told to explain the matter at the meetings of the boards of directors of their organizations, so that these may take steps to send their delegates, from among whom the general committee will be chosen.</p>
   <p>The press committee should publish in the papers an appeal to organizations. The following persons were elected members of the press committee: Dr. Anna Wyczolkowska, N. K. Zlotnicki, Emily Napieralska, Adamkiewicz, and Leon Mallek.</p>
   <p>It was decided that Dr. Wyczolkowska should prepare an appeal to all the publications and organizations. The nature of this appeal will be discussed this evening at the committee meeting to be held at the Polish Women's Alliance building.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be held at 7:30 P. M., Tuesday, December 26, at the Polish Women's Alliance building.</p>
