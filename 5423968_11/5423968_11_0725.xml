   <p>The news that the treaty with Russia, which was proclaimed Tuesday, is free from objectionable paragraphs, is false. After reading the treaty word by word, we find that none of the objectionable parts have been omitted. As proof, we cite a few examples below.</p>
   <p>In Article II, the crimes for which offenders are to be extradited are listed. It is plainly stated therein that not only actual offenders but also individuals who have attempted the perpetration of any of the crimes listed are to be extradited. Excluding such things as burglary, murder, and arson, there are a few points to which we would like to call attention. We read: "5) Falsification and use of falsified governmental or otherwise official documents."</p>
   <p>Although Article III contains a clause that individuals will not be extradited <pb facs="5423968_11_0726.jpg" n="2"/>if their offense is proved to be political, the following is added:</p>
   <p>"An attempt upon the life of any governmental official, or member of any official's family, if this attempt is made for the purpose of murdering, assassinating, or poisoning said official or member of his family, is not to be regarded as a political offense."</p>
   <p>Thus, the objectionable clauses, on which Russia can base demands for the extradition of political offenders, remain. The above-mentioned paragraph 5, of Article II, makes it obligatory for the United States to surrender to the Russian government individuals who have falsified passports. What sort of methods the Russian courts will use to make it appear that every political offender is guilty of an attempt upon the Czar's life, we know well; it is unnecessary to set forth the dangers which will now assail political fugitives from Russia.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0727.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The near future will undoubtedly show how Russia intends to make use of this newly proclaimed treaty. Let us have hope that the United States Government will reconsider and, upon Russia's first attempt to make political use of the treaty, denounce this disgraceful pact.</p>
