<title level="a">CZAR'S PICTURE BURNED AT CHICAGO POLISH BALLY RESOLUTIONS HOPE FOR DEFEAT OF RUSSIA AS ENEMY OF LIBERTY SYMPATHY FOR SERVIA</title></bibl>

   <p>Two thousand excited Poles seized a picture of the Czar and burned it along with copies of the Polish National Daily, which has pro-Russian tendencies, after a meeting which overflowed Walsh's Hall at Milwaukee Ave. and Division St., last night. The meeting was under the auspices of the Polish National Defense Committee.</p>
   <p>Following, in part, are the resolutions adopted: "There is every reason for all the Poles to wish and to hope that Russia be defeated in this war. And we wish it and hope for it, together with all the lovers of liberty, of progress and enlightenment. We are not concerned as to who is opposing Russia in this conflict. We are neither for Germany nor Austria; we are against Russia as a mortal enemy of Poland and a factor for evil in the life of humanity as a whole.</p>
   <p>"Servia will not suffer through the defeat of Russia. She will be freed, together with other smaller Slavic nationalities, from the real danger of being cheated and finally swallowed by Russia, as Poland was a century ago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0591.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"We believe that the future of Poland lies presently in opposing Russia and applying the whole power of the Polish people to the necessary work of reducing Russia to her natural dimensions."</p>
   <p>After reciting Poland's grievances against Prussia, particularly the expropriation of Polish landholders for the benefit of the German colonists, the resolutions conclude:</p>
   <p>"What we want and hope that Poland will achieve through this war is freedom and independence; not a part of Poland, but the whole."</p>
