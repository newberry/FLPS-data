   <p>With this question the enemies of our nation are very often occupied, the descendant of those who once perpetrated murder on our Fatherland, and those who are being persecuted today and deprived of peace by the sight of the murdered Poland.</p>
   <p>Almost everyone will understand that our enemies would like to answer this question in the negative, they crave that they could say with deep conviction that there will never be any Poland; that our beloved Fatherland will never be resurrected and never will it press close to its heart its unfortunate children. But their own conviction tells them differently. Their conviction - like the trumpet of an archangel - sounds to them that there will be a Poland because it has to be, and such an opinion one can read quite often in the German newspapers. And to ourselves what does our own conviction tell us?</p>
   <p>In the hard times in which we are now living - at a time of persecution when a faithless fee treads with his feet upon our most sacred rights and <pb facs="5423968_11_0641.jpg" n="2"/>along with this he spouts into our eyes a venom of derision - at such time, so much more oftener, so much more impetuously must be awakened in our hearts the question: "Oh, God will Poland be free? Our God and Lord, will you return our Fatherland? Will you give our nation once more its freedom?"</p>
   <p>And at once an answer is awakened within us: a voice of conviction with a long, far away echo stirs up within us, "Most certainly you are our God and Father; most certainly you are just - you will, you will punish the enemies of the Polish nation, you will give us a future - better and more fortunate."</p>
   <p>Even the one among us who might resemble the doubting Thomas; even he must believe in the future freedom of Poland when he calls to mind the history of the Greeks, Serbs and Bulgarians. Indeed - also those nations for hundreds of years greaned under the yoke of bondage and endured from the side of the Turks more terrific persecutions and cruelties than ourselves from our oppressors. They were being annihilated for hundreds of years by murder and conflagration- this our enemies - under the present time of culture, cannot do.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0642.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In spite of that the Greeks and even the Serbs and Bulgarians - after several hundred years of slavery - regained their political liberty,even though these nations stand much lower in regard to culture than we do, and they haven't the history or literature that we have.</p>
   <p>So much the more we should believe in the future freedom of our Polish nation, that nation which always was a bulwark of Christianity, that nation which has such a glorious history, such excellent literature, which in spite of the partition of Poland, with defiance of its partitioners feels as one nation, in spite of present day oppression and persecution it is growing, flourishing and is eager to fulfill the great problems which the future night bring it. Such a nation must and will be free, even if we believe that its liberation will result in another way than the freeing of the Greeks, Serbs and Bulgarians was brought about.</p>
   <p>Our poet justly says, "A great nation might fall but only a vile one can be lest." And the Polish nation fell when it was great, but the Polish nation will not perish, because even if within its fold are vile individuals <pb facs="5423968_11_0643.jpg" n="4"/>who care only about themselves and their affairs and not about their Fatherland, even then the Polish nation is not such in its entirety and for that it must be free.</p>
   <p>Finally, even the persecutions and oppressions, such as are at the present time heaped upon us by our enemies, even the tortures administered by them, are somehow a guarantee of the future freedom of Poland.</p>
   <p>As we have mentioned above, even our very fees themselves believe in a future Poland, but they also know that Poland can only exist there, where Polish people live and Polish language resounds. That is why they are opressing us, that is why they are endeavoring to do away with the sound of the Polish language in our land, so that upon it should dwindle, perish and the Polish people be lest, because them there will never be any Poland.</p>
   <p>But the Polish people will hear it all, will weather all of it, because they believe that there is a God in heaven - therefore Poland will be.</p>
   <p>The Polish nation does not intend to turn to violence, does not intend <pb facs="5423968_11_0644.jpg" n="5"/>to start a revolution, even if for example the Prussian Pole-haters are trying some way to force it upon us. We believe that without violence on our part, and without a bloody Polish revolution, our Fatherland must be freed.</p>
   <p>When the measure is overfilled with atrocities and crime of the mighty in this world, then the lightning of the wrath of God will strike them from the heights of the skies, demolish their power, and meanwhile God with his powerful arm will crush the chains of the enslaved nations. The wave of God's wrath like a storm, never remembered by mankind, will blast like the wind through the world and will crush the miserable foundations of present day society. And amid these societies God will erect a Poland free and equal among other free and equal nations.</p>
   <p>When will this happen? When will the morning - dawn of liberty shine upon the heavens? Will we live to see that time or our children, our grand-children, or some other generation?</p>
   <p>That time, sacred and great only the Almighty God knows, but the Polish nation will live to see that time in reality, if they preserve within them <pb facs="5423968_11_0645.jpg" n="6"/>that faith in God and the faith in their own personal liberty. Therefore, let that faith be kept alive in every one of its members, so that nothing will be able to dislodge it. Let this faith pass on from generation to generation, and it shall live to be rewarded.</p>
   <p>For that also you, brothers, you beloved Polish people, you most just and faithful guardians of national holiness inculcate that faith in the hearts of your children and teach them to earn their future liberty by faith, work, and prayer, and when you kneel in the morning and evening to pray, together with your children, back there to add to their usual prayers, the plea: "God give freedom to our Fatherland: God, save Poland: Queen of the Polish crown, pray for us, intercede for us!"</p>
