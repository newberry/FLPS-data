   <p>On the evening of June 6, a banquet was held in honor of the silver wedding anniversary of Professor and Mrs. William B. Day, at the Sherman Hotel. Professor Day is director and secretary of the University of Illinois School of Pharmacy faculty, and the banquet was arranged by the Alumni Association of the School of Pharmacy. At this banquet, eight prizes were awarded to students for proficiency in their studies.</p>
   <p>The gold medal offered by the Alumni Association for the highest average (over 95) was awarded to Miss Josephine M. Dyniewicz. This is the first gold medal to be awarded in ten years. During the course of these years, none of the students attained an average of more than 95.</p>
   <p>The second prize, a valuable microscope for use in pharmacology and materia medica, offered annually by Herman Fry, was awarded to Miss Harriet A. Dyniewicz, who also attained an average of over 95, though slightly less <pb facs="5423968_11_0927.jpg" n="2"/>than her sister.</p>
   <p>[List of persons (non-Poles) who received other awards omitted by translator.]</p>
   <p>Miss Harriet, who is twenty-one years of age and Miss Josephine, who is eighteen, are daughters of Edwin M. Dyniewicz, responsible official in the Department of Internal Revenue and Mrs. Anna (nee Lewandowski) Dyniewicz, and granddaughters of the venerable publisher, Walter Dyniewicz.</p>
   <p>This year's class consists of seventy-eight men and eight women students. Among the men there is one Pole, Richard Kaminski, and among the women, three Polish girls, the above-mentioned sisters and Miss B. Ostrowski, sister of Doctor Ostrowski of Hammond, Indiana.</p>
   <p>The exercises closing the school year will be held at the Studebaker Theater on June 9, at 10:30 in the morning; students from the colleges of Medicine, <pb facs="5423968_11_0928.jpg" n="3"/>Dentistry, and Pharmacy of the University of Illinois will participate.</p>
   <p>Our sincere congratulations to the young ladies who received the awards, and to their parents.</p>
