<title level="a">THE ARCHBISHOP OF CHICAGO AND THE POLISH CAUSE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Chicago archdiocese, as is known, has lately received a new Archbishop, who heeding the papal injunction, is adding his share to the offerings for Poland which are being collected through the world. The fact that this collection is being taken at the very inception of the Archbishop's incumbency in office, remarks the Dziennik Chicagowski, augurs well for the friendly relationship of the new Archbishop with the Poles of Chicago. Such mutual friendliness is highly important in this archdiocese, in which because of their large population the Poles occupy a prominent position. For a long time it had been impossible to arrange for the collection of offerings for Poland in the Catholic parishes of Chicago. The main reason for this was the severe and long-continued illness of the late Archbishop. His successor, however, is a young and energetic man, whose prior activities are well known, a man of highly humanitarian ideas. Therefore, moved by the misfortune of Poland, about which the press has reported so much, he has deemed it proper, as one of his very first acts upon taking over the reins of government in a new capital to proclaim a Polish Day in the archdiocese, thereby capturing Polish hearts at the outset of his career and binding them to him permanently in sincere devotion, good will, and readiness to support all the worthy causes which he may advocate hereafter.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0529.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This hearty gratitude of the Polish population is expressed by the Dziennik Chicagowski, which adds that the Archbishop is doing this as a tribute to the Polish element in Chicago, which is the largest loyally Catholic racial group in the diocese. We have already reported His Excellency the Archbishop's first action to promote the collection of offerings for Poland in our account of the audience given by him to a delegation of the Polish Clergy of Chicago. The Archbishop received the delegation with extraordinary kindness and benevolence, immediately referring to the call sent out by the Pope in the Polish cause, and he expressed his opinion that the matter should have been taken care of long ago. Since this had not been done, said he, he would with satisfaction proclaim a Polish Day as one of the first acts of his rule in Chicago.</p>
   <p>On Saturday, March 11, the Archbishop summoned the most Reverend W. Zapala, C.R., the general Secretary of the Association of Polish Clergy in America, whom he informed that April 2nd would be set aside as Polish Day, that is, the fourth Sunday in Lent, on which day in all parishes in Chicago, regardless of nationality, offerings and donations for Poland will be collected at all masses. These offerings will be turned over to the Archbishop, who will dispose of them. On the Sunday, preceedings, that is, on the third Sunday in Lent, announcement will be made from the pulpits of all churches in Chicago of the offerings to be collected on Polish Day.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0530.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In due time from the Archbishop will appear in the papers with all the above-mentioned instructions. It has already been prepared at the chancery and has been translated into various languages, used by Catholics residing in Chicago and its environs. This letter has already been sent out to the clergy with the recommendation that it be read from the pulpit in their churches on the 25th of March. His Excellency the Archbishop has informed the general secretary of the Association of Polish Clergy of all these details and besides this has turned over to him as a personal offering check for one thousand dollars together with a letter about the instructions which have been issued and the text of the Archbishop's order. This letter, composed in a simple but dignified style, attests our new Archbishop's benevolence toward the cause of Poland and his intrinsic generosity and is impressive in its effect. We cite it below.</p>
   <p>March 11, 1916.</p>
   <p>Dear Zapala!</p>
   <p>I have appointed a day and written an appeal for the collections to be taken in this diocese for the war - sufferes in Poland. I am sending you a copy of the letter to be translated into the Polish language. But I realize, how pressing is the need, and that help is required as soon as possible.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0531.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In order to co-operate in this work of relief, I am enclosing a personal donation from my own slender savings in the East. I wish that I were able to make it ten times as large, for I know of no charity that is more deserving nor any people who will more appreciate this assistance than the poor suffering people of Poland. I hope that you will find in Chicago many donors better able to give and for that reason more generous to your people.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours in Christ,</p>
   <p>George W. Mundelein,</p>
   <p>Archbishop of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The kind words of the Reverend Archbishop will make a deep impression on our hearts, and his liberal offer awakens our utmost gratitude and insures lasting remembrance of the noble donor in the hearts of Poles.</p>
