   <p>John B. Brenza was born in Nanticke, Pa. After finishing public school, he worked his way through Yale, where he graduated and received his LL.B. degree in 1909, and his LL.M. degree in 1910, during which year he was admitted to the bar.</p>
   <p>In 1915, he organized the Metropolitan State Bank with a capital stock of $25,000, which was increased to $200,000 in 1920. A remarkable feature is that while the deposits the first year were very small, the last published statement shows a surplus of $200,000; undivided profits - $82,000; and deposits - $3,223,087.31, mostly in savings accounts.</p>
   <p>In 1916, Mr. Brenza organized the Pioneer Fire Insurance Co., of which he is secretary. This is said to be one of Chicago's oldest fire insurance companies. He is vice-president and general counsel for the Pullman Ice Co.</p>
   <p>In politics, Mr. Brenza is a republican. He is a member of the Yale Club of Chicago, Olympia Fields Country Club, and the leading Polish societies.</p>
