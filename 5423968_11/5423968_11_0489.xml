   <p>The [Polish] National Museum at Rapperschwil, [Switzerland], is on the brink of ruin. This national institution, dear to the heart of every Pole because it contains the tomb of Kosciusko and other [historical] treasures, has a debt which already exceeds 65,000 francs. If this debt is not paid and the credit of the institution becomes exhausted, the National Museum at Rapperschwil will have to close. Then the building that houses the museum will be turned over to the rats and mice, which will eat the valuable books, manuscripts, and national memorials. In addition, it is possible that these valuable mementos and treasures may be stolen if the administrative staff of the museum ceases to guard them, a thing which it will be forced to do for lack of funds.</p>
   <p>Not long ago Professor W. Lutoslawski made an earnest appeal to the generosity of our readers through Dziennik Zwiazkowy. In the name of Kosciusko, whose heart rests in the museum at Rapperschwil, Professor Lutoslawski called upon all men of good will to place the most lasting wreath on the grave of Kosciusko, <pb facs="5423968_11_0490.jpg" n="2"/>on the one-hundredth anniversary of his death, by rescuing the National Museum from ruin.</p>
   <p>"We must make an earnest effort," wrote Professor W. Lutoslawski at that time from Switzerland, "in order to save this Polish [historical] treasure. Several thousand dollars are needed [now] to pay the most pressing debts; later at least four thousand dollars will be needed yearly for the most modest upkeep of the museum."</p>
   <p>If this earnest effort is to be made, the Polish immigrants in the United States should be the first to make it. If this most lasting wreath is to be laid on the grave of Kosciusko, the Polish immigrants in the [United] States will lay it, and by united efforts will save the Polish museum at Rapperschwil from ruin.</p>
   <p>We all clearly understand that it was not bad management on the part of the museum's administrative staff but the war which is responsible for the fact that today the museum has no funds for caretakers or upkeep. At any rate, when a <pb facs="5423968_11_0491.jpg" n="3"/>sick person is lying on his deathbed, the thing to do is to get busy and try to save his life and not to ask him what caused his illness.</p>
   <p>Cannot several thousand individuals be found among us, our groups, societies, parishes, etc., who could contribute one dollar to rescue our National Museum at Rapperschwil? Cannot several hundred thousand persons be found in the United States who could contribute one little quarter to save Kosciusko's tomb?</p>
   <p>If not, then the always generous readers of Dziennik Zwiazkowy will [not] show themselves apathetic and indifferent to a national cause. They should be able to make the necessary contribution alone, without any outside help, and they must not allow the National Museum at Rapperschwil to fall into ruin.</p>
   <p>Today we are beginning a separate list of contributions for this cause, in which we will acknowledge all contributions sent by mail or brought personally to the offices of Dziennik Zwiazkowy, 1406-08 West Division Street, or to the treasurer of the Polish National Alliance, Mr. J. Magdziarz, at the same address.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0492.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Group 712 of the Polish National Alliance has already made a beginning and has answered the appeal to save the National Museum by contributing five dollars to this cause. Other groups and societies will follow this example. Our readers also will contribute their little leaves to this "most lasting wreath" which Dziennik Zwiazkowy will place on Kosciusko's tomb on the one-hundredth anniversary of his death.</p>
   <p>Therefore, to action! Let us give quickly for he who gives at once gives double. Time is short. We must save the Polish Museum at Rapperschwil from ruin. Who will be next?</p>
