   <p>The Polish Patriotic Organization's meeting that took place yesterday at four o'clock is worthy of notice.</p>
   <p>We can omit such details as committee reports, financial reports, etc., and come immediately to those matters which we feel are of real importance. The Organization made a very noble gesture, which is deserving of the highest recognition. It has decided to pay all the expenses that have arisen and will yet arise from the Polish protest against the American extradition treaty with Russia.</p>
   <p>Further, the holiday of the Polish Queen's Crown falls on April 1. In order to honor its patron saint, the Organization is preparing a huge celebration for April 8 (delayed because of the Easter holidays).</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0740.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In addition, we find it necessary to mention the program that followed yesterday's meeting, which consisted of a lecture; music, and declamations. A very interesting and exhaustive lecture on the life and works of John Kochanowski was delivered by Mr. Klarkowski. Mr. A. Kwasigroch rendered a beautiful vocal number, and Messrs. John Kikulski and Jozwiakowski declaimed with inspiration. All contributors to the program were applauded generously.</p>
