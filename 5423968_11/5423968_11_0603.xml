   <p>The Alliance of Polish Falcons in America received the following appeal:</p>
   <p>"Countrymen, brothers in all sincerely nationalistic societies here and in foreign lands beyond our borders, to you we appeal confident in the well-known generosity of the Polish people. Come to our aid, because our group at present finds itself without shelter.</p>
   <p>"The Falcons at Mogilno (Poland), after the resurrection of this group from years of sleep and lethargy, showed at the last convention of August 6, 1911, that they have awakened to new exertions toward a renaissance.</p>
   <p>"Through May, June, and July a kind member let us use a meadow in which we could train, but the authorities denied us even this bit of free space for the good of our willing and energetic members, because training is not permitted in the open air.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0604.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"We have no gymnasium of any sort, not even the most modest place, and it leeks as the though we will net be able to practice even the permitted exercises during the winter. We are in a terrible situation. Our group consists of seventy members, more than forty of whom train. Recently a ladies' auxiliary was organized. Therefore, no other course is open to us except to appeal to you for even the smallest contributions. Many a nickle makes a mickle.</p>
   <p>"We wish to build a gymnasium in the spring, a very modest one, because the spirit is strong within us. Help us do this, brothers, countrymen! What you give us new in our need, we will return when we grow stronger, as soon as you call to us in your need.</p>
   <p>"We ask all of you, in Galicia, the Kingdom of Poland, America, all the Falcon groups, and all of you kind clergy, to send contributions. Please send your donations care of Teefil Szkopek, our secretary, Mogilno, Posen.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0605.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"In any event, we ask you to inform the undersigned board of directors of any contributions by mailing the enclosed card. Acknowledgements will be published in the Falcon, in Posen, or in the Falcons' Gymnastic Guide, in Lwow.</p>
   <p>"The board of directors of the Gymnastic Society Falcons, Mogilno, Lipa Square, Poland.</p>
   <p>"Felix Jarecki, president, Mogilno, Lipa Square.</p>
   <p>"Felix Serafinowski, vice-president.</p>
   <p>"Teofil <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, treasurer.</p>
   <p>"Maximilian Bialecki, secretary."</p>

   <p>Dear Brothers and Sisters! We know only too well the difficulties with which the Polish Falcons are beset under German domination. The [German] government does not choose between means in order to make this fine organization impotent and to place obstructions in the way of the development of specific groups. In spite of all these persecutions by Prussia, the Polish Falcon lives, grows stronger, and marches on, even if with slow steps. Not all the outposts in Posen, however, are in a position to meet alone these abominable adversities. Many of these outposts in Posen are seriously threatened, as may be seen from the appeal that appears in this article--an appeal which clearly explains the situation in which the group at Mogilno, in the Grand Duchy of Posen, finds itself.</p>
   <p>Will we permit their downfall? No. This we must not do! Just as every Pole under German domination defends on principle every foot of Polish ground, so the Polish Falcons, whether they be in Europe or America, should defend every possession of the Falcons, every one of its outposts. Considering that every group under German domination is a stronghold of our <pb facs="5423968_11_0607.jpg" n="5"/>national spirit against the tide of Germanization, considering that the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America should co-operate in the defensive actions of the Falcons and similar national institutions in Europe, the board of directors of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America, at its meeting of November 17, made an exception and resolved to aid this particular group, appropriating ten dollars from the treasury of the Alliance for the support of the Falcon group at Mogilno, in the Grand Duchy of Posen.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that all the groups of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America will follow the example of the board of directors and will come to the aid of the group at Mogilno, even with small contributions, in order that the latter may have, if not a roof over their heads, at least a permanent piece of land on which, in spite of German prohibition, they may be able to train. All contributions should be sent to the treasurer of the Alliance of Polish Falcons, Mr. Latuszewski, 2220 West North Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0608.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>For every one of these truly national contributions, each group will acknowledgement in the Falcon.</p>
   <p>For the board of directors of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in America,</p>
   <p>John Kikulski, president.</p>
   <p>Henry Lokanski, secretary-general.</p>
