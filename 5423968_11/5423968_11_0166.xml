   <p>An article entitled "Kolonizacya Drugiego Stopnia" (Second Degree Colonization) appeared in a recent issue of the Lwow publication, The Emigration Review. The article deals with the thought that the Poles living in America (almost two million) left their homeland principally for economic reasons, thus giving our settlement here a purely economic character. It suggests that the Polish-American colony should acquire political characteristics, that it should organize not only nationalistically, but politically as well.</p>
   <p>The colonization which the Emigration Review terms "second degree" finds numerous precedents in history. Portions of a people have often settled upon foreign shores, forming a colony with a definite national and political character. The article directly proposes that the Poles in America settle at least one state, so that that state will be entirely Polish. As the state best suited for this, it suggests Washington. We quote from the Emigration Review:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0167.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The beginning of a colonization policy on a large scale in the United States may well become an epoch in emigrational history; it need only to call attention to a unity of action and to direct such action to a particular territory. The State of Washington would be the most suitable. With an area of 181,391 square miles, it has a population of barely 350,000. Its climate is moderate, similar to that of Poland; its soil is fertile. The terrain is principally mountainous and wooded. It produces iron ore, hard coal, gold, silver, etc. The people engage in farming, fishing, and trading in lumber. The State has before it a very promising future.</p>
   <p>"Even the most stubborn opponents of colonization activities cannot take offense at this project, since it would not encourage emigration from Poland, but would merely be a rational settlement of those Poles already in America. The project expresses the real demands of the present time and is the necessary result of today's social and economic conditions; its realization is the salient problem of society.</p>
   <p>"Our countrymen across the ocean," concludes the Emigration Review, "would serve the Polish cause well if they took up the idea....of establishing <pb facs="5423968_11_0168.jpg" n="3"/>upon the shores of the Pacific Ocean, directly opposite Siberia, a new Poland. Such a new Poland, united in blood and spirit with the old, flourishing within the United States under the starry banner of a free and powerful republic, would work with its homeland for the realization of its ideals of liberty and justice."</p>
   <p>Although this article appears in so sane a paper as the Lwow daily Review, we who are better acquainted with conditions here, ought to point out that such a project, however noble its purpose, cannot be executed. In a natural way, spontaneously, it cannot be accomplished for lack of strength, lack of necessity for such a project in our American society; if it were attempted to put the project in force by other means, it would cost millions--and the results would be doubtful.</p>
   <p>Fantastic schemes for a "new Poland" have appeared in America before this; none attracted any general interest. The idea of a new Poland within these United States, in the face of the superior civilization, the unusual strength, the tendency toward centralization here, is in every respect, impracticable.</p>
