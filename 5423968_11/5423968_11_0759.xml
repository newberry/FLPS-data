   <p>Today marks the memorable anniversary of the November Insurrection of 1830 [the Poles rose against Russian oppression]. It has always been honorably celebrated, and today it is being venerated in all Polish churches with prayer for the souls of our brothers who have given their lives for the fatherland. Commemoration exercises are also being held in various halls. Independent of this, we would like to write a few words about the meaning of this historic anniversary.</p>
   <p>The rising of 1830-31, a powerful patriotic movement against the oppression of Russia, who had disregarded and broken every guarantee, came to a sudden end, and in its wake brought greater hardships to the Polish people. The responsibility for this disaster falls upon those who did not know how to handle this universal movement. At the same time, during the course of the decisive moment, there was too much opposition from the gentry on the matter of giving the <pb facs="5423968_11_0760.jpg" n="2"/>peasants the rights which in the name of justice were due them. The blame falls equally on disagreement and on the personal dishonesty of the leaders.....</p>
   <p>We who have received the burden of the downfall from our fathers have the task of rebuilding our fatherland. The lesson of the past should be clear to us: only the people as a whole, people with equal rights and equal culture, will be able to win independence; the struggle will be successful only when the people cast away their disputes, brawls and hatred, and join hands and hearts with a feeling of sincere brotherly love. This is the lesson that the negative side of the November Insurrection gives us.</p>
   <p>But there is also a positive side.....We must not forget the heroism and the sacrifices of the tens of thousands who have spilt their blood and lost their lives for faith and fatherland. After the downfall thousands walked to their exile in Siberia in silence.</p>
   <p>The ashes of these valorous heroes should, especially in this faraway land, <pb facs="5423968_11_0761.jpg" n="3"/>recall our national obligations. Let us defend and guard our faith, language and nationality! Those heroes of yesteryear have given up their lives for this defense. All that is required on this free soil, where no one oppresses us, is a little good will.</p>
   <p>Let us always remain Poles, preserve our religion and native tongue, retain in our hearts warm love for the fatherland, and be prepared in case of need not only to talk but to act--in this way we will show ourselves to be worthy sons of the heroes and martyrs of the November Insurrection.</p>
