   <p>Every time Dziennik Chicagoski urged the Poles to support the Democratic party and vote against the Republicans, it always pointed out that the latter, besides their many other defects, are saturated with the ideas of the nativists and of the Know-nothing party. Because of this, the Republicans harbor a burning hatred toward all those who were not born in this country, that is, the foreign element that lives in America.</p>
   <p>It is a well-known fact that practically all the Polish-American population is part of this influx of foreign citizens. That is why the Republican party is opposed to the Polish element and why it does not want to make concessions to them. If the Republicans make them concessions at times, <pb facs="5423968_11_0179.jpg" n="2"/>it is only to gain their purpose, but after it is gained the Poles are ignored and oppressed.</p>
   <p>The matter is plainly relative to the Republican hatred toward the foreigners. This was shown before elections, when, if anyone brought the question up, he was quieted by a salvo from the Republican haranguers. That is why our reference to the nativists and their principles received, prior to the elections, stubborn opposition from a number of Polish newspapers which had sold themselves to the Republicans.</p>
   <p>"It is untrue," cried out this and that paper....."The Republicans hold the Poles in esteem.....Present proof that the Republicans hate them."</p>
   <p>Such proof can be decisively presented.</p>
   <p>Today, after elections, when the people have declared their will and the next elections are far off, the Republicans no longer are restraining themselves <pb facs="5423968_11_0180.jpg" n="3"/>nor are they locking their mouths with a key....They say what they think about the Poles and others.</p>
   <p>Here is evidence: A few days after the election a reporter of the local paper Morning News Record interviewed Secretary of State Foster and his colleague (we do not wish to disclose his name), two outstanding representatives of the Republican party, about the last election and the future of the party.</p>
   <p>Secretary Foster informed the reporter that the Republican party did not suffer in the least. He and his friend went on to discuss various political issues in the United States.</p>
   <p>.....The Secretary's friend remarked that the country was overrun with foreigners and beggars, and that this condition demanded their extermination. Secretary Foster confirmed this statement. His friend further stated that there are more Swedes in this country than in Sweden and more Poles than <pb facs="5423968_11_0181.jpg" n="4"/>in Poland; that the aim of the Republican party is to find some means whereby to decrease the tremendous flow of immigrants from afflicted Europe. This was also confirmed by the Secretary.</p>
   <p>Although short, it is clear. Foster and his friend (perhaps Harrison) no longer mask themselves after the election. They say openly and clearly, in the name of the Republican party, that there are too many poor Poles and other political paupers in America, that it is necessary to get rid of them, and that the further flow of immigration must be checked..... They are even so ungrateful that they [do not] exclude the Swedes from this "extermination," even though the latter are staunch supporters of the Republican party.</p>
   <p>This frankness is very praiseworthy! It will benefit not only the Poles but also those who have not as yet been embraced by the nativists' mania....They will benefit [them] four years from now at the new elections, when the Republicans come begging for their votes.</p>
