   <p>Human beings are so constituted, the Poles in particular, that when conditions become so unfavorable as to seem beyond endurance, any trifle awakens in them many entirely unfounded hopes.</p>
   <p>An example of this can be found in the Prussian annexation. In this connection, the press has given rise to some obscure rumors among the people to the effect that the Prussian government intends to make some political changes that will affect the Poles.</p>
   <p>From where do these hopes originate? Upon what are these suppositions based? Truthfully speaking, nothing has occurred that would justify the Prussian Poles' hopes for a turn for the better in the near future.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt that this change must come about at some time. Why, the <pb facs="5423968_11_0620.jpg" n="2"/>whole world moves ahead, every new day bringing its share, however little, to human progress. In other words, humanity perfects itself, so that even the Germans must at some time become [a better] people or else there will be no place for them in human society. But this is a matter of a very distant future, of which it is useless even to think in the presence of a battle of life and death in the Prussian part of Poland.</p>
   <p>The prophets of the now course to be taken by Prussian politics base their prophecies upon several facts which, in their opinion, are to be the first rays of a rising sun. In the first place, the Prussian government has not dispossessed any Pole so far, and nothing is heard that it intends to do so in the future. Secondly, a permit was granted to the Polish National University in Posen, [founded] under the auspices of Mickiewicz, to offer courses. Furthermore, the conservative German press is not so intensely antagonistic toward the Poles as before, and even the semiofficial publications observe a greater restraint. Finally, Emperor William, during the dedication ceremony of his now palace in Posen, made no mention of <pb facs="5423968_11_0621.jpg" n="3"/>annihilating the Poles. He only made a brief statement that Posen and its environs are German property.</p>
   <p>That is all, It is so little that one would have to be a mad optimist to build hopes upon this unstable basis. Yet there are some who build something even upon this sand. They care little if their hopes are swept away by a small gust from Berlin, to be replaced with something new and worse.</p>
   <p>A great harm is done to the Poles in Prussian Poland by those who tantalize them with the hope that the Prussians will conduct themselves better. She Prussians will conduct themselves properly only when civilized humanity will grasp them by the threat with its powerful arm, so firmly that they will be unable to breathe. But this will not happen in the very near future.</p>
   <p>Undaunted energy, all the resources of patriotism found in the Polish soul, complete sacrifice--all this is necessary to conduct a successful battle for national existence. It is a difficult and burdensome battle, as it consists of the small efforts made daily by millions of people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0622.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Prussian knows the character of the Poles. He is aware that when his persecution causes the opposition of the Poles to attain its peak, it is best to relax for a while, to withdraw his claws, and to appear as if he were exhausted. Immediately thereafter, one will find certain people among the Poles who will start shouting. "He is not here. He has gone and there is nothing to fear; now we can play." As soon as the people, misled by these optimists, relax their opposition, the old wolf leaps again from his ambush and causes another slaughter among the lambs.</p>
   <p>There were two people--one a Pole and the other a German--who played a great role in their respective countries. Even today they are considered as masters, each in his own sphere. One of them knew the Germans perfectly; the other knew the Poles equally as well. Each of them left certain instructions to his own people.</p>
   <p>Mickiewicz wrote the following: "....but the Tentonic monster will not be appeased." He was aware that there could be no pacts or hope with the Germanic ogre, which will devour whosoever fails to oppose it with all his strength.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0623.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>And Frederick, called by Germans "the Great," wrote: "I am not so much concerned in gaining the good will of the Poles as I am in uprooting them." This same Frederick later wrote: "It is necessary to get rid of the Poles, because one German is more dear to me than this entire Polish nation."</p>
   <p>He also knew that no compromise could be reached with the Poles living on the land taken away from them by force. The only solution was to uproot them from their soil, or, if they refused to move willingly, to destroy them completely. His purpose was to denationalize them, to transform them into Germans.</p>
   <p>That is all there is to it. The gist of the whole Polish-Prussian or Prussian-Polish politics is contained in the words of these two men, each considered as great in the eyes of his respective nation. It does not matter whether the Prussians disposses the Poles or not, or whether they curse or praise them in their articles or their talks, or whether they flog or pet them--the fact still remains that they always do one and the same thing, that is, they conduct themselves according to the notion of their <pb facs="5423968_11_0624.jpg" n="6"/>great king. The tactics may change from day to day, according to the circumstances, but the aim is always the same.</p>
   <p>The Pole, regardless of the suffering he must endure at the hands of the Prussians, should always remember the words of Mickiewicz, that as long as the Tentonic monster exists we must fight against it. We should also adapt our tactics to the prevailing circumstances. We must fight at all times and never allow ourselves to be ensnared by any promises or false hopes, by any narcotics dosed out to numb our alertness and to weaken our opposition.</p>
