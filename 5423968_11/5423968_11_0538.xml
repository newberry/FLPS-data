   <p>For the past several months the plea of mothers and widows in Poland has echoed here in America and this plea was heard in Chicago, where the Polish element is doing all in its power to come to the aid of these unfortunates facing starvation.</p>
   <p>The Polish Merchants' Association of Chicago, fully realizes the necessity of giving aid to those unfortunate women and children, the feeble, the aged, who are in dire need of the very essential necessities of life. Therefore in order to raise money they have planned a bazaar to be held at the Polish Women's Alliance Hall, during the second week of March.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0539.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As suggested by the Right Reverend Paul Rhode a committee was organized with the aid of other fraternal organizations, and this committee appointed a reception subcommittee.</p>
   <p>The bazaar will be arranged so that each Polish neighborhood will have a designated day for its individual representation at this festivity. All proceeds of this affair,without any deduction, will be cabled to Poland on the closing night of the affair. All Poles living in the Chicago area should attend not only for the sake of entertainment and recreation, but as an expression of loyalty and sympathy towards their fellow countrymen who are suffering from privation in Europe because of war.</p>
