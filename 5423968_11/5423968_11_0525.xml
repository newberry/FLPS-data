   <p>Considering that all our Polish organizations and societies, as well as all true Poles personally, are endeavoring, as much as possible, to help our fellow countrymen in Poland suffering from hunger and all kinds of misery by collecting offerings for this cause; and,</p>
   <p>Considering that the periodical Free Poland, edited by the Polish National Council in America in the English language, with the aim of informing those of other nationalities about the Polish question, likewise needs material help so that it may carry, as far as possible, the work about Poland, and more effectively and universally draw public attention to the Polish cause, with the aim of developing an opinion favorable to this <pb facs="5423968_11_0526.jpg" n="2"/>cause in the nations of the world, and in diplomatic and political circles; therefore,</p>
   <p>Be it resolved that the Polish Democratic League of Cook County spread its activity in the spirit of its constitution and in the field of clean Polish politics, believing that with its influence it will repeatedly be in a position to help in the realization of our aims and national problems, together with our proper associations working in this thought, further,</p>
   <p>Be it resolved that the League as its first act in this direction aid the Polish political national publication, Free Poland, supporting this national periodical, so that it might not only further spread information about our Fatherland, but so that it may be able in the future to develop in this field, struggling more effectively with its foes; finally,</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0527.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Be it resolved that we call upon all the members of the League and upon our countrymen generally, as well as those of other nationalities, with a plea that they support the funds of the publication Free Poland with their gifts, and the League make the initial offer for this noble cause.</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee of the Polish Democratic League of Cook County.</p>
   <p>F. P. Danisch, President</p>
   <p>John S. Derpa, General Secretary.</p>
