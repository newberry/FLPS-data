   <p>As some publications in the United States and Canada inform us, Canadian officials will not allow those Poles from the United States who have lived here a certain number of years without becoming citizens to enter Canada. This does not pertain to Poles passing through Canada with no intention of settling there, but to those who go there to look for work, or to settle on a farm, or to establish a business.</p>
   <p>Canada needs many healthy, strong hands to work in its tremendous fields, and therefore gladly welcomes Poles, Ruthenians, or other Slavs who have just come over from Europe, but it does not want Polish emigrants from the United States who did not become citizens of this country, even though they were entitled to citizenship.</p>
   <p>The Canadian government believes that a person who has resided for several-- <pb facs="5423968_11_0041.jpg" n="2"/>in some cases, many--years in the United States without becoming a citizen will never become a citizen of Canada, and is not worthy of being accepted into that nation. So indifferent a person is considered simply a social pariah, a simpleton, and even an enemy of the country, because although living in it he does not want to give allegiance to its flag, and he is not interested in helping to solve its social problems.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, however, the Canadian government is unjust in its condemnation of those Poles from the United States who, through no fault of their own, have been unable to obtain their citizenship papers, when it asserts that since the United States has refused to grant certain Poles the rights of citizenship, American authorities must regard these people as unworthy and undesirable, and that Canada, therefore, does not want this element within its borders. In this case the Canadian government is perpetrating an injustice, because many valiant, hard-working, honest Poles try to get citizenship papers in the United States but do not succeed, since the entire matter often depends on the caprice of the judge. At the same time the requirements for naturalization are becoming increasingly difficult to meet, and more and more immigrants <pb facs="5423968_11_0042.jpg" n="3"/>find it impossible to obtain their citizenship papers.</p>
   <p>The attitude of the Canadian government should by all means open the eyes of those Poles who have lived in the United States for a considerable length of time to the way in which they are regarded for not having become citizens of the country in which they live and will in all probability die. Canada scorns such indifferent people; citizens of the United States scorn them, since these aliens take everything, and give nothing in return, with the exception of manual labor, to the country which welcomed them and gave them political, religious, and social freedom.</p>
   <p>The negligence of the Poles about accepting American citizenship is absolutely incredible. These people are obviously afraid to renounce allegiance to the governments of the czar, the Prussians, or the Austrians, as though they liked these governments better than the government of the free American republic. Our country, Poland, certainly will not condemn any of her sons because they have renounced allegiance to the brutal governments of our oppressors in order <pb facs="5423968_11_0043.jpg" n="4"/>to accept citizenship under the Star-Spangled Banner, the symbol of freedom and human rights. Being a citizen of the United States does not in the least prevent us from loving our mother country or from working for her interests, and by becoming citizens of the United States we can accomplish a great deal for Poland through the influence we can exert on this nation's policies.</p>
   <p>There is much shouting that the Poles are discriminated against, because they cannot get their people into higher political offices. But why is this so? Few people ever discuss the real reason. We make an impression in some cities because of our large numbers, but if we were to determine how many Poles in these large groups are citizens, we would have to blush to our very ears with shame.</p>
   <p>Naturally, if this large group of Poles was composed of citizens of this country--or even if a majority of the Poles were citizens--then surely our people would <pb facs="5423968_11_0044.jpg" n="5"/>attain higher offices; they would be shown greater respect by other nationalities, and would not expose themselves to scorn and sneers. Often we gather in great crowds at political meetings, but in these crowds one could count on one's fingers the Poles who are citizens.</p>
   <p>In Chicago, for instance, it is said that there are about three hundred thousand Poles. Out of this number we should have about one hundred thousand citizens, whereas, actually, who knows whether there are even forty thousand? The same situation, if not a worse one, holds true in other cities; therefore, it is not surprising that we stand so low on the political ladder, since we do not look after our own interests.</p>
   <p>To complain about our alleged lack of solidarity, and to inveigh against the manner in which we are misrepresented and ignored by other nationalities, will not help in the least as long as we do not try to obtain citizenship and do not take an active part in the political life of this country. If there were only twice as many citizens among us as there are now, we would be found occupying <pb facs="5423968_11_0045.jpg" n="6"/>our deserved position in politics; we would then achieve solidarity, because we would have the strength of numbers on our side. At present, since we lack this strength, many Poles who are citizens must ask favors of other nationalities, because they cannot expect much aid from their own people.</p>
   <p>But we must be concerned with more than political recognition; we must not run the risk, by remaining aliens, of giving the citizens here a valid reason for scorning us and treating us as parasites. Furthermore, if we are aliens, the United States Government cannot assure us its protection when we travel beyond the borders of this country, and upon our return it is not obliged to re-admit us.</p>
   <p>An alien is looked upon here as unnecessary ballast, to be thrown overboard at the first opportunity. Therefore, he who considers his own welfare, and looks into the future, should become a citizen of the United States.</p>
