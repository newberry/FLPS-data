<title level="a">TAG DAY FOR POLISH ARMY VETERANS</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Max Adamowski, our valiant alderman from the 28th ward, came out with a motion at yesterday's meeting of the City Council, to permit the Association of the Veterans of the Polish army in America, our men who served under General Haller, to stage a "tag day" for pedestrians during the drive for the collection of a suitable fund for the management of the veterans of the Polish army.</p>
   <p>Usually such motions go to the Finance Committee, but our alderman, who knows his way around, would not allow it to be said to him that the petition of the Haller's veterans "must, according to the routine, go to the committee," but demanded in the session of the City Council that the statute in this matter immediately give way.</p>
   <p>Before opposition could appear the motion was placed before the House and it was unanimously adopted. The maneuver of Alderman Adamowski <pb facs="5423968_11_0230.jpg" n="2"/>succeeded excellently, for which he should be given public recognition, because many different organizations ask for permission for a "tag day" but cannot receive it.</p>
   <p>The "tag day," on the strength of the resolution of the City Council, will take place March 19th. The petition for the City Council was worked out and handed over to Alderman Adamowski by Frank P. Danisch, attorney for the Haller's veterans.</p>
