   <p>For a long time the supporters of Harrison tried to win over the Poles and the Bohemians as they had the Germans. At one of their meetings which took place at Milwaukee Avenue and Noble Street, several influential Poles were made vice [chairmen]. Mr. P. Kiolbassa, a very popular Pole, was chairman of that meeting. The supporters of Harrison recognized Kiolbassa's popularity among the Polish people, and for this reason asked him to act as chairman of that meeting. Later on when Harrison and his supporters withdrew from the Democratic party, and Harrison was nominated illegally for mayor, his party made an attempt to gain supporters among the Poles. The supporters of Harrison turned to Peter Kiolbassa, a popular Pole, and asked him to accept the candidacy for city clerk but Mr. Kiolbassa refused it. The Poles do not sympathize with Harrison, because he is weakening the Democratic party by his illagal candidacy and is thus helping the Republicans.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_1020.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Poles who support the Democratic platform wish to help the Democrats, even if they have to oppose the one who once had their sympathy and now has lost it because his candidacy threatens the victory of the Democratic party. Mr. Kiolbassa, considering Cregier the legal candidate refused the Harrison group's offer [rather than join the"secessionist" group, he would prefer not to hold office].</p>
   <p>At present George A. Weiss, the candidate nominated by the Democratic convention for city treasurer, has resigned and joined Harrison's faction. Therefore this office is at present vacant.</p>
   <p>Attention was called to our countryman, Peter Kiolbassa. He accepted the candidacy which was offered, and will undoubtedly be elected. American newspapers gave the incident a great deal of publicity, relating the facts and giving a biography of our popular countryman; they called him a Polish "king" and a most influential citizen on the West Side. We are certain that all Poles will vote for Mr. Kiolbassa at the time of the election.</p>
