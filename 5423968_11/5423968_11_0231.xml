   <p>Because I am leaving for Poland in a few days, I feel that it is my duty to express my appreciation to the Chicago Polonia for its kindness and the help which it has given to me in arranging for the exhibition of Polish Art in Chicago. Above all, Consul General Zygmunt Nowicki was of great help in locating, through diplomatic channels from Washington and New York, the packing boxes and in speeding up their delivery in Chicago. Officers of the Polish Women's Alliance deserve credit for permitting us free use of their reading room for the initial exhibit to Chicago Poles. The Chicago Society (Group 1450 of the Polish National Alliance), especially two of its members, Mr. Balassa and Attorney Marion G. Kudlick, was instrumental in arranging for an exhibition of these examples of Polish painting at the Chicago Art Institute, sparing neither labor nor expense to assure the success of the exhibit. Thanks to kindliness of Dr. Pietrazykowski, who was a major in General Haller's army [Translator's note: Haller commanded the volunteers from America who served in the Polish army in the World War], the pictures found temporary shelter at <pb facs="5423968_11_0232.jpg" n="2"/>his house and later at his brother Marcel's, the druggist, 924 Noble Street, whence they will be transferred in a few days to the care of the Polish National Alliance to await the disposition of the artists.</p>
   <p>Because of hard times the financial results of the exhibit were very modest, and that there was any profit at all is due entirely to a few Polish individuals in Chicago who thought it their duty to support Polish art by buying a few pictures. Dr. Balcerzak bought "The Act" by Korwin Piotrowski. Dr. C. Gieraltowski bought "The Act" by Oleander and "Flowers" by Miss Krausowna. A. J. Kowalski, cashier of the Northwestern Bank, bought "Orchids" by Porankiewicz. Mr. F. E. Lackowski bought "The Troika" by Winterowski. Dr. M. S. Mioduszewski bought "On Guard" by Rozwadowski, "Peasant House" by Wyczolkowski, "The Cossack" by Kotowski, and "Skirmish" by G. Kossak. Mr. J. Piasecki bought "By the Windmill" by J. Kossak. Dr. Pietrzykowski bought the "Epilogue of the Insurrection in Upper Silesia" for the Upper Silesian committee. Mr. W. H. Schmidt bought "Venice" by Wyrzywalski. Mr. J. F. Smulski bought "Japanese Vase" by Sonneword, "Danzig" by Gendzierski, "Two Views of Cracow" by Fabjanski, <pb facs="5423968_11_0233.jpg" n="3"/>"The Bucks" by Graczynski, "A Fan" by Axentowicz, "A Four-Horse Team" by Helcmiller, "Picking Violets" by Stachiewicz, "The Hunter" by Falat, "On the Rock" by Uziemblo, three aquarelles by Skowronski, and four sketches by Wyczolkowski, "Views of Lublin". Dr. K. Wachtel bought "View of Lwow (Lemberg) by Dobrowolski, "Eve" by Kren, "Study of a Woman" by Pstrak, "A Mare" by Jaroszynski, and "Romeo and Juliet" by Peyzner. W. Wieczorek, the druggist, bought "The Beggar" by Rybkowski and a drawing by Wyczolkowski. Mr. J. C. Zarnowiecki, the architect, bought five sketches in water color by Setkowicz and two sketches by Wyczolkowski.</p>
   <p>To all these institutions and separate individuals I give my heartiest thanks. I feel that I owe a debt of gratitude to the local Polish press, which has always gladly accepted all my communications. Thanks to the kindness and benevolence of the Polish National Alliance the pictures will be placed next Tuesday in its rooms. Pictures can now be bought, up to next Tuesday, at reduced prices. All information in regard to prices can be obtained of Dr. Pietrzykowski <pb facs="5423968_11_0234.jpg" n="4"/>, telephone Haymarket 1344.</p>
   <p>Let me repeat: pictures cannot be bought after their transfer to the rooms of Polish National Alliance and my departure for Poland.</p>
