<title level="a">FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE POLISH-AMERICAN PAVILION AT LWOW</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The following announcement has been received by Dziennik Chicagoski:</p>
   <p>"From the financial report submitted by the manager of the Polish-American Pavilion at Lwow, the Polish people can readily see that the trust placed in Adam Szwajkart was not misguided, that he carried out his duties well, and that funds entrusted to him were managed to the best of his ability.</p>
   <p>"The financial report was examined and checked by members of the Central Committee, and after careful consideration it was accepted.</p>
   <p>"The members of the Committee extended their thanks to the manager for his conscientious and diligent work and urged the secretary to make public a report to the effect that the various objections to Mr. Szwajkart by the press and certain individuals were unfounded, unjust, and unfair, and were harmful to the good work done by him.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0692.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The report kills every objection.</p>
   <p>"The Polish people were also enlightened by the report that all obligations and debts incurred at Lwow were paid. No debts were left outstanding there.</p>
   <p>"But this does not mean that the Central Committee does not have any debts at all. This is not the case. The following is the situation:</p>
   <p>"Shortly before the close of the fair in Lwow, the Committee realized that contributions by the Polish-American public would not be sufficient to cover the expenses of the Polish-American Pavilion. The Committee, desiring to save the honor of the Polish-American people, secured a loan of five hundred dollars from a local bank and a loan of one hundred dollars from the publication Nadziea (Hope), and sent the money to Lwow.</p>
   <p>"Not being, as yet, in a position to make a complete financial report, partly for reasons cited in Mr. Szwajkart's report and partly because all the returns</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0693.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>from Lwow have not been made, we are giving a tentative report of financial conditions:</p>
   <table>
    <row>
     <cell>Present amount in treasury</cell>
     <cell>$60.00</cell>
    </row>
    <row>

    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Outstanding debt</cell>
     <cell>825.00</cell>
    </row>
   </table>
   <p>"From this report it is seen that the deficit is placed at $825, which must be paid.</p>
   <p>"The Central Committee directly appeals to the Polish people of America to help this situation, and it entertains the firm hope that this help will come, with this publication of the full details.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0694.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"After a complete checkup of this report, a complete and accurate statement will be published, giving an account of all income and expenses.</p>
   <p>"In the meantime various contributions should be sent to the financial secretary, Mr. B. Klarkowski, 42 Bradley Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Leon Szopinski, secretary"</p>
