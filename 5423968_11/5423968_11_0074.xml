   <p>The United States could not dispense with immigration, and if it attempted such a movement it would face a dark and uncertain future. Such, in part, were the words of the numerous speakers at a meeting of a Methodist ladies' society known as the Women's Home Missionary Society of The Methodist Episcopal Church. This society--although it belongs to the Methodist Episcopal denomination while a majority of immigrants to America are from Roman Catholic countries--has come to the conclusion that immigration to the United States is desirable because it is a real blessing for this nation. The working-class immigrants create fortunes here by working on railroads, in mines and factories, and on farms. This was asserted with a great amount of certainty at the meeting. Convictions of this type are shared more and more by an ever-increasing number of Americans. Moreover, many opponents of immigration, who at one time used their influence to make the immigration laws more stringent, are <pb facs="5423968_11_0075.jpg" n="2"/>now of the same conviction as those mentioned above. Let us hope, therefore, that with time the remaining portion of these anti-immigration radicals will also change their convictions to favor those who--as rightly stated at the above-mentioned meeting--create the wealth of this nation.</p>
