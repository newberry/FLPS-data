   <p>N. L. Piotrowski was born in Poland. He received his early education in his native land, supplemented by further preparation at Berlin, Germany. He came to the United States in 1882, and continued his studies at Notre Dame and Valparaiso Universities, Ind. He served as professor of physics and chemistry at St. Thomas' Seminary, St. Paul, Minn. In 1897, he became assistant corporation counsel, holding that office until 1902; and in 1906, was a candidate on the democratic ticket for the office of state treasurer of Illinois. He became city attorney of Chicago in 1911, and acted in that capacity until 1915. In that year, he was sent as a special war correspondent by the Chicago-Herald and as such in 1915 and 1916, visited Poland, England, France, Italy, Russia, Austria and the Balkan states.</p>
   <p>In 1918, he organized the Great Lakes Insurance Co., of which he has since been president. This is one of the sound and substantial institutions of the city, and has enjoyed success and gratifying growth.</p>
   <p>Mr. Piotrowski has long been one of the acknowledged leaders of the Chicago Poles. From 1918 to April, 1923, he was treasurer of the national Polish committee of America for the relief of Poland.</p>
