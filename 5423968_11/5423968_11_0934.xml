   <p>We have received from the Morning Oregonian a clipping with a portrait of Mr. Modrzejewski, the world-renowned bridge designer and a description of the great bridge which he is building in Portland. The editor of that journal praises highly the work of the famous Pole, who is enjoying the fame of being the best bridge builder in America.</p>
   <p>Mr. R. Modrzejewski is the son of a Polish actress who died in California two years ago. He is a member of the Polish National Alliance, group 504, and a resident of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Besides the bridge in Portland, Ore., Mr. Modrzejewski is also building a very large bridge across the St. Lawrence river in Montreal, Canada.</p>
   <p>The old Montreal bridge that had been constructed over that river by an English engineer fell down two years ago, then the Canadian government made a contract with Mr. Modrzejewski, for constructing another bridge.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0935.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Evidently, the Canadian government considers him an expert in building bridges.</p>
   <p>Those two contracts keep Mr. Modrzejewski very busy and for that reason he is very seldom seen in Chicago, and the Poles have no opportunity to meet their distinguished countryman.</p>
