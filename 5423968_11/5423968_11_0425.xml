   <p>Brethren! At our last meeting, on the ninth of February, the unfortunate political situation which is being created by the present European war between our nations, Poland and Lithuania, who have been joined in brother-hood for centuries, was discussed in detail and with great emotion.</p>
   <p>Prussian intrigue on the one hand, and on the other hand certain Lithuanians who are Prussian sympathizers and who seek personal gain rather than the good of the people, have brought matters to such a point that Poland and Lithuania will become enemies by the dissolution of that Union which, at the cost of so much sacrifice on both sides, was effected centuries ago for the protection of both nations against the rapacity of the Teutonic Knights. Prussian plans <pb facs="5423968_11_0426.jpg" n="2"/>and intrigues would array one nation against the other, thus weakening both, so that they can more easily be swallowed by insatiable Prussian militarism, which breathes hatred for both countries.</p>
   <p>Lithuanians! Be on guard!</p>
   <p>The scheming of the Prussians [Translator's note: Literally, those who hold the robes of the Teutonic Knights] is not the will of the people in the Lithuanian cottages; it is not the voice of the honest hearts from the beloved plains and woods in the Niemen valley. It is the voice of the Kaiser's sympathizers, of whom there are plenty everywhere today; it is the voice of those who thus far have not been able to exploit the nation because they were known and held in check; it is the voice of those who are followed, as by a personal bodyguard, by the German army in spiked helmets and with fixed bayonets.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0427.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The hirelings of the Prussians, preparing their carefully thought-out schemes for the permanent destruction of the two nations most dangerous to Prussia--Poland and Lithuania--are working zealously, while we, lulled by the hope of ostensible freedom, are waiting in blithe inaction.</p>
   <p>Look back into history! From the year 1120, when the Teutonic Order of the Cross was created, Poland and Lithuania were for whole centuries subjected to the same thing that Poland and Belgium and other nations are suffering today, under the pretense that they (the Knights of the Cross) were spreading Christianity. The time came when Poland and Lithuania realized that for the good of both nations, union was indispensable. In 1386, Ladislaus Jagiello, the Lithuanian Grand Duke, married Jadwiga, the Queen of Poland--not because there was any lack of beautiful daughters of Lithuanian boyars. The Queen of Poland sacrificed her own love to marry Jagiello, for the existence of both nations depended upon the union of these royal families. This upset all of the German <pb facs="5423968_11_0428.jpg" n="4"/>plans and finally led to war--and to the great battle of Grunwald, where in 1410 the heroic Lithuanians, Poles, and Ruthenians crushed the power of the Knights with their blood. In 1569, Poland and Lithuania effected the Union of Lublin, and, by so doing, held off for centuries the misfortune that faces us today.</p>
   <p>Today, however, we lack the men of Jagiellonian times. Today, Lithuania travels another road because the Germans wish it, because there are Lithuanians who serve Germany and not Lithuania, who, in accordance with German wishes, are breaking away from the nation to which freedom from the German yoke is as dear as to the Lithuanians. Their policies seek to destroy the Union with Poland, for German plans today are the same as they were before Grunwald--to separate and create differences between two kindred nations, to create a lasting hatred between two peoples, so that they will never again stand shoulder to shoulder for their own mutual benefit, as they did in the fields of Grunwald, so that by this alone they will more easily be vanquished, this time forever.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0429.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Our voices, by the decision of the Union of Lublin Society I, are jointly the voices of Lithuanians and Poles, banded together in this Society. We cry to you, brethren: Wake up! Write! Speak! Protest against the degradation of the splendid work of the Lithuanian princes, Ladislaus and Witold, sanctified by the blood of Lithuania and the united nations! Raise your voice in warning and protest, for Lithuania, Poland, and Ruthenia, lured by a false hope of freedom at German hands, are entering a tomb upon which the blasphemous German hand is carving a false statue to freedom.</p>
   <p>For the Society:</p>
   <p>S. Zukowski, Dr. L. S. Szumkowski,</p>
   <p>F. Okulanis,</p>
   <p>J. Zelnia,</p>
   <p>A. Mazylewski,</p>
