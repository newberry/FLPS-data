   <p>The funeral of Peter Kiolbassa took place on Tuesday, June 27, 1905.</p>
   <p>The relatives and friends began to gather early in the morning at the home of the deceased on Milwaukee Avenue, to once more look upon the features of a true Pole and patriot, a man who brought honor to all the Polish people in America.</p>
   <p>The carriages kept driving up continually. A company of police, of whom the deceased was once a member, had stationed themselves there. The cadets from St. John Cantius parish arrived. A delegation of veterans from the Grand Army of the Republic came to give their last services to a soldier, a veteran of the Civil War. Then came a band from St. Stanislaus College, remembering the services rendered to that institution and to the <pb facs="5423968_11_0960.jpg" n="2"/>Poles in America. His partners in public life came also. There were also present the mayor of the city of Chicago, Edward F. Dunne; City Attorney Smulski, City Treasurer Blocki, City Collector Traeger, the brother of former mayor Preston Harrison, the colleagues of the deceased in the office of the Commissioner of Public Works, and thirty alderman, Milwaukee Avenue became filled with people.</p>
   <p>After nine o'clock, amidst the weeping of the family and friends, they carried out the coffin and the funeral cortege started.</p>
   <p>First came the police, and after them the college band playing Chopin's Funeral March. After the band walked Mayor Dunne, City Attorney Smulski, Senator-Alderman Kunz and thirty other city officials. Then came the administrative staff of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union and representatives from various societies in which the deceased was both organizer and leading <pb facs="5423968_11_0961.jpg" n="3"/>member. Next marched the cadets, and, finally, the hearse came drawn by four horses and followed by seventy-two carriages. The cortege proceeded from Milwaukee Avenue and Noble Street to St. Stanislaus Kostka's church, where thousands of people awaited it. The spacious church was filled with people as they carried the coffin. The altar was covered with a shroud and before the altar awaited fifty priests. The priests and organists sang the Requiem.</p>
   <p>His Excellency Rev. Archbishop Symon, a papal representative, walked into the church accompanied by the Rev. Gronkowski and Rev. Lange, and behind him Bishop Muldoon, who in turn said the Holy Mass. Reverend Bienarz was deacon, Reverend Ladon, sub-deacon; Reverend Nawrocki was in charge of the ceremonial, and Reverends Kosinski and Truszynski were honorary deacon and sub-deacon.</p>

   <p>After the mass Reverend Zapala ascended the pulpit and gave a beautiful eulogy. Then, while the bells were ringing in all the surrounding churches, the body was placed in the hearse and taken to St. Adelbert's Cemetery to the spot where it will rest.</p>
   <p>Rev. Francis Gordon spoke at the grave in reference to the exemplary life and service rendered by the late Peter Kiolbassa.</p>
   <p>After the preacher had finished his talk,there echoed three farewell salvos over the grave, fired by United States soldiers. Then the coffin was lowered into the grave, the last prayers were said, and the thousands that filled the cemetery dispersed.</p>
