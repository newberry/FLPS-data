  <body>
   <p>Funeral services for the late Andrew Frasz, prominent Polish leader in Chicago, were held on Saturday, August 24, 1918. The deceased was an old settler of the St. Adalbert community. He was seventy-three years of age at the time of his death; the last thirty-eight years of his life had been spent in St. Adalbert's parish. The funeral cortege set out from his late residence at 1658 West 18th Street, proceeding to St. Adalbert's Church. The remains of the deceased were escorted to church by the Reverend Casimir Gronkowski, pastor of the parish. After a solemn requiem mass the body was laid to rest in St. Adalbert's Cemetery.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frasz leaves a widow, two sons, and three daughters. One of his sons, Ignace Frasz, is well known in St. Adalbert's social and political circles. He is a clerk of the municipal court in Chicago. The other son, Francis Frasz, is in the United States Navy. Many members of the family and friends <pb facs="5423968_11_0903.jpg" n="2"/>sent floral pieces and attended the funeral. Among those present were Judge Ignace Dankowski; Mr. John Pelka, candidate for clerk of the municipal court; Dr. Victor Shiller and family; Mr. Valentine Szymanski, director of the Polish National Alliance; Valentine Laskowski, candidate for the State legislature from the Fifteenth Senatorial District; Joseph Kaminski, clerk of the municipal court; twelve clerks from the chief bureau of the municipal court; F. Danisch; and many other prominent Polish-American citizens. Telegrams of condolence were sent by Frank Danisch, chief clerk of the municipal court; Thomas Kasperski, county commissioner; and Francis Rydzewski of South Bend, Indiana.</p>
   <p>May the departed soul of the late Andrew Frasz rest in peace!</p>
