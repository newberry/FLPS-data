   <p>The time is getting closer when the Polish armies will once again cover themselves with the glory of the Polish name.</p>
   <p>In the footsteps of our famous knightly ancestors, will go, before long, our armed bodies of soldiers under their own standards into combat with the foe of not only Poland, but the entire civilization.</p>
   <p>On the eve of that great moment in history, and on the first anniversary of that memorable decree, dear to the heart of every true Pole, of the President of the French Republic, Poincare, on June 4th, 1917, calling to life the autonomous Polish army in France. We Polish Americans, gathered in a crowd numbering 50,000 at the foot of the Kosciuszko monument, in Humboldt Park, at Chicago, Illinois, moved to the depths of our hearts and loyal to the tradition of our valorous forefathers, vow to strain all our power, means and property, so that the Polish army in France would be able to fulfill honorably the hopes placed in <pb facs="5423968_11_0299.jpg" n="2"/>them by our entire nation.</p>
   <p>To the heroic Republic of France and her undefeated army we render into the hands of their official representative and worthy guardian of the recruiting Polish army in the United States, the right honorable Colonel James Martin, expressions of honor, tribute, admiration and warmth, flowing wishes of endurance and victory.</p>
   <p>Standing undivided under the Star Spangled Banner, that sublime symbol of the highest human ideals, we send President Woodrow Wilson, that fearless champion of human liberty and rights of mankind, expressions of deepest tribute and assurance that in order to realize his lofty watchwords, enlightening the darkness of the present day, he may have at his disposal our life and name.</p>
   <p>Acknowledging the work of the National Department as the leading institution of our Polish immigration in America, we turn to them with an earnest appeal to deepen to the fullest extent their efforts in the work of uniting and freeing all Polish lands together with the coast and <pb facs="5423968_11_0300.jpg" n="3"/>Gdansk (Danzig), our port.</p>
   <p>To those brothers of ours who already have attained that good fortune, to stand under the standard of the White Eagle in France, we send from the depths of our hearts these wishes:</p>
   <p>Go forward to battle with pride in your heart, because to you not death and defeat, but victory and life is written! We are with you as long as there is life!</p>
   <p>Long live the Republic of the United States and its great President, Woodrow Wilson.</p>
   <p>Long live the heroic Republic of France and its fearless army.</p>
   <p>Long live the Allies.</p>
   <p>Long live Poland and its army, hurrying into battle!</p>
