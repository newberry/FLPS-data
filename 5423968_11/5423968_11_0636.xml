   <p>We, the Poles now living in America, do not only sympathize with our countrymen in Poland and do not only unanimously approve the demands made by them on the Russian government, but we obligate ourselves to support, according to our means the cause of our countrymen in Poland by creating a national relief fund by contributions to be safeguarded and distributed by the officers of the Polish National Alliance where fund will do the most good.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0637.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the foregoing language a special session of the central government of the Polish National Alliance, held yesterday at the national home, 102-4 W. Division Street started a movement for the assistance of the Polish people, who are struggling to establish a constitutional government.</p>
   <p>Appeal Is Widespread.</p>
   <p>More than 130 Polish societies, with a membership of more than 50,000, which will in a few days be increased to 100,000 in Chicago, will be asked to support the movement through an appeal that will be sent out today.</p>
   <p>The appeal is to be accompanied by a resolution adopted by the Central Alliance and a request for its adoption by the various societies. The resolution, which concludes with the obligation to contribute to the relief fund, is to be acted upon at mass meetings called by the officials of <pb facs="5423968_11_0638.jpg" n="3"/>the various societies, and after receiving the signatures of the members are to be transmitted to the office of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Solid Front Is Asked.</p>
   <p>In its appeal the central government of the National Alliance recommends the adoption of the resolution in the following language.</p>
   <p>We urgently recommend the unanimous adoption at such mass meetings of the resolution prepared by us, which will be first presented at a series of mass meetings to be held in Chicago, so that in support of those of our fellow countrymen who are now suffering and battling for the establishment of a free and a constitutional government <pb facs="5423968_11_0639.jpg" n="4"/>in the Empire of Russia we may present a solid and united front. Above all we appeal to you, our countrymen and the American public for contributions to a fund for the assistance of our fellow countrymen battling for freedom, poor and suffering hunger and other privations and punishment if imprisoned at the hands of a relentlessly oppressive government.</p>
   <p>The fund will be under the care and control of the central government of the Polish National Alliance and contributions will be received by the treasurer, M. Majewski, 102 West Division Street.</p>
