<title level="a">THE KOSCIUSKO BENEFIT FESTIVAL</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A meeting of the Polish Societies in Saint Adalbert Parish, to discuss the Kosciusko benefit festival to be held on the Fourth of July in Schuetzen Park, was held on Sunday at four o'clock in the afternoon in the Saint Adalbert school hall.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stanislaus Budzbanowski presided and the undersigned acted as secretary.</p>
   <p>The first speaker, Mr. Budzbanowski explained that the meeting had been called for the purpose of including our parish among other parishes participating in the festival and to devote all our energies to collecting funds for the erection of the Kosciusko monument in Chicago. The action was begun a long time ago and should be brought to a successful conclusion as soon as possible.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_11_0147.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Polczynski, a member of the main committee in charge of arranging the Kosciusko festival, was the next speaker. He explained that any society participating in the festival "in a body" would pay no admission fee, and that the committee would pay the expenses. So, every society, especially the military groups, should participate. Everybody should feel it his duty to attend, since by so doing we all will help erect the Kosciusko monument in a very short time.</p>
   <p>Mr. F. Czecwinski than suggested that, in order to lighten the task of the main committee, Saint Adalbert parish should select a subcommittee of its own, which would thus be able to do much more for the cause.</p>
   <p>Mr. J. Witt, Mr. W. Spychala, Mr. S. Behnke, and Mr. J. Kasperski also spoke. It was then decided to select a subcommittee for Saint Adalbert Parish.</p>
   <p>On a motion by Mr. Spychala, a list of the societies represented at this <pb facs="5423968_11_0148.jpg" n="3"/>meeting was read. The list includes The Holy Name of Jesus Society, Holy Family Society, Saint Florian Krakus Society, Saint Casimir Soldiers [Society], Court of Saint Adalbert [Society], Number 26, Archbrotherhood of Saint Dominic, Court of Saint Michael the Archangel [Society], Number 208, Saint Adalbert's Society, Number 1, Saint John the Apostle Society, Reverend August Kordecki Society, and Saint Adalbert Bishop and Martyr Society.</p>
   <p>Then, on a motion by Mr. F. Czecwinski, the following committee was selected, St. Budzbanowski, president; F. Czerwinski, vice-president; Valentine Zwierzynski, secretary; S. Behnke, treasurer.</p>
   <p>Mr. W. Spychala, Mr. J. Kasperski, Mr. Joseph Susmarski, Mr. Joseph Lejman, and Mr. Joseph Thomas are members of the executive committee.</p>
   <p>The next meeting regarding this matter will be held on Sunday, May 29, at seven o'clock in the evening in the old rectory.</p>
   <p>John Renklewski, secretary,</p>
   <p>808 West Seventeenth Street.</p>
