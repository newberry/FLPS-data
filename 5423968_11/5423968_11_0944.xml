   <p>Looking over the lives of prominent men of our city, it is easy to see that progressive characters have never lacked opportunities, and that opportunities have not signified so much as the man himself and the problems of professional, industrial and financial life in Chicago have been solved in many ways by the ability of Polish individuals. With the expansion of trade, the need of capital for building up and maintaining many gigantic industries and institutions, there has arisen a need for concerted efforts, but the personal factor has always been important. The financial institutions of this city have played an important and most helpful part, and one of the men of financial integrity is John F. Smulski, banker and lawyer, whose career is interesting and is typical of modern progress and advancement. Alert and enterprising, he utilized the opportunities offered in this city for both business and professional advancement, and in each has attained thereby notable success. Integrity, energy and determination have constituted the foundations of his achievement.</p>

   <p>Mr. Smulski began his commercial career in the newspaper and publishing business here in Chicago with his father. He continued in this field of activity for five years, and then engaged in teaching at the St. Stanislaus school for one year.</p>
   <p>In 1906 he organized the Northwestern Trust and Savings Bank, of which he is president. Mr. Smulski served as alderman from the 16th ward two terms and from the 17th ward, one term. He now is serving as city attorney, an office which he won in the year of 1903.</p>
