   <p>Children, today is L'G B'omer, I will therefore tell you the significance thereof.</p>
   <p>Many, many years ago Jewish people lived, in their own land, Palestine. They were happy and content for many years. Then came a bad, wicked enemy, a people called Romans, who destroyed the country. Cities were ruined, homes burned, thousands of Jews killed, thousands taken prisoners to be sold as slaves, and the land passed into their possession. But few Jews remained in the country, these encountered much trouble from the Romans, who treated them badly. As it were, they were a very small minority. What could they do? The enemy was too strong and they too weak, so they suffered in silence. But deep in their hearts, they carried an intense anger against their <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1386.jpg" n="2"/>oppressors, and waited only to become somewhat stronger to rise against the foe and free the country from the Roman yoke.</p>
   <p>And that time, my dear children, came to pass. Jews became bold, held open combat with the enemy. The leader of this revolt was a great hero by the name of Bar Kuchba. He secretly organized an army which set about to drive out the foe. At that time there also lived a very learned Jew, Rabbi Akeba. He, dear children, loved his people very much. He saw how the Romans avenged themselves on his brothers so that in his heart grew a great desire to rid his people of their oppressors. He was also a great orator. People listened to him and followed him. With sweet words he encouraged them, influenced them to join Bar Kuchba, and thus, in unity, fight for their country and their people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1387.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>So the war occurred. Jews offered their lives, faced the enemy courageously and drove them from Palestine. Bar Kuchba became the Jewish ruler. For three years he ruled, Jews were happy, they were free of the hated Romans.</p>
   <p>But the enemy was very powerful. Large groups of soldiers were sent against the Jews. Bar Kuchba defended his country bravely and courageously, yet, unfortunately, the enemy conquered. Oh what revenge the Romans took. Like bloodthirsty animals they descended upon their prey; killed everyone, men, women and even children. Bar Kuchba fell in battle, his army annihilated. Even the old beloved Rabbi Akeba was murderously slaughtered. Totally destroyed was the Jewish land. Those who escaped the hands of the murderers, fled and spread throughout the entire world. True, the Jews did not win the war, but their heroes, their courageous fighters, and their martyrs have <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1388.jpg" n="4"/>not been forgotten. L'G B'omer is the day that Jews all over the world observe in memory of the two great Jewish revolutionists Rabbi Akeba and Bar Kuchba. (Signed) M. A.</p>
