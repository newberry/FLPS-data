   <p>A large crowd of men and women gathered last night at the Kehilath Jacob Synagogue, Hamlin Avenue and Douglas Boulevard, where a mass meeting arranged by the Chicago Mizrachi Organization took place.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Meyer Berlin, who arrived in Chicago yesterday, addressed the gathering. In a brilliant speech, he spoke of the good work that the Mizrachi Organization is doing and of the aims and purposes of the Mizrachi. He also gave his impressions of the Carlsbad Congress, where the Mizrachi was represented by one hundred and eighteen delegates from all parts of the world.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Berlin concluded his speech by appealing to those present to join the Mizrachi Organization. In response to this appeal, several hundred of those present joined. Rabbi [Elazer Reuven] Mushkin and Rabbi [Baruch Zundel] Margolin also spoke at the meeting. Rabbi [S.] Shach was chairman.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1105.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Mizrachi Ladies Organization will give a reception this afternoon, at two o'clock, in honor of Rabbi Berlin, at the clubrooms of the Adath Bnai Israel, 1113 South Ashland Boulevard. All women leaders of the various Organizations are invited to the reception.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Berlin will address a mass meeting of the North Side Jews tonight at eight o'clock at the Tiferes Zion Synagogue. Rabbi Margolin will also speak. Rabbi Mushkin will be the chairman. All North Side Jews are expected to attend the meeting.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Berlin arrived in Chicago yesterday afternoon, at five o'clock. He was met by a committee of local Mizrachi. Rabbi Berlin came here in the interests of the Mizrachi Organization.</p>
