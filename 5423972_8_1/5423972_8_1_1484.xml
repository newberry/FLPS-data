<title level="a">JUDGE SCULLY EXCUSES JEWISH ELECTION JUDGES AND CLERKS ON YOM KIPPUR</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Upon the suggestion of Election Commissioner B. Horwich, County Judge Thomas F. Scully yesterday called together a few rabbis. He conferred with them regarding the Jewish election judges and clerks who will have to work on Yom Kippur, which happens to be the first registration day.</p>
   <p>Judge Scully received the rabbis very cordially in his chamber. After discussing the question, he decided to excuse all Jewish election judges and clerks, approximately 600, from working on the holiest of days. The judge also saw to it that they would not lose their positions.</p>
   <p>At the same time, Judge Scully thought of the Jewish polling places, which will naturally be closed on that day. Special polling places will be rented for that day and then afterwards the Jewish stores will be reopened as polling places.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1485.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This decision of Judge Scully will soon be forwarded to all Jewish election judges and clerks who will undoubtedly be glad to learn of their release for this day, and that they will later be reinstated.</p>
   <p>The Rabbis Ezriel Epstein, Ephraim Epstein, M. Zevin, Saul Silber and Cardon, and Judges Henry Horner and Philip P. Bregstone were present at the conference with Judge Scully and Election Commissioner Horwich.</p>
