   <p>Nearly a year has elapsed since the leaders of the community convened [for] the first educational conference at the Hebrew Institute to discuss ways and means [on] how to better Jewish education in the city of Chicago. The leaders of the conference, General Abel Davis and Mr. James, promised to convene a second conference within a short time but the second conference has not been convened, although the report of an expert on matters of Jewish education was completed long ago. The conference is more necessary now than ever, because as soon as the Community Building Fund Drive is over, plans for a new and better Hebrew Institute will be laid out and it is of utmost importance that the leaders of the West Side be given an opportunity to express their views and opinions on the pending educational reforms in general and on the new Institute in particular.</p>
   <p>Chicago Jewry needs an organization to unify and supervise all the educational activities in the community, and it also needs a good and up-to-date Jewish center <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0478.jpg" n="2"/>for the youth, the main object of the center to be a substitute for the destroyed Jewish spirit and atmosphere of the Jewish family. Book learning alone will not make one a Jew. A child or an adult may know a thousand and one things about Judaism and still be a poor Jew. The Jewish child must live in a certain atmosphere to grow up as a Jew, and inasmuch as the average Jewish family in Chicago can no longer offer the child that atmosphere and that spirit, a center must be created where the child will have the opportunity to grow up in a genuine Jewish atmosphere. Needless to say the new Institute to be established must also be an educational and intellectual agency, and what sort of an educational and intellectual agency it should be, is up to the West Side Jews to say because the Institute is primarily for their children, and only they have a right to say how they want to bring up their children. It is therefore of utmost importance that the educational conference be reconvened as soon as the drive is over and that an opportunity be given the leaders of the West Side to tell the community what is on their mind regarding the general educational problem and especially regarding the Institute.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0479.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Courier is committed to the policy of a strong central educational organization to unify and centralize all the educational activities within the community and such an organization can be established without difficulties and it can be made to function in such a manner that it be a blessing to Chicago Jewry, and such an organization can only be established as a result of an understanding between the various groups and factions in the community.</p>
   <p>We therefore urge that the conference be reconvened without delay because a little later people will begin to leave town, and before September or October nothing will be done, and when the conference will be convened in September or October the central educational organization will not be established before the winter is over, and there is no earthly reason why we should lose another year, and waste so much energy during the year.</p>
   <p>The conference should be called in the first or second week in June, and appoint its committees right away. Then upon resuming its work at the beginning of the new season everything will be ready to do actual work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0480.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We hope that the gentlemen who were responsible for the convening of the first conference and who are in a position to call a second will not delay matters and will act as soon as they are in a position to act.</p>
