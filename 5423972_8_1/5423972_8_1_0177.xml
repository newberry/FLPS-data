   <p>Lately the world has been more kind to prisoners - the outcasts of our social order. Once upon a time - not so very long ago - society condemned them. Their fate was put into the hands of wardens and guards, who were pitiless and cruel....</p>
   <p>For the past few years an entirely new view has been taken. Our social order is beginning to consider the various problems concerning our social life. We are convinced that all of us are responsible for each other. Whoever is sentenced to a prison term for a crime cannot alone be blamed for it, but all of us are responsible to a certain extent.....We should give them all possible support and guide them on the path of righteousness.</p>

   <p>I was requested to officiate at the services last Rosh Hashonnah (New Years) and Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) for the Jewish prisoners in Joliet. I have thus become very interested in the welfare of those outcasts, and therefore I have visited them quite often throughout the past year. Almost all of the 1,600 prisoners there know me now and show their appreciation each time I visit them. The 45 Jewish prisoners can hardly wait for my arrival. Last Sunday I dropped in on them unexpectedly while they were in the chapel. Their joy was great. All Jewish prisoners were present, and after each had greeted me separately they began the evening services. Following the services I spoke to them.</p>
   <p>The purpose of my address was to assure them that the Chicago Jews were greatly interested in them; that they should not consider themselves as outcasts.</p>
   <p>They always welcome the Jews from Chicago.</p>
