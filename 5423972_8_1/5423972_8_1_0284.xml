   <p>The announcement that Sam Gold, of the Pompeian Restaurant and Banquet Hall, 810 Roosevelt Road, intends to build a million-dollar hotel at 610 Roosevelt Road, one block east of Halsted Street, is a most interesting one for Jews in general and for West Side Jews in particular. Many Jewish businessmen from all over the country come to this neighborhood, where a big wholesale and jobbing trade is carried on. Nearly every Jewish businessman who comes to Chicago for business reasons visits the neighborhood of Roosevelt and Halsted, which is therefore the logical place for a Jewish hotel. Mr. Gold intends the new hotel to be an ornament to the neighborhood, a convenient place for its guests, and one of the most beautiful hotels to be found in Chicago, with all the modern conveniences, besides having a Jewish atmosphere and a kosher kitchen.</p>
   <p>The plans were drawn by the architects Alexander Levy and William Klein. The <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0285.jpg" n="2"/>work of erecting the hotel will begin shortly. It will be a nine-story building with convenient guest rooms and a bath in every room. The hotel will also have a big banquet hall for one thousand people, ordinary dining rooms, a Turkish bath fixed up in the most modern way, and a gymnasium.</p>
   <p>A. S. Shapiro intends to erect a fifteen-apartment building on the southwest corner of Lawrence Avenue and Troy Street according to plans drawn by David M. Klafter, architect. The cost is estimated at $200,000.</p>
