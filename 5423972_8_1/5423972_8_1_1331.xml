   <p>A small but noteworthy movement has been quietly and effectively going on within the past years. We refer to emigration of Jews from large industrial centers to small cities and farms. Although the movement has not as yet assumed large proportions, it is indeed fratifying to know that such a movement exists.</p>
   <p>For many years now, national Jewish leaders such as Jacob Schiff have sponsored resettlement organization, the purpose of which was to resettle Jewish people from industrial centers to farms and less densely populated districts. These organized efforts for some reason or other have not met with too much success. However, efforts by individuals who have left industrial centers of their own volition and have settled on farms on their own iniative seem to be making many forward strides. This of course does not mean that organized efforts of resettlement should be abandoned, but rather invites some changes in methods of organized resettlement.</p>
