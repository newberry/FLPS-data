   <p>The Zionist convention, held yesterday at the Hebrew Institute, was a source of wonder to the Chicago Zionists. They were surprised at the great number of delegates and guests, and they were surprised at the seriousness and enthusiasm of the proceedings.</p>
   <p>Some of the Zionist workers have been discouraged; they thought that Zionism in Chicago was dead. Suddenly they saw with their own eyes that Zionism in Chicago was strong and healthy, and that a better organization and more workers would make it even finer. When there is a better organization, there will naturally be more workers.</p>
   <p>It was worth while to have a convention if only to prove to the Zionist workers that Zionism in Chicago is alive and healthy. The older Chicago Zionist workers claim that this convention was one of the most beautiful that has ever been <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1671.jpg" n="2"/>held in Chicago.</p>
   <p>One of the most remarkable features of the convention was the sight of Mr. S. B. Komaiko, a businessman, delivering a poetic address, while Rabbi Leon Fram delivered a practical speech about practical work. Everybody enjoyed it.</p>
