<title level="a">THE ANNUAL ZIONIST CONVENTION</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial in English)</title></bibl>

   <p>The forthcoming annual Convention of the Zionist Organization of America,to take place in Baltimore on June 17th, will have to deal with problems of vital importance not only to the organization but also to Palestine. The Convention will have to do real business to be successful. It will either have to draw a line of demarcation between the Zionist Organization and the Keren Hayesod [Palestine Foundation Fund], or it will have to merge both, because otherwise either the Zionist Organization will suffer or the Keren Hayesod will suffer. At present the Keren Hayesod is actually eating up the Zionist Organization. It is devouring all the energies of the active Zionist workers, because for the time being, at least, ninety-nine per cent of all the Keren Hayesod workers are active Zionists, and since they cannot be active Zionists and active Keren Hayesod workers at the same time, they give up the Zionist work in order to <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1624.jpg" n="2"/>help the Keren Hayesod. If this should go on any longer, the Zionist Organization will be destroyed in a short time, because an organization without workers is an impossible thing. The hope that the Keren Hayesod will find its own group of workers and that the Zionists will thus be in a position to continue the Zionist work has not come through. If the Zionists should give up the Keren Hayesod work, then our work in Palestine will be destroyed. Now since the Zionists cannot do both Zionist and Keren Hayesod work, the annual Convention will either have to create a distinct line of demarcation between both fields of activity and allot to one group of Zionists Zionist work and to the other Keren Hayesod work, or it will have to merge Zionism and Keren Hayesod and enable the Zionist workers to work for both simultaneously. The only possible way to do it is to emulate the Chicago example. In Chicago, every Keren Hayesod subscriber who donates to the Keren Hayesod twenty-five dollars and up is mechanically enrolled as a member of the Zionist Organization. In this way the Keren Hayesod contributors can help and do help the Zionist Organization and can at the same time determine the policies of the Organization and the methods of our work in Palestine.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1625.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The leaders of the organization must not be afraid lest certain people will say that the Keren Hayesod is a purely Zionist enterprise. It is a Zionist enterprise and there is no reason to be ashamed of it. Those who realize the importance of Keren Hayesod work will give money for the Keren Hayesod even if it be controlled by Zionists, and those who do not care for a Jewish Palestine and are not concerned with the future of the Jewish people, will not contribute to the Keren Hayesod even if it be controlled by non-Zionists. The fact of the matter is that the Keren Hayesod has been created by the Zionist organization and is solely dependent on the Zionists, and we believe that it is the duty of the annual Convention to make this plain to our people in this country.</p>
   <p>Just as the Keren Hayesod cannot exist without the help of the Zionists, so the Zionist organization cannot exist if entirely divorced from the Keren Hayesod. Both are interdependent and both must co-operate in such a manner that none suffers from the co-operation. We believe that a modus of co-operation can be <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1626.jpg" n="4"/>established, by which both will gain and none will lose, and there is no reason in the world why this modus of co-operation should not be established.</p>
   <p>Let the Zionist organization at its annual Convention proclaim aloud: Keren Hayesod is an organic part of Zionism and a Keren Hayesod contributor is ipso facto a Zionist, unless he protests against his enrollment as a member of the Zionist Organization.</p>
