   <p>The critics of religious and cultural conservatism claim that it is worthless to preserve traditions because the efforts which are expended therein can be used for the creation of new values. As far as other religions are concerned this is probably true, but it is absolutely false so far as it concerns the Jewish religion and Jewish cultural lore. The Jewish religion, emanating from the spirit of eternity, constantly rejuvenates itself. It ever possesses eternal youth and at the same time great antiquity, for its great leaders and disciples thought in terms of eternity. Everything existing in the realm of the Jewish religion is worthy of preservation, regardless of the labor and effort involved. The subterfuge that it is very difficult to preserve the great Jewish traditions is a very poor pretext. To live as a Jew should live in the world has never been an easy task. Each generation must fight for its Judaism. Each generation must find its own salvation. By the good deeds of our ancestors alone we cannot exist. The fact that our fathers lived as Jews does not mean that we can take it easy and shake off the burden from our shoulders.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0619.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Wherever Jews begin to live by the deeds of their ancestors, Judaism goes under. The French Jews, for instance, who are assimilated to a great extent, still have Jewish memories. They are proud of the fact that their fathers lived as Jews, and the whole of their Judaism is based on a certain respect for the belief in Judaism of their fathers, and they still observe the anniversary day commemorating their parents' death.</p>
   <p>If we cease to live as our fathers lived, and if we are too indolent to work for our own salvation, then we shall be the last generation of Jews. This is what every thinking Jew who strives to remain such must understand.</p>
   <p>Our fathers lived under less favorable conditions than we are living. They suffered want and misery--but with courage and pride they bore the great Jewish burden upon their shoulders. They didn't even feel that burden, nor its weight, for as Jews they did not live an isolated life, but a community life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0620.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is possible to be a pious Jew and to pray at home, but our fathers went to the synagogue to pray--to pray together, for they possessed a genuine sentiment which told them that to be in a group in a synagogue is very valuable and is a strong psychological factor in Jewish life.</p>
   <p>Our fathers did not have such developed ideas about organization as we have, yet they understood that if Judaism was to survive, the Jews must be organized neither in cliques nor groups, but in communities. They understood that a group, synagogue or house of prayer is only a part of the community, but not the community itself, and that it cannot take the place of the community. When a public Jewish enterprise had to be carried through, it was not done by individual cliques or their leaders, but rather by the representatives of the community of which the cliques or groups were only a part. When Jews have no united community but are organized in cliques only, then the result is--a moribund Judaism.</p>
   <p>Certain readers will contend, that here in America different conditions prevail and therefore the forms of organized Jewish life must be different. To argue <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0621.jpg" n="4"/>in this manner it is necessary to go a step further and say that as long as the circumstances of life are different here, it then follows that the Jewish religion must be different. This is just what the reformed Jews contend--but what have they accomplished? Have they strengthened Judaism or have they made it into a moribund Judaism? Just as there is only one Jewish religion, so there can be everywhere only one Jewish way of life. In reality, America is not the first country to which Jews have immigrated. Wherever they wandered and settled down they organized Jewish public life according to ancient, highly esteemed historical form--in the form of communities and not of synagogues or cliques.</p>
   <p>When the Jews settled in Spain, where for centuries they enjoyed great liberty, they organized communities. When they went to Poland they founded communities and when they went to England they also established communities, and there is no reason why American Orthodox Jewry should not organize themselves in communities and live as Jews have lived everywhere. No one prevents them from establishing well-organized and well-supervised communities.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0622.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>If there ever was a necessity to establish communities, such a necessity exists now in America, where the current of life is so strong and powerful that if Jews do not organize into communities and stick together, Jewish life will degenerate and eventually disappear.</p>
   <p>If the representatives of Orthodox Jewry in Chicago are successful in establishing a community in the historical sense of the word, they will not only preserve the future Jewish generation in Chicago, but will achieve a great historical deed for all of American Jewry and will make it possible for us to live as Jews, as our fathers lived everywhere.</p>
