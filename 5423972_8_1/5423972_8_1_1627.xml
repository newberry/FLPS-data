M., the hall was packed with smiling faces, representatives and members of all organizations affiliated with the Labor culture League; The Socialist Alliance; The Forward Association; The Jewish Women's Art Club; The Culture League Choir; The National Socialist Singing Society; The Mandolin Orchestra and the Literary Dramatics Society.</p>

   <p>The Labor Culture League is an organization grown out of the absolute necessity of culture among the Jewish masses. The first ones that felt the need of culture in Chicago and immediately started in the work of organizing a culture Leagure were Louis Schaffer and Jonah Spivak, who in the beginning arranged lectures and various concerts at their own expense, that were very successful from the start, and later branched out to greater activities.</p>

   <p>The League has had forty-two lectures and intertainments since May 12, 1922 and all were successful. A great deal of credit is due to the organizations that are affiliated with our league. They gave us all the co-operation we needed.</p>
   <p>Comrade Jacob Seigel, treasure of the league reported an income of $4,000.00, but the expenses he claims was much above that.</p>
   <p>"Much credit is due to the Forward which served the interests of the League," said Comrade Schaffer.</p>
   <p>He also mentions the further activities of the League, which takes in the new resolutions to organize a labor educational institute, where systematic courses in Science, Literature, Socialism, Political and Economic questions will be taken up.</p>

   <p>#2. A recommendation to request the construction of a private Independent People's Art Theater.</p>
   <p>#3. A recommendation for a journal that will serve, to announce, the activities of the League and which will permit our youth to come out before the public.</p>
   <p>He concludes with an appeal to work in harmony and show an example of building a powerful culture organization that will be the pride of Chicago. The president was applauded.</p>

   <p>The public then enjoyed a lunch in the Rose Room of the Morrison Hotel. After lunch, Comrade Spivak introduced a new Jewish tenor, Mr. Dubin who has recently returned from England. Dubin who was accompanied on the piano by his wife, Mrs. Dubin, was greatly applauded for his wonderful compositions.</p>
