   <p>Ramah Lodge has played an important part in the early history of Chicago. In the year 1857 when it was instituted, the city had but 80,000 inhabitants. The Jewish Community was small and divided. There were the German Jews and the Polish Jews. They hardly knew or cared for each other. There existed a great need for an organization upon whose platform all Jews could be united and whose purpose it would be to promote the common interests of all our co-religionists.</p>
   <p>When the movement was started in 1857 to establish such an organization in Chicago, Henry Greenebaum was an eager worker.</p>

   <p>On June 15th, 1857, Ramah Lodge was instituted by deputies of District Grand Lodge #2;- Dr. Max Lilienthal and Wm. Renau of Cincinnati, assisted by Henry Greenebaum, G.M. Cohen, who at that time was head of K.A.M. Temple, was chosen president; Rudolph Rosenthal Vice-President and Herman Felsenthal, secretary. The Lodge became at once a great influence in the community.</p>
   <p>Among the leaders of the new organization were Dr. B. Felsenthal, Joseph L. Gatzert, Samuel &amp; Leon Strauss, Conrad Witkowsky, Solomon Rothschild, Herman Goldsmith, L.J. Unna, A. Louis, and Dr. Cerf.</p>
