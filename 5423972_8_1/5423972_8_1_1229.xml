   <p>In yesterday evening's meeting of the Relief Committee at the Morrison Hotel, the acting chairman, S. J. Rosenblatt, reported on his activities in New York.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to formulate plans for the opening of a special office, through which the Relief Committee will send money from local Jews to their relatives in the Old World.</p>
   <p>Mr. Isaac Lasser, and Mr. Safer, of Chicago Heights, attended the meeting, especially for the purpose of enlisting the clothing enterprise. They will be members of the committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1230.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It was also decided to have a special committee visit prominent businessmen in the clothing and shoe industries, to secure new shoes and garments that have been soiled, or are just out of season, for the war sufferers of Europe.</p>
   <p>Julius Sovitzki, office manager, read the auditor's report of July 1, 1918, to March 31, 1917 (sic). It indicated that a sum of $203,485.50 has been received during this time, not including the money collected for the general Million Dollar Relief Fund.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sovitzki also reported on the financial statement for the month of April, showing a sum of $21,209.08 received from various sources.</p>
