   <p>Madam Bertha Kolish, playing successfully in the drama, "The Riddle Woman," at the Woods Theater was the guest of the Covenant Club last Tuesday. After dinner, Madam Kolish addressed the club. Her speech, a truly Jewish, patriotic one, was received with tremendous applause by those present.</p>
   <p>She spoke of the Jews in the art of acting, and presented a review of what Jews have accomplished for the modern theater in America and Europe. She especially emphasized the fact that the majority of the actors in the 19th century were Jews.</p>
   <p>In closing, she observed that when Jews have their own home in Palestine, they will be able to accomplish more in the art of theater acting, because Jewish genius will develop at its best under the "eternal blue skies" <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1212.jpg" n="2"/>of Palestine. Then, will both culture and science blossom in Palestine.</p>
   <p>Tremendous applause greeted her able speech.</p>
   <p>Her listeners greeted and thanked her heartily for coming to their club, and for the inspiring pleasure she bestowed upon them with her beautiful English and hearty words. One after another, men and women formed a line to shake her hand, and express their delight and appreciation.</p>
