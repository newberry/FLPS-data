   <p>The second annual convention of the Tool Campaign will have two more sessions and then it will close.</p>
   <p>The convention opened last night with a huge mass-meeting. The convention hall was crowded with delegates and visitors.</p>
   <p>The speakers were: Mr. Abe Cohan, editor of the Daily Jewish Forward; Mr. J. Baskin, national treasurer of the Tool Campaign; Mr. Abe Shpilakov; Judge Jacob Penkin, and Mr. Z. Lorber.</p>
   <p>Comrade Vladek, chairman of the Jewish National Tool Campaign, acted as chairman of the mass-meeting.</p>
   <p>Comrade Cohan was greeted by the delegates and friends with a stormy ovation, when introduced.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1555.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Comrade Cohan delivered a brief but rousing talk. He, spoke about the relief work that the American Jews are carrying on to aid their unfortunate brothers and sisters on the other side of the Atlantic.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vladeks opening remarks were as follows:</p>
   <p>"We come to the second annual convention with a brilliant record of practical achievements, of which we can be proud. In a time when all relief activities are disorganized and most of them are dissolved, we not only have kept up our organization, but we have increased our activities in new locations. We have collected large sums of money and have demonstrated that our work is very practical, constructive, necessary and important!</p>
   <p>Dr. Z. Lorber, the delegate from Chicago, reported on the work accomplished by the National Tool Campaign in this City. He also told <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1556.jpg" n="3"/>of the phenomenal success of the bazaar despite the bad weather and heavy snow storm that crippled the city's transportation system for several days.</p>
   <p>A pleasing concert was given between the business sessions.</p>
   <p>The convention closed today's session with a most inspiring talk by the national chairman, Comrade Vladek, who was reelected to that post.</p>
   <p>Many interesting talks, were given during the morning and afternoon sessions by prominent Jews and great civic leaders.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers were: Rabbi Jonah Weis, Mr. Meyer Levin, Mr. N. D. Perlman, and Dr. Coralnik.</p>
   <p>Mr. Viadek praised the work done by the Chicago branch and the Rovno Brotherhood in particular.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1557.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Mr. Chanin praised Mr. Vladek's work. He attributed the success achieved to Mr. Vladek's loyal, sincere, and devoted guidance of the campaign. The convention was elevated to the highest degree of ecstasy by this speech.</p>
   <p>All the delegates cheered and applauded Mr. Vladek.</p>
   <p>Messages of greetings were received from all parts of the country.</p>
   <p>An elaborate banquet was served in the evening in honor of the delegates.</p>
