<title level="a">THE ZIONIST CONVENTION</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>Today, the twenty-third annual convention of the American Zionists will finish its deliberations, and will disperse. It cannot be said that this was a great convention. Taking into consideration the fact that it was numerically much weaker than any of the previous conventions, it is to be considered more of a gathering of Zionist leaders or a conference, than a regular convention. The business of the convention was to lay the foundations for a new Zionist organization in this country, to embark upon a definite policy as regards Palestine, and to straighten out the difficulties between the European and the American leaders of the movement.</p>
   <p>It was probably because the European Zionist leaders were afraid of the possibility of a split in the movement that they thought it advisable to send <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1734.jpg" n="2"/>over Mr. Joseph Cowen, the director of the Anglo-Jewish Trust, and one of the leaders of the English Zionists, to the convention, to help restore more cordial relations between the American and European Zionists. Whether or not Mr. Cowen's mission was successful, we do not yet know.</p>
   <p>The very fact that the leader of the movement in America, Justice Louis D. Brandeis, deemed it advisable to be absent from the convention is not a good omen. First, it was supposed that the convention would be honored with the presence not only of Mr. Brandeis, but also of the acknowledged Zionist leaders, like Mr. Louis Marshall, Mr. Nathan Strauss, etc. Now it appears, however, that none of them honored the convention with their presence, either because they could not work out a program satisfactory to all concerned, or because of differences of opinion concerning the attitude toward practical work in Palestine. Whatever the cause, the convention was by no means a great one as far as the element of personnel is concerned.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cowen came to America to attend the convention, and also to awaken interest <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1735.jpg" n="3"/>in the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of Zionist World Organization] among the American Zionists. Judging from the reports from our special correspondent, we are unable to say whether or not Mr. Joseph Cowen was entirely successful in his specific mission. We hope, however, that something concrete has been done to bring about unity in the house of Zion, and to restore more cordial relations between the European and American Zionists.</p>
   <p>The European Zionists are well aware of the fact that without the financial help of American Jewry, Palestine is lost. The American Zionists, however, should also be aware of the fact that without the idealism, experience, and intelligence of the European Zionists, the American Zionists money would not go very far in Palestine. Both must co-operate harmoniously to make Palestine a Jewish land. When both realize this situation, peace will be completely restored, and harmonious co-operation possible.</p>
   <p>As far as the reorganization of the movement in America is concerned, the <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1736.jpg" n="4"/>Chicago Zionist leaders had some concrete plans to offer, and it is a pity that the plans were rejected because the reorganization plans offered by the Chicago Zionist leaders were a happy medium between centralism and federalism, which left the organization as a whole, intact, and offered the local branch much more work. We do not know the reasons for the opposition to this plan, and we can only express our regret that Chicago Zionism, as represented by Judge Hugo Pam, Max Shulman, and Nathan D. Kaplan, was not offered a chance to help shape the [new] Zionist organization which is to be established on the ruins of the old one. Chicago Zionism is in many respects purer than New York Zionism. The Chicago Zionist leaders have not indulged in Zionist politics as much as the leaders in New York have, and they have their own judgment on questions pertaining to organization. It seems, however, that this time, too, the will of New York Zionism had to prevail. Whether or not the plans for the new organization that are to be adopted by the convention, will work out well, remains to be seen. We confess, however, that we are not very optimistic in this respect, and as long as there is no strong and solid organization, the American Zionists cannot raise all the necessary funds for the work of reconstruction in Palestine.</p>
