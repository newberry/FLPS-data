   <p>Dear Editor of the Jewish Courier:</p>
   <p>Permit me to make the following appeal to the Jewish students of Chicago through your worthy newspaper:</p>
   <p>The present dreadful plight of our people has found a weak response in the hearts of our scholastic youth. This decisive act of the millennial, blood-drenched tragedy of our people, even though the half-paralyzed limbs of the Jewish nation have felt the horrible convulsions from which the Jewish people's organizm has been disturbed for the past two years, has found the few thousand Jewish students of Chicago steeped in a sweet dream-the paltry dream of their future careers.</p>
   <p>History tells us that, "Greece's freedom was attained through her universities." The student always plays the most important role in every liberating <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1263.jpg" n="2"/>Movement. The Jewish student body has produced the noblest idealists, the bravest fighters, and the most courageous heroes, who have tirelessly fought for the liberation of various nationalities. However, when we take into consideration how insignificant in number are those students who wish to do something for the liberation of their own people, the most oppressed of all peoples, we then arrive at very unpleasant thoughts.</p>
   <p>Is it possible that they who not so long ago willingly sacrificed their careers, their fortunes, and not infrequently their lives in the struggle for freedom in Russia, have degraded to petty careerists whom nothing interests save their personal affairs? No, this is not possible! We need only strike the right chord in their hearts and their former spirit will return to them.</p>
   <p>With this hope in our hearts, we, the Student Congress Organization, appeal to every Jewish student of Chicago: "Harken unto the despairing wails of woe from millions of our unfortunate brothers and sisters, who, besides having suffered from the world catastrophe far more in proportion than any <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1264.jpg" n="3"/>other nation, are still struggling in the hands of various tyrants. Do your duty in order to help them. We do not ask for any difficult sacrifices. We understand quite well the economic as well as other difficulties with which the Jewish students, particularly the new comers, have to cope. But we ask of you a little self-sacrifice, interest, and some of your leisure time.</p>
   <p>The Student Congress Organization consists of a group of Jewish students who organized for the purpose of assembling a Jewish Democratic Congress. We believe that a Jewish congress organized on a democratic basis is the only competent institution which can devise a method of solving the aggravating Jewish question and thereby wipe out dreadful and unnecessary suffering. In our organization there are people who belong to various political parties. The sense of duty to our people unites all of us. It is the most sacred duty of every Jewish student to belong to our organization.</p>
   <p>Meetings are held on the first and fourth Sundays of every month at 7 P.M. <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1265.jpg" n="4"/>in the P. P. S. Assembly Hall, 1208 North Hoyne Avenue. Lectures and discussions are arranged in order to shed light on the many phases of the Congress movement.</p>
   <p>Everybody is welcome.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Student Congress Organization.</p>
   <p>H. Cohen, 921 North Rockwell Street.</p>
