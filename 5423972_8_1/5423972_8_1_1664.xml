   <p>The Zionist conference, held the day before yesterday, was a real surprise to Chicago Zionists. They did not realize that there were young Zionist forces in Chicago who were willing to do Zionist work. They did not know that Chicago is very sympathetic to Zionism; they did not realize that it is possible to hold a successful Zionist convention in Chicago. Every Zionist in Chicago is surprised. What a great and successful convention! What a pleasant surprise!</p>
   <p>I believe that inaugurating a new leadership is a social function, a holiday function; I think it is more than a simple business transaction. 1, therefore, resolved to turn over the Chicago Zionist leadership in a much <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1665.jpg" n="2"/>more dignified way than it had been entrusted to me, at a meeting of a few men in Max Shulman's office.</p>
   <p>I thought it would be correct to start the new Zionist administration off with a bang, to put a little spirit and a little life into the Zionist forces in Chicago. It seemed to me that this could be done best at a convention. I, therefore, deemed it advisable to break the custom of an annual meeting and to have a convention instead. I am very glad that the convention was such a success and that it accomplished such good work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Leonard Grossman succeeds me in the Zionist leadership in Chicago. He is an energetic man, a good speaker, and possesses executive ability. I am sure that he will stimulate every Jew in Chicago to wake up and do some Zionist work.</p>
