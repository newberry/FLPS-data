   <p>B'nai B'rith: No order was more prompt or more energetic in the work of charity than the B'nai B'rith lodges of this city. Soon after the great catastrophy there was a meeting of the various lodges the following gentlemen were appointed a central committee on relief: Dr. B. Felsenthal, chairman; J. L. Gatrert, superintendent, and Messrs. Henry Greenebaum, Charles Nosminsky, B. W. Seligman, W. Felsenthal, A. Moses, and J. L. Unna. The following summary will show how ably and conscientously the committee did its work. Contributions: From lodges of the IOBB, $19,195.12. From other societies, $3,952.73. From individuals and firms, $2,335.60. Total receipts, $25,483.45. Disbursements: To thirty seven members of Ramah Lodge, $4,565.45. To twenty three members of Wittel Lodge, $2,525. To forty one members of Jonathan Lodge, $4,540. To nineteen members of Maurice Mayer Lodge, $1,940. To forty nine members of Sovereignity Lodge, $4,275. To thirteen non-residents members, $1, 386. To non-members of the order, $1,739.75. Through the United Relief Association, $2, 949.25. For expenses of the committee, salaries, etc., $698.65. Total disbursements, $24.618. 65. Balance in bank, $864.80, totaling, $25,483.45.</p>

   <p>There were also received thirty-two cases of clothing, blankets, bedding, etc., which were distributed under the kind and excellent management of Mrs. Henry Greenebaum, Mrs. Charles Kosminsky, and Mrs. Adolph Moses.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Relief Association took active part in relieving the wants among the sufferers of its own nationality. The sum total of its receipts and disbursements is $18,000 in money and about $5,000 worth of clothing contributed by the Hebrews of Cincinnati. The largest portion of the money came from generous people from other cities, in sums from ten to two hundred dollars, but a portion was contributed by the different Hebrew societies composing the association. The St.Joseph Hospital on North La Salle Street, which was destroyed by the fire belonged to the United Hebrews. It will shortly be rebuilt. An active part was performed in disbursing the relief by J. Rosenthal, Esq.; Abraham Mart, president of the association; Philip Stein, its secretary and Nelson Morris, its treasurer.</p>
