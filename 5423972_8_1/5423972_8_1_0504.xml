   <p>Jewish residents of Lawndale and of the Northwest Side may have labored under the impression that they were bringing up their children in a reasonably wholesome environment; that these children had in the main decent homes and were in a fair way to become respectable and worthy citizens.</p>
   <p>"There are 99,000 Jews in the Lawndale District, and 72,000 in the neighborhood of the Northwest Side (Jewish People's) Institute. The bulk of these people are of foreign birth, or are children limited by environment to foreign or street influences. A great many of them are distressingly poor and ignorant.</p>
   <p>"As they live at present, they are Not The Best of Citizens, and have only a limited chance of becoming the best of citizens. That is due more to their Environment, Poverty, and Ignorance than to innate inferiority. The Jewish People's Institute works toward the education and Americanization of these people. It breaks down their Red tendencies."</p>
   <p>Thus speaks the Tribune in its editorial designed to help the drive for funds, soon to be launched by the Jewish charities on the behalf of the J. P. I. and other philanthropies.</p>
