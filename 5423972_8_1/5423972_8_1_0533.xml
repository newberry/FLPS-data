   <p>The one great problem which American Jewry must solve, is the problem of education for the youth. In every Jewish center in America, we have a number of Jewish youth societies, youth organizations, and youth clubs. Despite this, the Jewish youth in this country grows up not only without a Jewish education, but also without Jewish traditions, because it will not, under any circumstances, accept the traditions of the parents. In many cases, parents have already severed the traditions which they brought from abroad, and if the parents live without Jewish traditions, how are the children to know what Judaism is?</p>
   <p>We are already so accustomed to the phenomenon of almost complete illiteracy among the Jewish youth, that it no longer suprises us. It is more striking <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0534.jpg" n="2"/>to strangers than it is to us. When a European Jew or prominent Jews, educators, Zionist leaders, Hebraists, etc., visit us and witness the intellectual condition of the American-Jewish youth, they are bound to ask: Is America a wilderness as far as Jewish education is concerned?</p>
   <p>It is also true that in Western Europe, Jewish education is not as strongly developed, and in certain countries, like France, Italy, and in the Scandinavian countries, Jewish education stands on a very low level; nevertheless, it is not on as low a level as in America, because even in those countries, Jewish knowledge is valued and Jewish erudition guarded, whereas in America this is not the case. American-Jewish youth not only grows up without a Jewish education, but still worse--without respect for Jewish ideas, for Jewish education, etc.</p>
   <p>The many Jewish welfare workers in America, who devote their time and energy <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0535.jpg" n="3"/>to Jewish welfare work, never stop to ask: Why are we working? If they are working for the consolidation of American Jewry, then it means that they are working for the young generation, and the young generation is abandoning us--has already abandoned us. If it is not for the young generation, of what value is all their work? If the young generation does not understand what Judaism means, cannot value Judaism, has no respect for Jewish ideas, and has no love for the Jewish tradition, what fruit can the work of our welfare workers yield?</p>
   <p>Since American Jewry has consolidated itself economically, it seems to us that it should now concern itself with the solution of one more problem--to bring the youth back to Judaism and to create, as far as possible, conditions that will enable the third generation of immigrants to adhere to Judaism.</p>
   <p>In order to carry this through, the youth must be given an opportunity to <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0536.jpg" n="4"/>acquaint itself with Jewish traditions and Jewish theories. The beginning must be made in the family--the rest must be done in Hebrew schools and Jewish centers.</p>
   <p>A Jewish educational campaign must be organized throughout America, an educational campaign in a twofold sense--one to teach parents their Jewish duty to their children; two, a campaign to raise money for Jewish educational purposes--for Jewish schools and Jewish centers.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt but that if the leaders of the American Jewry would carry on an educational campaign with as much zeal and inspiration as they do a relief campaign, adequate financial means could be raised to reconstruct the whole educational movement in America, and to place Jewish education on a solid basis.</p>
   <p>Many of the more intelligent welfare workers understand the significance of <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0537.jpg" n="5"/>the educational question, but the majority of our welfare workers still think in terms of charity and not in terms of education. Even our Orthodox welfare workers think in terms of philanthropy and forget completely that this concept is not Orthodox but rather Reform, and was created by Reform Jews in order to justify the whole destructive movement of Reform Jewry.</p>
   <p>The Orthodox welfare workers do not realize that whereas they are pretending to strengthen and fortify Orthodoxy, they are actually aiding Reform when they think in terms of charity, instead of thinking in terms of Jewish education.</p>
   <p>Not until our own [Orthodox] welfare workers understand that our chief aim is, "And you shall teach them," will the question of Jewish education in America be raised.</p>
