   <p>Congregation Shaare Zedek, Logan Square, has long felt the need of a modern Synagogue and during the last six years many attempts were made to get the co-operation and support of that portion of Chicago Jewry located in that vicinity, but in each attempt the proponents of the project met with failure, due to the difficulty in harmonizing the various factions as to the form of Judaism that the synagogue should represent. There were those who wanted Reform, and those who insisted upon ultraorthodoxy, and others who thought between the two extremes would be best. And to this end, a meeting of all the factions and auxiliaries of the Congregation was convened Wednesday evening, January 25, at Cedric Hall. Rabbi A. L. Lassen of Congregation B'nai Zion, Rogers Park, addressed the meeting, and after his impressive and convincing address, it was voted unanimously by the two hundred men and women <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0410.jpg" n="2"/>present to build a modern synagogue, such as would answer the present need of American Jewry and, nevertheless, adhere to traditional Judaism.</p>
   <p>The Synagogue will be a two story structure built on a site of 100 by 175 on the corner of Kedzie and Fullerton Avenues. In addition to the main House of Worship which will have a seating capacity of about eight hundred, there will be facilities and equipment for class rooms, library rooms, Beth Hamidrosh, Dining Room, Dance Hall, Assembly Hall, etc. The plan of specifications has already been drawn up and sixty thousand dollars has already been secured as a nucleus to proceed with the work.</p>
   <p>Mr. Harry B. Rubenstein, President of the Congregation, has rendered valuable service in making the building of the synagogue a reality.</p>
   <p>The other officers of the Congregation are as follows: J. Rosenfeld, Vice President; A. S. Shapiro, Treasurer; Martin Wolf, Recording Secretary; J. J. Steiner, Financial Secretary.</p>
