   <p>There is a movement on foot on the South Side to organize and unite the Jewish element in that community. The leader of this project is Rabbi Jacob Levinshon of Englewood. Not long ago the rabbi called in a few South Side Jews for a conference and introduced his idea. The synagogue, Rhodoph Zedek, 18th and Michigan Avenue was selected for the meeting place. This synagogue is located in the heart of the South Side and last Saturday Rabbi Levinshon laid his plans before a large assembly selected from different South Side synagogues. His idea and plans were unanimously accepted.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1292.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The program of uniting the different organizations is not as yet an assured fact, but the idea is that all synagogues, societies and organizations, located on the South Side and interested in Jewry, religion, Zionism, and cultural and literary pursuits, should be united in one organization. For example, the Hebrew Institute on the West Side, or the Educational Alliance on the Northwest Side which centralizes all Jewish forces in the community. It is our desire that every synagogue, society and organization, interested in Jewish activities, should form committees and give their names to Rabbi Levinshon who will arrange all meetings where propaganda for this plan can be discussed.</p>
