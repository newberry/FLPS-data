   <p>In the same week that Reverend Mr. Stratton made his violent attacks upon the theatres, upon the actors, and upon the Jewish managers, claiming that they are ruining the morals of our land and that they are responsible for all crimes and sin committed throughout the United States; at the very same time, in the same week, the press came out with three stories in which the heroes were clergymen. One of these stories took place in a small town in the state of Arkansas; a clergyman was sentenced to life imprisonment for hiring a man to murder a poor, old, lonely woman. He was in hopes that after the death of this poor woman, he would fall heir to her legacy. He paid the hired man $850 for the job. The hired man confessed the crime. A similar story occurred in Canada; a clergyman, with his own hands, murdered his own brother. He had taken out a $25,000 life insurance policy on his brother, and a few weeks later, while riding in an automobile, shot his brother to death.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0119.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The third occurrence took place in the city of New York. A colleague and old friend of the Reverend Mr. Stratton, and preacher of the Holy Gospel, was the hero of the drama. The members of that church brought some abominable accusation against that God-fearing holy man. They spoke of his shameful and inmoral acts. Some of those who were present at the hearing of the charges against this man became hysterical and left the room. The committee of the church, after investigating the case, has exonerated him of these charges. But the accusers are prominent members, and Stratton himself declared that these charges cannot be weeded out so easily. A more thorough and, impartial investigation will follow.</p>
   <p>The theatre manager Mr. Brady, in his reply to the Reverend Mr. Stratton, stated that he has figures showing that there are more clergymen in America prisons than there are actors. To this the Reverend Mr. Stratton answered that the member of clergymen is larger than the number of actors. That of course is correct, but if the actors are the lowest creatures, and the clergymen are the holiest, then the proportion of the clergymen in jail ought to <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0120.jpg" n="3"/>be smaller. That, however, is not the case: among the most brutal criminals, you will find a great number of clergymen's names; among the worst degenerates you will find many names of holy people. That is not only a case of the present time, but it was always the case in times gone by, when religion was much finer and cleaner.</p>
   <p>As a class, the clergymen ought to be the last ones to preach morality to other classes.</p>
