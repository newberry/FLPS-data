<title level="a">PROTEST RESOLUTION AGAINST JOHNSON BILL UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED BY CITY COUNCIL; ALDERMAN ARVEY HEADS DELEGATION TO WASHINGTON</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Yesterday afternoon, the City Council, in the name of the city of Chicago, unanimously adopted a resolution protesting against the immigration bill that has been introduced in Congress. The Council also decided to send a delegation to Washington to protest against the bill in the name of the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The judiciary committee of the City Council had a hearing on Tuesday and unanimously resolved to recommend to the City Council that the resolution be adopted. It was, therefore, expected that the City Council should take the action that it did.</p>
   <p>Yesterday Alderman Lyle, the chairman of the judiciary committee introduced <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0838.jpg" n="2"/>the resolution from the floor of the City Council and spoke in favor of its adoption. Alderman [Jacob] Arvey, who had introduced the resolution, then made a speech in which he showed how the new immigration bill discriminates against certain nationalities, and how it recognizes other nationalities as undesirable immigrants.</p>
   <p>Alderman Schwartz cited an interesting historical case from the records of Pennsylvania. In 1750, the first Dutch settlers in Pennsylvania protested against the recent immigrants from England, stating that they were a menace to the country. In a strongly worded statement, Alderman Schwartz declared that a country always gains by immigration, and that, contrariwise, a country that has no immigration is fated either to remain stationary or to retrogress.</p>
   <p>Aldermen [S.] Adamkiewicz, Petlak, and Burns spoke in favor of the resolution. Nobody spoke against it and it was adopted unanimously.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0839.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mayor Dever then announced the names of the members of the committee which is to go to Washington to record the protest of the city of Chicago against the Johnson bill. The committee consists of Jacob M. Arvey, chairman, Petlak, Nelson, Klinke, Guernsey, and Franhauser. The Committee will leave for Washington as soon as word is received from Congressman A. J. Sabath that he has arranged for a hearing by the immigration committee.</p>
