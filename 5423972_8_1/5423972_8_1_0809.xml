   <p>Amid great festivities the B'Nai Israel Congregation celebrated the laying of the corner stone for its new synagogue yesterday afternoon, at 62nd and Aberdeen Street. Rabbi I. D. Friedmann offered a prayer at the commencement of the celebration; speeches in English and German by the Elders of the congregation, Isaac Golden and Rabbi Lesser, followed. The privilege of laying the corner stone was granted to the highest bidder at public auction; Isaac Bernard obtained it upon payment of $75.00. The laying of the three contiguous stones brought $12.00, $11.00, and $15.00; the masonic work was then performed by N. Goldmann, S. Urbani and I. Schiff.</p>
   <p>A copy of the community's constitution and by-laws, also a list, enumerating the officials and members, as well as Chicago news-papers, were sealed into the corner stone.</p>
   <p>The plot for the synagogue is 50x125 feet and cost $2,500.00; the building will be 40x65 feet, of two story construction; wood is to be used for material and the main hall will seat 300 persons.</p>
   <p>The B'Nai Israel congregation was organized in the year 1889, having had five members at the time, today it has fifty followers. A special rabbi has not yet been obtained.</p>
