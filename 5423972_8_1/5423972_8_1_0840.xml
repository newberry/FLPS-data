<title level="a">PERSECUTION OF IMMIGRANTS UNANIMOUSLY CONDEMNED BY COUNCIL COMMITTEE AND REPRESENTATIVES OF ALL NATIONALITIES IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Native-born Americans, Irish, Jews, Poles, Italians, Lithuanians, Czechoslovakians, and representatives of other nationalities met yesterday afternoon in the chambers of the City Council of Chicago and strongly condemned the pending anti-immigration bill. The fifteen aldermen of the judiciary committee voted in favor of the resolution condemning the anti-immigration bill, and adopted Judge [Harry] Fisher's motion to send a delegation to Washington to fight the immigration bill in the name of the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The hearing yesterday was an encouraging event in the lives of our immigrants who have recently had to endure a great deal of persecution. It proved that the immigrant does not stand alone.</p>
   <p>This is what happened. Aldermen [Jacob] Arvey, [J. O.] Kostner, Horan, and <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0841.jpg" n="2"/>[B. S.] Adamowski introduced a resolution in the City Council to protest, in the name of the city of Chicago, against the Johnson anti-immigration bill. The City Council turned the resolution over to the judiciary committee for a hearing. The judiciary committee held the hearing yesterday in the chambers of the City Council.</p>
   <p>The first speaker, Miss Jane Addams, the well-known fighter for freedom, immediately created an atmosphere of warmth and friendliness. The famous American woman, who is respected by the entire world, condemned the pending immigration bill as one which discriminates among nations and which spreads hatred.</p>
   <p>Circuit Court Judge Scanlan delivered a brilliant speech. He told how his father, an Irish immigrant, had been persecuted a few decades ago by the enemies of immigration. As far back as 1840, a cry was raised that the immigrants were a menace, but the immigrants, who kept coming here despite the cries against them, have built a great and powerful America and have protected it from danger.</p>
   <p>Judge Scanlan related a few remarkable facts. Washington's army was an army of <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0842.jpg" n="3"/>immigrants, he declared. People now complain about the Jews but they seem to forget that there were over a hundred Jewish officers in Washington's army. During Washington's time, every Jew was a real patriot for American independence. America was saved in the Civil War, said Judge Scanlan, by the immigrants. They made up the ranks of the Union army.</p>
   <p>Judge Scanlan concluded his speech by referring to the principles of our founding fathers to prove that the present anti-immigration bill is a blow at American ideals, and is a dastardly act which should be condemned. The Judge received an ovation at the conclusion of his speech.</p>
   <p>In a long and powerful speech, Circuit Court Judge Fisher proved that the bill, if passed, will drive America into an abyss because, for the first time, a division between nationalities will have been made, officially, by an act of Congress. This will inflame all the nationalities of Eastern and Southern Europe against America, and, in America itself, two classes will be created: the desirable and the undesirable. Judge Fisher concluded his speech by proposing that the City <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0843.jpg" n="4"/>Council send a delegation to Washington.</p>
   <p>Speeches were delivered by Municipal Court Judges [Francis] Borrelli and Barasa, by ex-Alderman Toman, by representatives of the Italians, Poles, Czechoslovakians, Lithuanians, Jugoslavians, and other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Samuel Levin of the Amalgamated gave a brief speech. A few words were spoken by representatives of the Workmens' Circle, International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, various trade unions, Young Men's Hebrew Association, and many other organizations of various nationalities. Resolutions passed by the United Jewish Orthodox Congregations, by the Joint Relief Committee, and other organizations were read.</p>
   <p>Alderman Lyle, chairman of the judiciary committee, then ordered a vote taken on the resolution. Alderman Arvey made the official motion and declared that the Courier had drawn the attention of the aldermen to the bill, and should really be given credit for the resolution. Alderman Nelson seconded Arvey's <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0844.jpg" n="5"/>motion. A roll call of the members of the committee was taken. Everyone voted "yes".</p>
   <p>Judge Fisher's motion that a committee from the City Council should leave for Washington was also adopted. The resolution against the pending anti-immigration bill will be brought up today before the City Council. There is no doubt that it will be adopted.</p>
   <p>Congressman A. J. Sabath sent a telegram expressing his regret that he was unable to attend the hearing because he is busy attending committee meetings in Congress on the immigration question.</p>
