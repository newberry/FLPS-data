  <body>
   <p>An Orthodox newspaper in New York, which is closer to the Mizrachi [Orthodox wing in Zionist group] than to the Zionist organization, gloated over the rumor that Dr. Weizmann had resigned [as president of the World Zionist Organization], and made the most of the rumor by attacking Dr. Weizmann, thereby getting even with him. This newspaper accuses Weizmann of wanting more power and criticizes him sharply for a political deal which he is alleged to have made with Emir Abdullah of Transjordania.</p>
   <p>There is absolutely no truth to the story about the deal with the Arabian leader. We can rest assured that the leader of the World Zionist Organization will not betray Zionism, nor will he hinder Zionist interests, nor will he make a move without the sanction of the labor faction. If the labor faction does not complain about Weizmann's alleged autocracy and diplomatic intrigues, then an <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1054.jpg" n="2"/>editor of a Jewish newspaper in America has no ground for complaint. No one should be more Pope-like than the Pope.</p>
   <p>After expressing its deep satisfaction with Dr. Weizmann's resignation, this newspaper had to deny the rumor the following day. But in the meantime, the true position of this newspaper toward Dr. Weizmann had been made clear. It assumes a very hostile attitude toward him. But as long as Dr. Weizmann was at the head of the World Zionist Organization, it did not say a thing against him. It isn't profitable to start a row with a Poretz [Editor's note: An influential individual]. The very moment, however, that it [the Jewish newspaper of New York] believed that Dr. Weizmann had fallen, it showed its true colors. And the grievance held by the New York paper against Dr. Weizmann is shared by a number of people in America and Europe.</p>
   <p>In one respect only are the charges concrete. His opponents claim that Dr. Weizmann covets too much power. The other charges are all vague and indefinite, that is they are not concrete. His opponents are opposed to Weizmann <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1055.jpg" n="3"/>because he is not a Mizrachi or because he is not a Poale Zion (labor group of Zionists) or because he does not compromise with this or with that group--with the Ziere Zion ("youth" group of Zionists) or with the Revisionists, who are under the leadership of Vladimir Jabotinsky. Every priest believes that he can be a Pope and each priest further believes that he would be more successful on the throne of Peter than the Pope himself--"why am I not as capable as anyone else of acting as Pope?"</p>
   <p>It is very difficult to be a leader among Jews. Jews are a subjective people; they are a critical and gifted people, and a Jewish leader must possess many more qualifications than a non-Jewish leader. Any person who has Dr. Weizmann's responsibilities is not in an enviable position because he is one of us. "A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own house." Yet a Jew from Pinsk suddenly emerges as a prophet from among his circle of friends--a leader of those with whom he grew up. Many resent that. For this reason, many Zionists and semi-Zionists oppose Dr. Weizmann.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1056.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>They [Dr. Weizmann's opponents] cannot deny his ability as a diplomat and as a leader. They cannot deny his splendid characteristics as a man and as a Jew. After all, how many Weizmanns can the Jewish people claim at this moment? We are very eager to know where we can find another Weizmann--a great Jew from Eastern Europe with a Western European culture; a Hebraist who knows how to win the confidence of the greatest diplomats of his time; a scientist who has answered an historic call [Zionism], and a man who is a magnificent specimen of humanity. Had Weizmann come from another camp, all his present opponents would have the greatest respect for him, as they had for Brandeis. Did anyone have the temerity to utter one word against Brandeis, even when they felt that he was in error? No! He came from another camp. But Weizmann is one of us. That is why we permit ourselves to be arrogant toward him and to speak of him in a disparaging tone.</p>
   <p>We charge Dr. Weizmann with seeking too much power because he wants to coordinate the executive structure of the Zionist organization, and to introduce a system of centralized authority; because he does not permit the irresponsible <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1057.jpg" n="5"/>Vladimir Jabotinsky to do things which the Zionist organization cannot allow.</p>
   <p>The only charges that we can bring against Weizmann are: one, that he permitted Jabotinsky to go unchecked up to now; two, that he should have introduced more centralization and co-ordination than he did. Had Dr. Weizmann not given Jabotinsky a fair trial when he (Jabotinsky) concluded his agreement with the agents of Petlura thereby exposing Zionism [to criticism and censure], there would have been nothing left of Jabotinsky's politics today. Dr. Weizmann believed that people like Jabotinsky would eventually understand that underhand politics cannot be carried on in behalf of Zionism, and would co-operate with the President of the Organization who is, after all, the only man responsible for Zionism.</p>
   <p>Now that Jabotinsky and his comrades refuse to subject themselves to discipline, Dr. Weizmann must insist upon discipline. For this reason his [Dr. Weizmann] opponents assert that he seeks too much power and is inclined to be a despot.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1058.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>If they could not find any other fault with Dr. Weizmann, they would have been much wiser if they had kept quiet.</p>
