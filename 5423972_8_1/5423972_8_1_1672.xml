   <p>The first annual convention of the Chicago Zionists opened last night at the Hebrew Institute. Over one hundred and fifty representatives of districts, clubs, societies, and other Zionist organizations participated.</p>
   <p>The convention was opened by Dr. S. M. Melamed, chairman of Chicago's central committee. Dr. Melamed gave a short report on the present condition of the Zionist central committee, and then proposed that the convention should elect its chairman, vice-chairmen, and secretary.</p>
   <p>There was a lengthy discussion on the agenda of the convention, in which Messrs. S. B. Komaiko, Meyer Abrams, S. Antonow, Fred Lubin, and others participated. The following were elected officers of the convention: Dr. S. K. Rosenzweig, chairman; Leonard Grossman, Dr. Walter, and B. Antonow, vice-chairmen; Maxim Hirsch, secretary.</p>

   <p>The convention adopted a resolution proposed by Mr. Max Shulman that a telegram of greetings be sent to the annual conference of the Zionist committee, now being held at Carlsbad. A committee will be elected today to work out the text of the telegram.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Antonow gave a report on the financial condition of the central committee for the past eight months. The income from dues, donations, and meetings was, according to the report, five thousand five hundred seventy dollars and eight cents. The expenditures were five thousand five hundred four dollars and eighty-five cents. There is now in the treasury a balance of sixty-five dollars and twenty-three cents.</p>
   <p>The convention was then addressed by Dr. S. M. Melamed.</p>
   <p>Today, the convention will be in session for the whole day. The first session will start at ten o'clock in the morning, and the second session at two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
