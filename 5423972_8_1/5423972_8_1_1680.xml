   <p>Jewish organizations of Chicago are organizing a Naturalization Aid League at the conference. The naturalization conference held Friday night at the Workmens Circle Lyceum was a large success in every respect. Many organizations were represented, and the questions dealt with, were intelligently and systematically handled. All who were present felt the importance of this, the first conference; and all knew that very essential work had been accomplished. They also felt that they had successfully built the organization, that they had intended to build. A Naturalization Aid League, which will undertake to make our Jewish masses into American citizens.</p>
   <p>Comrade M. Blumen, of the City Central Committee of the Jewish Socialist Alliance, called the conference to order. In a short talk he explained the task that lay before this gathering, and immediately thereafter the following were elected officers: Comrade Terr, M. Blumen, secretary, Comrade N. Weinrib, Abramowitz and Levin, the credential committee, and Comrades Samuel Holland, Sobel, Ziskind, Abramowitz, and Kramer, the organization's and resolutions' committees.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1681.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The chairman then called upon some of the leaders of the naturalization work for a few remarks. Attorney Jessie Marcus reported on the work at the Douglas Branch; Comrade M. Weinrib reported on the work of the North West Side; Attorney Samuel Holland and Comrade S. P. Kramer, whom the chairman introduced as the initiators of this movement, spoke on the work in general, and of the new laws that are being proposed to restrict immigration.</p>
   <p>The New York Naturalization Aid League, greeted the conference warmly by a hearty telegram presented by their manager, Comrade E. H. Wesherin. The work of the conference began, after the organizations and resolutions committee returned with their reports. A Naturalization Aid League has been in existence in Chicago for the last few months and that is the league organized by Comrades of the Forward, the Jewish Socialist Alliance and the Young American Branch of the Workmens Circle. This League has two branches, and has done excellent work. It is the work of this conference to put the League on a sound foundation <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1682.jpg" n="3"/>and place all the work on a wide and more systematic basis. A plan was finally effected for a League, to be kept up by all Jewish organizations, without disturbance due to scarcity of money. An executive board of fifteen was elected, consisting of representatives of the large central body. The names of the executive board will be announced later in the Forward.</p>
   <p>The conference thanked the Forward, the New York League and all comrades who were active in the work until now. Before adjourning the conference, Comrade Terr, the chairman declared that many conferences had been held in Chicago, but no conference had built a foundation for such constructive work as had this conference.</p>
