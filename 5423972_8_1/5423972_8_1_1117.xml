   <p>The opening of the Twelfth Zionist Congress was certainly a very solemn and very edifying affair, but we are not so sure that the discussions and the debates on the various problems with which the Zionist Congress is confronted will be solemn and edifying too. In the course of the last eight years, vast quantities of "gases" were accumulated within the Zionist movement, and not before these gases evaporate can one expect the stormy Twelfth Congress to be a very peaceful affair. We moreover expect stormy sessions and stormy debates, but we hope, at the same time, that all will end well for the benefit of the great cause.</p>
   <p>The Zionist Congress, attended by a thousand delegates or more, is composed of various elements and of men and women of different temperaments, different occupations, and different stations in life, and under such conditions it is <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1118.jpg" n="2"/>only natural that there should be clashes and heated discussions. In the main the Congress is composed of three different elements, the right, the left, and the center. The center consists of the delegates of America, Austria, Germany, Czeko-Slovakia, Jugo-Slavia and Roumania, while the left parties consist of the Poale Zion, of the Zeire Zion, the Hapoel Hazoir, and the like. The workingman delegates are by no means red radicals, and in comparison to the Eastern European or even to the Central European radicals, there are but moderate laborites, and their main program is the betterment of the position of labor in Palestine and favorable working conditions under a regime of social justice. We do not believe that the main parties are opposed to this program as far as it is only economic in nature. They may, however, be opposed to the cultural policies of the left.</p>
   <p>The right wing consists of the Mizrachi and of the various non-Mizrachi delegates who lean toward Orthodoxy. These delegates are too few in number proportionally to determine the course of the Congress. It seems that the center is the most influential group, and at the same time financially the strongest group. We <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1119.jpg" n="3"/>presume that the delegates from England, also belong to the center, so that this group actually represents the majority of the Congress, and also the main financial power of the Zionist Organization. The Jews of America, England and Germany are still the strongest financial Jewish groups, and they will have to do the financing of Palestine; and needless to say that they will have the greatest influence on the shaping of the Zionist policies. This group is loyal to the present administration, and it will no doubt try to place it again in power. The delegates belonging to the center will make an attempt to kill the motion of the laborites regarding the participation of private capital in the development of Palestine. Mr. Ussishkin, who is by no means conservative, has already announced that he is not opposed to private investments in Palestine, and if the labor element is still the dominating force in the Holy Land, it is because the middle class has not deemed it advisable to participate as much in the reconstruction of the country as has labor. While thousands of Chalutzim are going to Palestine, only a few middle class people settle in the Holy Land, and this is a very deplorable state of <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1120.jpg" n="4"/>affairs. If this practice should continue for a considerable time, then there will be in Palestine only two classes of Jews, workingmen and officials of the Zionist organization, or those who are in charge of the work of reconstruction. Palestine will be a country of small farmers and workingmen. Such a country, history shows, can never be strong.</p>
   <p>This the Zionist leaders realize, and they will do their best to induce the middle class people to settle in Palestine and to invest their capital in the country. Even radical-minded Zionists like Poale Zion, who are socialistically inclined, admit that without the help of private capital the reconstruction of the Holy Land cannot make rapid strides, and on the other hand, they are not very much enthused over the introduction of private capital in Palestine, because they cling to certain theoretical principles. However, with principles alone Palestine will not be rebuilt. Private capital will do the job much better. We expect that the main discussions of the Congress will be centered around this question, and we are hopeful that the center will win out in the end, but that the workingmen will be given a certain guarantee that no attempts will be made <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1121.jpg" n="5"/>to lower their cultural and economic standards.</p>
   <p>The solution of the Arabic problem will also cause heated discussions in the committee rooms. We do not expect that the Congress will deal with this delicate problem in open sessions. It will be thrashed out in the committee rooms, and the Congress will be notified of what has been decided to do in the matter. Altogether we expect it to be a very lively Congress because it is the first international Zionist Congress within the last eight years, and because it is confronted with so many vital problems affecting the very existence of the Zionist movement and the very fate of the Jewish people. We are convinced that our American delegates will exercise a helpful and moderating influence on the Congress, and that they will contribute to its success, because the American delegates are experienced Zionist workers and are very familiar with all the problems with which the Zionist organization is at present confronted.</p>
