  <p>Every day we find more scandals in the Chicago sacramental wine enterprise. The witnesses now appearing in Federal Judge Carpenter's Court, where the case of the sacramental wine scandals is being tries are telling tales out of schools and we are constantly finding new scandals and graft. It is learned now that the standard price of wine permits were $300 for each individual during the winter of 1924, and that later this was raised to $400. It was also learned that over $30,000 in graft has been paid by wine dealers to the prohibition leaders and their go-betweens. The ones accused were State Senator Lowell B. Mason of Oak Park, and former Prohibition Director, Percy B. Owen. It was proved at the trial that over a million gallons of contraband wine from the government warehouse were released to the wine dealers.</p>
  <p>Last night Irving Friedman stepped out as the star witness for the government. Friedman, a jewelry dealer, now lives at the East End Hotel. Friedman admitted that he was a wine dealer. He told how in 1924, he had paid graft and that he received good results from the prohibition office. Friedman also told that in 1923, that wine dealers suffered no hardships in obtaining wine for religious purposes, but that in 1924, they found that the
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0068.jpg" n="2"/> prohibition officers were more strict and would not issue any more permits. Friedman told that he was informed how to contact Louis Abelson, who could be of some assistance to him. He saw Mr. Abelson, who was one of the collectors for the prohibition officers. Abelson gave all the permits he could use at $300 each. Abelson then suggested, said Friedman, that all the wine dealers should get together and adopt some scheme to make him the dealer of the permits. Friedman spoke to the majority of wine dealers and all approved of this plan. Right then and there the plan was established. Friedman would collect the graft from the dealers and turn it over to Abelson, who would split with the prohibition officials.</p>
   <p>Friedman told that he paid out $3,000 graft to Abelson in a period of three months in 1924. "In the month of May, 1924," continued Friedman, "it again became difficult to obtain permits and Frank Loveland, a friend of Abelson's proposed that Friedman should meet him at lunch to talk things over." Friedman kept the appointment and also found Ralph Stone at lunch with Loveland. Stone later was appointed Prohibition Director for Illinois. After lunch the three went out automobile riding. At Roosevelt Road and Michigan Avenue, Loveland stepped out of the car, and Friedman and Stone talked things over. Stone said that the prohibition officials were very strict in letting out <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0069.jpg" n="3"/>wine permits and, "After all,"said Stone, "dealers can't expect to get permits now at $300 each. The new price will be from now on, $400 each." Friedman approved of the new price.</p>
   <p>After Friedman's statements in this case, the trial was set to continue at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.</p>
