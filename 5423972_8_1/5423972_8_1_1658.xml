  <body>
   <p>A report on the Peoples Relief Conference was, already, published in the Forward. We have mentioned in this report, a resolution which was adopted. We hereby submit this resolution:</p>
   <p>We, the representatives of thirty-eight Jewish labor organizations in Chicago assembled at a special conference, called by the Peoples Relief Committee in Chicago, October 1, 1922, having listened to a report from our delegates to the National Peoples Relief Convention in Philadelphia and have resolved:</p>
   <p>1. That the action of our delegates, who have adhered to the instructions of the Peoples Relief Conference in Chicago meets with our approval.</p>
   <p>2. That the adopted resolutions adopted at the convention in Philadelphia concerning the Joint Board, though not in full accordance with our resolutions are nevertheless close to the viewpoints, which our resolutions have <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1659.jpg" n="2"/>expressed; and, taking into consideration the fact that the unprecedented poverty abroad requires the support of the Jewish masses in America, we agree that the Peoples Relief is the apparatus which the entire Jewish working class had established and is the only apparatus through which the Jewish working classes carry on its relief work.</p>
   <p>The conference determines to accept the adopted resolutions of the convention and obligates itself and all affiliated organizations and appeals to all Jews, especially Jewish workers, to support the Peoples Relief in its great and important work.</p>
   <p>At the same time, the conference demands that the general executive put into effect the convention's resolutions concerning the Joint Board.</p>
