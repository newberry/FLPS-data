   <p>The brethren of the Independent Order of B'nai B'rith held a mass-meeting last evening at Oriental Hall, 122 La Salle Street, to officially receive the officers and General Committee of the District Grand Lodge. The meeting was well attended, considering the state of the weather. Mr. Adolph Loeb, Grand Secretary, called the meeting to order, and, after explaining its object, nominated Mr. Charles Kozminski as Chairman, who was unanimously elected. Mr. Kozminski in a few well-chosen remarks thanked the brethren for the honor conferred upon him. A committee of three was appointed to bring in the Grand Officers. The Committee retired and soon after filed in with the officers and placed them in a row in front of the Chairman, who welcomed them. He then introduced them individually and severally to the members present. They were R. Reichman of Milwaukee, President; D. Amberg of Grand Rapids, Vice President;.....</p>
   <p>President R. Reichman addressed the meeting in German, going over the past history of the Order, and showing how much good has already been accomplished through its instrumentality. He also spoke of the needs to maintain the present state of the Order.</p>

   <p>Mr. Samuel Kaizer, Professor of Elocution at Hershey Hall, then read very effectively an elaborate and able poem on religious liberty entitled "Epitoma Judaica," by Dr. H. M. Bien of this city. Dr. Bien dedicated this poem to the Orders of B'nai B'rith, Kesher Shel Barsel, and Free Sons of Israel, to commemorate the erection at Philadelphia, July 4, 1876, of Ezekiel's Centennial monument, embodying the principles of religious liberty.</p>
   <p>After this several of the Chicago members made short remarks and then the meeting was adjourned.</p>
