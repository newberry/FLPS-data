   <p>In one of the English comic sheets, which draws a large part of its earnings from its jokes and caricatures about Jews, we noticed a cartoon of a Jew who was at the point of death, and whose wife and children stood near his bedside weeping bitterly. The dying Jew was fretful because they did not want him to die, and he said to those standing by, "Why should I live on in this world? Money can no longer be made in the clothing business."</p>
   <p>We recalled this typically Gentile joke, which sees money as the only thing in life that the Jews value, when we read in some letters from France that the Gentiles there do not permit the French Jews to die [i. e., to become assimilated]--the Jews who are bending every effort to crush and destroy the last remnant of their Jewish spirit. In France, however, it is <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0681.jpg" n="2"/>neither a joke nor a caricature; it is a tragic fact--tragic, that is, for those Jews who want the world to forget that they are Jews.</p>
   <p>The most prominent advocate, among the French Jews, of the theory of complete assimilation is Joseph Reinach. Anyone who has heard of him is familiar with the views he constantly preaches in his books and newspaper articles. He is forever saying that the Jews are not a race and not a nation. He does not even agree with the cynical remark made by Heinrich Heine, that the Jewish religion is not a religion, but rather a misfortune. Reinach would say the Jewish religion is not even a misfortune; it is only a memory. From his point of view, it [the Jewish religion] is not even a pleasant memory, but is rather some sort of a nightmare, of which one reminds oneself. Reinach is the intellectual leader of those French Jews who constantly shout that they are not Jews, but Frenchmen.</p>
   <p>Now along comes a famous French author and journalist, Monsieur George Piache, and asks this question: Are such "Frenchmen" who deny their ancestry, who <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0682.jpg" n="3"/>no longer concern themselves about the fate of their people, who remain indifferent to the persecution of their people--are such people to be considered true Frenchmen?</p>
   <p>In his weekly newspaper, Monsieur George Piache expresses the opinion that such Jews are not truly French. "The Jewish masses," he says, "who proudly and courageously shoulder the burden caused by Jewish suffering, stand much higher, in my opinion, than those assimilated Jews who seek to run away from their people and want to be something other than Jews.</p>
   <p>"The poor Jew," he continues, "who sticks by his people in periods of sorrow as well as joy, is in a position to give something of his own individuality to the world. But what can the Reinachs offer? They are too intellectually bankrupt to contribute anything to the world."</p>
   <p>We must not assume that statements like these, made by prominent Frenchmen, will persuade the Reinachs and their kind to return to the Jewish people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0683.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>They are too far gone in their "death agony," and their attitude toward returning to the fold is like of the Jew in the cartoon: "Why should I live if I can't make money in the clothing business?" But, at least, M. Reinach can reason from this that if Judaism is not a religion, it is, none the less, a misfortune.</p>
   <p>It is simply horrible to go on living like this, and it is still worse when they [French Jews] are prevented from dying [i. e., from becoming assimilated].</p>
   <p>The Frenchman who understands the significance of being affiliated to his people, and who knows what such an affiliation means in the spiritual life of an individual, knows what havoc is wrought in the soul of an individual who tries to break away from his people. The Frenchman senses the great truth that the [intrinsic] qualities of an individual, as is similarly true of his race, are required for truly creative work. He who severs his relationship with his people, is disqualified and unable to create something original.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0684.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Monsieur Piache is obviously a profound thinker. He possesses deep insight into the pschology of various peoples. He knows that a Baruch Spinoza could have developed only from a pure Jewish environment. He knows that the Reinachs, who have estranged themselves from their own people, can, for the most part, write books containing material which they accumulated as a result of considerable work and effort. They [the Reinachs] cannot, however, create anything original, because, to do so, one must possess genius, as well as creative ability--and this can only be inherited.</p>
   <p>We have discussed this incident which took place in France because it is characteristic of Jewish assimilation in all countries. That which Monsieur Piache said in Paris is reiterated by writers and thinkers in Berlin, London and Petrograd. Mention of this is also made in America. And these statements are made not out of hatred toward Jews, but because of an aversion that inevitably develops among people, for those who deny their spiritual heritage.</p>
   <p>There will come a day when all Jews will begin to realize that a Jew cannot <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0685.jpg" n="6"/>deny his heritage nor shrink from his duties, and, at the same time, remain unpunished.</p>
