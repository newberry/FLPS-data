   <p>Alderman Jonas' institution, the free lodging house, which was opened on the first day of the new year, on corner Wells and Indiana Sts., is getting on prosperously. Since it was started there has been a nightly increase of applicants, and on the 11th of this month, they numbered 90. The place is kept in very good order, loud talking and drunkenness being prohibited. At night the men are given bread and meat, and in the morning a bowl of soup and a large piece of bread. Up to a few days ago the whole weight of this work rested upon Alderman Jonas' shoulders; this benevolent son of Israel spending much money of his own to maintain this institution, and we are glad to learn that another co-religionist, Mr. Ludwing has interested himself in this charitable institution. This house will be kept up during the entire Winter.</p>
