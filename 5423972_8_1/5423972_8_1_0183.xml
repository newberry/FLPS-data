  <body>
   <p>Today a new Juvenile Court opened in Chicago that will prosecute convicted children ranging from seventeen to twenty-one years of age. This court is a result of the splendid work accomplished by the Juvenile Court in Chicago since its inception. Up to now only cases of children not over seventeen were admitted in this court, and cases of children over seventeen had to be treated in the old-fashioned way of grouping them with adult criminals, with the result that the prison was the first place in which they, the firstlings, would learn the ways of the underworld.</p>
   <p>Recently, however, various societies were organized on the basis of new research on criminals. It is claimed that as long as a young man entangled in a crime may be brought back to the road of justice, he should be given all opportunities. All doors of life should be opened to him in order that he may be on a level with all of us.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0184.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Almost everybody knows full well that no child is born with criminal tendencies. Even if the parents are criminals, their children will not become corrupt if given the proper environment. Under certain conditions no child will be prone to steal, even if he is mentally deranged. We have recently learned of a case in which a child of morally degraded parents was taken away from them. The child was twelve and had the mentality of a six-year-old. He was photographed as he appeared while living with his parents, and his picture made a shocking impression on everyone who looked at it. The face appeared deranged and maddened like that of a vicious beast; his eyes were red from drinking together with his demoralized parents; his hair was disheveled, and his hunchbacked body was on the verge of crushing in.</p>
   <p>The child was taken to a decent, intelligent home, where he was clothed, educated, and his hair trimmed and kept combed. The result was that in the course of two years the child had changed so much for the better, mentally and physically, that when he was photographed again no one could be made to believe that both pictures were of the same boy, that the sympathetic, innocent child of today had any relationship with the criminal <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0185.jpg" n="3"/>image of yesterday.</p>
   <p>This and many other similar experiments made by reformers, clearly prove that when prosecuting the youth we should first of all devise corrective ways tending to rid them of evil influence, especially if they are born and reared in a criminal environment. In any event, the prison is no place for juvenile criminals. The prison is a school that instills hatred for society in the youthful and casual criminal, which leads him to professional crimes. Having a criminal record, the youngster cannot return to society, and must therefore remain outside of it for the rest of his life as a refuse of society.</p>
   <p>This is the reason why there now exists in Chicago and many other cities special courts,--juvenile courts,--for children. There is where, they deal with all cases having to do with boys who deviate from the path of justice. They are examined there by a psychiatrist. If they are curable, they are cured; if mentally irretrievable, they are sent to an institution founded for that purpose.</p>
   <p>The juvenile court's aim is to help children misled by environmental conditions and poverty. If possible, it removes them from evil surroundings.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0186.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The good results that Juvenile courts have yielded lead one to believe that similar methods should be applied to boys over seventeen and less than twenty-one. A boy brought before this court is not considered a low or corrupt character, but a lost sheep that needs the supervision of a shepherd, a child who needs the love of a father, a student who seeks the advice of a teacher.</p>
   <p>And this is why the opening of this Juvenile Court is such a grand holiday for the organizations and reformers who strive to improve the life of children, and who want to see crime uprooted and demoralization disappear.</p>
   <p>All these reformers foresee in this new Juvenile Court a new means to save human life from the deep abyss to which life reluctantly has a tendency to slope.</p>
