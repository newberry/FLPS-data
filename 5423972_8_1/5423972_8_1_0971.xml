<title level="a">ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS RAISED AT THE KEREN HAYESOD BANQUET; MAYOR DEVER GIVES THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>Over one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars was raised last evening at the Keren Hayesod drive banquet given at the Congress Hotel.</p>
   <p>Over four hundred of the noblest Jews of the city were present at the banquet, which was arranged to open the Keren Hayesod drive here. Chicago has to raise three hundred thousand dollars as its 1924 quota.</p>
   <p>Dr. Abramowich, director of the Keren Hayesod for the Middle West, was the toastmaster.</p>
   <p>He told the story of Zionism, the most beautiful ideal the Jews have, in a <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0972.jpg" n="2"/>short, sincere speech. He told about the success of Zionism and the new spirit which it brought to Jewish life. "Only ten years ago nobody wanted to believe us, because nobody could see our sacred duty, but today everybody may believe because everybody can see," were the concluding words of Dr. Abramowich's brief speech.</p>
   <p>Leonard J. Grossman then read the message of Mayor Dever, which will remain a memorable document in the history of Zionism and of the American Jewry.</p>
   <p>Mr. Grossman also thanked Michael Rosenberg and Alderman [Jacob M.] Arvey for arranging the audience between Mayor Dever and a committee of Zionists.</p>
   <p>Michael Rosenberg arose and declared that the Mayor had given two hundred and fifty dollars as his contribution to the Keren Hayesod. The public arose and stormily applauded the friend of the Jews and the latest recruit to Zionism--Mayor Dever.</p>
   <p>Judge Hugo Pam delivered a strong speech, urging the American Jews to open the <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0973.jpg" n="3"/>gates of Palestine. He declared that it is the duty of the American Jews to open their pocketbooks to help build Palestine now when the gates of America are closed.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Horwich, the veteran of Zionism in Chicago, made an appeal to the young Zionists to work for Zion.</p>
   <p>Dr. S. M. Melamed read a message to the Keren Hayesod volunteers, who are the only ones who work for the future of the Jewish people. He appealed to the public to make Chicago the capital of Jewish philanthropy in America.</p>
   <p>Max Shulman, chairman of the Keren Hayesod, gave a report of the drive. Mr. Brown, the national chairman, then made a strong appeal, the like of which has never been heard in Chicago. The speech electrified his audience. Dozens of volunteers arose from their places and doubled their personal subscriptions and pledges. At least twenty-five thousand dollars was raised that way.</p>
