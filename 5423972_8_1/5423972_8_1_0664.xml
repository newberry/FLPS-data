   <p>Echoes come from all sides to us Jews, "The hour has come - be prepared."</p>
   <p>We speak here of the hour when Jewish people must openly proclaim to the world that Jews are a nation, want to be a nation, and demand their rights as such.</p>
   <p>The hour has come when the world demands it of the Jews. When Europe elevated herself above the feudalism of the Middle Ages, she recognized the principle of giving the Jews their freedom, much as America, by the same principle, did later with the Negroes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0665.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The political and social systems of the Middle Ages were based on the servitude of the individual.</p>
   <p>The church overpowered the king, who overpowered the knights, the knights their vassals, and they their serfs and so on down the ladder of society.</p>
   <p>Each class was enslaved by a higher class, the individual was figured as nil, the individual had no privileges except those bestowed upon him by his superior.</p>
   <p>Very often disputes took place between the church and king, king and knights, knights and vassals, but those were not disputes for freedom, but for the right to power.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0666.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Not until the 17th century did the idea of personal liberty become clear. Then came the philosopher, the encyclopedists, and prepared Europe for the great revolution, the great struggle of the individual against the principle of slavery.</p>
   <p>The French revolution recognized the principle of equality, meaning that one individual is as good as another. No one has a right to enslave another, all are equal, according to our law.</p>
   <p>What was Europe to do about the Jews? Once Europe recognized the individual irrespective of faith, it had to recognize the Jew as having equal rights in principle.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0667.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Truthfully speaking, the Jew has, in every country in the world, the true equal rights. In every country there are privileges for the majority of non-Jews that the Jews cannot have as long as they are Jews, but those are social privileges, not legal. European countries to recognize most recently this principle were Russia and Rumania.</p>
   <p>Gradually, along with the growing freedom of the individual grew also the principle of national freedom. If an individual is to be free, he must have the right to live in his own national group.</p>
   <p>With the present great world war, came the principle of national freedom. Jews must demand their rights as a national group. The principle of national freedom must liberate the Jewish nation. That is why we say: "The hour has come - be prepared."</p>
