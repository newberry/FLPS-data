   <p>30 organizations represented through their delegates, Mr. Rashkes and Zuckerman, spoke of relief-work for Russia.</p>
   <p>The special conference of the Peoples Relief Committee, for the tool campaign for Soviet Russia and Ukrania, which will soon start throughout the United States, and toward which Chicago will have to give the determined quota, was held yesterday-morning.</p>
   <p>The Conference consisted of over 40 delegates, representing various Jewish labor-organizations of Chicago. The Workmen's Circle was represented by 16 of its branches, and the rest of the delegates represented Jewish Unions, Socialist branches, central bodies, and relief organizations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1701.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Conference lasted from 11 A.M. until 6:30 P.M., and was addressed by the General Manager of the People's Relief, Mr. B.Zuckerman and M. Rashkis. The Conference spent a good deal of time on a discussion which arose as a result of a recommendation submitted by a committee of individuals who were not delegates to this Conference, and yet the recommendation was heard by the delegates and a satisfactory decision was reached.</p>
   <p>That Committee represented an organization that parted from the People's Relief a few months ago, and asked that certain conditions be worked out for this great tool campaign in accordance with their demands, and without which they would not join the Peoples Relief in the tool campaign. The recommendation was referred to the Resolutions Committee, who rejected it by a majority-vote. The minority, which consisted of three left-wing delegates of the Resolution Committee, brought the recommendation, which really amounted to an ultimatum up for discussion on the floor of the Conference, and it was rejected by a vote of 29 to 7.</p>

   <p>All the delegates came prepared to start the work of the tool campaign, and did not care to listen to anything that might disturb them in the action that the People's Relief would undertake for the relief of the Jewish labor-sufferers of Soviet Russia and Ukrainia. It was understood that in the interests of a successful campaign, the work must be carried on by one great united relief organization that would represent one great Jewish labor organization instead of two individual organizations.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the conference was Mr. A. Lurie, who is also chairman of the People's Relief Commission. The Resolutions Committee was composed of the following: Blumen, N. Miller, Dr. Golin, S.P. Kramer, Dr. Lorber, M. Fein, B.J. Shapiro, N. Shapiro, and A. Sashev.</p>
