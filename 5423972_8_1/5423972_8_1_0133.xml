   <p>The attack instigated by Irish bullies upon Jews Monday evening, in the vicinity of Taylor and Cypress Streets, is apparently more serious than it seemed to be at first. The seriousness of the attack is attributed to the fact that it was premeditated and that it was going to be launched was known in advance by peaceful Jewish residents and the police of the 13th Street Police Station. The attack is serious because the Jews, expecting it, had requested police protection and failed to get it.</p>
   <p>Three Jews lie at the hospital in a critical condition; fifteen are confined to their beds in their homes, and windows still remain shattered. And not one single policeman came to investigate until everything was over.</p>
   <p>The district around Taylor and Cypress Streets looked like the aftermath of a battle. It has been learned that the number of injured is much larger than what it was originally calculated to be. It is now known that besides the four <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0134.jpg" n="2"/>wounded whose names appeared yesterday in the Courier, the following are also seriously wounded:</p>
   <p>Dave Anext, 45, 2119 Kendall St.; Paul Stein, 2106 Kendall St.; Sam Shechter, 18, 2125 Kendall St.; Ruben Dubinsky, 19, 1024 Cypress St.; Charles Michaelson, 20, 933 Cypress St.; Solom Cohen, 40, 1010 Oakley Blvd.; Morris Ruzitsk, 38, 2102 Taylor St; and Hyman Bass, 36, 1933 Taylor St. Many others were also wounded, but disappeared and their names have not as yet been disclosed.</p>
   <p>If it is true that the police were aware of the premeditation of the attack upon Jews and refused to give protection, it is time for Jews to deliberate on what should be done about this matter.</p>
   <p>For this purpose a mass meeting will be held next Sunday which will inform our city authorities and our protectors of the public peace what law-abiding citizens think about this. The place and time of the mass meeting will be announced in the Jewish Courier on Friday and Sunday.</p>
