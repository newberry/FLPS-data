<title level="a">TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RAISED AT OPENING OF KEREN HAYESOD DRIVE IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The Chicago Zionists were tremendously enthusiastic last night when the drive for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] was opened in the Pompeian Room of Gold's Restaurant. The appeals yielded twenty thousand dollars in cash for the fund to rebuild Palestine. Samuel L. Antonov was the chairman of the evening. The first speaker was S. B. Komaiko, who pointed out that Palestine is no longer a dream but rather a reality, and that the closed doors in America [to immigration] should induce Jews to open wider the doors of their homeland.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Samuel Sale of St. Louis won the hearts of his audience with his impressive speech. Among other things, he said: "The Jewish spirit can only maintain its purity in a strong body, and that body can be developed in Palestine."</p>

   <p>The chairman of the Chicago Keren Hayesod drive, Max Shulman, then made an appeal for volunteers to aid in the noble work. The large assembly was surprised when Cantor Joseph Rosenblatt appeared with his wife, accompanied by his Chicago manager, J. Hyman. Cantor Rosenblatt did not sing. He contributed $200 for the Keren Hayesod drive. Dr. A. Abramowitz, director of the Keren Hayesod, delivered the closing address.</p>
