<title level="a">CHICAGO ZIONISTS WILL ESTABLISH A CHICAGO COLONY IN PALESTINE; TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ALREADY RAISED</title></bibl>
   </div>

   <p>The Red Room of the Hotel La Salle was crowded yesterday afternoon when the central committee of the Chicago Zionists opened the annual convention of the local Zionist districts, clubs, and schools. Leonard J. Grossman, president of the Chicago Zionist Committee opened the conference. He reported, in the shortest speech ever given by a president of a Jewish organization, on a year's Zionist activity in the second largest Jewish community in America. His report, though brief, was encouraging. He told the Zionists gathered there that the national sentiment has grown, both in numbers and in spirit. He was warmly applauded at the conclusion of his speech.</p>
   <p>Dr. [A. E.] Abramowitz, the director of the Chicago Zionist Bureau, gave a full report on the year's work in Chicago. He spoke of the difficult work accomplished by the Zionist workers during the past year. He related how those workers had sacrificed their homes, their businesses, and their personal <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1583.jpg" n="2"/>inclinations to visit and speak every day and every night to synagogues, lodges, and individuals. Their work was crowned with great success. The membership of the Chicago Zionists was tripled during the last drive. Chicago now has thirty-two well-organized Zionist districts, with a membership of thirty-three hundred, all of them in good standing in the organization.</p>
   <p>Fifteen thousand dollars in dues money alone was sent to the main office in New York. The Chicago Zionists, in addition, raised large sums of money for the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization], and the National Fund. They were also very active in the Palestine Development Company.</p>
   <p>One encouraging aspect of the conference was the fact that nearly all the speakers dwelt more upon the problems of Jewish education, Jewish culture, and history than upon the dry figures of income and expenditure.</p>
   <p>Dr. S. M. Melamed was the first speaker to mention the problem of our Jewish youth, which is being estranged from everything that is sacred and traditional <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1584.jpg" n="3"/>to the Jews. In a long speech, he discussed this tragic situation, more tragic, perhaps, than the Diaspora itself. He appealed to the youth and to the parents to bridge this abyss of separation. His appeal made a deep impression upon everyone.</p>
   <p>Max Shulman was the second speaker who touched upon this problem. In a warm Jewish speech, he made an appeal in behalf of a Jewish life and urged the study of Hebrew. Shulman also reported that the Chicago Zionists had given a check for one hundred thousand dollars to Dr. Weizmann. He said that ten thousand dollars has been set aside for the establishment of a Chicago Jewish colony in Palestine to be named "Chicago".</p>
   <p>Chicago Zionists also listened to speeches made by three interesting speakers who have recently come to us from across the seas and who have made Chicago their home, thus enriching the Chicago Jewish community by three intellectual and national leaders.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1585.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Dr. Neiman of Berlin [Germany], S. Soloveichik from Poltava [Russia], and Rabbi Marcus from Crimea [Russia]--all three spoke about the economic and political ruin of our brothers across the seas. All three told how those Jews work faithfully and devotedly for the eternal Jewish ideal, in spite of the terror of the Cheka, or of the German Fascists.</p>
   <p>The delegates and guests, at the end of the conference, pledged themselves to carry out the series of resolutions which the new executive committee will, from time to time, pass. The executive committee, on the other hand, agreed to carry out the following recommendations of the resolutions committee:</p>
   <p>To work for the Keren Hayesod and for the National Fund; to organize active Zionist work among the youth; to organize Zionist groups in the colleges, and to grant a scholarship to a college student of Chicago for the best treatise on Zionism.</p>
   <p>The conference also resolved to thank Leonard J. Grossman for his work. The <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1586.jpg" n="5"/>conference adopted resolutions of sorrow in regard to the premature deaths of Dr. Sultan and M. Goldman.</p>
   <p>A resolution was unanimously adopted that a committee of three prominent Chicago Jews be sent to become acquainted with the present political and economic conditions [existing there]. The committee is to report to the next conference of the Chicago Zionists.</p>
   <p>The following officials were unanimously elected at the conference: Dr. S. M. Melamed, chairman; Emil Braude, B. Brener, and I. A. Lazarus, vice-chairmen; Sam Ginsburg, treasurer; Daniel Heffner, recording secretary; Dr. A. E. Abramowitz, director, Leonard T. Grossman was elected chairman of the executive committee which will now consist of one hundred members, fifty from the Zionist districts and fifty elected by the conference.</p>
