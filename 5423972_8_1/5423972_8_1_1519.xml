   <p>Yesterday was the third day of the Festival that is taking place at the Hebrew Institute in honor of the Mid-Week of Succoth.</p>
   <p>It is to be regretted, that yesterday's visitors at Hebrew Institute, were very few in number, and as a result of this, the Institute took in very little money, contrary to previous expectations. The expenses, however, are enormous, and the Jews of Chicago should bear that in mind. A large sum of money was spent in order to arrange this Festival.</p>
   <p>The Festival will continue for only two more days. Every Jew in Chicago should do all within his power, to come to the Hebrew Institute and share some of the expenses. This money will be well spent. In so doing, one will have the pleasure of sharing in an Institution, which is the crowning glory of Chicago's Jewry, and in which Judaism and Americanism will be taught.</p>

   <p>Today's matinee is scheduled for Jewish women-old and young. They should all try to be there and make sure that this enterprise, which is 100% Jewish and is for the benefit of Jewish education; and should not be a failure. Miss Bertha Jerusalimsky and many other well known women will entertain the guests.</p>
