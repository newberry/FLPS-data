  <body>
   <p>Through the influence of Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, the wife and two children of Mr. S. Klein will be admitted to America.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. Klein, of 102 Hastings Street, is well known in Chicago's West Side. Being a newspaper vendor he has been a daily visitor in hundreds of Jewish homes for the last three years. He is a young boy who worked hard at his newspaper route and managed, by skimping, to save a few dollars in order to bring his father and sister from Russia. A year ago he sent tickets for his mother and his two younger brothers. When his mother and brothers, however, were ready to board the steamship, they were refused admittance on the ground that they had trachoma. For seven months they were detained in Germany. They tried very hard to reach their destination and finally succeeded in obtaining a steamship which brought them to Quebec, Canada. There they were detained for seven weeks by the American immigration officials, who declared them to be trachoma sufferers <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0909.jpg" n="2"/>and that it will be necessary to send them back.</p>
   <p>Mr. Klein and his father not being able to accomplish much themselves, decided to appeal to Congressman Adolph J. Sabath for assistance. The congressman, as is typical of him, had become interested in the lot of this unfortunate family. Upon investigation the congressman found that to send them back would mean a catastrophe. Mr. Sabath appealed to the Secretary of Commerce and Labor at Washington for admittance of the Klein family to Chicago.</p>
   <p>Although Congressman Sabath was very busy with his campaign, and had no time to spare for his private affairs, he had done all in his power and finally accomplished his goal by obtaining permission for this family to come to Chicago.</p>
   <p>The family was released on bonds, which was a clear indication that the <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0910.jpg" n="3"/>congressman was willing to take it upon himself to cure this family of the dreadful disease trachoma. The physicians in attendance were to be appointed by the National Government, for which services the congressman was to pay.</p>
   <p>Yesterday at 2 P. M. the family arrived in Chicago. An immigration commissioner awaited them. It was decided to take the youngest child to an eye and ear hospital, his mother and older child were permitted to go home.</p>
   <p>This was the first case since the passage of the immigration laws forbidding the entrance of trachoma victims into the United States. Congressman Sabath hopes that at the next session of Congress he will succeed in passing a law permitting all trachoma sufferers into the United States under bonds. He is convinced this will be a great accomplishment.</p>
