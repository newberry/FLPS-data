   <p>All Jews employed by the state, county, and city have been exempted from work for the Jewish holidays. The Jewish Courier approached the Governor, the Mayor, and the highest officials of the various departments with a request to exempt all the Jewish employees from their duties for Rosh Hashonu [Jewish New Year], and for Yom-kippur [Atonement Day].</p>
   <p>In the course of last week we mentioned the replies from the various officers, and yesterday we received answers from Governor Lowden and County recorder Joseph P. Haas.</p>
   <p>In the answer of Governor Lowden, it is said that the Governor has instructed all the highest officials of the various departments of the State to exempt all Jewish employees for the High Holidays.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1471.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. M. Shlensky, of Joliet, informs us that he and Mr. Wulfberg have been promised by Warden Murphy of the state penitentiary that the Jewish inmates will be permitted in a private room that will be transformed into a house of prayer, where they will conduct their Holiday services.</p>
   <p>The Warden will also permit the relatives and friends of all Jewish inmates to visit them during these Holidays.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. Kamaika will officiate and conduct the services for the Jewish inmates in Bridewell.</p>
