  <body>
   <p>Fifteen hundred delegates from various parts of the country have already registered for the convention of the Zionist Organization of America, which will be opened here on September 14, at the Auditorium Theater. Additional registrations are expected which will increase the number of delegates to two thousand.</p>
   <p>The administrative committee of the national organization has decided to arrange [some] special features for the convention. There will be no banquet; the convention will devote itself to practical routine work so as to arrange things in Palestine,which can almost be considered [at the present time], the Jewish homeland.</p>
   <p>Justice Louis D. Brandeis will undoubtedly attend this convention, and as far as Dr. Chaim Weizmann is concerned, the delegates still hope that he will be able to get here. Justice Brandeis, who recently returned from a trip to Palestine, Paris, and London, has important and exceedingly pleasant news to convey to the Chicago convention. This will be his first public appearance since his appointment to the <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1762.jpg" n="2"/>high rank of Associate Justice of the highest tribunal of America. It will be a privilege to hear Justice Brandeis speak. Have you already made arrangements to attend this convention?</p>
