  <body>
   <p>The Workmen's Circle possesses over forty branches in Chicago. This number is not so small, it should please every one whose ambition is to see our movement great and influential.</p>
   <p>When, however, we see that the number of Workmen's Circle members only reach 4,000, then we must admit that we have too many branches. And of what do the good qualities and faults of the small branches consist of? A large branch has a possibility of raising a sufficient amount to pay for a decent meeting place. A large branch, most of the time, possesses a larger number of intelligent members, and is thereby enabled to elect a better secretary and other necessary officials, whereas a small branch, with a poorer element, is compelled to meet in a small room, without air and other comforts, and is also compelled to elect a secretary with little experience and no ability.</p>
   <p>It very often happens in the existing small branches that of their thirty or forty members, only a few come to the election of officers, and not having enough members from which to choose, they are compelled to elect officers that have no idea of their task. They are compelled to take the office because <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0643.jpg" n="2"/>they cannot help themselves. The branch cannot exist without officers. This results, often times, in the books being kept without a system, and the treasury suffers without the person being aware that he is using the money.</p>
   <p>But you must consider the circumstances. The Workmen's Circle consists mainly of workers, and to our sorrow, workers cannot boast that one-hundred percent of their ranks possess an elementary education. Our intelligent elements are limited, which proves that the smaller branches must get along with the poor elements. No one is to be blamed, but the fault lies in that, instead of having our 4,000 members in ten branches and each branch having members with sufficient ability, we have forty branches of which many have not enough intelligent elements.</p>
   <p>The best plan would be to unite four or five branches - organize these branches according to the districts in which the members live, so that a few branches will be on the West Side, some in the Douglas Park and some on the Northwest Side. Such a system would save hundreds of dollars in rent and postage, every undertaking would be sure of a success, educational work would be possible; such branches could engage secretaries and other officials of ability.</p>
