   <p>The English classes held in the evening at the Hebrew Institute are becoming popular, especially since the closing of the public evening schools. Many students are now continuing their studies in the Institute. There are four evening classes a week, from Monday through Thursday, 7:30 to 9. Taking advantage of the opportunity presented by the Institute, many students have already taken out their first and second naturalization papers. There are, however, many Jews in Chicago who do not intend to become citizens. This attitude indicates disrespect for the country which has welcomed them, and does not help the Jew rid himself of the stigma of "greenhorn." These people can correct this attitude at the Institute, where in friendly consultation, they will receive all the information necessary to obtain citizenship.</p>
   <p>The Institute has opened a millinery and dressmaking class for young women. Every woman should know something about style in clothes. There are many more activities in the Institute; all are of value to the progressive-minded individual.</p>

   <p>And every individual can be useful to society according to his ability and training.</p>
