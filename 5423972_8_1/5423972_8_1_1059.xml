   <p>Chicago will be asked, within the next few weeks, to aid in bringing health and sanitation in Palestine when the local Hadassah Chapter launches a campaign to secure this city's share of a $450,000 fund that is being raised throughout the community to support the work of the Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization. The campaign will be conducted by a committee of local women who have hitherto been busy making garments for orphans and needy babies of the Holy Land. Mrs. Bertha Read, of 1512 Hood Avenue, is chairman of the campaign, assisted by the District Chairmen, Mrs. William Ramsey, Miss Lillian Franklin, and Mrs. Leon Sager.</p>
   <p>Hadassah was organized just before the war, with 193 members who raised sufficient funds to send two nurses to Palestine to give prenatal and maternity care to the women of Palestine, and to combat trachoma, a disease whose spread and neglect <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1060.jpg" n="2"/>was causing blindness among the school children of Palestine. The work of these two nurses grew to vastly large proportions, when in 1918 the Hadassah supported the American Zionist Medical Unit of 43 physicians, nurses and sanitarians sent to Palestine as a war emergency service. The war ended, the Unit became the Hadassah Medical Organization, employing over 400 doctors, nurses, pupil nurses, sanitarians, dentists and druggists, who work in five hospitals, many clinics, field hospitals for immigrants and workmen, medical circuits in the Jewish colonies and schools and two infant welfare stations. In addition a Nurses Training School is maintained in Jerusalem, giving a three year course in modern methods of nursing. Hadassah nurses and doctors inspect and treat ten thousand children in many parts of Palestine for trachoma and skin diseases and cares for mothers in and before childbirth. This work is entirely non-sectarian (sic) in its scope, and is supported principally by American Jews.</p>
   <p>Hadassah sewing circles in this city and in other parts of the United States have sent to Palestine in the past year linens, blankets, clothing, layettes and other necessities to the value of $67,000.
