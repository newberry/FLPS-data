   <p>Dr. Weitzman was greeted by 300 people at the depot. From there he was taken to the Congress Hotel, where a crowd of 150 gathered in the Elizabeth room for a luncheon. The principle speakers were Bishop Folos, Mr. Kanes of the Sanitary Board, and Dr. Weitzman.</p>
   <p>Interview with Dr. Weitzman</p>
   <p>A representative of the "Forward" interviewed Dr. Weitzman at the Congress Hotel. The "Forward" representative asked Dr. Weitzman two questions:</p>
   <p>First: How far did he succeed in carrying on the Keren Hayesod fund, without the aid of the Zionists leaders, Brandeis and Mack?</p>
   <p>Second: What, does he think, caused the pogroms upon the Jews in Palestine?</p>
   <p>In relation to the first question, Dr. Weitzman replied that the work is just, practically, begun and we don't know how far we will succeed in our plans of raising $100,000,000 dollars, in the next five years, for the building of Palestine. Seventy per cent of this sum must be contributed from United States and Canada.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1725.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Relative to the riots in Palestine, Dr. Weitzman would rather not have them called pogroms, by declairing that:</p>
   <p>The assembly of the League will soon convene. This assembly must recognize the mandate, which England received concerning Palestine, from the highest Council of the League. (The League consists of two bodies, the Assembly, which holds sessions very seldom, and the Council, which, practically, does all the work. The entire work of the igh Council must pass the Assembly).</p>
   <p>The Arabs have, now, started a riot in order to influence the Assembly of the League of Nations to recognize the British mandate for Palestine.</p>
