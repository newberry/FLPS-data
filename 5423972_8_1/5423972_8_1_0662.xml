   <p>The Jewish radical colony at 40th avenue and 60th street, is a new factor in the Jewish life of Chicago. In former years, the Jewish radicals planned to realize all their future ideals in the colony. Several of these Communist colonies were unable to exist on account of unsuitable elements turning to the tillage of the soil.</p>
   <p>The Jewish radical colony of Chicago is distinguished by its sense of genuineness. It is free from the fantasy of its leaders and is entirely established upon the tried mutual interests of its members. It is constructed on a cooperative basis, although each member has the full right of individuality. The colony has thirty members with room for ten more families. Every member who paid $260, received two lots. The streets were restricted, by the City Hall as private, so that the colony would be located in a world by itself.</p>
   <p>The cooperative investment amounts to $18,000. The members have paid, on that principle sum $8,000 and upon making further payment, the colony shall build stores, which shall be under cooperative management. The construction <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0663.jpg" n="2"/>of houses was stopped due to the war and at present it is only inhabited by three families. However all necessary preparations are being made to advance the work.</p>
   <p>The cooperative colony shall succeed in carrying through its plans and become a model district for the Jewish working class of Chicago.</p>
