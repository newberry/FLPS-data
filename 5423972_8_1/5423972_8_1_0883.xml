   <p>Whether you are a Zionist or not, so long as you are a Jew, you are without doubt wholeheartedly interested in reviving the life of the Jewish nation....</p>
   <p>The Jewish Colonial Bank is the only Jewish national bank in the world. It is a bank which belongs to the Jewish nation, a bank of which it can be truly said that it is of Jews, for Jews, and by Jews.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Colonial Bank is the pride of the nation and every cent that the bank earns goes for the upbuilding of the Jewish nation, and its Holy Land. It is no wonder that every Jew in Chicago is more than happy to hear the news of the opening of this bank. The most popular bank in Chicago, the Ashland and 12th Street Bank, accepted the exclusive representation of the Jewish Colonial Bank.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0884.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This agency sends money to all foreign countries through the Colonial Bank and acts as its agent in anything which is of interest to the new bank branch and its stockholders. The bank also collects the dividends on the shares of the stockholders and accepts deposits for the Jewish Colonial Bank etc.</p>
   <p>Every Jewish person, man or woman, in whose heart beats a national sentiment, should feel duty-bound, when a sum of money is to be sent to foreign countries, Russia, Galicia, and especially to England and Palestine, to send it through the branch of the Jewish Colonial Bank.</p>
   <p>It deserves to be patronized for all profits derived from any business transactions of this kind goes to stockholders of the Colonial Bank. The Ashland and 12th Street State Bank deserves the patronage.</p>
