   <p>With mixed emotions, Jews will sit down at their Passover tables tomorrow evening. There will be no feeling of joy, but rather one of sadness and despair in the holiday spirit of Passover--the holiday commemorating our liberation. Many Jews, and they are probably in the majority, will celebrate this Passover as they have for the past eight years, under conditions which are even worse than those described in the Jewish history of Exodus. The Jews in the Diaspora have seldom celebrated Passover under favorable conditions, but rarely have they observed the Passover services under such unhappy conditions as they will this year, or [for that matter, as they have] the past few years. For the first time in our glorious history, the majority of the Jewish people find themselves in a condition such as the bitterest anti-Semites might well desire for them. Of the nine million Jews who live in Central and Eastern Europe, the majority are in great economic and political distress, and this is at a time when the <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1460.jpg" n="2"/>doors of Palestine are open to all Jews, and also at a time when a great national catastrophe has paralyzed our forces of liberation. No other nation has lived to see such a tragic fate. If it were not for this dreadful catastrophe, we would not need any Zionist delegations in America, nor any Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] campaigns, nor the clamoring and commotion that accompanies every movement of our national leaders. The Jewish merchants of Moscow and Petrograd alone would have raised the entire sum necessary to rebuild Palestine, but now that the majority of our people are in a condition which is horrible beyond description, the work of liberation is carried on slowly, and the slower the work, the weaker becomes the life force of the Eastern and Central European Jews.</p>
   <p>This condition [the suffering of Eastern and Central European Jews] arouses sadness among all the thinking circles of our people, a sadness which cannot be alleviated by the holiday spirit of Passover. We are commemorating the first emancipation of our people [from bondage in Egypt], but the situation of the Jews in this period of final liberation is so bitter that we must project <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1461.jpg" n="3"/>ourselves either into the future or the past, in order to enter into the true spirit of this holiday [Passover].</p>
   <p>Our only hope of celebrating Passover in the future under more favorable conditions lies in rebuilding Palestine as quickly as possible. When Palestine is built, all the Jews will derive real pleasure from Passover.</p>
