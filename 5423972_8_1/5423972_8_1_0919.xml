  <p>Ramah Lodge of B'nai B'rith recently installed a large group of members in celebration of the nineteenth anniversary of the existence of the order. Ramah Lodge is the largest single group in the country, numbering over two thousand members, among whom area large number of men promninent in the community. It seems strange that the B'nai B'rith in Chicago cannot increase its membership to the number it deserves. After all, B'nai B'rith has a constructive program and does some splendid work. It seems, however, that very few members, who are induced to join any of the Chicago B'nai B'rith Lodges, remain. Upon investigation we find that they find the dues, which are $12.00 a year, entirely too high. If the B'nai B'rith lodges, especially in Chicago, could
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0919.jpg" n="2"/> reduce the dues to, say, half they would have no trouble in doubling or tripling their membership, thereby making it a vital force in the community. The dues of Masonic organizations are only $6.00 per year. Why shouldn't the B'nai B'rith have the same? It is a matter well worth looking into.</p>
