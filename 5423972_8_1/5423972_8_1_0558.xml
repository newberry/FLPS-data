   <p>This evening is a "community evening" in Chicago. The leaders of the Orthodox Jewish community--its rabbis, businessmen, philanthropists, heads of institutions--will gather at the Grenshaw Street Talmud Torah to consider some very important problems which face the Jews of Chicago at the present time.</p>
   <p>The intelligent Orthodox Jews of Chicago realize that the present situation cannot continue. Something must be done to create order in our community life. All branches of community activity should be reorganized and coordinated. The representatives of Chicago Jewry face a great task this evening. Will they be able to come to an agreement upon the important problems which must be considered? Will they be able to arouse the organizational energy which is needed for this gigantic task?</p>
   <p>The most important problem to be considered is the one concerning the Hebrew <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0559.jpg" n="2"/>Theological College. The future of Jewish education in Chicago and the fate of Jewish cultural life in Chicago, depend upon that institution. The Hebrew Theological College can become a great spiritual and cultural center in Chicago. If the leaders of the city realized that not only is the existence of a local, petty seminary at stake here, but also the education of future Jewish generations, they would certainly try harder to have the building of the Hebrew Theological College completed, so that it could open its doors within a short time. However, if the leaders of the city do not understand what is at stake here--then the work and struggle of a few workers, who have given all their time and energy to this institution, have been in vain.</p>
