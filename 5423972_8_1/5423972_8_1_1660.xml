   <p>Representatives of Labor Organizations Approve Report on Peoples Relief Convention.</p>
   <p>The representatives of the Jewish labor organizations, who have appointed delegates two months ago, to the Peoples Relief convention in Philadelphia, assembled in the Labor Lyceum, Sunday morning to listen to a report by their appointed delegates. The report was a joyous one from these viewpoints: The Peoples Relief has recently regained strength; all labor organization of the country were represented at the convention; the Peoples relief distributed $300,000 last year, for cultural purposes; collected clothes amounting to two million dollars; influenced the Joint Board to participate in constructive work.</p>
   <p>The Chicago delegation was instructed to fight for independent work done in Europe by the Peoples Relief, even if it should mean breaking from the Joint Board, and this demand, though the Chicago delegates stood for it, <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1661.jpg" n="2"/>was not granted by the other delegates, although several proposals were adopted concerning independent work in America and in Europe.</p>
   <p>The official reporter was Comrade Miller. Other delegates spoke preceding a general discussion. In conclusion, the report was unanimously adopted. The conference had at the same time, adopted a resolution, which will be published in the Forward tomorrow. It will declare that the convention's transactions concerning the Joint Board is not entirely satisfactory. It is however, a step forward - and is considered and accepted as such.</p>
   <p>Friend Ehrenreich, manager of the tool campaign, then demanded to continue the work of completing the campaign and all those present promised to cooperate in the work. The assembly, also, promised that they would urge their organizations to appoint workers for the campaign.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the conference was A. L. Lurie, the permanent president of the Peoples Relief. L. Benenson was appointed as secretary.</p>
