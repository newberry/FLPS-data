<title level="a">AN ENTHUSIASTIC CONVENTION OF CHICAGO ZIONISTS REORGANIZES THE WORK HERE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The annual convention of the Chicago Zionists, held yesterday at the Hebrew Institute, was a success from every point of view. All the active Zionist forces in Chicago participated in it. It reorganized the Zionist work in Chicago in such a way that Zionism is bound to grow in Chicago if the newly elected officials take their work seriously. The convention systematized and co-ordinated the organization's many-sided activities, such as organization, membership, propaganda, National Fund, and Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization].</p>
   <p>The first session of the convention opened at ten o'clock yesterday morning, Dr. K. Rosenzweig acting as chairman. The entire session was devoted to the election of various committees, such as finance, resolutions, nominations, and others. Speeches dealing with the tasks of the convention were delivered by Dr. Abramowitz, Rabbi Aaron Cohen, H. Steinberg, and Dr. S. M. Melamed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1667.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The second session, the most important one, opened at two o'clock in the afternoon. Reports on the activities of various groups were heard at this session; resolutions on the further activity of the Zionists in Chicago were worked out, and a new administration was elected.</p>
   <p>Dr. Warsho, chairman of the Chicago office of the National Fund, was the first one to report. The National Fund has received, during the last six months, the sum of seven thousand five hundred twenty-six dollars and forty-nine cents--deducting all expenses--from flag days, boxes, and flower days.</p>
   <p>Miss Broide reported on the work of the South Side Zionist district.</p>
   <p>Miss Pearl Franklin, president of the Chicago Hadassah [women's group in Zionist organization], made a brilliant report. Chicago Hadassah has organized, during the last year, three new branches and now has about four hundred and thirty members. The Hadassah has raised seven thousand four hundred fifty dollars exclusive of the fourteen hundred dollars membership dues, which the Hadassah has <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1668.jpg" n="3"/>remitted to New York. Hadassah has also sent to Palestine various medical supplies, valued at eight hundred dollars. The various expenses amounted to only two hundred and thirty dollars.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. R. Cohen, chairman of the resolutions committee, read various resolutions proposed by the committee to the convention. Among the many resolutions was one proposing that a telegram of greetings be sent to the Zionist annual conference at Carlsbad. The other resolutions were to thank all Chicago rabbis and synagogue presidents for helping in the Zionist work, to thank the Daily Jewish Courier for its support, to appeal on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur in all synagogues on behalf of the Keren Hayesod, to establish peace within American Zionism, according to the resolution of the last convention in Philadelphia, to thank the present Chicago Zionist administration for its good work, to grant membership in the central committee to all Zionist clubs, groups, and societies, and other resolutions.</p>
   <p>Mr. B. L. Sloan, chairman of the nominations committee, then read his list of <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1669.jpg" n="4"/>nominees. Nominations were made by the convention and the following were elected officers: Leonard Grossman, president; Rabbi Leon Fram, S. B. Komaiko, and Mrs. Benjamin Davis, vice-presidents; Maxim Hirsch, financial secretary; Max Konheim, executive secretary; M. Ben-Ami, treasurer; H. Steinberg, chairman of membership committee; Rabbi Aaron Cohen, chairman of ways and means committee; Dr. S. M. Melamed, chairman of publicity committee; Fred Lubin, chairman of Keren Hayesod committee; W. Weinstein, chairman of National Fund Committee.</p>
   <p>The newly elected officers were installed at once in their [respective] offices by B. Antonow.</p>
   <p>The convention closed, amidst great enthusiasm, to the strains of Hatikvah [Jewish national anthem].</p>
   <p>The speakers made a deep impression upon the audience. The propaganda for the rebuilding of Palestine has gained a great deal thereby.</p>
