   <p>In reply to the request of the Daily Jewish Courier, that the Mayor of Chicago should do something to help Jewish inmates at Bridewell, for the Passover holidays, so that they should not be forced to eat Hametz (food not permitted to be eaten on Passover), or if necessary to let them go home for the holidays, the may sent the following reply:</p>
   <p>To the Daily Jewish Courier:</p>
   <p>The mayor received your letter, of the first of this month, and he authorized me to confer about the matter with Mr. Whiteman, superintendent of Bridewell. Mr. Whiteman informed me that there are about fifty to sixty Jewish inmates at Bridewell. In cases wherever possible, he would recommend them for a pardon. To others, Mr. Whiteman would allow Jewish charitable organizations to supply them with matzos. Mr. Whiteman would gladly buy the matzos in any place you would recommend to him, if the price is reasonable enough.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt, therefore, that Mr. Whiteman would carry out your wish. He would gladly do anything to help them, but he cannot allow the serving <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0143.jpg" n="2"/>of wine to prisoners, because that would be against the rules and regulations of Bridewell. However, if you would not be able to come to an agreement with the authorities of Bridewell about the matter, the mayor would gladly appoint me or somebody else of his assistants, to talk the matter over with you.</p>
   <p>Very truly yours,</p>
   <p>W. L. Binn, Ass't. Sec'y. to the Mayor.</p>
