   <p>We are certain that many people believe the "Poale Zion," that played such an important role in the Jewish life, is no longer here in Chicago. We wish therefore to extend the greetings of the Worker Zionists that are even now existing here. A visit at their last meeting, Saturday evening, not only proved their existence but also their enthusiasm and activity.</p>
   <p>To the "Poale Zion" belongs the undeniable credit for bringing nationalism to the Jews of America. They are the ones who year after year with their written and oral agitation and instructions have awakened in the Jewish worker the desire for freedom not only of his economic diaspora but also of his Jewish life diaspora. Their work in many instances has been successful.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1301.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is true, that there remains a few undesirable intelligents who long ago fell from their heights and who will from time to time attack the Poale Zion, but, their attacks are so clumsy, and so without tact or fact that the masses pay little attention to them and many do not even deign to notice them.</p>
   <p>As previously stated the principles of the Zionists are high ones. Their work is a necessity among the Jewish working masses, and yet during these last years the Poale Zion has been quiet and inactive. What is the reason for this? Of course we shall not attempt to answer this although there must be some very important reasons for it.</p>
   <p>And now the Poale Zion is coming to life again. The organization arranged a series of lectures with some of the best lecturers for Friday evenings <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1302.jpg" n="3"/>at the John Smythe School. They, together with the National Workers Verband branches are the founders and supporters of the Daily National Radical School in the John Smythe School. They are working to produce again the Jewish Kempfer (Fighter), a weekly paper that brought forth such acclaim during its former existence. Therefore we may expect again to hear much of the Poale Zion, and they shall again carry on their worthy work among the Jewish working masses.</p>
