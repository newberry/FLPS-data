   <p>The desire of Chicago Jews, in recent times, to reorganize community institutions and adapt them to the changing conditions of our times, shows clearly the development of Chicago Jewry. Jewish community leaders are now beginning to realize that they must meet the needs of the people.</p>
   <p>Our institutions are not folk institutions in the true sense of the word. Although they were founded, and are supported, by the people, they are not administered in accordance with the will of the people. Those who are acquainted with the administrative setup of our institutions know full well that it is possible to foretell for years to come the men who will be elected to the various offices. These men have created the impression that the institutions could not exist without them.</p>
   <p>Chicago has been fortunate in having earnest and well-meaning men at the head of her Jewish institutions. Yet, when vital decisions must be made requiring the experience and training of an educator or administrator, the weaknesses <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0790.jpg" n="2"/>inherent in this one-man system become apparent. The man has done his best, but his best was not good enough.</p>
   <p>This system is detrimental to the progress and administration of our institutions. They increase in size but not in quality. Chicago Jewry grows richer, larger, and more modern day by day, but its institutions do not progress.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the movement to reorganize our community institutions means, for us, the coming of a new day. A beginning was made with the reorganization of the Hebrew Institute and the Talmud Torah. We hope the reorganization movement will not stop with these two efforts. It is necessary for us to reorganize all of our community institutions. Such a step would be greatly welcomed.</p>
