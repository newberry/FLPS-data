   <p>As long as we live in the Diaspora, we are fated to lead a life of "drives". We keep having "drives" not because we like them, but because we must. If we were to stop having "drives," the great Jewish factory would stand still, and the Jewish people cannot continue to exist if they stand still.</p>
   <p>In December and January we had a relief drive, in March and April a Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization] drive, and now in May we are going to have a Zionist membership drive. During these drives we almost forgot that we have a Zionist organization which we have to maintain. We almost forgot that without the Zionist organization, we cannot have the Keren Hayesod or Palestine. We have neglected the Zionist organization shamefully.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1075.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>I do not say that somebody is to blame for this situation. The truth is that we have been very busy with the drives, but now that the drives have come to an end, we must take up our own drive--in behalf of the Zionist organization.</p>
   <p>What is the aim of this drive? The aim is to enroll two thousand members in Chicago during May. What are you willing to do to help in this great undertaking?</p>
