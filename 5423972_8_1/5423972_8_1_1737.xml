   <p>Seventy representatives of 33 organizations - 22 Workmen's Circles, 3 Unions, 4 Socialist Alliances, 3 Poale Zion, and the People's Relief Executive, assembled yesterday at the Conference of the People's Relief Committee. They determined to continue the People's Relief activities and appointed three delegates to represent Chicago at the People's Relief Conference in Boston.</p>
   <p>A.I. Lurie, Chairman of the People's Relief, was appointed chairman of the Conference and H.I. Cohen, of Workmen's Circle Branch, 540, Secretary.</p>
   <p>On the Credential Committee were appointed: Sam. Finkelstein, Silverstein, M. Levin, H. Borah, and Chusoff. The following were appointed on the Resolutions Committee: Ben. Dolwick, Ireland, H. Miller, F. Alschul, Joseph Burman, Joe Snyder, and Fager.</p>
   <p>H. Silver, Director, gave a short review of the work that the People's Relief in Chicago carried through since the last conference. He paused, especially, on the Tag Day, which proved that the People's Relief has gained the sympathy of the masses,who warmly responded to the call for aid.</p>
   <p>Nathan Miller, on behalf of the executive, discussed the matter of prolonging the existence and work of the People's Relief and made reference to the 65 poor children who attend the schools which are supported by the People's Relief.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1738.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A lengthy discussion ensued as to whether to liquidate the People's Relief or to prolong it. Several delegates maintained that it was no longer possible to carry on the tremendous work that was required, and advocated liquidation. A second standpoint, which was well defended by Dr. R.Galinan, was that the relief work should continue but under a different name, and operate with different organizational methods. The People's Relief, according to this standpoint, must become the American Division of the "Ort."</p>
   <p>A majority of delegates, however, adopted the standpoint which was defended by the executive members and which was expressed in several resolutions adopted by the conference.</p>
   <p>The first resolution declares that the relief work must continue and that the main objective of the People's Relief must be supported by cultural institutions. It demands that all labor-organizations of Chicago shall influence their national bodies to obligate themselves to contribute financial support to the People's Relief.</p>
   <p>The second resolution demands that the name, "People's Relief" shall remain, as it has in the past eight years, the name of the United Relief Order of the Jewish workers.</p>
   <p>The conference expressed sympathy with the work of the "Ort", in order to avoid any friction in its work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1739.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>After the liquidation of the Joint, the People's Relief must directly support the cultural institutions in Russia.</p>
   <p>The following resolutions were also adopted: That the People's Relief shall see that the Joint should not instigate the labor organizations; that the money collected by the People's Relief shall be divided among the workers through the labor-organizations direct; that the People's Relief Administration must pay more attention to publicity and information. Almost all resolutions were adopted unanimously.</p>
   <p>The following delegates were appointed to the convention in Boston: A.I. Lurie, Leon Hanak, and Frank Alschul.</p>
