   <p>The American Jewish Reform Movement is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary this week in New York. The celebration takes the form of an annual convention of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. The program is elaborate. The leading Rabbis of the Cincinnati school are expected to attend. Prominent laymen are to deliver addresses. There are to be social functions. But there is one subject which we expected to see discussed at this convention which does not appear on the program.</p>
   <p>What progress has the reform movement made? Is it moving forward or is it retrogressing? Is it as virile now as it was fifty years ago? What are its prospects?</p>
   <p>The old school of Rabbis, the pioneers of the reform movement, who formulated <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1645.jpg" n="2"/>its principles and established its forms, are gradually being gathered to their fathers. The younger Rabbis, bred in an American atmosphere, are taking their places. A generation has passed into history. It would be in order to have an impartial objective review of what has been achieved by this effort to adjust Judaism to American conditions, or, to put it differently, to give expression to a new religious movement in Jewish life.</p>
   <p>The statement is made that the Union of American Hebrew Congregations represents fifty thousand Jewish families. That is, presumably, the total membership of all reform congregations in this country. Of these fifty thousand families, forty seven per cent may be attributed to the newer immigrants who arrived after 1881. There were in 1881 in the United States, according to the estimate of the late William B. Hackenberg, about two hundred and fifty thousand Jews, of whom not less than eighty per cent were of the earlier settlers, those who came from Germany and were the pioneers of the reform idea. It may be estimated that in 1881 there were <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1646.jpg" n="3"/>about forty thousand Jewish families affiliated with reform congregations. Today there are not less than three and a half million Jews in America, or about seven hundred thousand families. If in 1881 there were about forty thousand Jewish families and in 1922 there are fifty thousand minus twenty thousand, or thirty thousand of the old Jewish families affiliated with reform congregations, it is pertinent to ask the question, Are reform Jews satisfied with the progress made?</p>
   <p>In 1881 leadership in Jewish affairs, religious, philanthropic and social, was in the hands of the first settlers. There were the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the Independent Order Bnai Brith, the Hebrew Union College, hospitals, orphan asylums, etc. Today that leadership is surrounded and overshadowed by activity in Jewish affairs dominated by elements that have come in since 1881, and strongly in religious matters. There is the thriving Jewish Theological Seminary, innumerable conservative congregations, Jewish fraternal and social organizations of all sorts and varieties. Far from affecting the Jewish life of the new-comers to the United States, the reform <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1647.jpg" n="4"/>Jewish movement has actually been very largely shaped by the influences radiating from the orthodox or conservative elements in the United States that have come in since 1881. The ideals represented by the reform movement, born out of political conditions that arose in Germany, have not made much of an impression upon American Jews, as witness the tremendous growth of the sentiment in favor of Zionism and the wide-spread interest in Palestine. What was so glibly spoken of years ago, of Washington being our Jerusalem and America our Zion, is now being spoken of in historic retrospection.</p>
   <p>It is evident that the reform movement which has in it certain features that would appeal to large number of Jews, has not, in the first place, managed to hold even the descendants of the pioneers of the movement. The reform movement has been to a certain extent the outpost on the way to assimilation, its disciples wandering off in alien directions, into the Unitarian Church, into Christian Science, into Ethical Culture, into the various manifestations of eclectic religion. Nor has this movement been <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1648.jpg" n="5"/>able to make any impression upon the new-comers. Orthodoxy and conservatism stand strong; they labor manfully with the natural incongruity that attaches to the difficulties of harmonizing a strong Jewish life with disintegrating American influences. The reform movement has suffered a great deal because of the intrusion into it of matters that have no relation to religious ideals or principles.</p>
   <p>The rejection of those features of Jewish national life that had become integrated into the religious life made it difficult for reform to affect the lives of those who persisted in asserting those features of Jewish life that they regarded as essential for the existence of the race or nationality. From the beginning, a movement for liberalizing religion, it went out of its way to give expression to certain temporary or transitory political conclusions. These ideas have become dogmas. They now stand in the way of the progress of the reform movement. If it is to have any influence upon Jewish life, it must concentrate its attention upon those problems which are in reality religious, and seek a way to conserve its religious principles. At <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1649.jpg" n="6"/>any rate, it would serve a good purpose and enable us to understand the reform movement better if a discussion took place at the convention which would elucidate the situation in which it now finds itself.
