<title level="a">CHICAGO'S DELEGATION TO PROTEST AGAINST THE IMMIGRATION BILL EN ROUTE TO WASHINGTON</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Aldermen Jacob M. Arvey, Petlak, Lyle, Guernsey, and Frankhauser, members of the committee appointed by the City Council of Chicago to protest against the pending anti-immigration bill, are leaving this afternoon for Washington. They carry with them resolutions passed by the City Council of Chicago and by the Cook County Board, of which Anton J. Cermak is president. They will submit these resolutions tomorrow to the immigrations committee, before whom they are scheduled to appear.</p>
   <p>Congressman A. J. Sabath, who is now in Washington, is making the preparations for the City Council committee to receive proper recognition and to have access to the Senate committee. Yesterday, Congressman Sabath telegraphed Alderman Arvey that the House has concluded its hearings, but that the Senate hearings will take place on Friday (today) and Saturday (tomorrow). Mr. Sabath also says that the Senate will, very likely, pass a bill entirely different <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0835.jpg" n="2"/>from the one passed by the House. This will permit the House to reopen hearings. "Just the same," concludes Mr. Sabath, in his telegram, "I will attempt to arrange a hearing before the Senate committee on Saturday. I am expecting you."</p>
   <p>The resolution passed by the Cook County Board reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Senate now has before it the Johnson Immigration Bill, which,if adopted, will close the gates of America to a large part of the best elements among the foreigners, who can become good citizens; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The above-mentioned bill is un-American, unfair, and discriminates between one nationality and another, and is based upon the quota of the 1890 census; instead of the 1920 census, which reduces the quota from three to two per cent, and when adopted, will lead to the separation of many families--some members of the family being in America and some across the seas; and <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0836.jpg" n="3"/>"Whereas, City councils from most of the big cities in the United States have adopted resolutions condemning the aforementioned bill; be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we, the board of Cook County Commissioners lift our voices in protest against the passage of this bill. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That a copy of this resolution shall be given to the President of the United States, and to the Senators and Congressmen from the state of Illinois."</p>
