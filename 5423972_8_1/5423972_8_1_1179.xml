   <p>Chicago Zionists have finally felt the great responsibility which has been thrust upon them because the next convention of American Zionists is to be held here. Already we can see a great increase in the activities of the various districts. We hope that their efforts will be crowned with success.</p>
   <p>That Chicago Zionists would begin their campaign by holding open-air meetings would have been considered fantastic yesterday; yet the meetings took place. The Lawndale District was the first to conduct an open-air gathering. The results were remarkable: several dozen new members were secured. Following this example the West Side District will also conduct similar open-air meetings.</p>
   <p>The Northwest Side District has another plan by which it hopes to activate its registered members. The District will hold daily meetings limited to a small number of members and attempt to impress upon these individuals the vital <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1180.jpg" n="2"/>necessity of working for Zionist ideals. In the South Side District, where Jews live far apart, other methods of reaching the public will be employed.</p>
   <p>Moreover, plans are in progress to make the Herzl Memorial Day program on Sunday, June 20, a great occasion in Chicago. Excellent speakers will participate at the various meetings; and pictures of Herzl, showing various events in his life, will be shown in all parts of the city. Principals of all Talmud Torahs, who are devoted to Zionism, will aid in the preparations. Lodges and vereins are responding heartily to the appeals which are being made among them and are joining the Zionist ranks. Furthermore, synagogue officials will be given an opportunity to participate in Zionist work since plans are being made to invite them to a special conference dedicated to Zionism.</p>
   <p>Elections were held recently [in the various Zionist districts]. Those elected were: in the lawndale District, Mr. Meyer Abrams, District chairman and Dr. N. K. Rosenzweig, Campaign chairman; in the North Side District, Mr. H. Steinberg, <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1181.jpg" n="3"/>District chairman and Mr. L. H. Lichterman, campaign chairman; in the West Side District, Mr. H. L. Meites, District chairman and Mr. F. Berman, campaign chairman; and in the South Side District, Mr. H. Phillips, District chairman and Mr. S. V. Adelman, campaign chairman. Mr. Abraham Goldstein of New York completed his tour through Ohio and arrived in Chicago to aid in the great task. He is an ardent Zionist and a talented orator.</p>
