   <p>Today is Flag Day. Today all our homes should be decorated with the American flag, the Red, White, and Blue, the emblem of freedom and democracy. Mayor Thompson has issued a proclamation which declares that today is Flag Day and requests that the traditions of the country be observed in an appropriate manner, and that all public buildings, places of business, and private homes be decorated with American flags.</p>
   <p>The proclamation reads as follows: "Whereas Friday, June 14, 1918, is the one hundred and forty-first anniversary of the adoption of the Stars and Stripes as the national emblem of these United States; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, This anniversary is one that should be particularly observed at this time; and</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1406.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Whereas, Our flag proclaims to the whole world the recognized truths that all men are equal before the law; that this is a government of the people, by the people, and for the people; that all men are endowed with the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that our government which makes the laws has the approval of those governed, and that these rights were established through the blood and sacrifice of our ancestors and shall be upheld by the blood and sacrifice of our soldiers and sailors who are now in the war:</p>
   <p>"Therefore, I, William Hale Thompson, Mayor of the City of Chicago, herewith proclaim Friday, June 14, as Flag Day, and I herewith request that the traditional observance of this occasion be shown by the raising of the American flag on all public buildings, places of business, and private homes of the nation, and that other public demonstrations appropriate to this day be held."</p>
