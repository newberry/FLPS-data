   <p>No matter what the outcome of the case may be, it stands as a warning to parents to watch their children, to safeguard them against themselves, to understand and profit from the distinction between mental and moral upbuilding. Social adaptation, living adjustly, usefully and happily within the group, depends not only upon one's intellectual outlook on life, but in a greater degree upon one's moral outlook, and so far in the life of human-kind this element has been best assured through religious and quasi-religious influences.</p>
   <p>For the most of us, a tolerable environment and the pressing duties of everyday life will suffice to keep us going straight. For the exceptional individual, super-normal, abnormal, or sub-normal, exceptional measures are called for. But every person at some period in his youth passes through a difficult time, when he is not, strictly speaking, rational.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0096.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And the parents of the least extraordinary of children will do well to watch for this critical time, to provide against it, to build up self-respect and respect of others, and, above all, not leave the youngster too much to his own devices.</p>
   <p>Parents generally do not appreciate the difference between character and accomplishment.</p>
