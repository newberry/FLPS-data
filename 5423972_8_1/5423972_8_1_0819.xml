  <body>
   <p>Rabbi Hirsch took up the intermarriage question as a distinctive topic and laid down a general proposition, which was that if the Jews did not intermarry it was the fault of our social fabric. The Jews had been friends of our public school system, which attempt to break down the social barriers, and had even given up their parochial schools, but the facts were that as soon as the children left the public school, the social barrier was reared again.</p>
   <p>Without social intercourse, intermarrying was out of the question and the Jews were not to blame.....But there was still another barrier to intermarriage, which was that there existed different fundamental views of life.</p>
