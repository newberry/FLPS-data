   <p>Our forefathers were once a people chiefly composed of tillers of the soil. That historical epoch having vanished long ago, we can hardly sympathize with our forefathers' naive joy over nature and close affinity to everything that sprouts and blossoms.</p>
   <p>Yet all our holidays are closely related to the natural elements of the country in which our forefathers became a race. Our holidays of sowing, ripening, and reaping have little significance in the countries in which we now live and earn our livelihood. Our ancient prayers for dew and rain, as well as most of our laws and traditions, have a meaning only in the country of our patriarchs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1494.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To us who live outside of the Jewish homeland, the new year's day of trees, called Chamisho Oser B'Shvat is merely a bygone memory of the bountiful, prolific natural life of our forefathers on the mountains and in the valleys of Palestine. [Chamisho Oser B'shvat is the 15th day of the 5th month in the Jewish calendar, corresponding to parts of January and February. It is a day set aside to plant trees, similar to Arbor Day.-Tr.]</p>
   <p>When the Palestinian winters and the rainy season blow over; when from the clear blue sky, a bright warm sun begins to shine and the fertile soil sends forth its first envoy to notify the children who inhabit it that spring is on its way, on that day, Chamisho Oser B'Shvat, our patriarchs would go out into their gardens and fields to decorate the revivifying <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1495.jpg" n="3"/>mother earth with a new wreath of fresh trees.</p>
   <p>All this was when Jews were still an independent race and the possessors of their own gardens and fields. Now we are an urban element, even if we reside on farms. We are segregated from nature and no longer yearn for the life of trees and flowers.</p>
   <p>Nevertheless, we celebrate this holiday of Chamisho Oser B'Shvat just like all other traditional holidays. The rabbi said that we be merry and so we are merry. Many a Jew pronounces a benediction over carobs, dates, and other fruits which grow in Palestine, but very few remember the covenant at the waters of Babylon, and think of the country where grapes and oranges grow.</p>
   <p>There is only one place in the world where the planting holiday is observed in its whole splendor, and that is in the now modernized ancient country <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1496.jpg" n="4"/>of the Jews. There in Palestine, where we have again revived the ancient bond between the Jewish people and nature, and animated the decrepit traditions and mores of an old agricultural people who had at one time dwelled in a country which they had named Land of Israel,-there, in Palestine, where the Jews have acquired anew the lingo of flowers and trees, there they celebrate Chamisho Oser B'Shvat, which is a tree arbor day.</p>
