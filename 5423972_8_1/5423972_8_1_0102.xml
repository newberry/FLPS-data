<title level="a">THE BUMS IN STANFORD PARK</title><title level="a" type="sub">by J. Loebner</title></bibl>

   <p>Recently, a group of Irish and Polish bums has appeared near the library in Stanford Park. These bums annoy the Jewish boys who go to the library to get books, and to the park to enjoy the amusements which the park provides. The bums are not content with creating noisy disturbances near the library; they are not content with making fun of the Jewish boys and tripping them. The bums have recently begun to beat up the Jewish boys. Max Kustiner of 560 West Twelfth Place is their latest victim. The bums attacked him and beat him up so thoroughly that he hardly had strength enough to drag himself home. His eyes were punched and one leg was maimed. The policeman on duty there is either a friend of the bums or else he is afraid of them because when a complaint is made to him, he merely shrugs his shoulders.</p>
   <p>Stanford Park, like all other parks, is public property. The parks were established and are maintained by taxes and by fees which the public, without <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0103.jpg" n="2"/>distinction as to race or religion, pays. Everyone has the right to use the parks. Everyone who enters the park to enjoy it, has the right to protection. The policeman (a park policeman) was stationed in Stanford Park to provide that protection. Since he is incapable of doing so, either because he does not want to, or because he cannot, the park board should replace him by another policeman, or perhaps by two. If the park board does not want to do this, it should ask the chief of police of Chicago to send some of his men there. We ourselves will do it if the superintendent of the parks is afraid of the bums.</p>
   <p>The disturbances in Stanford Park must cease. Anyone who has a complaint to make, is asked to send it in to this office.</p>
