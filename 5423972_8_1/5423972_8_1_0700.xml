<title level="a">THE REVENGE OF A PARVENU</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>It is the nature of the parvenu to ape the well-established wealthy persons of old families. The parvenu labors under difficulties in trying to speak, dress, furnish his home and appear like the rich man who comes from an old family. It is difficult for a person to change his psychology in a short time. Somewhere in his speech and in his conduct, the parvenu, the upstart, will reveal himself. He lacks that certain dignity which is a result of generations of tolerance, of higher caste, and of cultivation of the spirit. One with a sharp eye will immediately recognize the newness of the parvenu. Especially can he be recognized by his lack of appreciation and evaluation of things that are old. To the parvenu genealogy is a hindrance. The value of family tradition is foreign to him. Feeling ill at ease in his new position, he constantly seeks to ape others. He willingly drops his own personality in order to disguise himself. He discards everything which is apt to remind him of his past, regardless of how <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0701.jpg" n="2"/>valuable it may be. Only that which is new and which can be adapted to the environment to which his newly acquired riches have brought him--only that does he seek to obtain. Only that which glitters and shines on the surface and that which he thinks will place him on an equal footing with other aristocrats--only that does he seek. This psychology of the parvenu has begun to develop among us Jews during the past three or four generations.</p>
   <p>Throughout the centuries the Jewish People have been likened unto an impoverished person. They had to endure a great deal of hardships, suffer a great deal, wander about in destitution, were chased by murderers--but in their hearts they always bore the consciousness of their value. As a People they were aristocrats of illustrious descent. They were always aware of certain high principles that they had inherited from their ancestors.</p>
   <p>Then, in certain countries, Jews met with good fortune. God helped them. For <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0702.jpg" n="3"/>a while they lived at ease. Many became really wealthy. They began to adapt themselves to their new riches and began to develop the psychology of the parvenu. They tried to look like the wealthy people of old families! To speak like them! To think like them! If a person accustoms himself to such ways, he becomes like the ostrich that hides its head in the sand, thinking that no one will see him.</p>
   <p>We were good enough to bring up generations of Jews who consider themselves Germans, French, English, Poles, etc. Speak to them and they will tell you that there is no difference between themselves and others. But what about anti-Semites? They are wicked people. They [the anti-Semites] seek to ferret out the Jews, notwithstanding the fact that they are no longer recognizable as Jews, in order to cause them trouble. Aside from this there is no difference.</p>
   <p>The tragic farce of the parvenu lies in the fact that he does not sense the asininity of his position. He thinks that he is "second to none", and starts giving advice from the depths of his own experience. We find, for example, <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0703.jpg" n="4"/>in the American Israelite, the following "sound advice" offered to the Jews of Poland:</p>
   <p>"It is very likely that they [Jews] would be treated no less gruesomely and brutally even if they should adopt the traditions, language, clothing and customs of the country. But if this were done and the Jews did not segregate themselves, the relationship between the Christians and the Polish Jews would probably 'become friendlier'."</p>
   <p>Truly this is reasonable advice, although it is not original. The camels and many other animals and insects have long practiced this advice by developing the protective coloration of their environment in order to escape their natural enemies. And this is also not new to the Jews because Jews practice this type of self-protection in all countries of the world.</p>
   <p>If we practice this out of necessity, through the instinct of self-preservation <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0704.jpg" n="5"/>because we lack the power to fight, then we are justified in so doing. But we cannot, however, consider this a virtue. It is not a very delicate thing to offer a People this advice: "Conceal your racial identity, disguise yourselves and, probably, you will not be recognized."</p>
   <p>But our parvenus in America do not feel that this is disgraceful. This is the psychology of the parvenu who, light-heartedly, renounces the past in order to enjoy the present.</p>
