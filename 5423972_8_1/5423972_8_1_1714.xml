   <p>A conference of the Trade Unions. Workman's Circle Branches and Central Labor Orders, was held yesterday, to discuss the condition of the organized labor-movement.</p>
   <p>Morris Ziskind, Spokesman of the United Hebrew Trades, who called the conference, stated many reasons why the labor-organizations were urged to meet at this specific conference.</p>
   <p>He pointed out the economic and moral conditions of the Trade Unions and the opinions which have formed in the Jewish neighborhoods and the relationship which the bosses have created in the Unions through their attacks on organized and unorganized labor.</p>
   <p>The delegates have decided to organize this conference. D. Williams was appointed Chairman and Morris Ziskind was appointed Secretary of the conference.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1715.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Methods and possibilities were introduced to organize the thousands of unorganized clerks, office-workers, factory and shop workers, through a campaign of oral and written agitation, and propaganda.</p>
   <p>The delegates decided unanimously that this conference should remain permanently.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to appoint an Executive Committee of nine, which should set forth plans to create financial means for the support of the conference.</p>
   <p>The following delegates were appointed for the Executive Committee:</p>
   <p>L. Hanock, Silverstein, Malow, Shapiro, Abrams, Brooker, Duffer, Miller, and Ziskind.</p>

   <p>As soon as the Conference organized itself, the delegates, first of all, pointed out the importance of having an alliance of all labor organizations for material support.</p>
   <p>The representative of the Shockets and Butchers Union, reported that their Union is being attacked by reactionary elements, who seek to destroy the Shockets Union.</p>
   <p>The conference determined to appoint a committee of five, who should be connected with the Shockets Union, and protect the solidarity of their organization.</p>
