   <p>Tomorrow the Naturalization Aid in the W. C. Lyceum.</p>
   <p>Every Jewish organization must be represented.</p>
   <p>Organizations that have not selected delegates can be represented through their officials. Tomorrow, the long awaited conference, will take place, of all Jewish organizations to establish a great and powerful Naturalization Aid League which will undertake the important and urgent task of making our masses into citizens.</p>
   <p>It always has been necessary for our Jews to become citizens. It always has been necessary that the Jew, the worker of America, shall have the privilege of speaking his mind when approached as a worker, or as a Jew. But now, it becomes more than necessary that he should do so when such cruelties against foreigners are being planned. It is more important than ever before, that Chicago shall have an organization to undertake this important task. For this purpose, the Naturalization Conference <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1684.jpg" n="2"/>is being called tomorrow. We have the Naturalization Aid League, but there must be branches all over Chicago, we must have groups in every organization, we must put it on a safe foundation, and this must be accomplished at the Conference, tomorrow.</p>
   <p>The lawyers of the Naturalization Aid League will be present at the Conference: Comrades J. Marcus, D. Yuritz, S. Holland and M. Sobel. They will explain the new laws that are being planned against the citizens. They will also explain the plans worked out by the Naturalization Aid League, for further action.</p>
   <p>Let no organization faid to be represented at the conference, neither unions, nor Workmens Circle Branch, nor Jewish society. The Douglas branch of the Naturalization Aid League will be open, tonight, at the Workmens Circle Lyceum, Kedzie and Ogden Ave.</p>
