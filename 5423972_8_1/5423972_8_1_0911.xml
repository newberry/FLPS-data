   <p>Immediate severance of all diplomatic relations between the governments of the United States and Russia was urged by Dr. Emil G. Hirsch in his lecture at Temple Israel last night. Dr. Hirsch declared that economic conditions should not stand in the way of an open break with Russia and that international law should at once inaugurate a principle withholding the recognition of all governments from "a nation denying the inalienable rights of its subjects."</p>
   <p>"Until Russia agrees to give to her people the justice that is theirs by right divine, our government should sever all diplomatic relations with her," said Dr. Hirsch.</p>
   <p>"The United States has a right to do this, and I believe will do it. The consequences of Russian despotism are felt in this country when millions of Russian Jews and Russian Lutherans are driven here every year. We should demand justice. Our mission is higher than to be merely a supplier of iron and steel to Russia.</p>
   <p>"I believe there will soon be an international law that no nation can deny the inalienable <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0912.jpg" n="2"/>rights of its people without forfeiting the consideration of all other nations."</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch compared the Russian revolutionists with the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and declared that they were merely demanding what the heroes of the American Revolution died for. The signers of the Declaration, he remarked, would have been called anarchists as are the Russian people, had England succeeded in hanging them.</p>
   <p>"If Christ should come to Russia, He would not be allowed to enter because He was a Jew," he said.</p>
   <p>"The immoral officials have turned the churches into dens of thieves and they think they are safe because He who threw the thieves out of the temple cannot pass the Russian frontier since He is of the race of Abraham."</p>
