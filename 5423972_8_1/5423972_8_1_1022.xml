   <p>Chicago Jewry extends to you, Dr. Chaim Weizmann, leader of our people and of the great Zionist organization, a hearty welcome! The Jews of Chicago, together with the Jews of America, watch with the greatest interest your successful efforts in behalf of our people and their liberation; follow enthusiastically the progress of your great work, which must end in the triumph of the immortal ideal of liberation--the rebuilding of Palestine for our people.</p>
   <p>The Jews of Chicago, together with the Jews of the world, know how to value the immortal services you are rendering the Jewish people. You have succeeded in inducing the English government to issue the famous Balfour Declaration; you have succeeded in inducing the representatives of the Great Powers to affirm the Balfour Declaration through the historic treaty of San <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1023.jpg" n="2"/>Remo, and you have succeeded in inducing the League of Nations to affirm the English Mandate in Palestine. Seldom has a leader of the Jewish people had the honor of writing such a glorious chapter in the annals of Jewish history. That is why the masses and classes of our people have the greatest confidence in your statesmanship, in your diplomatic ability and in your discretion as a leader. The Jews of Chicago, together with the Jews of the entire world, know that your path, as ambassador of the Jewish people to the nations of the world, has not been strewn with flowers; they know that countless obstacles and stumbling blocks have been placed in your way--but you succeeded in brushing aside all obstacles and paved a clear road toward liberation--if we wish to take that road. You removed all external and many internal obstacles and now the road is clear. Our task is to finance the great work of rebuilding Palestine, to create the necessary organizational structure, and to do everything that a nation should do to attain its national goal.</p>
   <p>The Jews of Chicago, together with the Jews of America, look upon you as the successful statesman of the Jewish nation, as a great creative personality who <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1024.jpg" n="3"/>inspires new energy and harnesses old energy. As a creative personality and as a great Jewish statesman, who is destined to write a new chapter in Jewish history, you are welcome to the Chicago community, the second largest Jewish community in the world; it promises you its co-operation in the great work of building Zion.</p>
   <p>Dr. Weizmann--our statesman and leader--thousands of Chicago Jews hail you; they are eager to follow you and will follow you on the road to the redemption and the rebuilding of Palestine.</p>
