   <p>The Workmen's Circle is known in every Jewish home in Chicago. A drive to enroll 100,000 new members at the opening of the Workmen's Circle Convention has begun.</p>
   <p>The Workmen's Circle has a better system for benefits than any other organization and each year the benefits vastly improve in the interests of the members. The members are eligible to receive sick benefits, death benefits, consumptive benefits, attend their own sanitorium, and help those in need, not in the name of charity, but in a brotherly manner.</p>
   <p>The Workmen's Circle has another aspect. It caters to the labor movement and helps various political and economical organizations. It supports the labor movement financially, whenever possible.</p>
   <p>Another campaign is carried on to help the war destitute in Europe.</p>

   <p>The Educational Committee.</p>
   <p>The greatest achievement of the Educational Committee was the establishment of Workmen Circle Schools, where the children of members are given a radical education. The Educational Committee, also provided plans to send prominent speakers to address the members of the W. C. The committee also arranges beautiful concerts, every other week at the Labor Lyceum. The annual masquerade ball will be celebrated tonight at the Coliseum.</p>
