   <p>Our theoreticians--who sit up high, "on the garret," and philosophize about the things that Jews want to do or don't want to do, or whether they are able to do them or are not able to do then--are often inclined to say discouraging things to the followers of Zionism. They claim that the Jewish people, that is, the great masses, are not Zionistically inclined, that Zionism is limited to a small body of Jewish idealists who comprise the various groups in the Zionist Organization. They also say that the great majority of the Jewish people are entirely indifferent to the movement, and they therefore come to the conclusion that Zionism is not practicable.</p>
   <p>The Zionists claim, on the contrary, that the average Jew, if he is still clinging, more or less, to Jews or Judaism, is a Zionist at heart. Sometimes he is a Zionist without even knowing that he is one until something happens in his life which causes his true sentiments to come forth and clarify themselves. Then he becomes a conscientious Zionist.</p>
   <p>Something happened in Chicago the other day, which has clearly demonstrated that the Zionistic assumptions are correct, that the Jewish pulse beats for <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0906.jpg" n="2"/>Zion and that the Jewish masses are Zionists at heart. A small editorial was printed before the holidays under the caption "A Plan." It was proposed that Jewish families who are desirous of settling in Palestine, but have not the necessary means should organize a society. This society would be composed of over a thousand members, each member paying ten cents a week in dues. Within a year's time, five-thousand dollars would accumulate in the society's treasury. A drawing would then be held, and the member drawing the lucky number would be given a farm in Palestine, together with all farm implements, and traveling expenses for himself and his family.</p>
   <p>The writer of that editorial did not intend to prescribe a definite plan. He merely wanted to show how one family, at least, could be settled in Palestine, the land of our future. Hardly had the week passed by before Jews from all parts of Chicago, the great majority not belonging to the Zionist Organization, assembled and immediately organized such a society. Every one can see that the members of the society don't expect to be helped by it. A thousand members, paying ten cents a week in dues, can only hope to collect five-thousand dollars a year at the most. That amount can only supply one family with <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0907.jpg" n="3"/>a farm, but the sentiment behind the idea, to do something for Palestine has attracted many Jews. The thousand-to-one chance was enough to inspire and to stimulate a true enthusiasm for the cause. In our opinion such a response shows the true pulse-beat of our people.</p>
