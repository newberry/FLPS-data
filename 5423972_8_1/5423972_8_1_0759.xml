<title level="a">WHY EXAMINATIONS?</title><title level="a" type="sub">By H. S. Herman</title></bibl>

   <p>It is a well established fact that ever since the establishment of schools for the youth, examinations are always given to students at the close of each semester to ascertain how much knowledge they acquire during that time, and how far is their advance in science and in general knowledge. This is the general rule in the more or less progressive nations the world over.</p>
   <p>The Jews have still taken a step farther. They examine the children not only at the close of each semester, but also every week during the entire year. Every father deems it his duty to "examine" his children every Sabbath in everything they study during the week, and it is not infrequently that he brings them before a noted scholar to undergo a new examination.</p>
   <p>Today, however, there is an outstanding setback in the examinations, a setback which the people of years ago didn't have to contend with, and which is more detrimental (especially in Jewish religious education) than any other difficulty. The setback in question is that parents don't show any interest in the <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0760.jpg" n="2"/>work of their childern. Years ago it was unnecessary to manifest a great deal of interest because children took for granted that education was a duty, a commandment, as necessary as the air he breathed and at times more important than food.</p>
   <p>Today, however, especially in this country, parents are hardly interested in their children's Jewish education. If they do send their child to Chedek (Hebrew School), they merely do it to justify themselves before others or simply to prevent him from idling about in the streets.</p>
   <p>If we want our children to have a knowledge of Judaism, we must show them, and quite often, that we the adults are interested in their educational life.</p>
   <p>As things stand today, we cannot but feel ashamed that wherever there is an examination at our Talmud Torahs and Theological Seminary, no one attends class on that particular day. The children are so used to the two or three rabbis who make the examinations, that they look upon them as teachers whom they encounter daily, and this sense of familiarity reacts in the form of contempt. When <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0761.jpg" n="3"/>principals or teachers examine the children, they do it merely to determine their grading so that they may be assigned to other classes. This fails to convince the children that the public is concerned with their study of the Bible, Talmud, and other Jewish Subjects.</p>
   <p>Therefore, one of the most essential things is that our rabbis, civic leaders, church members, and Jews in general manifest more interest in school examinations. At every opportunity they should visit classes and express their contentment. This will be most impressive and will affect the students so favorable that there will be no need for parents to drive them to school with rod.</p>
   <p>The children will then enroll and attend our Jewish schools voluntarily. The number of slackers, that is, children not educated in Jewish studies, will decrease considerably.</p>
