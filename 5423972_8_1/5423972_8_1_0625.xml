   <p>This very new enterprise--an English page in the Courier, to form an organic part of the Daily, testifies best to the tremendous changes American Judaism has undergone during the last five years. Not only has there arisen a generation, thoroughly Americanized--and for many reasons alienated from original Judaism, but even the younger element from among the immigrants, who have reached the shores of America from lands across the Atlantic, during the last years preceding the War, have already been acclimatized to American manners and modes of thinking.</p>
   <p>Both the second generation of the earlier immigrants, and the Americanized immigrants themselves, unable or unwilling to read Yiddish and finding little interest as well in the so-called American Jewish weeklies, are bound to forget their Jewish traditions, unless they find an organ that will consider <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0626.jpg" n="2"/>it its duty to bring home the Jewish message to these young Jews and Jewesses in English.</p>
   <p>It is with this object in view that we submit, so to say, our first English page to the younger generations of our community. We want to see the young Jew and Jewess of Chicago as well as of the whole Middle West remain in touch with the life of their people. We want them to continue the noble traditions of our race and to take an active interest in all matters Jewish.</p>
   <p>The English page of the Courier will try its very best to keep them informed on all important events and happenings in the life of the Jewish people all over the world and particularly in American Jewry. By supplying Jewish information to our young readers and by attempting to awaken in them a greater interest in Jewish life, we hope to help to keep them in touch with Jewish life and to help them to continue the Jewish traditions--their greatest inheritance in life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0627.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Welcoming our new hosts of English readers, we greet them as the future helpers of the Jewish cause and we extend to them our congratulations on the occasion of the new year. May they witness a new and happy year and may it be granted to them to see in the new year the redemption of our people from bondage and oppression, wherever they are oppressed and persecuted.
