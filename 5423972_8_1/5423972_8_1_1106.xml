   <p>A French wit once remarked that the representatives of religion are always to be found on the wrong side. This may be overstating the case against religion, but it is a fact that representatives of religion have already come too late to save a situation. Fundamentally conservative and clinging tenaciously to traditions of old, the representatives of religion, fail to read the signs of the times and fail to recognize the requirements of the time. And unfortunately, the representatives of the Jewish religion form no exception to the rule. They are by no means "early risers," and their eyesight is not always good either. Like all representatives of religion, the representatives of our religion do not see very far ahead, and cannot anticipate matters. When they finally have to fall in line with a certain movement, because they are compelled to do so by sheer necessity of events, <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1107.jpg" n="2"/>they, as a rule, come too late.</p>
   <p>Twenty-five years ago, when the late Theodore Herzl issued his historical appeal to the Jews of the world to help redeem Zion and to establish an organization the object of which would be to secure Palestine as a homeland for the Jews, the representatives of our religion did not only not respond to the appeal, but they took a hostile attitude to the new movement. The Rabbis all over the world, Reformed and Orthodox alike, have exhibited their opposition to Zionism, and they often did it in a very nasty way. We only beg to remind our readers of the so-called five "Protest Rabbiner," including both Orthodox and Reformed Rabbis, who issued a protest against Zionism, denunciatory in nature.</p>
   <p>In the course of the last twenty-five years, many a Rabbi has undergone a change of mind and heart regarding Zionism. Many a former opponent to the cause <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1108.jpg" n="3"/>has become a convert. There are today any number of Rabbis, both Orthodox and Reformed, who are ardent Zionist workers. In many countries they are at the head of the movement, but still the majority of the Rabbis everywhere are still hostile to Zionism, and perhaps from their point of view they are right to a certain extent. To a representative of the Jewish religion, Zionism is an attempt to secularize Judaism, and it is only natural that they should fight such attempts. To them Judaism is primarily a purely religious proposition, and they cannot possibly be in love with a movement, the representatives of which are advocating a secular Judaism. But there was a time when Zionism could be shaped according to the wish of the majority of its adherents. If the representatives of our religion were men of foresight and ambition, they would have joined the Zionist movement when it was in the stage of inspection, and would have shaped it according to their own tastes and views. Now it is too late to do it. But now the representatives of our religion cannot altogether ignore Zionism. They may not like it, but they cannot pass it unnoticed. It is too strong a movement and too influential an organization. Today every Jew, whether layman or Rabbi, must be interested <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1109.jpg" n="4"/>in the Palestine proposition for a thousand and one reasons. First of all we need Palestine as a center of Jewish immigration, and it may prove to be the only center of Jewish immigration left to our people. We need Palestine as a spiritual center; we need Palestine as a political center; in short, Zionism is no longer a luxury, but a dire necessity, and hence it cannot be ignored any longer. The representatives of our religion find themselves in a rather unpleasant position. They cannot join the movement, because they cannot deny their past, and they cannot ignore the movement because the realization of Zionism is a necessity.</p>
   <p>To find a way out of this dilemma, the representatives of Orthodox Judaism in Central and Eastern Europe have established an Agudas Israel. The Agudah is primarily a political organization, and no denial of any of its representatives can make any reasonable man change his view on this subject. The Agudah may render us very valuable service in the field of Jewish education and Jewish religion, but being an international organization, they also deny that they are opposed to Zionism. But ready to participate in national enterprises, it <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1110.jpg" n="5"/>is primarily a political and not an educational organization, and as such it must necessarily be antagonistic to the Zionist organization. As a matter of fact it is the only organized force in Jewry today that is antagonistic to Zionism. But no Jewish organization can be a mass organization and can be a thriving and flourishing organization, if it is openly opposed to the Zionist proposition; that is to say, to the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The representatives of the Agudas Israel deny that theirs is a political organization, and they also deny that they are opposed to Zionism. But no denying will be of any avail. It can only lead to a political abyss and to all sorts of dubious politics. Then what must the attitude of the Zionists be to the Agudas Israel? To our mind the Zionists, especially the conservative among them, will look sympathetically upon the activities of the Agudas Israel, as far as they are purely educational and purely religious, and all the Zionists without distinction of religious belief, must oppose it and must take an outspoken hostile attitude to it as far as it is political.</p>
   <p>We are glad to notice that the Zionists all over the world, and also the Zionists in America, have taken this attitude to the Agudah. Whenever the <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1111.jpg" n="6"/>Agudah appeals for funds, for educational purposes, the Zionists give gladly as much as they can, but whenever the Agudah appeals as a political party, and begins to meddle in Jewish politics, the Zionists do not hide their opposition to the Agudah. We understand perfectly well that the Agudah finds itself in a very delicate position nay, in an unpleasant position, and we do not see for it any way out of it. The representatives of our religion have themselves to blame for this unfavorable position they have created for themselves. It was their duty to join the Zionist organization twenty-five years ago when they could shape and form it according to their own tastes. Today, they might not be able to do it, and are therefore unwilling to join it. But their open opposition to the Zionist organization will not help them either. Zionism is going to win out whether the Agudah Israel wants it or not, and the only thing the Agudah can do and must do, if it should think through its own proposition logically to the very end, is to fight the Zionist organization. But the Zionist organization is ready for the fight. One cannot remain outside of a movement for twenty-five years, fight the movement, and then dictate <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1112.jpg" n="7"/>the policies of this movement. We can therefore foresee a bitter fight between the Agudah and the Zionist organization, and the fight will be a political one, and it will be a nasty fight, but there is no doubt in our mind as to who will emerge victoriously from the fight, and we are very much afraid that the representatives of our religion will, in the future too, be on the wrong side, because they have been on the wrong side from the beginning.</p>
