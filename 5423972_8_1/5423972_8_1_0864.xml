   <p>The following is a resume of the Activities of the Verband. The Naturalization Bureau ---announces that its new offices at the Labor Lyceum will be open every evening except Saturday and Sunday to help all members of the Verband in their naturalization problems. Members may apply for their first and second citizenship papers by making application at our office.</p>
   <p>Lectures and Classes - - In answer to the complaint of many members that the cultural activities of the Verband have been lagging behind, the educational committee wishes to state that now that the Labor Lyceum is up, more time will be found for such activities. The Labor Lyceum was built both with the idea of large meeting balls and small lecture rooms. Interesting lectures on subjects vitally affecting us are already being arranged. The schedule of lectures will be announced in the near future.</p>
   <p>Workers unions are rapidly realizing that the Labor Lyceum is the ideal meeting place and are rapidly making arrangements to change the locale of their meeting places to the Labor Lyceum.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0865.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The latest unions to move into the Labor Lyceum were Local 39 of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union and Local 504 of the Carpenters Union.</p>
   <p>The Arbeitering Branches are considering a new field of activity.</p>
   <p>The consumer co-operative idea has been endorsed a number of the Arbeitering branches and financial obstacles are being put out of the way. More of the consumer co-operative's activity will be printed in the near future.</p>
   <p>Growth and Expansion of the Arbeitering Movement.</p>
   <p>The Arbeitering announces an increase in membership of 1500 members in the period of July 1st, 1919 to July 1st, 1920. This brings the total membership to 5,999. The Arbeitering realizes that this membership hardly begins to represent the Jewish working class of Chicago. It feels that all Jewish workers in the Chicago community should become members of one of the Arbeitering Branches and thus the activity of the Arbeitering can be more far reaching in score and significance. The organization feels that by co-operating with the Socialist Institute, a duplication of <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0866.jpg" n="3"/>activity could be averted and the ideals of both organizations more quickly realized.</p>
