   <p>The plan regarding a Jewish chaplain for the Chicago jails, whose work should be to visit Jewish prisoners and preach for them, as well as to help them with advice, as was proposed in the Courier, has finally been realized. Dr. Joseph Marcus was invited to come here from New York for that purpose. His activities in that direction will start as soon as he arrives. Almost every large American city has a Jewish chaplain who preaches to Jewish prisoners, who have the misfortune of being incarcerated. The City of Chicago was the only one which had no Jewish chaplain. And now Dr. Marcus will have a hard job on his hands, for Jewish prisoners here have not heard a good Jewish word by a religious representative for months and even for years.</p>
   <p>To a reporter of the Courier, Dr. Marcus explained that he came here not only to preach for Jewish prisoners in the different jails, but also to aid in reducing this number. He will also see to it that those who leave the jails should be given jobs so that they will not be forced to commit other offenses, which may bring them back again into jail. In order to do his work well, he hopes to get the co-operation of all religious representatives in this city, as well as the assistance of Dr. David Blaustein, Superintendent of the Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>Dr. Marcus has been in the United States for the past twenty-five years. He came here from Kovno, Russia. (Now Kaunos, Lithuania). There he studied the Talmud <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0215.jpg" n="2"/>in various Jewish seminaries, and afterwards he continued his studies in Germany, where he received his degree of Doctor of Theology. From Germany Dr. Marcus came to New York, where he was engaged as Rabbi at the congregation in Elmira, New York, and was the spiritual-leader there for fourteen years. During that period he assisted Dr. Rodin, who was appointed by the Rabbinical Association, to visit and assist Jewish prisoners in the jails there.</p>
   <p>Dr. Marcus will work hand in hand with the Bureau of Personal Service, which invited him to work with them.</p>
