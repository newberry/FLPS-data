   <p>Representatives of 40 different religious groups, founded a Citizen's Congress, the purpose of which is to introduce religious principles in Chicago politics.</p>
   <p>The first meeting was held in the First Methodist church, where 46 religious groups and civic clubs and even a Jewish Temple were Represented. The Jews were represented by Rabbi Emil Hirsch and Dr. Joseph Stolz. Just what the activities of this group will be is not yet clear. A committee of fifteen, including the two mentioned above, was appointed to work out a workable constitution. The purpose of the Organization will be to clean out city politics.</p>
   <p>Mr. Edward Skinner, the project's most enthusiastic backer stated that the "Citizens Congress" was to be entirely non-partisan in character, and unbiased to religious affiliations.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that through the activities of this group, the courts will be forced to judge a criminal by the crime committed and not by the size of his bank-roll.</p>
