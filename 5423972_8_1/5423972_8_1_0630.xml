   <p>If you [intend to] remain here in America, think more of America than of the old home you have left. No true American wants to see his language forced upon you. He desires to see instead that you apply yourself to it so that he and you may easily understand each other. Become a citizen as soon as possible and help all good American citizens to secure an honest state government, a clean political life, and justice for everyone.</p>
   <p>Keep your children in school as long as possible. Give them the opportunity you wished to have when you were young. Help your wife to learn the language and thereby preserve your relationship with your children and their American friends.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0631.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If you remain in America do not become bitter, or full of hatred when you encounter adverse conditions. Seek justice for others and yourself in a legal manner. Ask a good American to defend you if you are unable to defend yourself.</p>
   <p>If you remain in America speak to your fellow countrymen who are thinking of leaving America. Help them to understand the many reasons for remaining here. It helps both America and your own country at this time if you do this.</p>
