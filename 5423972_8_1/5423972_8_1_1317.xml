   <p>Thousands of men, women, and children, during the past four days, have visited the health exhibit which opened last Monday on West Park #2, corner Jefferson Street and 14th Place.</p>
   <p>Right at the entrance you will find a department for women and young girls. In that department you have the opportunity of witnessing and of receiving the proper instructions and latest methods in diapering the baby, also how to feed the infant, and how to take care of the milk which makes up the diet during the child's infancy. The women also are told of the Chicago's infant mortality rate which is 6,800 annually and which can easily be reduced to 3,500.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1318.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The women and girls are also taught the importance of safe-guarding the health of the baby, by using all possible means to keep the child healthy.</p>
   <p>In some of the other departments you can see many interesting things, such as many female attendants with red badges, who act as guides offering to show the visiting public around. Most of these guides speak the Yiddish language in explaining the good of this health project.</p>
   <p>This exhibit is open to the public from 10 A. M. to 10 P. M. at the big gymnasium hall. Many interesting programs are being conducted at this exhibit such as music, dancing, speeches, and illustrated pictures.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1319.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Each one of these programs is sponsored by the different schools and clubs in the neighborhood.</p>
   <p>Saturday night is Jewish night. Mr. Sydney A. Teller will act as chairman and Mr. Max Shulman will be the speaker of the evening in which he will demonstrate a trip to Palestine, etc. The children of West Park and of Henry Booth's house will furnish folk dances, and the Health Department will give the visitors a demonstration on milk, in which infectious germs will be shown and how to avoid them.</p>
