   <p>A reader asks us to define Zionism. We do it gladly and say that Zionism is not an abstruse philosophy, but a national movement. It expresses the resolve of the Jewish people not to be wholly merged among the nations of the earth, but to revive its own national existence in its ancestral land. It is a protest against drift and decadence, a call to collective action for the common good.</p>
   <p>There are many who believe that merely to preserve the customs and institutions of Jewish life in the lands of dispersion is the be all and end all of Judaism. Laudable as such an effort undoubtedly is, and growing in difficulty with every generation, it represents but a shortsighted view of Jewish destiny. It is not enough to battle against the inroads of assimilation, which works its way through a myriad cunning channels. However much energy is spent on this task of self-preservation, <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0501.jpg" n="2"/>much is also lost, for the forces of assimilation are as irresistible as their operation is universal. There is only one way in which those forces can be forever defeated: by restoring Israel to the land of his national birth, the scene of his national glories, where he may resume once more a normal course of national development, free from the trammels and corrosion of an alien environment.</p>
   <p>Three factors are needed for the fulfillment of Zionism: nation, land, and language. They are the triple foundation upon which alone, on fabric of Israel's future, can be built with safety.</p>
   <p>Those who declare that they are Jews simply on the ground that they are followers of the Jewish religion often follow it at a great distance behind--further behind than their fathers, and further still than their grandfathers, whilst their children will follow at an even greater interval, and their grandchildren may lose their way altogether.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0502.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The true children of Israel realize that they are members of the Jewish nation as well as adherents of the Jewish faith. For them Judaism is not merely a cycle of observance or a series of rites, however highly they esteem their value and significance; it is an all dominating spirit that animates their souls, colors their lives, and gives poise and direction to their mental outlook. They feel that beyond the celebration of festivals of tradition, commemorating landmarks in the national development of Israel two, three, or even four thousand years ago, they have to continue the chain of tradition by renewed activity in the land of the past. They are not content merely to mark time; they wish to record progress.</p>
   <p>In no other region but the Land of Israel can the Jewish people realize its rightful destiny, for there it was that it first acquired nationhood and rose to renown. There it was that it evolved its faith, culture, and polity, fashioned its language and produced its holy writ. There its prophets taught, its psalmists sang, its kings ruled. From every hill and dale, from every city, plain and river, the land speaks of the doings of the people of Israel. From <pb facs="5423972_8_1_0503.jpg" n="4"/>the days when Israel went into exile Palestine has had no history but a barren record of incursion and devastation, and only from the days of Israel's return has its history begun anew. No other land can call the Jewish people back to national rejuvenation.</p>
   <p>Coming from the four corners of the earth to their ancestral domain, the children of Israel can understand one another only through their ancestral language. Only by elevating Hebrew to the speech of the home and the mart, as well as of the school, can they avoid a babel of tongues. Only by employing the speech of David and Solomon, of Isaiah and Jeremiah, can they hope to reanimate the soul of their forefathers and rekindle a spark of the ancient flame.</p>
