   <p>The Succoth Festival, which was arranged at the Hebrew Institute, is one of the finest and most beautiful the Chicago Jews have ever had. The festival has begun two days ago, and everyone who visited the Hebrew Institute and has seen this wonderful panorama, is simply astonished.</p>
   <p>On the enormous yard of this Jewish institution, which aims to disseminate Judaism and American patriotism among the Jews of Chicago, there are various pleasures. In the center of this yard one may observe a long line occupied by well known Chicago housewives, who are presenting to the public, objects of distinction and interest. In another part of the yard there is a "merry-go-round." In a third place there is a tea-room, and then the colossal Succoh, where a great variety of delicacies are served. There are also two five cent theaters, a dance hall, the music played by a good orchestra. The air is delightfully refreshing on this spacious, attractively illuminated yard. All in all, it is a picture, as that of a fire, which costs much to <pb facs="5423972_8_1_1436.jpg" n="2"/>be built up.</p>
   <p>Yesterday was the second day of the Succoth Festival. Among the guests, who participated yesterday, was the great philanthropist, Mr. Julius Rosenwald. He had contributed a large sum toward the purchase of the Hebrew Institute. Mr. Rosenwald had appropriated a sizeable sum, but this alone is insufficient. It is imperative that all Jews of Chicago visit this festival, which will last until Thursday, to assure the success of this noble enterprise, so that the Hebrew Institute will not be a loser financially.</p>
