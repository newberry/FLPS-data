   <p>A Garment Workers Aid Conference was organized five weeks ago - a body where all Jewish unions, Jewish labor organizations, and workers benefit societies are represented. What has it accomplished?</p>
   <p>The purpose of this Garment Workers Conference is to cooperate with the Joint Board in organizing the Chicago clothing workers - to help them financially and morally - a noble task which should inspire every conscientious worker. And yet they have not approached any practical work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0433.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In times when forty to fifty thousand workers are working under enslaved conditions, in this important moment of an epoch-making turning point in the tailoring trade, there are representatives from almost sixty organizations of the local labor movement sitting there arguing, debating, squabbling over a foreign matter as to whether they should admit a delegate from an industrial workers union or not. Two meetings have already been taken up with this petty issue. In the meantime, you tailors allow your bosses and foreman to impose such bad conditions on you; you work for starvation wages. It doesn't matter if you wait, "We must talk it over; reveal all we know personally, scientifically, and materially; that is more important than anything."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0434.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Yes, the Jewish workers, the intelligentsia, the mouthpieces have not yet learned to be tolerant. They have not yet discarded the old traditional Jewish habit of talking and talking. But they don't do any actual work. The fact alone that two and one-half hours were taken up in a debate at the conference on a question which could have been settled in five minutes is indication of their ineptitude. And another fact is that immediately following this "scientific" debate, the debaters walked out of the hall when they reached the point where practical work was to be introduced. And at the close of the meeting a committee of fifteen was needed and only five barely accepted. One might ask: Why this conference?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0435.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It is true that the Joint Board who called this conference was sincere in their object, but it was a failure. Such a conference is neither necessary nor timely. The best advice is that this conference should turn into a United Hebrew Trades Association where only trades unions should be represented for the purpose of carrying on general trade union organizational work. Such a body is timely, necessary, and very important.</p>
   <p>We do not wish, however, to discourage the loyal workers of the conference and may they go forward in their work. Any one understanding the importance of such work should help as much as he possibly can.</p>
