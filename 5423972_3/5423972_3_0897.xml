   <p>All the Chicago cloakmakers as one went out on strike yesterday, and in rows marched to their union halls. The strikers are inspired and sure to succeed. Warm greetings from Schlesinger. The first day of the cloakmakers strike in Chicago brought excellent results. The largest cloak manufacturer in Chicago ignores the bosses association and signs an agreement with the union. That is the first victory and best assurance of a quick victory for the whole front. The cloakmakers, despite the dark and heavy clouds overhead and the rain that continued from morning till night, was not hindered from marching out of the down town shops and parading through the streets to the halls where they were addressed by the strike leaders, and were registered in the struggle against the organized cloak and suit manufacturers. When the cloak makers left their shop, many of the manufacturers distributed circulars to each of the workers giving reasons why they determined to adopt the old conditions in the shops. The contents of these circulars, were false and no doubt aimed to fool the workers. B. Hirschbaum and Co. stated to their workers that the union refused to have conferences with the bosses, and for that reason until a new agreement will be presented to them, this firm will adopt a standard of production.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0898.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Naturally, the workers know this to be a false statement. The union never refused to go into conference with the bosses, but the bosses refused conferences, unless, they would be assured that before making a new agreement, they could introduce a standard of production. The cloak makers having enough experience, and knowing their bosses well, knew that such statements had but one aim, to bring doubt into the minds of the workers, but the bosses can never accomplish this.</p>
   <p>The biggest firm, Palmer and Co. settled with the union. The start of the cloakmakers victory began yesterday. Percival B. Palmer, 367 W. Adams St., the largest cloak manufacturer signed the agreement with the Joint Board of the Cloakmakers Unions, and the workers remained working under union conditions. When business agent Glassman made the transaction with Mr. Palmer he convinced that Mr. Palmer is not looking for a battle with the union and does not want to change any conditions in his shop. He declared, that he does not see why the manufacturers are looking for a war with their workers, and demanded that their workers shall not be stopped because he is signing an agreement. The striking committee determined that Palmers requests be granted, and the agreement was signed. President Schlesinger sent a greeting telegram to the Chicago Strikers, and promised the aid and assistance of the International.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0899.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The telegram read as follows:</p>
   <p>To the Chicago cloakmakers -- Accept my hearty greetings at the beginning of your strike, and my brotherly assurance that efforts of our International and all other sources will be available for the striking cloakmakers of Chicago. We are carrying on a battle for the maintenance of human working conditions in the industry. We will continue the battle until the bosses will drive out of their head, the idea of bringing back the sweat shop system.</p>
   <p>Benjamin Schlesinger, President.</p>
   <p>Workers of the different shops, at 10 o'clock in the morning shop meetings will be held, where arrangements will be made for furthur strike work. All strikers must be on time and at their designated places.</p>
