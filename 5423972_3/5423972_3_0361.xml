   <p>Among the 2,500 children's jacket makers in Chicago a movement has been started to organize their own union. They have been members of many different locals of the Amalgamated. In the last strike, they were together with the other strikers in the tailoring trade. The jacket makers belonging to the different locals, claim, that their treatment by the locals is not as it should be, hence they had to have a union of their own. Very often, questions of importance came up, which could not be solved, by having their member co-workers scattered about in many other locals. Nothing can be accomplished unless a new union is formed. These jacket makers had to go to the district council with their trouble and applied for a charter, for a union of their own. The district council has turned the charter application over to the general executive for action, because the council has no authority to issue a charter of this sort.</p>
