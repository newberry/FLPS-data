  <body>
   <p>Our painters and paper-hangers are displaying real organization and leadership. Realizing that this is the time of year when work is most plentiful, they have used this opportunity to better their economic condition by demanding a higher hourly rate. This should be an example to workers in other trades. Better your lot by joining a union and demanding better pay.</p>
   <p>May Day and The Jewish Workers</p>
   <p>May Day is drawing near and Jewish labor organizations are planning to help make as large a labor demonstration as possible. Under ordinary circumstances we would be among the first to support such action. However, at this time we are opposed to this form of hilarious demonstration. We feel that if the same energy which is being put forth to make this demonstration a success were put forth to organize people into unions, a great deal more would be accomplished.</p>
