   <p>There is a rumor in circulation that one of the parties fears the entire Jewish vote will go to the other party. This rumor is based either on political [motives] or on stupidity, and the rumor has no foundation in fact. There is no such thing as a Jewish vote. The Jewish citizens do not vote as Jews, but vote as Americans and as members of the American parties. They are to be found in both camps--in the Democratic camp and in the Republican camp. If it is going to be a Democratic landslide, the Jewish voters will naturally slide along with the Democrats, and vice versa. But to assert that there is a silent conspiracy of the Jewish voters in America against one or the other party is an act of stupidity and an act of malice, and no import should be attached to such assertions. We do not know of any responsible Jewish organization in the United States, the leaders of which have urged upon the members to vote for one or the other party. Jewish life and Jewish affairs have nothing to do with politics.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1721.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But while there is no Jewish vote, there are Jewish interests to be safeguarded. The interests of the Jews are legitimate from every point of view, because they differ in no way in principle from the interests of many other religious or ethnic groups in this country. The Irish have their interests, the Catholics have their interests, the Prohibitionists have their interests, the Protestants have their interests, etc. Just as there are to be found Catholics or Protestants in both camps, though they have their own interests to safeguard, so there are to be found Jews in both camps. But while the interests of other groups may or may not collide with the interests of the American people and government, the interests of the Jewish people, being purely humanitarian in nature, do not collide with the interests of the American people; and as a rule, the interests of the Jewish people are absolutely compatible with those of the American people. We would never urge America to embark upon risky foreign enterprises to save Jewish interests, and still less to risk a war on account of Jewish interests. But the American people, imbued with liberal and humanitarian ideas, is certainly not interested in Jewish oppression abroad; but it is moreover interested to see the Jewish people happy and prosperous. The oppression of the Jews in <pb facs="5423972_3_1722.jpg" n="3"/>the various European countries affects the interests of the American people in so far as it leads to a Jewish exodus from the lands of the Jewish oppression, and the exiles see only one refuge before them--America. While there is room in America for many more millions of people, America is deeply interested in seeing that immigration does not degenerate into a peoples' migration, that it does not assume the form of an invasion. The oppression of millions of Jews in various European countries is decidedly against the interests of America, and if we appeal to the American government and people to intervene in behalf of our oppressed brethren and sisters abroad, we do not impose ourselves upon the good nature of the American people; we appeal to its highly developed sense of justice.</p>
   <p>If we know that a party is going to violate every principle of liberalism and fair play, [if] we think that the coming in power of a party will do harm to the American people and to the world, and will delay the progress of the world, there is no reason why we should be instrumental in delaying the progress of the world.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1723.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We do not ask the Jewish voters to cast their ballot for one party. We are sure that is not going to happen. Besides, there are a great many Jews in this country who have a developed sense of gratitude, and being grateful to the present administration for all that it has done for the Jews in the lands of Jewish oppression, and for all it has done for the Jewish people in America by appointing a Jew to be a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, will cast their ballot for the Democratic candidates. Others, who expect the Republican party to be as fair to the Jews as the Democrats, will cast their ballot for the Republican candidates. But both types of voters are going to the polls with America's interests in mind, and not with specific religious or ethnic interests. Of course we could not expect a Jew to vote for an outspoken anti-Semite, first of all because anti-Semitism is absolutely incompatible with true Americanism. But when the attitude of both candidates to the Jewish people is the same, when both display the same impartiality, the Jewish question is absolutely eliminated.</p>
   <p>The late Theodore Roosevelt was popular among all the Jewish classes because of his rich personality, and because of his courageous attitude to despotic <pb facs="5423972_3_1724.jpg" n="5"/>Czarist Russia. The present Democratic administration is popular among the Jews because it has displayed a spirit of true liberalism to the Jewish people here and abroad, and those Jews who are Democrats by conviction or temperament, will certainly not fail to express their gratitude to the present administration by supporting its candidates on the day of judgment.</p>
