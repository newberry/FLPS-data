   <p>The Amalgamated Clothing Worker's Union is struggling on six fronts, conducting with great ability its struggle for a higher wage scale and union recognition. The most bitter fight is with the Kuppenhiemer shop on the Southwest Side. This shop employs a majority of Bohemians, who a year ago were impervious to organizational attempts, but who today are the most loyal fighters.</p>
   <p>The strikers in the Cohen and Rissman shop are full of hope that the employers will be compelled to settle with the union. The main demand of the latter is recognition of the union. The firm tried to open a non-union shop in the Southwest Side, but the union forestalled this plan by organizing the new employees. The same struggle is to be seen in the shop of Adenheimer and Stein, Chas. Kaufman, and Alfred Decker and Cohen. The tailors of these shops are determined to win the right to organize and to enable themselves to dictate the conditions of work.</p>
   <p>From the beginning of the drive to organize the Northwest Side shops, the head-quarters of the Amalgamated Union were found to be too small; therefore, a new hall at 1364 N. Robey St. and Damen, was rented. All members seeking information are requested to speak to Comrade Glickman.</p>
