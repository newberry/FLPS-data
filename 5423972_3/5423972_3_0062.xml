  <body>
   <p>Every now and then you can hear rumors that there still is a creature existing, named the Citizens' Committee, which undertook no smaller task than establishing the open shop system in various branches of the building industry.</p>
   <p>The Citizen's Committee, after adopting the so-called Landis-Award, thought that they could do such wonders as to stand the world on its edge and exterminate all the unions of the building industry in Chicago. This ruling was engineered by the former Judge Landis, and it has failed until now to reach a successful standing. The very unions which the Citizens' Committee undertook to destroy have become stronger and more powerful in their struggle against capital. The few contractors pretending to stand by the Landis Award are doing it for the sake of appearance, in order to avoid disputes with certain bankers to whom they must, from time to time, apply for loans. But the fact that they abide by this <pb facs="5423972_3_0063.jpg" n="2"/>policy had not the least influence on the course of the building industry, and certainly did not harm the unions of this industry.</p>
   <p>Yet, it does not seem proper to state publicly that the entire Landis Award is a failure, or that the Citizens' Committee lost their fight with the organized workers. They try from time to time to raise a little rumpus, to give the public the impression that they are still alive and making progress, but listening carefully to what some of the leaders of the Committee are saying you can clearly understand that it is nothing but a bluff.</p>
   <p>A few months ago a conference of various employers' associations took place. A few members of the Citizens' Committee were present at this conference, in which the Landis-Award drew its last breath. Prior to this conference no one had heard anything of this creature, the Citizens' Committee, which for a long time had been considered dead and buried.</p>
   <p>This week another memorial meeting was held by people with a strong desire to hear that the capitalists are making progress in establishing the open shop system in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0064.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This meeting was called by the Chicago Association of Commerce. The president of the Citizens' Committee was present and submitted a report of the "great success" of their work.</p>
   <p>"Our people that belong to the Citizens' Committee are forced to admit that it would be impossible to establish in Chicago the open shop system one hundred per cent," said the chairman, "and as long as we cannot expect one hundred per cent open shop, we must be satisfied with a smaller percentage of success."</p>
   <p>Well, one would naturally expect that, if not one hundred per cent success, at least he was going to say 75, 50, or 25 per cent. But no, upon listening further to the report, in which figures are given about the number of workers employed by the contractors who support the Landis Award, one could hear of the bitter defeat the leaders of the Committee have suffered in attempting to destroy the organized unions of the building industry.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0065.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>They said that they would not stop at one industry only, but that they would establish the open shop system in all branches of industry, and that when they were all set in Chicago they would go to other cities and do the same. But now they have changed their tune.</p>
   <p>The Citizens' Committee of Chicago is dead, and all we can do is offer a prayer, on each anniversary, in memory of this creature.</p>
