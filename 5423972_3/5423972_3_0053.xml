   <p>The delegates of the Jewish trade unions to the United Hebrew Trades, (with the exception of one), yesterday determined to join the movement to fight the Communist peril in the trade unions.</p>
   <p>The delegates of the Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Painters, Carpenters, Bakers, and other unions have bitterly the Communist activities in the various unions of Chicago and have declared that the United Hebrew Trades must not be passive in this struggle.</p>
   <p>The delegates demanded that the Hebrew (united) Trades shall join the movement, which was organized in New York, and that the United Hebrew shall be represented at the conference of the New York unions, December 21.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0054.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After listening to the unfortunate and harmful tactics of the Communists, the delegates accepted the following resolution:</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades, assembled at a meeting December 12, decides to join the movement of the New York trade unions to combat the Communistic tactics in its union.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades, also decides to drive out the Communists from the unions that they seek to seize.</p>
   <p>It was also determined to send a delegate to the trade union conference to be held in New York, December 12. Comrade Morris Siskind was unanimously elected to represent the United Hebrew Trades at the Conference in New York.</p>
