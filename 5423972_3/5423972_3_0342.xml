   <p>All the employers with the exception of a few came to the union headquarters in the Palace Theatre Building, and signed the agreement for 1916, and 1917. The union members are now working under the following conditions:</p>
   <p>1. Bosses must employ union members.</p>
   <p>2. Only workers sent by the union office may work in the bakery.</p>
   <p>3. No boss can offer board and room to his workers, nor ask him to do work not connected with baking.</p>
   <p>4. A work day shall consist of ten hours, including time off for lunch. Not more than six days shall constitute a week, one day of which is given to the unemployed who are paid by the worker whose place the substitute takes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0343.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>5. The minimum weekly wage is $26 for a foreman, $23 for a second-hand, $21 for a third hand.</p>
   <p>6. Substitutes receive $4 a day. Oven and sponge setters, $5 a day.</p>
   <p>7. All holiday with the exception of Pesach week, will be paid for.</p>
   <p>8. All work in the producing of bakery goods must be done by union men.</p>
   <p>9. Union representatives have free asset to the workshops at all times.</p>
   <p>10. Any substitute worker sent by the union must be admitted and allowed to work.</p>
   <p>Now the union will continue with the work agitating to the workers regarding the union label, which serves as a great help in our campaign with the bosses for union conditions. Monday, May 1, Local 237 will meet as in every year, and celebrate by marching on the streets with music and a mass meeting after the parade.</p>
