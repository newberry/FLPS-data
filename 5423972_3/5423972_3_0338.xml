   <p>The Labowitz Company, 2041 Ogden Avenue, whose forty girls walked out on strike last Monday refusing to submit any longer to hunger wages at a time when they are being bossed around, secured an injunction a few days ago against the leaders of Local 60 of the House Dress, Kimona and White Goods Workers' Union, and also against all the strikers, who are now forbidden to picket near the shop. In the struggle against the weary, sallow-faced girls who have hitherto toiled at starvation wages while wasting their energy at the machines, the bosses have employed the old method of compelling workers to return to work under slave conditions. The strikers are, however, quite determined never to cross the threshold of that factory, rather than to yield and again be dominated by half a dozen bosses who pay only starvation wages. With the guidance of their union, the strikers are sure they will eventually win, because they know that even injunctions cannot operate the machines and produce the heap of aprons that used to be produced daily.</p>

   <p>Shoe Repair Bosses Satisfied With Union</p>
   <p>In response to our notice of last week under the caption "Union of Shoe Repair Workers Grows and the Bosses Are Frightened"--i. e., speaking of the bosses of this trade who fear the rapid growth of the union--we have received a letter from one boss who denies our assertions, declaring that the bosses are highly satisfied with the newly-organized union. We believe that the letter is characteristic, and therefore we publish its full contents, as follows:</p>
   <p>"Dear Editor of the Courier: In Wednesday's issue of the Courier, I read in the column 'In The Field of Labor' that the shoe repairers have organized a union, and that the bosses are beginning to fear....</p>
   <p>"I can write that this is not true. The bosses have no fear. On the contrary, we wish them to hasten the progress of their organization, and to work only six hours instead of the many they now work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0340.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"I can also inform you that the bosses are beginning to organize themselves. I am the secretary of the United Shoe Repairers Association of Chicago, and I come in contact with many who employ workers. It is their desire to support their employees' union, because our association is based upon the principle that we ourselves do not want to be enslaved. Most of the 'bosses' are now working seven days a week. Therefore, we wish the Shoe Repairers Union success. There are bosses who are not shoemakers themselves, but employ shoemakers who work fifteen hours a day. This is why we ourselves are enslaved. Therefore, we hope that the Shoe Repairers Union will,within a short time, curtail the number of working hours.</p>

   <p>Raincoat Workers To Make New Demands</p>
   <p>Because of the expiration of the old agreement, the raincoat manufacturers <pb facs="5423972_3_0341.jpg" n="4"/>will have to respond no later than August 1 to the new demands of the raincoat makers. A ten per cent raise and more sanitary conditions in the shops are all that the union demands, and it is willing to continue these demands even if a strike becomes necessary. It is hoped that the manufacturers will renew the contract, submitting to the workers' demands.</p>
   <p>Grocery Clerks Profit By Union Signs</p>
   <p>"A Union Sign In A Grocery Window Means Good Conditions For The Clerks." This motto is being widely distributed by the Grocery Clerks' Union, which was organized a few months ago in order to improve the clerks' conditions. The union signs in the windows, an idea which was introduced a short time ago, help the union a great deal in its work and, recently several disputes were thereby ironed out with almost no struggle at all. The grocery clerks express their gratitude to housewives for co-operating with them.</p>
