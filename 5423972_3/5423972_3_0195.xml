   <p>Six Months Activity of the United Jewish Trades. by Leon Hannvik (Sec'y).</p>
   <p>The United Jewish Trades serves as a clearing house for every strike called by one of the smaller unions, which are members of the Trades.</p>
   <p>The past six months were not stormy ones. There occurred no major strikes. Financial support was given to the following: Chicago Federation of Labor, for the deportation cases which were being fought by the American Women's Committee, $200; Laundry Workers, $25; Furniture Store Workers, $50; Albany Defense Fund, $25; and to the Cooperative Conference, $25.</p>
   <p>Aside from the above, the United Jewish Trades provided the mattress makers with a free hall in which to meet for 20 weeks. The picture-frame workers and the automobile cushion makers used the Trades Hall during their strikes. The Trades has begun lately, to organize the pocket-book makers.</p>
   <p>In the last six months the income of the Trades was $1,412.14, and the disbursements were $1,262.90.</p>
