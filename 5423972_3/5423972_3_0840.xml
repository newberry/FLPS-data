   <p>About sixty dressmakers of Lipson Brothers Dress Shop, 325 Adam St., declared a strike yesterday resulting from poor conditions, low wages and long working hours.</p>
   <p>The strike was called by Mandy Fineberg, organizer of the Joint Board of Cloak Makers at the consent of the organizational committee, which strives to organize the unorganized dressmakers and cloak makers of Chicago. The organizer, also called out on strike the dressmakers of the Lerner Shop in the same building. However, Mr. Lerner had immediately settled the strike with the union, granting forty-four hours and the minimum scale of the Dressmakers Union, Local 100.</p>
   <p>The strike at Lipson Bros. will be carried on until they will recognize the union and undersign an agreement with union conditions. Good operators who worked forty-four hours and overtime, earned about $20 a week. Finishers earned between $12 and $15 a week. Cutters were ranging from $30 to $35 a week, while union cutters were earning $40, $50 and higher.</p>
