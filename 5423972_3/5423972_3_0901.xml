   <p>Vice President of the Bosses' Association, Settled the Strike with the Union</p>
   <p>The union proves that the manufacturers make false statements regarding the strike.</p>
   <p>Rabiner brothers and Fishman, the vice president and treasurer of the association, signed the agreement, yesterday with the capmaker's Union, and their workers will start working today under union conditions, without a standard of production.</p>
   <p>Rabiner brothers, the largest firm in the city and Mr. Fishman one of the largest manufacturers signing the union agreement, are the best in indications that the association will disband, and the capmakers will be the victors over the bosses, who always tried to force upon the capmakers a form of work, which is considered by the workers the worse kind of slavery.</p>
   <p>Mr. Skolnik, the business agent of local five, quoted a representative of the Forward yesterday, that those manufacturers claiming that they didn't try to decrease the wages of their workers, are not telling the truth.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0902.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In a statement from the association received by the union July 31, 1921, signed by the president and industrial adviser, Mr. Skolnick pointed out that article No. 2 in that statement states that the manufacturers claim that the standard of production now in effect and the ten percent reduction in wages decided by the arbitration board, still costs them more than it did when they paid for piece work. In order to reconcile the cost for the manufacturer with that of the other needle trades, they demand the equivalent of a ten percent reduction in pay thus reducing wages to the 1920 level when the system was in effect. This demand was answered with a strike, and, it is likely that the union will be the victors in this battle.</p>
