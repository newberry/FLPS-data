   <p>Nine good and true men, representing the three major religious faiths, have formed a Permanent Commission on Better Understanding, a fact-finding and opinion-forming body which will analyze all charges made against the various groups of American citizens by other groups from time to time. Protestants, Catholics, and Jews are equally represented in the newly formed, voluntary body. Representing the Protestant denominations are: Reverend S. Parks Cadman, president of the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America; W.H.P. Faunce, president of Brown University; and Roscoe Pound, dean of the Harvard Law School. Catholicism is represented by Father Francis P. Duffy, president of the Rainbow Division of the Veterans' Association; Judge Victor J. Dowling, presiding justice of the Appelate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York; and Martin Conboy, Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great. American Jewry is represented by Dr. Stephen S. Wise, rabbi of the Free Synagogue of New York; Henry Morgenthau, former U.S. Ambassador to Turkey; and Irving Lehman, justice of the New York State Court of Appeals.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1299.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The object of the newly created commission is described in the following terms in an editorial in the American Hebrew: "The Permanent Commission on Better Understanding is to be free of private religious views, doctrines, beliefs, or practices. It is to be free of politics. It is not to initiate any new movement. It is not, of its own accord, to investigate any problems that may trouble the religious groups. Questions touching international relations shall be entirely out of its province. It will have no power, nor will it have any desire, to act in any capacity. It will have no permanent officers and will call itself into session only when it receives an appeal to redress a 'group wrong'. It will determine for itself whether a protest from a particular group comes within its purview. But when it has undertaken a task, when it has investigated painstakingly, and when it has spoken after careful and unbiased deliberation, the whole nation will listen and will accept its pronouncement as the enlightened voice of the Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish population on the broad grounds of American humanity."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1300.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>I must ask that I be counted among the "doubting Thomases" with regard to the possible achievements of the well-intentioned Permanent Commission on Better Understanding. I am strongly inclined to believe that very little of lasting value can result from the contemplated activities of the Commission. I respect the nine gentlemen for their good intentions, but I fear they will soon tire of their self imposed task.</p>
   <p>I have no quarrel to pick with the members of the newly organized Permanent Commission. The half-dozen Gentile members are to be praised for their avowed interest in the cause of the Jews; and as far as the three Jewish members are concerned, nothing less could have been expected from men calling themselves Jews. Nevertheless, it is our duty to examine the bases underlying the proposed activities of the new body calmly and dispassionately.</p>
   <p>As "a voluntary fact-finding and opinion-making body which will investigate accusations against groups of American citizens who feel themselves unjustly <pb facs="5423972_3_1301.jpg" n="4"/>accused," the Commission can hardly have in mind the seventy-five million Protestants. A group comprising three-fourths of the population of the United States has no reason to fear unjust accusations. It can afford to ignore the attacks made by the minority groups. It follows, therefore, that only the minority groups need concern themselves with accusations made against them by the majority; and as we have seen, the two minority groups are the Catholics and the Jews.</p>
   <p>What about the Catholics and the Jews? Do they suffer at the hands of the Protestant majority? If so, how? It would be too much to deny that there are elements among the Protestant majority that look askance on the Catholics generally. We have had anti-Catholic sentiment with us for a long time. Ever since the first influx of Irish immigrants a century ago, Protestants, and by no means the least influential among them, have openly expressed disapproval of the Roman Catholic element. There is a considerable anti-Catholic feeling in the South and in some parts of the West. There is a well-defined understanding that no Catholic can be elected to the Presidency. Much of the anti-Catholic sentiment in the West, for instance, is due to the fact that the <pb facs="5423972_3_1302.jpg" n="5"/>Catholic Church is regarded as the enemy of the American public school. In recent years the only organized body that has disseminated Catholic propaganda has been the Ku Klux Klan. This organization, however, attacks other groups as well.</p>
   <p>As far as the American Jews are concerned, only Mr. Ford and the afore-mentioned Ku Klux Klan have felt the urge to maintain an organized propaganda machine against them. It is generally conceded that the Klan has already lost most of its numerical strength throughout the South and the West. Mr. Ford's activities have not been so successful as he might have wished. Frankly speaking, there is no anti-Semitism to speak of in the United States. What passes for anti-Semitism in this country is a mild form of social ostracism. Certain high class resorts refuse to serve Jewish patrons. From time to time attempts are made in the Eastern colleges to exclude, or limit the number of Jews. Aristocratic clubs draw the line against Jewish members. Recent anti-immigration laws were aimed, in part, against the Jewish immigrants.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1303.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>It is, therefore, proper to inquire what, if anything, the Permanent Commission on Better Understanding could hope to accomplish if it made the minority groups a little more popular with the majority? What surprises me is that the Commission on Better Understanding has overlooked the one real, live, racial problem in the United States. I am referring, to be sure, to the Negro question. Here is something worthy of the labors of the eminent gentlemen of the Commission. Compared to the problem of the Negro in America, the difficulties of the Catholics and the Jews pale into insignificance. Surely there is need for better understanding between the whites and the blacks in this country--on the part of the whites, we mean. Why not tackle this problem?</p>
   <p>In all likelihood the Commission would probably admit that the Negro problem offered insurmountable difficulties. And this is a point of view which appeals rather strongly to my way of thinking. At bottom it is a question of prejudice. I don't see how the Commission would eradicate prejudice from the minds of millions of native Protestant Americans. Prejudice is not amenable to reason. Our hatreds, even as much as our loves, are irrational and inexplicable. Psychologists are only now beginning to understand a little of the workings of <pb facs="5423972_3_1304.jpg" n="7"/>the human mind. Prejudice is not due solely, or even mainly, to lack of knowledge. It is due to something deeper and more profound--to hidden causes.</p>
   <p>Consider the phenomenon called the Ku Klux Klan. The editor of the American Hebrew thinks that if such a body as the Permanent Commission on Better Understanding had been functioning ten years ago the Klan would not have swept the South and the West in 1920.....The more the Klan was condemned by "men of enlightenment and lovers of their fellowmen," the more it grew in membership and influence throughout the South in the years following the end of the World War. What then shall we think of the new Permanent Commission? The most that can be said for it is that it is a pretty gesture. Its work, in all probability, will be barren.</p>
