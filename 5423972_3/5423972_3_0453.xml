   <p>The Worker Ghetto.</p>
   <p>What have the Ladies Custom Tailors gained in their last strike? - For the first time in the Jewish Workers movement. - Reasons and Differences. - The South Side Slaves. - The ruling of the Illinois Supreme Court on the women's 10 hour maximum working day law. - "The Ladies Garment Worker", a new journal.</p>
   <p>It took more than twelve weeks of hunger, starvation and trying times for the Ladies Tailors to win their strike. They were out once and for all to establish their trade on a normal basis. And, they were successful. They won. They now have an eight hour working day, and higher prices for their work, time and a half for overtime, and a closed shop. During slack seasons, all work will be divided equally among all the workers. No worker may be discharged unless the employer can show cause, and then only if the union accepts the employer's reason.</p>
   <p>This is the first time in the history of the Jewish Labor movement in Chicago, at least in the last six years, that Jewish workers have won such a successful strike and achieved such a victory.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0454.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>What are the reasons? Why were the Ladies Customs Tailors able to win where other Jewish trades have failed. The explanation is simple. The Ladies Tailors were organized from the start for good and normal reasons. No one agitated for organization. No literature was sent out. No publications have appealed to them to combine with other workers forces to form a strong labor movement. The Ladies Tailors organization sprang from natural causes and therefore has a strong natural foundation.</p>
   <p>May it be said that the strike was carried on in a sensible, tactful, and a logical manner.</p>
   <p>We have always said that the lack of success of the Jewish labor movement in Chicago, as well as in other American cities, has been due to the lack of natural organization. Their activities were not directed to the strengthening of their trade. This fault was remedied in the Ladies Tailors strike. They have set a good example for future organizations of Jewish trade unions, and no doubt will have great influence upon their future activities.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0455.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And what is the matter with the South Side workers of this trade? Have they no understanding, do they not understand what union organization means, don't they want to better their economic conditions at all? One must be crazy not to want to take advantage of a victory achieved by others in their trade. We hope that these backward workers will wake up, and within the next few weeks, join the union and better their working conditions.</p>
   <p>It is indeed gratifying to know that the Illinois Supreme Court declared the women's 10 hour maximum working day law constitutional. The manufacturers have fought the law ever since its passage and even obtained an injunction against its passage. The Illinois Supreme Court set aside the injunction and declared the law constitutional.</p>
   <p>We hope that organized labor will now start agitating for an 8 hour maximum working day, not only for women, but for men also.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0456.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We have just received the first issue of the "Ladies Garment Worker" which is printed in three languages, Yiddish, Italian, and English. The publication is informative of the trade union movement through out the city.</p>
   <p>We welcome this publication and hope that it soon becomes a weekly. The Jewish worker is in need of such a publication just as he must breathe.</p>
