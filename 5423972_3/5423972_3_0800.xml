<title level="a">NO PROSPECT FOR A SETTLEMENT OF THE DRESSMAKERS' STRIKE; MANUFACTURERS AGAINST ARBITRATION</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Last night the cloakmakers' union called a strike of the dressmakers in Evanston. Five hundred dressmakers, who belong to a branch of the Chicago union, stopped working.</p>
   <p>Ten more shops have settled with the union and signed the new agreement, according to the latest official declaration of the strike committee. The names of these ten are: Miller Brothers, Fox and Geller, Osom and Kaplan, M. Miller and Son, P. Lyons, Sherman and Berman, Sopkin Dress Company, Levin and Cable, Knee Brothers, and Vogue Garment Company. This makes thirty firms that have signed with the union.</p>
   <p>Five hundred workers of Shuman Brothers have each pledged to contribute one dollar a week for the benefit of the striking dressmakers.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, Judge Sullivan confirmed the injunction against the Union, <pb facs="5423972_3_0801.jpg" n="2"/>prohibiting strikers from picketing on Market Street, between Van Buren Street and Adams Street. The injunction was issued at the request of the attorneys for the manufacturers, Dodeney Taylor and Leo Lebowsky.</p>
   <p>The two arbitrators whom the Secretary of Labor sent from Washington to do as much as they could to help end the strike, were in conference yesterday with the lawyers of the manufacturers' association, with individual firms, and, later, with union officials. The bosses, however, refused to arbitrate. Attorney Lebowsky spoke in their name, and said that they would refuse to arbitrate just as long as the Union stuck to its demands. The two arbitrators, B. M. Marchman of Chicago and E. H. Donigan of Washington, were unable to accomplish anything.</p>
   <p>About twelve strikers were arrested yesterday for picketing.</p>
   <p>Joseph Weitzel of 3601 West 15th Street was severely beaten up by three men, when he was going to work in the shop of Lipson Brothers, 324 West Adams Street. He claims that he is a victim of the present strike.</p>
