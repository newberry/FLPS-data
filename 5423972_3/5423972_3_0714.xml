   <p>The conference which was called in Chicago by Jewish socialist and labor organizations opened yesterday morning in the West Side Auditorium, and closed about eight o'clock in the evening. Over one hundred delegates participated, mostly from the Chicago branches of the Workmen's Circle and from the Jewish branch of the Socialist Party. There were some delegates from a few locals of the Amalgamated Union, some from the Jewish bakery workers and a few from the provinces. There were also over a hundred visitors.</p>
   <p>The following resolutions were adopted.</p>
   <p>That the national Jewish labor committee should call a separate labor congress, to take place in New York at the time when the general Jewish congress in Philadelphia will be on the verge of adjournment.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0715.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>That Jewish workers should take no part whatever in the Jewish congress in Philadelphia.</p>
   <p>A counter resolution to participate in the general congress under certain conditions was, after a heated debate, voted down fifty-six to forty-seven.</p>
   <p>A resolution was also adopted, which demands autonomous national rights for Jews in all countries, as well as Palestine. A counter resolution, to demand a federative republic in Palestine with autonomous and economic rights for all national minorities of Palestine was, after a stormy debate, voted down by a large majority.</p>
   <p>A resolution was also adopted demanding the complete deliverance of Tom Mooney, and also a protest resolution against the terrible pogroms upon Jews in Poland.</p>
