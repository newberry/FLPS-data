   <p>All conjectures that the baker bosses would not renew their [union] agreement, thereby inviting trouble, were in vain. The bosses apparently have figured out that the whole thing wouldn't pay, and all have signed the contracts in accord with the previously secured working conditions.</p>
   <p>It was really interesting to see the bosses come in groups to the Palace Opera Rouse, 1145 Blue Island Avenue, where the settlement committee has been stationed for the last few days. None of them even questioned the clause concerning the helpers who were supposed to be the main source of conflict. It was believed that they (the bosses) would want to strike out the clause this year, which reads "The Union has the right to send an unemployed member to replace a regular worker for one day each week."</p>
   <p>The most important clauses of the renewed contracts are as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0345.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>1. The bosses shall employ only union members in good standing.</p>
   <p>2. Only workers sent by the employment office of the Union may work in the bakeries.</p>
   <p>3. No boss shall keep his employees in room or board, and shall not command them to do anything that is not relevant to their work.</p>
   <p>4. The working time consists of nine hours every day (including lunch time). The worker is not permitted to work more than six days a week, (in fact, no one works more than five days because one day is deducted for the unemployed, or the helpers who get paid by the workers themselves).</p>
   <p>5. The minimum weekly wage is: foremen, $26--second hands, $23--and third hands, $21.</p>
   <p>6. Helpers shall receive $4 a day. Foremen, spongers and oven hands $5 a day.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0346.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>7. Pay for all holidays except Passover.</p>
   <p>8. All work in production must be done by union men only.</p>
   <p>9. Union leaders may enter any shop at any time.</p>
   <p>10. Helpers sent by the union are to be placed if they are qualified.</p>
