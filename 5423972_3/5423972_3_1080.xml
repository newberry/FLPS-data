   <p>The Progressive Cigar Makers' Union have again proved successful in its strike. After a short strike of a week, the employers granted every demand of the union. The strikers won an increase in pay from ten to thirty per cent for all members, a closed shop, and sanitary conditions. These demands the employers granted after a few conferences with the representatives of the union. A few of the employers that had settled, changed their minds and went back on their agreement, one of them being Mr. Rais. The second shop was the Consumers Cigar Company and Piness' shop. These employers have already called the strike committee and have arranged for the immediate return of their workers.</p>
   <p>This victory of the Progressive Cigar Makers' Union, makes Chicago a real union city for the entire cigar trade. No one can hope to have a non-union shop in Chicago. The International controls the label shops and the Progressives control the Al shops.</p>
   <p>We congratulate the Progressive Cigar Makers' Union for procuring for the cigar makers a closed shop and other improved conditions. We hope that this aggressive union will remain loyal to the Progressive principles.</p>
