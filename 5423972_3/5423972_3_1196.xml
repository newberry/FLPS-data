   <p>Why every member of the Workmen's Circle shall become a member of the Credit bank.</p>
   <p>Every person knows when a member of the Workmen's Circle gets sick, he receives sick benefit, but what can a person do when he is in perfect health and in need of money for a short period and cannot find a place from which to get it. The answer is a credit union. When a business man is is need of money he can borrow it in a bank, but a laborer can not borrow money in a bank, a credit union is for the worker, what a bank is for a business man.</p>
   <p>It makes no difference for what purpose a man needs money as long as he needs it and hasn't got it, one has not the money to prepare with coal for the winter, he would be glad to find a place to borrow a few dollars, and pay it back in small weekly or monthly payments.</p>
   <p>A second man wants to buy a piano, but instead of buying a new piano on payments, prefers to buy a used one for cash and save half of the price; but he has not the amount needed in cash.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1197.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A Cloak presser, after losing his health and strength from pressing so many years and who cannot work any more - is in need of a little money to enter some small business where he can make a living.</p>
   <p>A worker wishes to be released from the landlord, who is continually raising his rent, and wants to buy a little home of his own; a cottage somewhere out of the city; but has not enough money to make the first down payment.</p>
   <p>In such cases, the worker can be helped a good deal through a credit union.</p>
   <p>In short a credit union is an organization whose purpose is to help its members with cash money in time of need, which help to do away with the usurers, loan sharks and loan societies.</p>
   <p>How to establish a credit union? Everybody buys a share and pays it off in small weekly or monthly payments. When one loans money from this credit union, he pays a small per cent interest, a part of this accumulated interest is laid aside in a separate fund called a guarantee fund. Whenever there is a loss it is covered with money taken from this guarantee fund, Another part of this interest is used to <pb facs="5423972_3_1198.jpg" n="3"/>cover expenses,- such as rent, stationery, books and other administrative expenses and the rest is profit which is paid out to the members from time to time, according to the number of shares they have bought.</p>
   <p>Every member has one vote regardless of the number of shares he has. The officers are elected at special meetings. The regular meetings is the place to pass and put into effect laws. That is how the Workmen's Circle credit union was established a year ago.</p>
