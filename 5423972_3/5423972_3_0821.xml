   <p>The New York Jewish newspaper, The Day, wonders why there was not one word mentioned in the New York "Ford-Ward" [Editor's note: Term applied by Courier to Forward because latter prints Henry Ford's ads] about the strike that has been going on against the Chicago "Ford-Ward". The Day will find it very amusing to learn that when the strike against the Chicago "Ford-Ward" was in full swing, when the yellow rag could not be seen on any newsstand, the Chicago "Ford-Ward" still maintained that the strike was not a strike but a conspiracy. However, when the strike ended with a defeat for the "Ford-Ward," the Bintel [term of derision applied by Courier to Forward] newspaper suddenly declared that the strike had been settled. How one can settle a strike that has never existed is a rather difficult question to answer, but nobody should question the ability of the Bintel boys to do the impossible. A Jewish newspaper that can accept an advertisement from Henry Ford and make a deal with Henry Ford can also settle a strike that has never existed.</p>
