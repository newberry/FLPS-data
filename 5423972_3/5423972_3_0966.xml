<title level="a">CIGAR MANUFACTURERS PLAN LOCKOUT; STRIKERS MAINTAIN THEIR COURAGE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Yesterday, there was considerable discussion within the ranks of the striking cigarmakers regarding the plan of the local manufacturers to join their obstinate New York brothers in the lockout against the strikers.</p>
   <p>These rumors gave the brave strikers new courage to continue the fight for a decent wage, until they have gained a victory. The crowded picket lines around the shops were the best proof that the cigarmakers did not fear any lockout threats.</p>
   <p>The strikers' enthusiasm seemed to be particularly strong at the mass meeting at Colonial Hall, 20 West Randolph Street. Emil Hobel, who returned yesterday from New York--he was sent there three months ago by Local 527 in the interests <pb facs="5423972_3_0967.jpg" n="2"/>of the Havana-American strikers--gave a vivid report of the strike situation there. He said that about 300 manufacturers, employing more than 1,000 workers, had settled with the union. The strike situation there is very encouraging.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hobel also said that one thousand girls, working in the Lewis Cigar Company, Trenton, New Jersey, had gone on strike Monday, in an effort to improve their working conditions. Of these one thousand striking girls, one-half are Negroes who are well-organized and very enthusiastic about the strike.</p>
   <p>The New York Cigar Manufacturers Association, as we have previously stated seems determined to break the union. But the unity of the strikers is so strong that the industry has already begun to feel a significant scarcity in cigars. The bosses are actually losing money, and naturally, they will finally be forced to yield. In closing, he told of the plans of the local bosses.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0968.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Today the strikers will again picket the shops and thus show the bosses their determination to carry on this strike until they have won a decisive victory.i</p>
