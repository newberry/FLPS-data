   <p>Cooperative Restaurant opens Today.</p>
   <p>Members, friends, and synpathizers of cooperative enterprises, who formerly ate at the Cooperative Restaurant on 12th St. and St. Louis Ave., will from today on, be able to eat at the Cooperative Restaurant in the new location, 3056 W. 12th St. corner Albany.</p>
   <p>Due to the hardships in fixing up the place we were unable to open on scheduled time. Today the restaurant will open for business, and all customers, shareholders and sympathizers are asked to come back to their own workers cooperative home.</p>
   <p>All efforts will be made that the cooperative spirit shall be the foundation of our undertaking. The banquet to celebrate the opening of the Cooperative Restaurant was postponed Saturday night, June 12th, at 8 P. M. Preparations are being made for a magnificent banquet. The price per plate will be $1.00 and it is expected that many of our members will gladly participate.</p>
