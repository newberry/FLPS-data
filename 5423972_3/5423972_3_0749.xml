   <p>The Amalgamated records a great victory in the Hart, Shaffner &amp; Marx shops. Late last night, an agreement was signed between the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union and Hart,Shaffner and Marx who employ between nine hundred and a thousand workers.</p>
   <p>The following points of agreement for a three year contract were accepted at a large mass meeting held in the Hod-Carriers Hall.</p>
   <p>1. A raise in salary of 10 per cent, which totals a million and a half a year.</p>
   <p>2. To shorten the working hours from fifty-two to forty-nine hours a week, and time and one-half for overtime.</p>
   <p>3. Minimum wage for beginners,- the third month, nine dollars per week for girls and twelve dollars a week for men.</p>
   <p>4. The raise in wages will, through a committee of the union, be distributed to those workers who earn less than the standard wage demanded by the union.</p>
   <p>These conditions were gained without a strike and the workers of Hart, Shaffner and Marx are proud of their union and the officials, who served them so honestly and devotedly.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0750.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is true we met with hardships in trying to reach the agreement, but after thorough explanations the representatives of the firm realized that the demands were logical, and they surrendered to the union.</p>
