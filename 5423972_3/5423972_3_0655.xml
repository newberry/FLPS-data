   <p>What the chicago Tailors are doing for the Striking Tailors of New York. by Morris Ziskind.</p>
   <p>To the great devotion and the willingness to sacrifice themselves displayed by the members of the Amalgamated for their New York brethren, there is one other factor in the organization which makes the picture of unity and solidarity whole and great. This is the institution known as the Shop Chairman Meeting, which is composed of all shop chairmen of all clothing factorise in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Each shop has a shop chairman who is elected by the employees of that particular shop and he becomes the representative of the employees in all matters which occur in the shop. The shop chairman is responsible for the observance of all union rules within the shop.</p>
   <p>At various times, meetings of all shop chairmen are held, and these meetings<pb facs="5423972_3_0656.jpg" n="2"/> discuss the most important problems facing the Amalgamated. One of these meetings will remain in the memories of every shop chairman and official of the Amalgamated in Chicago. This is the important meeting held in the large west Side Auditorium, when Sidney Hillman addressed the shop chairmen and executive officials regarding the New York strike.</p>
   <p>The gathering taught the observer that the Amalgamated of Chicago is a Rock of Gibraltar, and that it is deeply rooted in the hearts of the vanguard, those who execute the decisions formulated by the membership of the union. At this meeting, not much was said of the duties of the shop chairmen. The large membership of the Amalgamated grasps the importance of supporting the strike in New York and when it was decided by the Joint Board Executive Board at a large mass meeting, that each member should tax himself $20 to $30, the co-operation of the membership was assured.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0657.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Besides the $50,000 which the Joint Board gave from its treasury, the $10,000 from Local 39, the $10,000 from Cutters Local 61, and the smaller sums from other locals, the shop chairmen have brought about $100,000 from the tap which the membership had started.</p>
