   <p>The English Parliament has recently listened to words more becoming to America than to England. A labor representative pointed out that today there exist two kinds of measures for justice, namely, one for the wide masses and another for the wealthy and privileged. The speaker illustrated this by the present happenings in Ireland, where officers of the English army sided with the English lords in halting the passing of Ireland's independence, which was confirmed by His Majesty and the English people. These public-enemy officers are not penalized by the government; on the contrary, the latter will yield to every term demanded by the wealthy and aristocratic, even though by so doing, it may act contrary to the interest of the English masses.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1600.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The aristocrats figure out that if a strike is declared by workers, - for, a strike is the last means to which the masses resort when in dire need, - due to the former's ignorance of the people's needs and their obstinate desire to drive them to desperate acts, the whole district would be declared in a state of war and the very children of the workers would be sent out to suppress, with bayonets, the human pride, characteristic of their fathers and brothers.</p>
   <p>Should the workers' children, in military uniform, declare that they cannot wage war against their own flesh and blood; that they cannot kill those whom their human sentiments dictate to defend: should soldiers dare to speak like that, they would be then declared traitors to their "fatherland" and punished accordingly.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1601.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In France, the noted scholar Hervay was sentenced to a few years in prison for enlightening the soldiers on this condition. In England, the labor leader Tom Mann was imprisoned for six months for telling the English soldiers not to shoot at their striking brethren. Those who have kept an eye on the military despotism in Colorado and the arrest of the old gray labor leader Mother Jones, and those who still remember the countless instances of bloodshed among strikers in every state of the Union, to say nothing of the hanging of several labor leaders, can readily see that two kinds of justice exist in all parts of the world, i.e., one for the rich and another for the poor.</p>
   <p>The sooner the people become aware that a different degree of justice exists for them and that that degree is determined by those in power--the quicker will they seek to gain more power. And it will be only when <pb facs="5423972_3_1602.jpg" n="4"/>the people shall become powerful that the ancient Jewish commandment of "Thou shalt not have measures of two kinds" will come to pass.</p>
