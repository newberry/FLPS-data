   <p>Jewish citizens of Chicago, irrespective of the party to which they belong, will go as one man to the polls to vote in the coming elections for city and county officers. They will vote for the Jewish and non-Jewish candidates who deserve their support. The local chapter of the Ku Klux Klan has embarked upon a strong campaign against Jews and Catholics who are candidates for public offices. These hoodlums, under the guise of patriotism and Americanism, want to eliminate from public life every foreigner and American who does not subscribe to their policy. The Klan thus hopes to destroy them completely. They have already proved what they can do.</p>
   <p>The American Unity League is the reply to the organization which seeks to spread its criminal activity over the public and political life of this country. This league, to which many prominent citizens of all classes belong, seeks to stop the activity of the Klan, to call a halt to the spread of its poisonous propaganda, which undermines the existence of American institutions <pb facs="5423972_3_1418.jpg" n="2"/>and which sets citizens against citizens.</p>
   <p>The American Unity League appeals to you for your support. Do not refuse it. It is in your interests as Jews and as citizens.</p>
