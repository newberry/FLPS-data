   <p>The cloakmakers may congratulate themselves upon the settlement made yesterday with the cloak manufacturers of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Exactly four weeks ago yesterday the cloak makers left their shops, rejecting the demands of their bosses to go back to the piece work system, a 49 hour week and a cut in pay. The manufacturers had hoped that the cloak makers would surrender; but they fooled themselves, because the cloakmakers were preparing to strike as long as the bosses would necessitate. During the four weeks strike the manufacturers were convinced that while the strikers were sitting in their meeting halls listening to concerts, entertainments and speakers, there were no suits or cloaks being made and the thought that it would pay them much better to settle the strike to the satisfaction of the union rather than lose an entire season, led them to chose the most practical way. They settled with the union and signed the agreement for 5 months. The cloak makers may be proud of their organization. The settlement is the result of the solidarity of its members and the practical leadership of President Schlessinger and the local officials that were instrumental in the settlement. Tuesday the cloakmakers will return to work with the realization that their conditionsof work have not been touched and that their organization has become all the more powerful through this settlement.</p>
