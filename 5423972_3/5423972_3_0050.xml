   <p>The representatives of all the Jewish Trade Unions, at a meeting of the United Hebrew Trades, yesterday, determined to stand with the International Fur Workers Union and with the management of the Fur Local #45 in not permitting the Communists to break the Union.</p>
   <p>This decision was accepted after the Business Manager, Israelson, and Vice president, Ida Weinstein, gave a report on the action of the Communists of Local #45, who broke up a meeting when they failed to carry through their scheme which was to smuggle through the Communist delegate rejected by the United Hebrew Trades.</p>

   <p>When this question was transacted, it was expressly understood that Goldstein could not be a delegate and that the Union must elect another one. The left wingers agreed upon re-entering the United Hebrew Trades, knowing that another delegate was to be elected in place of Goldstein. However, at the election, the Communists raised a rumpus and wanted to elect Goldstein again.</p>
   <p>When Vice President Ida Weinstein wanted to take over the chair, because the President and Vice President had acted in a partial biassed manner on the question, a left winger blocked the platform. The meeting was broken up, thanks to the Communist Union leaders as a fight broke out between them.</p>

   <p>After listening to the report of the Furriers International and of Local #45, the delegates determined to stand with the International and with Local #45 against the Communist destroyers, who seek the opportunity to split the Furrier Local #45.</p>
