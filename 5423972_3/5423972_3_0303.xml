   <p>Due to the misrepresentation of the Jewish baker bosses of the real reason why we were compelled to walk out in a strike, we find it imperative to make the following statement to the great Jewish masses:</p>
   <p>We are not the truly guilty ones in this strike, worthy public; no worker wants to strike. The worker wants only to live, and even though he gets a few dollars a week more, it is no more than is needed to live on. You all know the fortunes which a worker makes. He works several years, becomes exhausted, loses his strength and then is thrown out in the street. Have you ever seen a boss lying ill in the County Hospital? Have you ever seen when death occurred that a boss should be buried in a charity cemetery? No! Certainly not!</p>
   <p>They have everything and we have nothing. And while we workers, desire only to live, to support ourselves and our families, they still have the <pb facs="5423972_3_0304.jpg" n="2"/>audacity to blacken our eyes with false accusations. They, who rob you as well as us, scream that we want to ruin them. Just take a look and see who ride in automobiles, the workers or the bosses? Who live in beautiful homes, the workers or the bosses? And from the other side: who lack the mere necessities of life, having no rest by day or night, we, or the bosses? Who never see their wives and children, we, or the bosses? Who become exhausted, crippled from hard work, we, the workers, or our bosses?</p>
   <p>You know the answer well. We are sure that you know it. And we go still further and say that the majority of our bosses know it too; that this majority of the bosses admits that our demands are just and are willing to settle with us. But there are two little fellows who have as much to do with the bakery trade as we have to do with diplomacy. These two, always nicely dressed little fellows, make a comfortable living by fooling the bosses, promising them the golden calf at your expense, at the expense of the great Jewish public.</p>
   <p>These two genuine vampires, one living in New York, the other in Chicago, <pb facs="5423972_3_0305.jpg" n="3"/>hold the bosses by the hands and tell them not to sign the agreement with our union. They know that as quickly as the bosses will begin to act, according to their own common sense, then they will lose their fat jobs and of what concern is the welfare of three hundred Jewish bakery workers and their families to them, as long, as they are able to ride in automobiles and smoke fine cigars. And do you know why the bosses listen to them? If you don't, we will tell you; they persuade the bosses to rob you, to give you poor bread, to short weigh your purchases of bread, and besides all that, to use the poorest flour in the manufacture of bread. This is their mission. This is their livelihood and they are smart enough to hide their mean conduct behind a mantle of would-be patriotism.</p>
   <p>But all of this is not enough for them. They approach the bosses now and say to them: you must not settle with the union. To settle with the union means that you will have to pay the workers a fair wage. Do not do it, break the union, and then you can compel the workers to work for the wage which you are willing to pay them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0306.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The bosses ask how this can be done. And the two little fellows reply: You bosses, don't give in to the union, but make it appear before the housewives, that you are pious; your answer to every demand of the union should be "arbitration." But we have nothing to arbitrate, said the bosses and the reply of the two little fellows followed: fools, that you are. This is only a pretext to fool the public and to enable you in a nice way to break the Hebrew Bakers Local!</p>
   <p>This is the truth. We demand a few dollars more added to our weekly wage. We leave it to you to say whether we are justified or not. Prices went up and naturally wages must go up too!</p>
   <p>We demand payment for five holidays through the year. Is it too much? Aren't human beings entitled to rest at least five days throughout the year?</p>
   <p>We demand the right of the union to help its unemployed members. Is this an injustice? Just imagine, the union man is willing to give one night's work to his unemployed brother and the union guarantees the bosses that <pb facs="5423972_3_0307.jpg" n="5"/>this man must be and is a capable worker. Is this wrong?</p>
   <p>And this is the point which the bosses are so reluctant accept, forcing us to strike and depriving you of the purchase of bread.</p>
   <p>It is up to you, worthy public, to decide, who is right? Don't you think that we are right, and if you do, then we beg of you to give us your support. Don't buy "scab" bread, and in this way, make the boss realize that the worker also has a right to live!</p>
   <p>With your support we will win our just and righteous struggle.</p>
