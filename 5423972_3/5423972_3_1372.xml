   <p>The first central body of a great international union to take a political position against the left element, who have attempted to seize control of the unions and transfer them into the hands of those who control the Communist Movement, is the Chicago Joint Board of the Cloak Makers' Union.</p>
   <p>The Joint Board, at a special meeting Tuesday evening, listened to the report of a committee that was appointed a few weeks ago, to sentence two officers of the Joint Board on the charge of belonging to an opposition union: The Trade Union Educational League.</p>
   <p>The committee submitted two reports: One report stated that the two officers are members of the League and are guilty of the charges which Meyer Pearlstein, the western district manager, preferred against them, and they must either withdraw from the Educational League or be expelled from the Union. The delegates discussed the report for several hours.</p>
   <p>The principal speaker against the convicted was Meyer Pearlstein. He showed that the activities of the Educational League are opposing the interests of the Union.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1373.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Pearlstein declared that the Educational League was organized by William Z. Foster at the command of the Communist International from Moscow. They were ordered to organize shop committees and clubs under false titles within the unions in order to seize control.</p>
   <p>After Pearlstein clarified the true character of the League, the Joint Board determined to expel the accused from the Cloakmakers' Union, if they would not resign from the Educational League within two weeks.</p>
   <p>This decision applies to all other members of the Cloakmakers' Union who belong to the Educational League.</p>
   <p>All members of the Cloakmakers' Locals must either belong to the Cloakmakers' Union or to the Educational League, because the Joint Board is of the opinion that the Trade Union Educational League is a dual organization, in opposition to the Cloakmakers' Union, and the Joint Board will not permit any disrupting elements in the International Ladies Garment Workers of America.</p>
