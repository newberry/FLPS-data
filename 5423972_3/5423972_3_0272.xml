   <p>Shoe repairers are preparing to strike for an 8 hour day.</p>
   <p>Saturday the 22nd, the shoe repairers union sent out to their bosses a demand, that beginning April 1st, they want an 8 hour working day. They are working 9 hours a day now.</p>
   <p>Some of the bosses are spreading a rumor that the Union is demanding an 8 hour day and Saturday a half day, but that is not true. The Union knows the circumstances of the trade are such, that one must work all day Saturday, so they only demand an 8 hour working day including Saturday. The Union hopes that the bosses actions will not lead to a strike, and that they will grant the demands of the Union, as this is all they ask. But, if the bosses do not grant the Union demands by March 31st, the Union is prepared to go out on strike the 1st of April.</p>
   <p>In case the strike should start, it is endorsed by the Federation of Jewish Unions, and the entire labor movement will give them whatever assistance will be necessary. It is up to the bosses now, they can either prevent, or have the strike.</p>
