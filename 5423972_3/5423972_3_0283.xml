   <p>The ladies should be the first to get the 44 hour week, but this time it is not ladies first, for things don't work out as fast as you say them. It so happened that the men of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of Chicago and other large cities have taken the first step. But the ladies will not be left lagging behind. They will also strive for shorter hours and better conditions.</p>
   <p>The enthusiasm over the victory won by the waist and dress workers of New York caused the waist, dress, kimono and white workers of our city to act through their local 100 to start a campaign organizing the trades and <pb facs="5423972_3_0284.jpg" n="2"/>demand a 44 hour week, raise in pay, and recognition of the union. This decision has the approval of Comrade Schlessinger, President of the International Ladies' Garment Workers, and the general executive of the International.</p>
   <p>Comrade Schlessinger wired the general organizer Comrade Hochman to start the campaign immediately, so that demands be granted.</p>
   <p>The needle trade of both ladies' and men's garments came to their assistance.</p>
   <p>Local 100 prepared for such a step. This has been going on for a few months, and now that the signal was given, nothing will be left undone that can help in winning the 44 hour week for all the women workers in the ladies' garment industry in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Most of the men who are working in this industry, mainly pressers and cutters <pb facs="5423972_3_0285.jpg" n="3"/>of waist, dress, and white goods, are now joining the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union and as it looks, it won't take long and they will win the same benefits that the New York organization won.</p>
