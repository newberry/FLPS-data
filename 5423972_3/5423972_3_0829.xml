<title level="a">CAPMAKER'S UNION DECLARE A STRIKE AT POLAKOFF AND BREMER</title>.
</bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Polakoff and Bremer, cap manufacturers, are in fear of their shop being unionized. Their shop is located at 557 Jackson Blvd., and they were both sitting and working, along with the other cap makers, when they overheard some of the workers talking among themselves about organizing a union. This was done, and they became good union men. As soon as Polakoff and Bremer heard that their workers had joined Local 5, they immediately locked out all their workers. The workers came to their union with their complaint and a strike was at once declared.</p>
   <p>The Cap-Maker's Union will carry on the strike against Polakoff and Bremer until an agreement with the union is signed. The Cap-Maker's Union is also conducting a strike at the former business agent, P. Mogeloff, who employs non-union capmakers, and is using the police for protection to combat the union.</p>
