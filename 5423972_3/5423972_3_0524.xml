   <p>What can be heard in the Chicago Joint Board of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers? by Morris Ziskind.</p>
   <p>The Joint Board of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers is the central organization of all city locals belonging to the Amalgamated. It not only has authority over the trade questions, but also caters to the cultural side of the organization as well as with everything concerning the Amalgamated Labor Movement.</p>
   <p>The Joint Board is, therefore, the barometer which measures the progress of this organization from various angles of the worker's activities. The Joint Board has conducted cultural work for the past three years. Lectures and concerts are given throughout the winter in the Ashland Auditorium.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the Joint Board, the board of directors reported that preparations were already made for the coming season. The Educational <pb facs="5423972_3_0525.jpg" n="2"/>Committee reported that the lectures in the Ashland Auditorium will begin November 3 to March 16, 1923, and will be arranged as follows: Debates, two lectures illustrated with stereopticon slides, four concerts with lectures and two concerts without lectures. Concerts and a series of lectures will also be sponsored on the North West Side and South Side. Such evenings will not conflict with the evenings in Ashland Auditorium.</p>
   <p>One of the tasks the Amalgamated has undertaken is raising a million dollar fund to operate clothing and textile factories, in partnership with the Soviet Government, the Russian-American Industrial Corporation, of which Sidney Hillman is president. The Chicago Joint Board withdrew $25,000 from its treasury and purchased shares in the corporation. Propaganda is now being spread among the locals on behalf of this organization. The work is administered slowly, due to the depressing conditions in the industry, although, <pb facs="5423972_3_0526.jpg" n="3"/>as Sam Levin, manager of the Chicago Joint Board, stated, several shops are cooperating splendidly and all the members determined to buy shares in the corporation.</p>
   <p>The Amalgamated Bank makes great success.</p>
   <p>"The Amalgamated Trust is a great success from all standpoints," said the president of the bank and the manager, Levin, the latter being a member of the board of directors. The number of depositors grows from day to day. The number demanding loans increase daily. One of the most encouraging aspects of the Amalgamated Bank is, that many large trade unions and the American Federation of Labor became depositors in the bank.</p>
   <p>Preparations are now being made to unite the Amalgamated Bank with all European banks. Mr. W. A. Thompson, chairman of the board of directors, together <pb facs="5423972_3_0527.jpg" n="4"/>with Sidney Hillman will make all necessary connections with the large European banks, so that money may be sent and exchanged and the transporting of passengers from Europe with the best service.</p>
   <p>The problem of unemployment and the new manager of the employment office. The Joint Board of the Amalgamated appointed a manager in the employment office, with the object of installing a system of dividing the jobs that come from small factoring and with the object of compiling a record of the number unemployed and the firms requesting work, and to introduce a scientific system for unemployment insurance in the clothing industry. Mr. B. M. Strauss, the new employment manager, has many years of experience as manager of employment bureaus in Canada and in America and he elaborated a system which will facilitate partial control of unemployment. Mr. Strauss is preparing necessary forms and records to make it easier and more convenient for the unemployed to register and obtain work, according to the alphabetical order of their registration. This will be of great benefit to the members of the industry.</p>
