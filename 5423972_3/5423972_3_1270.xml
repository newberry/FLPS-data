   <p>Without intelligent organization, the Workmen's Cooperative cannot be successful. It can not develop and perform its duties as an organization which must meet the economic problems of the present standard of living. As a Workman's society its duty is to perform cultural works and to prepare a technical apparatus for the future society, and the management of our entire economic life. The society must have members who should be acquainted with the principle of Workers' Cooperatives, with its history, and the methods of management in the present cooperative movement.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the Board of Directors of the Northwest Side Cooperative, it was decided to appoint an Educational and Press Committee whose duties would be to agitate and spread propaganda among the Jewish masses of Chicago; to arrange meetings, classes, and lectures on the history and the management of the Cooperative, and to organize campaigns for increased membership.</p>
   <p>A Committee of three was elected:</p>
   <p>J. Ziskind, L. Remis, and W. Chinen.</p>
   <p>A Charter and Constitution Committee was elected, whose duties are to enable the Cooperative to function immediately, to secure a charter from the State Government, and to draw up a final draft of our Constitution and By-Laws. The draft will be presented to the Board of Directors, and if accepted it will be submitted to the membership at a general meeting of the Society, for final approval.</p>
