  <body>
   <p>Chicagoans are walking. All means of transportation, streetcar and elevated, have stopped functioning. The workers are on strike. The dozen or two buses which run from the North Side to downtown are not of much help to the tens of thousands of people who have to go to the Loop every morning and return in the evening. The upper and middle classes have their automobiles and can get along without the streetcars or the elevated, but the poorer classes have either to use trucks or to walk. Neither alternative is pleasant.</p>
   <p>Nobody can foretell how long this strike is going to last because it is, in every way, an unusual strike. It broke out at a moment when the wave of strikes in America had reached its height. The miners are on strike and the end of their strike is not yet in sight. Hundreds of thousands of railroad workers are striking. Strikes are going on in many other big industries in America and the very air is full of strike. Both sides are stubborn and <pb n="2"/><gap unit="sheet" extent="1" reason="missing"/><pb facs="5423972_3_0859.jpg" n="3"/>upon any attempt by the traction barons to organize strikebreakers. A serious conflict will ensue and heads will fall. The government will have to intervene because, from a legal point of view, it has to protect the freedom to work. President Harding has declared that every man in America has a right to work, and that the government must protect that right. This means that the government will have to protect the scabs in case the strikers wish to prevent the strikebreakers from taking their jobs. This also means that violence will break out. Everybody, of course, understands that the government is always stronger than any group or any union in the state. The situation will not be a cheerful one if the government is drawn into the conflict.</p>
   <p>A strike--no matter from what point of view you consider it--is always to be regretted because it means damages and often ruin to tens of thousands of people and because it may lead to bloody conflicts in which victims, sometimes innocent victims, may fall.</p>
   <p>The representatives of both sides held long conferences before the strike was <pb facs="5423972_3_0860.jpg" n="4"/>called. They negotiated and discussed for days and nights, but could not reach any agreement. If it was difficult for them to reach an agreement before the strike broke out, when the workers were merely presenting demands and were not yet embittered, how much more difficult is it going to be to arrive at a settlement when both sides, particularly the workers, are in an embittered frame of mind? What guarantees have the traction magnates that later on they will succeed in coming to an understanding with the workers? It seems to us that the longer the strike lasts, the more bitter will become the feeling on both sides, and it is obvious that when both sides are embittered, it is difficult to arrive at a compromise.</p>
   <p>The traction magnates very likely had this in mind when they broke off the negotiations and let the workers go out on strike. One, therefore, must assume that the traction barons want to win more than a temporary victory. One must assume that they want to fight for "principles"--for the open shop. Unionism in America, however, is too strong today and it will not let itself be broken easily even if the government should be dragged into the struggle.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0861.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The public should, therefore, expect stormy days ahead.</p>
