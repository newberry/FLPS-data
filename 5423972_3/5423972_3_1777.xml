   <p>Each time a campaign begins for city, county, state, and national officers, we do our utmost to acquaint the Jewish public with the current issues and with the qualifications or faults of the various candidates who run for the various offices. The great masses call it politics. That would not be so bad, but the trouble is that many Jews, especially those who came from Russia where they were barred from participating in any political action and from electing delegates to represent them, are under the impression that the whole affair is an American matter, and that whoever is not involved in politics should not participate in elections.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1778.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is true that after the importance of each election has been pointed out, the Jewish public becomes more interested and more people learn that it is the business of every individual citizen to participate and to mix in it and this quite frequently enabled the Jewish public to demand many of their demands.. The Jewish public is credited with the high positions held by Congressman Sabbath, Julian W. Mack, Harry Fisher, and Judge Hugo Pam. However, interest in the personalities of candidates only as a result of continual hammering by this newspaper is far from understanding the rights of Jews, and is still farther from taking advantage of their rights.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1779.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We mention this now, because there remains but four weeks until the primaries for nomination of a Judge for the Superior Court. The Jewish public knows that each time an individual Jew advance a degree, the entire Jewish community is elevated. The Jews should show that they are good capable citizens, who can occupy the most honored positions, and there isn't a more honored position than the judgeship.</p>
   <p>The Jewish public is already aware of the fact that the well-known Russian-Jewish lawyer, Elijah N. Zolin, is a candidate for the Judge of the Superior Court on the Democratic ticket.....</p>
   <p>The Jewish public will not be playing politics by nominating and electing as judge, Mr. E. N. Zolin. His election is a necessity from the Jewish and the American standpoint.</p>
