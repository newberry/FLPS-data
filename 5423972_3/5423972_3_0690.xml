   <p>Junk workers want to live too. About two weeks ago local workers, occupied in sorting and packing rags, old iron, and other metals collected from the most filthy places [and later sold at a great profit], gathered to organize a union.</p>
   <p>What made them organize?</p>
   <p>About five thousand workers, two thousand Jews and the rest Poles and Lithuanians, are employed in the junk trade. Two-thirds of them are women, young and old, and elderly Jewish men who struggle to earn their own livelihood so that they would not have to rely upon their children. They work seventy or more hours per week for a mere starvation wage of twelve to fifteen dollars and endure miserable working conditions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0691.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Every boss and foreman considers himself a tzar; and his workmen are his subjects. The worker had no one to champion his rights nor to defend his interests. As a result he was driven to set up a union--one which would protect him and improve his working conditions.</p>
   <p>The forgotten junk workers, in whose fate the public is not interested--perhaps because their work is not so clean--are as justified as any of the other workers in demanding decent working conditions. Junk workers wish to live--to live like organized, free individuals. We are certain that they will achieve their purpose if all of them will join the newly established union.</p>
