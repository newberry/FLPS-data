   <p>The Problems and Aims of the Mother's League. - by Morris Ziskind.</p>
   <p>Never was the existence of the Mother's League, of working women, so important as it is today. When the Mother's League of Chicago was organized, It encountered many important and great tasks. The pioneers of the Mother's League understood that no element of modern society is so little organized, and so little prepared to defend its interests, as the Jewish working women.</p>
   <p>The Jewish working woman sacrifices her life to bringing up children, and does not have the smallest opportunity to affiliate herself with the basic ideas in the breeding of children. The working woman is tied down to house-work and the preparation of meals, and does not have the slightest opportunity to participate in the social and political life of city and country. The working women are, therefore, more backward in organizing than all other classes of women.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1206.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Jewish women are especially more backward in organizing their work than are the women of any other race.</p>
   <p>The principle problem, which the Mother's League ponders, is the education of the women. The League arranges lectures to give information on various important problems women should understand. Under modern conditions, with outstanding inventions, that make life for women in the home easier, it is possible for the women to lighten the burden of house-work, to a certain extent, and participate in the social and political life of city and country.</p>
   <p>The Mother's League has attempted to fulfil this task. Although its success will depend upon the educated and progressive working woman who already sees the necessity of being organized, of coming to the Mother's League, and joining as a member, that she may help carry on the educational and constructive programs.</p>
   <p>Every woman knows what it means to pay high rentals. Every woman feels the yoke of the high cost of living. The average working woman feels the heavy <pb facs="5423972_3_1207.jpg" n="3"/>burden from which she suffers, due to unemployment, due to high rentals, due to the many things of which she is in need and is unable to obtain. Women speak singularly, they are dissatisfied, they criticize the landlord, the butcher, the baker, the laundry collector, but, as an organized body of united working women, they do nothing. This is the main task of the Mother's League. It tries to unite all the working women in an organization, through which the scattered minds of the individual working women shall be united. Through instruction and education, they will become a force, a factor, in the social, economic, and political life of modern society.</p>
   <p>Every working woman should belong to such an organization. Every working woman must find time to attend the meetings of the Mother's League and acquaint herself with the important problems discussed. Then she will fight for her interests, as a woman, and as a member of the working class.</p>
