<title level="a">THE SWEATER STRIKE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The striking sweater workers, who yesterday entered the second week of their strike, met some brand-new guests while en route to picket the shop. The union officials explained that these were sluggers whom the bosses had sent against them. For example, it was definitely shown that the Sheiker Knitting Mills, 426 South Clinton Street, was surrounded by such individuals; other manufacturers, such as Mr. H. H. Newberger, owner of the Royal Knitting Mills, 846 West Jackson Boulevard, have themselves become "special officers".</p>
   <p>Adolph Laizerovitch, 1543 Sedgwick Street, a striker from the Royal, who was picketing this shop, was attacked by the owner, Mr. Newberger, who beat him up and had him arrested. Mr. Newberger later explained that the above-mentioned striker attacked him first.</p>
   <p>Some manufacturers began proceedings for an injunction. The strikers, however, <pb facs="5423972_3_0987.jpg" n="2"/>were not intimidated and clung fast to their demand for union recognition. A dispatch from the Amalgamated Textile Workers brought the news that a special representative was coming here to help carry on the strike.</p>
