   <p>Mr. Gertler, secretary and organizer of the F. J. U., gave a report last evening, at a meeting of the Federation of Jewish Unions, of the work accomplished by the union in the past six months.</p>
   <p>He spoke of the wonderful relief work that at the initiative of the Federation, was carried out among the Jewish unemployed of the city of Chicago, a work that has brought light, glory, and food to many unemployed homes, helping hundreds of unemployed get their sustenance when times were hard.</p>
   <p>He also mentioned the relief given by the Federation to the striking bakers, <pb facs="5423972_3_0043.jpg" n="2"/>expressing the hope that this strike will end victoriously.</p>
   <p>He reported on the educational campaign the Federation plan to carry out on the question of "Can the trade union movement solve the problem of unemployment?" This question will be discussed at all Jewish unions and Symposiums by lecturers of the Federation.</p>
   <p>The Federation is now organizing a union for the pocket-book makers, and so far it has succeeded in unionizing over one hundred persons engaged in this trade.</p>
   <p>We sincerely wish and hope that this will be a very strong union.</p>
   <p>At the meeting it was decided to celebrate the semi-annual anniversary <pb facs="5423972_3_0044.jpg" n="3"/>of the Federation with a banquet, to which all Jewish Workers of the city of Chicago will be invited., and in which reports of different unions will be read, enabling the delegates to get acquainted with one another, with their work and with other organizations.</p>
