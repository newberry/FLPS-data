   <p>The dispute between the master bakers and the Union, Local #237 was settled yesterday, at 2 p. m. The lock-out was rejected and the workers returned to the shops. The representatives of the Union and the employer's representatives resorted to lawyers about the clauses of a supplementary agreement which was accepted and undersigned by a committee of seven from Local #237 and a committee of seven from the Master Baker's Association.</p>
   <p>In accordance with the supplementary agreement every employer must adhere to the Union conditions. If it will be shown that the bosses break the agreement, in any way, the Union is entitled to withdraw the workers and the Union label from the Union boss.</p>
   <p>It was also decided that the Union and the Association shall select a committee, whose task shall be to adjust difficulties which might arise in the shops. In case the committees will be unable to agree, they have the right to admit an impartial person, who, together with the adjustment committee, shall hand out a decision.</p>
