   <p>Joint Board Ratifies Agreement with the Chicago Cloak Manufacturer's Association.</p>
   <p>At a conference, which was held between the Chicago Cloak and Suit Manufacturer's Association, the North West Cloak and Suit Manufacturer's Association and the Joint Board of the locals of the International Ladies Garment Worker's Unions, it was agreed upon to renew the old contract with the Joint Board and they adopted five of the modifications which were added to the old agreement.</p>
   <p>At the conference concerning the agreement, vice-president Hyman Schulman and Barney Fogel, labor manager of the Joint Board, represented the union. The Joint Board heard a report of the conference Friday evening and ratified the agreement with the modifications, excepting two clauses, which were referred to a sub-committee of the Joint Board. This committee will hold a conference in relation to the above mentioned clauses.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0522.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The modifications, which were added to the old agreement are important and signify a greater improvement for the workers in the cloak shops. The Following modifications were adopted and became a part of the agreement:</p>
   <p>The old agreement permitted manufacturers to work causing unemployment among the workers, especially the cutters. Several employers were, also, engaged in other branches of the trade. This clause is entirely changed in the agreement, specifying that the employers are not to cut, press, finish or operate.</p>
   <p>The second important modification is that the employer is not permitted to reorganize the shop. According to the old agreement, he could, upon his will, decrease a shop and reorganize a shop to the effect that he selected workers to remain on the job and discharged whomever he pleased. According to the new agreement, the workers themselves will determine among themselves, by a vote or any other method, who is to remain, after</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0523.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>a representative from the union and association will select them.</p>
   <p>Another important clause is that the boss is not to buy any finished clothing, as he formerly practiced. According to the new clause, the cloak manufacturers can not buy nor sell any products to contractors or manufacturers with whom the union declared a strike. In case it is revealed that the boss is guilty of this, he, then, breaks the agreement and the union will have a right to declare a strike.</p>
   <p>One of the most important clauses of the agreement with the modification is, that the bosses have recognized the words: "The prevailing minimum scale of wages." The local manufacturers thought that these words do not include the raise that the governor of New York determined for cloakmakers in February of 1920. According to the present agreement the bosses must pay the scale, together with the raise of 1920, because it was agreed upon with the union in 1920 that what the New York manufacturers grant the cloakers, goes for the Chicago cloakmakers also.</p>
