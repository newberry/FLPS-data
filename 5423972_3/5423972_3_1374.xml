   <p>The relief committee for the Polish "Bund" (Socialist Party), which was organized last week in Chicago by the delegate of the Polish "Bund" Comrade G. Silbert,is beginning to do inportant work in Chicago. Several plans elaborated by the executive committee are beginning to function successfully.</p>
   <p>The committee devised a program for all Bundists, who are now in Chicago, to help the Jewish organized working class in Poland extend its political activities. Special dues of $3 a year were assessed all members of the relief organization.</p>
   <p>The executive also worked out a plan of 10 cents capital tax, which will be distributed among all Jewish workers and friends of the working class in America. It is expected that by this capital tax a huge sum of money will be appropriated for the "Bund" in Poland.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1375.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It was, also determined to open a special campaign for the daily periodical "Peoples Paper," which is printed in Warsaw.</p>
   <p>The Chicago committee is of the opinion that there are hundreds of former Polish Party members and workers who are interested in knowing exactly what is happening in Poland. Therefore, the committe divided itself into a sub-committee in order to raise funds for the Peoples Paper.</p>
   <p>All former Bundists and sympathizers, whoare interested in helping the Bund in Poland can apply for membership at the newly established Relief Committee.</p>
   <p>Exact imformation concerning the committee can be obtained in the Workmen's Circle School, 1224 Albany Avenue.</p>
