   <p>At the last meeting of the United Hebrew Trades the Carpenters' Union, Local 504, and the Painters' Union, Local 521, submitted very interesting reports which proved that these two unions have made themselves more powerful than ever before by refusing to submit to the requests made by the Citizens' Committee, thereby adhering to their principles. The Painters' Union now has a membership of 15,000, and controls 99% of the workers and 65 of the 68 largest contractors in the trade.</p>
   <p>The district council organized the 3,600 painters that the Citizens' Committee had brought to work under the open-shop system. As a result the Painters' Union was made more powerful and wages were raised to a level higher than ever before. The Citizens' Committee did not accomplish what they had expected and are ashamed to admit their failure.</p>
   <p>The carpenters have 22,000 members; and despite all the efforts and dirty tactics <pb facs="5423972_3_0078.jpg" n="2"/>of the Citizens' Committee, they still remained strong and powerful.</p>
   <p>The Retail Clerks' Union will in the near future start an organization campaign. In Chicago there are over 100,000 clerks and workers that are not organized. Nevertheless, a union local of a few hundred members maintains union conditions. The delegate of the Retail Clerks' Union, Local 195, pointed out the necessity for all unions to help the small group of organized clerks carry on organizational work among the large number of unorganized clerks. The delegate appealed to the other delegates to take this question up at the meeting of their organizations and get their members interested in the plans of the Retail Clerks' Union. Moreover, he stated that merchandise should not be bought in those stores that employ nonunion clerks. The United Hebrew Trades determined that their executive board shall take up this question and find ways of helping the organization campaign of the Retail Clerks' Union, Local 195.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Waiters' Union was not recognized by restaurant owners serving non-Jewish customers. The waiters worked under very poor working conditions. Now <pb facs="5423972_3_0079.jpg" n="3"/>they find themselves in a better position. The Union has unionized a large number of restaurants.</p>
   <p>The Dressmakers' Union, Local 100, has increased its membership by over a thousand, and forty shops have been unionized since the campaign was begun by the Joint Board of the Cloakmakers' Union a few months ago.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the Jewish Butchers' Union, Local 590, it could be seen that the members were very much interested in the position of their organization and realized the importance of having a strong union.</p>
