<title level="a">HUGE STRIKE DEMONSTRATION</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Thousands of dressmakers, Jews and Gentiles, whites and negroes, organized and unorganized, left their shops and with inspiration marched to their meeting halls. The bosses posted injunctions on the doors of their shops, but remain with the injunctions and without workers. Police on horse back, motorcycles, and on foot besieged the strike district.</p>
   <p>The dressmakers strike started with a hugh demonstration by thousands of workers who left their shops at the specified time, marching with smiles on their faces to the hall, designated for them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0810.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Before eight o'clock in the morning, the strike committee were out distributing strike circulars among the workers, and the dressmakers were impatiently waiting from the moment specified by the strike committee to stop their work and leave the premises.</p>
   <p>The organized cloakmakers started leaving their places a half hour before the dressmakers, whose specified time to walk out was at ten-thirty, at which time Market St., from Van Buren to Madison St., was crowded with workers of the ladies' garment industry.</p>
   <p>The strike brought the entire dress industry in Chicago to a standstill. The shops at the present are idling.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0811.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Observing the huge crowd marching through the streets after leaving their shops, you could see workers of various nationalities, Jews and Gentiles, young and old, black and white, union workers and non union workers, marching together.</p>
   <p>It was too bad for those dress manufacturers who depended on the injunctions and the police to keep their workers from striking.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ribak, of 237 Market St., who has had injunctions so many times that he can read them from memory, posted copies of his injunction at the entrance of his workshop, thinking it would help keep his workers from walking out, but to his sorrow all the cutters and <pb facs="5423972_3_0812.jpg" n="4"/>pressers left their work at the specified time and went on strike; a little later all the girls, Gentiles, left their work and went to 20 Randolph Street to enlist as members of the union.</p>
   <p>Other bosses were prepared with police, and Market Street, looked like a large police station. A patrol wagon came loaded with police, also a mob of police on horseback and a score on motor cycle. The downtown squad also came to the striking district. The strikers cheerfully and with smiling faces, good naturedly left their work in good order; then left Market Street, and, together with the thousands of cloakmakers, marched to the various halls where massmeetings were held.</p>
   <p>The halls at 180 Washington Street were in a short time filled to capacity. The chair-ladies and committees organized the workers of various shops.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0813.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The workers of each shop elected a shop chairman from among their own group to take charge of the workers, and also appointed pickets.</p>
   <p>Vice president Pearlstein called the meeting to order and addressed the strikers, telling them of the position the bosses have taken when demands were laid before them. They refused to grant any demands mentioned in the new agreement, and are the ones to blame for the workers' going on strike. He assured the strikers that through their unity and activities towards this strike, they will in a very short time win their just demands.</p>
   <p>Many representatives of the Chicago Federation of Labor assured the strikers that if the entire dress industry is organized, they cannot fail.</p>
