   <p>Labor Tactics Change. (Editorial).</p>
   <p>Labor tactics and labor organizations are at present undergoing revolutionary changes. This seems to be in accord with the general changes in the social and political life of America. Every observer can readily see these changes taking place. What are the changes labor organizations are undergoing and why do workers join trade unions? We believe that one word "fight" answers the whole question. Labor is preparing to fight and they are ready to fight their employers to get better conditions, better personnel management, and better pay. Through this new spirit the employers are already being forced to grant many concessions and improvements.</p>
   <p>This fight between Capital and Labor which is so often apparent in our own land, invoked the interest of an indirectly affected third party, the people. This third party expresses its interest and its dissatisfaction in various forms. It may be an open protest, it may be new laws, or it may be the successful or <pb facs="5423972_3_0451.jpg" n="2"/>unsuccessful sponsoring of new laws. Capital, on seeing this sentiment of the third party, slowly but surely begins to make concessions, sometimes, before labor demands them.</p>
   <p>The manufacturers of Illinois now send representatives and lobbyists to Springfield to see to it that the legislature enacts proper workmen protection laws. The Harvester Company has already introduced new methods in labor management and personnel, although such innovations are as yet in the discussion stage in the legislature at Springfield. The Steel Trust, and many railroads are now raising wages and bettering working conditions in anticipation of worker's dissatisfaction with existing arrangements.</p>
   <p>Certain industries are planning a cooperative plan between workers and employers whereby employees receive a share in the division of profits. We could point out numerous cases where Capital is becoming social minded and is doing much to avoid conflict.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0452.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Naturally, we see in this only the beginning in new social development. There still exists much bitterness between Capital and Labor, but we feel that there must exist some bitterness in the development of a new social structure.</p>
   <p>Just what this new social structure will be, what conflicts may be had in its attainment, and how it might affect the Jew, is as yet speculative. However, we are sure to see new Trade Unions in America, with new demands and new battle lines, and moreover with new and varied labor tactics.</p>
