   <p>We think that we express the opinion of at least ninety per cent of the clothing workers when we say that the tailors will not strike.</p>
   <p>The wage scale of the clothing workers is so small that it is impossible for a tailor to save anything. Even in the height of the season a tailor is unable to put in full time due to the sluggishness in industry. People, who are familiar with the activities of the charity institutions know that the tailors, who over-work themselves in season, must apply for charity for many weeks during the year.</p>
   <p>Strikes, among these workers, practically mean that they imperil the welfare of their wives and children, and it is, therefore, no wonder why these unfortunate workers, who have given up all hope of improving their lot thank the Lord when they are working and forget about the slack season.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1137.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The large clothing manufacturers, who are united in the Association of Clothing Manufacturers, are aware of this. This fact - the workers' weakness - is their best weapon. It was not the strength of the Association that brought about the defeat of the last tailors' strike in Chicago - it was the weakness of the workers.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the Association will avoid further conflicts when they will learn that the workers are well organized enough to fight them. It is mistaken to think that the Manufacturers' Association fights for principles. In truth it is a pure business affair, a matter of dollars and cents, and when the Association will learn that a strike is not profitable to them, it will certainly grant the demands to the workers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1138.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The conditions are now more favorable for the workers than for the employers. The recent white slavery investigation aroused public opinion against the tactics and conduct of the large employer. If a clothing strike breaks out, it will inevitably call for an investigation which will reveal things that the employers will want to keep under cover; this fact alone will make the employers dodge a strike.</p>
   <p>The main thing that the large manufacturers should know is that the workers have determined to unite; they should know that the clothing workers are organized under the leadership of men who are devoted, body and soul, to the interests of the workers; the manufacturers should know that in back of these leaders there is an industrial army of 50,000 waiting for the signal.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1139.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The clothing manufacturers will not want to resist such an organized army. And therefore, in our opinion, there is but one panacea for strikes, and that is that the workers should stop discussion, stop squabbling, and step into the respective unions to which they belong; not merely to pay dues but also to attend the meetings in the various halls. Let each meeting be a demonstration for unity and devotion. Let each meeting demonstrate enthusiasm. Every worker should learn that he has nothing to lose. They should be informed that the doors of charity will never close. They should be informed that behind them stands the good-will of every right thinking person. This should inspire them so that their leaders, who have recently proved that they can be relied upon, may place the proper demands and settle without a strike.</p>
