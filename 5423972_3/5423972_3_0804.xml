   <p>Morris Zigman, president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, will arrive in Chicago today to help lead the strike of the dressmakers. Both sides [manufacturers and strikers] declared that they would fight to the end.</p>
   <p>Leo S. Lebowsky, attorney for the manufacturers, declared yesterday that work is going on as usual in many places and that many union workers are returning to work.</p>
   <p>Union headquarters announced that on Saturday, fifteen of the largest manufacturers settled with the union, and agreed to all the union demands.</p>
   <p>Seven girl pickets were arrested on Saturday on South Market Street and Adams Street. The arrested are: Charlotte Malinowsky, Eleanor Soglowsky, Vera Dobrow, Bessie Koglin, Sophia Martin, Yetta Kessler, and Minnie Sefarinin. The charge <pb facs="5423972_3_0805.jpg" n="2"/>against the girls was disorderly conduct. Judge Trude freed them under four hundred dollars bonds each.</p>
   <p>The twenty girls, who were arrested Friday evening, were also freed under four hundred dollars bonds each.</p>
   <p>Fannie Bot, 2040 Humboldt Boulevard, was seriously beaten up Saturday afternoon by a group of strikers, when she entered a car.</p>
   <p>Martha Geist, a picket, complained that the police treat the strikers brutally and arrest pickets without any cause.</p>
   <p>Meyer Perlstein, leader of the strike, speaking yesterday before the American Federation of Labor, declared that the manufacturers are using a band of sluggers to break the strike.</p>
   <p>Lebowsky, the representative of the manufacturers, denied Perlstein's accusation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0806.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A big picket demonstration of the striking dressmakers has been arranged for this morning.</p>
