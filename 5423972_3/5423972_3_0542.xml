   <p>The Amalgamated is starting to organize a corporation to build factories in Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>The readers know that the Amalgamated Clothing Workers convention has approved Sidney Hillman's plan, to organize factories in Soviet Russia in partnership with the government. President Hillman brought that plan with the signature of Lenin and his own signature on a contract for such a corporation.</p>
   <p>The general office of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers declared in a statement that the organization agreed to $60,000 as an investment in that corporation, which is organized to sell, as a start a million dollar shares. The money created through the sales of shares will be used to purchase materials and supplies to increase the production of the Russian clothing factories. All the people who are interested in the development of Soviet Russia, are urged to subscribe for shares.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0543.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This great enterprise will be administrated by the Supreme Council of National Economy of the Soviet government, incorporated with the American Corporation. A central committee will have the supervision of the general management, and the Soviet government will transfer, to the central committee the ownership and the factories of Moscow and Petrograd together with the raw materials. The government assures the first orders, for the factories, so there shall be steady work. These orders will be for the government employes and other workers.</p>
   <p>According to the statement of the Amalgamated officials, no plans are being made to send workers from America. Hillman declared yesterday that Russia has enough workers to make clothing. Seven-thousand are now working in the factories that are included in the concessions.</p>
   <p>The stock in the corporation will be sold at $10.00 a share and it will be prohibited from gaining control of this corporation. Committees of <pb facs="5423972_3_0544.jpg" n="3"/>organized labor are being organized all over the country, and mass meetings will be held in the interests of this big enterprise.</p>
