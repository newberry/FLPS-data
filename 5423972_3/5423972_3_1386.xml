   <p>All of us still remember the time when all troubles that befell this country, and even all individual mishaps, were ascribed to the Germans. The Germans were guilty of everything. If a strike occurred, it was surely the work of the Kaiser's spies; if someone voiced his opinion, it was surely that he spoke according to instructions from Berlin; if a fire broke out in some factory or some other casualty occurred, it was surely the work of German spies; even if farmer Jones had suffered the loss of a cow under mysterious circumstances, it was ascribed to German spies who were everywhere and had a hand in everything.</p>
   <p>The German bogeyman served a good purpose during the War. On the one hand, it helped bolster up the war spirit among the masses, who were really frightened by it, and, on the other hand, it aided and abetted several profiteers <pb facs="5423972_3_1387.jpg" n="2"/>to catch fish in muddy waters without permitting the slightest protest against their acts. If protests were raised, the demonstrators were immediately branded as "German agents" and that silenced everything.</p>
   <p>The German bogeyman has finally disappeared. The American people can no longer be frightened by "German propaganda", although some would like to continue that game. But no one takes them seriously. The American people fully realize now that most of the horrible stories about the activities of German agents, which were spread during the War, were purely fabricated by self-interested persons. The American people fully realize now that not every American radical or pacifist was on the Kaiser's pay roll, and they can no longer be taken for "suckers".</p>
   <p>But the "practical advantages" of a bogeyman for the people were so clearly "demonstrated" during the war, that we can no longer do without it. The German bogeyman disappeared and another had to be found in its place, and it was found -- the red bogeyman.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1388.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Instead of "German agents" we now have Soviet agents." All internal troubles which were formerly ascribed to the Germans are now being ascribed to the Soviet agents who, according to assertions from "one hundred per centers," are executing orders from Moscow everywhere.</p>
   <p>The red bogeyman serves a special purpose to the captains of industry in their struggle against labor unions, for it is very easy to ascribe all labor troubles to the intrigues of Moscow, and labor leaders, who take a firm position against the establishment of an open shop, are decried as Bolsheviks who are a menace to the existence of the American government.</p>
   <p>The red bogeyman is also instrumental to the reactionaries and the militarists, who seek to suppress every free thought and who wish that the Americans be armed from head to foot, according to the plan of the "peace loving" military powers of Europe. Whoever dares to protest against this is a Lenin agent and deserves to be annihilated.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1389.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>If there are a group of men and women who demand the acquittal of political prisoners and some picket the White House so as to attract President Harding's attention to their demand, the American Defense Society, an organization of reactionaries and militarists, come forth with a statement in which it is declared that the Society has "reliable" information that the movement for the acquittal of political prisoners is conducted by Moscow and that the persons who picket the White House are representatives of the Communist Party. So naturally, the political prisoners must not be freed because that would constitute a "menace" to the country.</p>
   <p>Attempts are being made to threaten the American people with the red bogeyman just as they had been frightened by the German bogeyman, and for practically the same purposes.</p>
   <p>The red bogeyman cannot, however, drive the masses to the hysteria of the German bogeyman. There no longer exists a war-time during which common sense was deafened and every absurdity had become a current custom. But the red <pb facs="5423972_3_1390.jpg" n="5"/>bogeyman has the characteristic of a superficial probability and can be aptly used for a certain time, until the eyes of the American people will be opened to see that they are again being taken for suckers. The one hundred per centers will then have to create another bogeyman.</p>
