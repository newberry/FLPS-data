   <p>Slowly we will get back on our feet again. The standstill of our Socialist movement is now a thing of the past. For a long time, the active members who remained loyal to the party carried on various arguments and discussions with those who had broken away, in order to convince them of their wrong step, but they have at last abandoned this futile attempt and will devote their time to a more useful and practical task. There is no doubt that it will not task long before this sort of activity will bring us great results.</p>
   <p>At the last joint meeting of the three Jewish Socialists branches of Chicago, where many different plans were proposed for socialistic work, the loyal members manifested their willingness to get to work, and work hard for the cause of the party.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1425.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Every one to a man has agreed that the time of wrangling and quarreling should be forgotten. We must by all means stop bothering with those who deserted us. Let them sober up in their own natural manner. Among the present comrades there are a few who admitted that for a time they were a little depressed over the result of the split, and that they had many heartaches thinking that the deserters were enjoying lots of lively activities while everything was quiet by us. But after summarizing the daily occurrences in the deserters' camps, we find that their activities are not up to par, that their enthusiasm has left them, and that everything seems rather quiet among them. The earnest and loyal members of the Socialist party have started to take inventory of their own activities. They have decided to let by-gones be by-gones. The time they lost in many hours of discussion, and the energy wasted with the deserters, let that be forgotten.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1426.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But what is to be done now? There is lots and lots of work to be done. There are many important problems before us for consideration which the Socialist party must figure out in order to stand by its promises. For example, sometime in the near future a very important conference is to be held here in Chicago by the representatives of labor, for the purpose of considering a possible political labor party.</p>
   <p>The Socialist party was invited to this conference. There is no question that this party (labor party) will exact a clear and definite stand from the Socialist party as to its political problems.</p>
   <p>It is therefore, very important that all parties concerned get together on any definite stand which the new party may decide upon.</p>
   <p>A question of this sort should be considered also by those Jewish labor organizations which are more or less interested in matters of this nature.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1427.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>If not the members of the Socialist party, who else then will look after this work?</p>
   <p>The City Central Committee of the Socialist branches of the Federation has also accepted this question for consideration at the first meeting of the open forum.</p>
