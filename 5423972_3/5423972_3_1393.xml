   <p>The Italians of America, or at least a number of them, have organized an American branch of the Fascisti here. In a sense, it is but natural that they do this, for their interests with their old home must incline them to share in some measure, an interest in the fate of the movements, political, social, or otherwise, that are refected by the times in their native country. Yet what can the use of an organization of Fascists be in America, if it is not political in its intent; what can the purpose of the Fascists be in this country unless it be one that directs itself to ends subversive of American ideals? The Fasicist black shirts are the representatives of an extreme monarchical order of government, which has no parallel in this country. Its ideals are inconsistent with the progress of liberalism, either in the matter of government or of thought, and it is merely the hypocrisy of our journals of opinion that has prevented them from exposing the reactionary character of this form of government. The Fascist organization throughout <pb facs="5423972_3_1394.jpg" n="2"/>Europe spells reaction. It is a sinister move that Italian liberals should not countenance in this country.</p>
