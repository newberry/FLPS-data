   <p>The meeting of the co-operative conference, which was held last Sunday in Workers Circle Lyceum, has taken an important step in the work for cooperation.</p>
   <p>The Central Committee of the conference recommended the following :</p>
   <p>1. The conference should elect a committee that shall be united with the Central Committees of the existing cooperative society. They should manage the co-operative undertakings which are in existence and are to open new co-operative enterprises.</p>
   <p>2. The conference should decide to open a co-operative grocery store on the West Side.</p>
   <p>3. The conference should start a campaign for shares. The delegates discussed the recommendations and with a small exception, decided on the following:</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1218.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>To elect a board of directors of seven, who together with six members of the co-operative societies, should be the administrators of all co-operative enterprises.</p>
   <p>The conference decided to instruct the new administration board, to discuss at its first meeting, the question of opening a store on the West Side. The report which the delegates of the Workmen's Circle branches given showed that many branches had members who belong to unions. These members pay a dollar to their union for co-operation, and they think that they should not have to give another dollar to the branch.</p>
   <p>The delegates accepted the decision that Workmen's Circle branches should be able to join the conference, when they buy two shares for the branch, and secure voluntary contributions of a dollar each and think those who give a dollar through a union, shall not give any more.</p>
