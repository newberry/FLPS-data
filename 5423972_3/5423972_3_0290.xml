   <p>As it seems, the Progressive Cigarmakers' Union, Local 527, International Cigarmakers' Union, was born in a fighting mood. From the first day it has had no rest, always finds itself in a fighting mood, and must exert its energy to combat external and internal enemies.</p>
   <p>It is natural that existence under such conditions has revolutionized their souls, and has developed a stubbornness which is being expressed in self-sacrifice, solidarity, and devotion.</p>
   <p>From the beginning of its existence, the Union led a fight against the conditions then prevailing in the trade. Even without the assistance of <pb facs="5423972_3_0291.jpg" n="2"/>the socalled International, it organized, through its own efforts, the union of all the small cigar workers, and elevated them to the status of a selfrespecting influential union organization.</p>
   <p>Then, the Progressive Cigarmakers' Union was forced to differ with their brother workers of the International, who not only did not help in the task of organizing them, but also hindered, persecuted, and blackmailed them, and even went so far as to whitewash scabbing against them.</p>
   <p>During all this time the Progressive Union stood watch, and with rare self-sacrifice performed the task of building a strong union and of revolutionizing the trade, directing constant struggles with the manufacturers, who always exerted their power to break the Union. The Progressive Union, at the same time, had to defend itself against the International.</p>
   <p>The International, at last, was compelled to take in the Progressives as <pb facs="5423972_3_0292.jpg" n="3"/>a local union but no pleasure was derived from it, because they were discriminated against by the International. They were placed in a separate class, which was especially created for them by the International. They were not given the same status as other workers, and were robbed of the most elementary rights possessed by union members. They cannot participate in the Union's transactions, cannot vote on any questions and resolutions, have no voice in the nominating and electing of officials, and in general are considered as strangers and stepchildren.</p>
   <p>The Progressive has recently begun a fight for equal rights in the Union and the Joint Advisory Board, but the reactionary forces of the International were again the victors. The appeal to justice and logic is of no avail. This is what they want and the way they act.</p>
   <p>The question then is, why does the Progressive remain in the International?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0293.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It seems that with the International's seal they haven't lost an iota of their conscience and pride; then why be humiliated, insulted, and persecuted? Is it because no cigars are produced by their human labor? Do they not inhale the same bad tobacco air? Is there any difference in the profit of the cigar manufacturers according to the method of manufacture used? Then, why should the Progressive member be stamped as a lower type of man in a union which should have the principles of unity, equality, and justice?</p>
   <p>The Progressive is strongly organized, it almost controls the entire trade, and yet in no instance are they being assisted by the International. Then the question arises, why does the Progressive remain there? On the contrary, as progressive human beings, as class-conscious and revolutionary workers, they should start a fight against such reactionary and unjust methods in the conduct of the International.</p>
   <p>The Progressive, receiving only a small part of their payments to administer <pb facs="5423972_3_0294.jpg" n="5"/>their union interests, are in need of a substantial sum for the support of a permanent office and secretary. As a part of the Jewish labor movement participating in all works, members have always been obliged to pay a special tax of ten per cent from their wages to the Union.</p>
   <p>This system was a great burden upon the members, and after much discussion a plan was adopted whereby a regular assessment of fifteen cents shall be used exclusively for local matters. The Union, at present, has a deficit of $2,700, which was paid out for local strike and sick benefit. This deficit must be met, and as it is necessary to always have ready cash on hand, it was resolved to introduce this fifteen cent local assessment.</p>
   <p>It is to be hoped that the members of the Progressive, who are so conscious of the necessity for a union and have sacrificed so much for its existence, will willingly contribute the designated amount for the upkeep and growth of the Union.</p>
