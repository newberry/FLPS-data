<title level="a">CHICAGO CITIZENS! VOTE TODAY FOR ALDERMAN IN YOUR WARD</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Today is election day. In each of the thirty-five wards of the city, an alderman is to be elected. Today is the first election under the nonpartisan system, and if the great mass of voters will go to the polls to vote, it will save the city a large sum of money, and will make it unnecessary to hold a second election.</p>
   <p>Any candidate receiving a majority of all the votes cast in his ward, will be declared elected. In a ward where no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, the two candidates receiving the largest number of votes will have a runoff against each other on April 6.</p>
   <p>In only ten wards of the city is there no opposition, and the candidate in each of these wards is assured, therefore, of today's election. Women, as well as men, may vote in the aldermanic elections today.</p>
   <p>The polls will be open from 6 A. M. to 4 P. M. The best time to vote is before <pb facs="5423972_3_1742.jpg" n="2"/>going to work, or to one's place of business. Irrespective of party affiliation, you ask for a ballot from the election officials and vote for the most suitable candidate.</p>
   <p>Don't forget to vote for the following candidates: James McNichols, for alderman of the Tenth Ward; Oscar H. Olsen, for alderman of the Twelfth Ward; Maurice Cavanaugh, for alderman of the Eighteenth Ward; John Toman, for alderman of the Thirty-fourth Ward.</p>
   <p>The above-mentioned gentlemen have all proven to be capable public officials. They are at present members of the City Council, where they have made a brilliant record for themselves and the city. Henry Sonnenschein is also a person of great ability who deserves your support.</p>
