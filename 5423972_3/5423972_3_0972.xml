   <p>Abraham Levin, nineteen years old, one of the strikers from the United Cigar Stores, lies in the County Hospital. He was wounded by two bullets when he attempted to escape from two detectives, who had arrested him and three other strikers on the charge of having broken the show windows in seventeen company stores.</p>
   <p>The police state that Levin confessed, at the hospital, to the window-breaking and also gave the names of the other accomplices, who are Isadore Goldstein, 3903 West 18th Street, Charles Sharkin, 1421 South Ridge Avenue, and Raymond Kozlovski, 3445 Diversey Boulevard. Levin, Goldstein and Kozlovski were arrested by the detectives as they were leaving the headquarters of the Retail Clerks Union, 166 West Washington Street. The detectives said that Levin had escaped at Randolph and Wells Streets, had run north on Wells Street, and <pb facs="5423972_3_0973.jpg" n="2"/>had turned into an alley. The detectives followed, shot twice into the air, and then sent two bullets into Levin's leg. Both bullets struck the hips.</p>
   <p>Sharkin was arrested at the Chicago Federation of Labor headquarters.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the Federation would not permit the detectives to make the arrest. The detectives phoned Chief of Police Garrity who said,"Do your duty."</p>
