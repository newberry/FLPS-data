   <p>The Jewish labor movement has, in the course of the past week, grown richer; a few newly organized unions have augmented the ranks of the organized working class.</p>
   <p>The butchers, who have practically never been organized, have organized a union. The capmakers organized a separate local for trimmers and lining makers. The glove makers also organized a special union for the canvas glove workers, whose union will be separate from the leather glove workers, although in certain organizational matters, they will work together.</p>
   <p>This creation of new units in the trade union movement is the best evidence of a new spirit in the field of Jewish labor. We can expect a huge labor <pb facs="5423972_3_0739.jpg" n="2"/>movement in Chicago in the near future. That there are ample grounds for this belief can be seen in the activity now going on among the smaller, but strong unions of the bakery drivers, the shoe repairmen, the wood turners, the mattress makers, and the others who are becoming very active.</p>
   <p>Yes, the Chicago Jewish labor movement is growing and developing rapidly. If there are enough intelligent and energetic workers, then it is certain that the local [labor] movement will be able to compare [very favorably] in the near future, with the labor movements in other large cities of America.</p>
   <p>One can hardly understand how the local [Jewish] butchers could live, until now, under such horrible and unbearable working conditions. Most of the butchers, who work eighteen to twenty hours a day, receive eight dollars per week. There are some who earn ten or twelve dollars a week. But it is a fact <pb facs="5423972_3_0740.jpg" n="3"/>that most of them--and many of them are married--simply go hungry. Finally, they decided that only a union could help them to improve their conditions. With the aid of Mr. J. Etkin, they organized a union last week.</p>
   <p>This Friday evening, at 3058 West Twelfth Street, the second meeting of the newly organized butchers' union will be held. All butchers should attend, and should join this organization.</p>
   <p>Shoe Repairmen Prepare for Struggle</p>
   <p>About two months ago the local shoe repairmen organized a union and began to think seriously about ways to improve their working conditions. The organization immediately gained the confidence of all the workers [in the trade], and it did not take long before the union had a membership of about <pb facs="5423972_3_0741.jpg" n="4"/>three hundred.</p>
   <p>Conditions, however, became worse from day to day. The union then decided to demand of the bosses certain improvements, and if the latter would not yield, the workers would declare a general strike.</p>
   <p>The shoe repairmen know now, and are convinced that if they wait for justice from the bosses, they will have to wait until doomsday. Consequently, they drew up their demands at their last meeting, and they will present them to the bosses in the near future. The workers' principal demand is for shorter hours, i. e., fifty-four hours a week, which is certainly a reasonable demand. It is to be hoped that the bosses will see the justice of this demand, and will grant it without forcing the workers to call a strike.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0742.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>But the workers want to make certain that the strike--if it is called--will be completely successful. The union has, therefore, decided to make all the necessary preparations for a strike. All workers are requested to attend the meeting which will be held this Sunday in Orkin's Hall on Maxwell Street, to listen to a report on the details concerning the strike.</p>
   <p>The Camp of the Cloakmakers</p>
   <p>At its last meeting, the Cloakmakers Joint Board decided to permit all finishers, operators, and pressers to work the Sunday (October 1) that falls between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur. It was understood that this does not include the cutters. They are not to work on that Sunday, or any Sunday, under any circumstances. At the same time, it was also decided that no <pb facs="5423972_3_0743.jpg" n="6"/>buttons will be given out to members unless their dues are paid up to last month.</p>
