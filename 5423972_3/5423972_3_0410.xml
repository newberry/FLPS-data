   <p>Many organizations of the different sections are making preparations and arrangements for lectures, readings, and entertainment for the coming winter season. We believe it most important to interest the Jewish trade unions in these activities.</p>
   <p>It is simple to work out a plan whereby all the Jewish unions will work together, hand-in-hand and benefit by their efforts. If possible, it is best that the United Jewish Alliance should accomplish this. It is really very simple. You arrange a series of lectures, about ten.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0411.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Naturally these will pertain to trade unions and workmen's problems. A hall may be rented, say, for every other week on Sunday, for a dinner or any other occasion. Small cards are printed stating the subject, the lecturer, the time and place. The work needed in this instant is rather easy, we think, in view of the huge success gained.</p>
   <p>No one will deny the importance of explaining to Jewish workers the various labor problems and trade unionisms.</p>
   <p>There is an uncertainty among the Jewish workers, giving rise to many questions for which it is important and necessary that they have a clear and positive conception even should we disregard other evils existing in the Jewish streets.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0412.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If the task should prove to be more than the Alliance can undertake in this field, we would suggest that some of the trade unions carry on individually. We on our part shall do everything possible to make this undertaking successful.</p>
