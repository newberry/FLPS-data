<title level="a">JEWISH BAKERS WIN A COMPLETE VICTORY</title>.
</bibl>

   <p>After a two weeks struggle, the Jewish bakers won a complete victory. The bakery bosses signed the new agreement yesterday, and, in the evening, the strikers returned to work.</p>
   <p>Not only did the bosses of the association settle with the union, but even Mr. Wolpert of Maxwell and Sangamon Streets, with whom the union has waged continual struggle for the last few years, also signed an agreement and from now on will have a strictly union shop.</p>
   <p>New agreement, a week's work shall consist of 6 days, of 8 1/2 hours each; no work on May 1. Minimum wages as follows: Foreman $32; second baker, $29; and third hand baker, $27 a week. This is the of $4 per week in comparison with the previous salary.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0302.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Substitutes, shall receive $5 a day; foreman, spongers and special men $6 a day. For overtime, (permitted in emergency cases only), first hand shall receive $1 and second hand shall receive 75Â¢ an hour. For holidays, the pay shall be time and one-half. In the week of Labor Day, the workers shall work only 5 days and shall receive a full week's pay. The bosses obligate themselves to recognize only capable helpers or substitutes.</p>
   <p>From this, it can be seen that the bakers have won nearly all their demands, and their main demand regarding the substitutes and helpers they gained more than in the last year's agreement.</p>
