   <p>Neck-tie Makers win their demands of Mr. Salk.</p>
   <p>At a meeting of the striking neck-tie makers, it was reported that Mr. Salk stated that he agreed to grant the demands of the workers, for 10% of their wages for the 6 months prior to July 1st. The Strike Committee was instructed to see Mr. Salk and also to interview a few of the members. Mr. Salk received the committee very cordially. He declared that he realizes now that it was his mistake, and is willing to make amends.</p>
   <p>The committee brought this report back to the strikers who were waiting at the United Hebrew Trades Hall. They agreed to go back to work at 9 o'clock in the morning.</p>
   <p>Miss Ida Blatt of the Womens Trade Union League addressed the neck-tie makers about the importance of being united, and acting with solidarity as they did in this strike. The neck-tie makers thanked the United Hebrew Trades and the Womens Trade Union League for the help extended them during the strike.</p>
