<title level="a">DRESSMAKERS' STRIKE EXPECTED TOMORROW</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The strike in the dressmaking industry will probably be called tomorrow. Today, the union is making its final preparations for the struggle. These are the chief demands of the union: a five-day work week, a ten percent increase in wages, and the introduction of an insurance fund for the unemployed. Other demands are recognition of the union, full union working conditions in the shops, and so on.</p>
   <p>The manufacturers refused to negotiate with the union. Such an attitude usually results in a strike. Furthermore, many manufacturers have tried to exploit the hard times now prevailing in the industry to make working conditions still worse.</p>
   <p>The strike will be a very bitter one in all the shops, with the exception of those that are completely organized. The high cost of living and the increase in unemployment have caused the workers to stand resolutely by their demands.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0818.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The dressmakers are known as one hundred per cent union men who will fight long and bitterly for their demands.</p>
   <p>In many shops the cloakmakers will stop working in order to help the dressmakers organize their strike, to help picket on the first day of the strike, and to prove the solidarity of the Ladies Garment Workers Union with the strikers.</p>
