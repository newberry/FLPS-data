   <p>The movement to organize the Clothing and Gents Furnishing clerks in a trade union, for the purpose of lessening their unlimited working hours and improving the trade in general, has already from the beginning exerted its influence. For, as it seems, it shall not be necessary to call the salespeople to strike against their employers to secure their main demands which are: first, to shorten working hours; secordly, to close the store entirely three evenings a week. There will be no obstacles in obtaining these, for the store-owners are themselves interested that this be so since, in truth, no matter how much they earn, they still which to rest and enjoy their homes with their wives and children.</p>
   <p>The fact is that most of the West Side Clothing and Gents Furnishing stores are in accord with this plan; but a small minority are unsatisfied, and with these the union will carry on its battles. It is especially important to <pb facs="5423972_3_0397.jpg" n="2"/>organize a union, and we again wish to call to the attention of the Clothing and Gents Furnishing salespeople, that Friday evening, the first of December, there will be a mass-meeting at 1125 Blue Island Avenue (Naftalins Hall), called by the United Alliance to organize a union and discuss ways and means of improving the deplorable plight of the salespersons.</p>
