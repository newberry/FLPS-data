   <p>In recent years we have heard a great deal about the tribulations of the Jewish students in our colleges. Jewish students have not been allowed to participate in all the activities in which Gentile students participate. This situation has been denounced as outrageous. It is well known that there have been official attempts (or alleged attempts) to keep down the number of Jewish students entering into the colleges. [This proposed Jewish "quota" has long been criticized.] Criticism, however, has also been leveled against the policy of preventing the Jewish students from participating actively in activities so as to create student fellowship between the Jewish and the Gentile students.</p>
   <p>The following quotation is an appeal by a Jewish college graduate to Jewish students not to get hysterical about the fancied slights which they receive. This old-time graduate says that Jewish students should attempt to win respect, admiration, and complete fellowship by being quiet and respectable--by acting in such a manner that all the students will consider their behavior as exemplary.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1340.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He says: "One day, during my senior year at college, I was sitting on the campus with a group of fellow students. One of them was reading a New York newspaper aloud. In the correspondence column some non-Jew had written a letter protesting against the mistreatment of Jews in some college or other--I have forgotten the name.</p>
   <p>"'Here in New York,' read the letter, 'we have an eighteen-per-cent, Jewish student body at Columbia University--students as good, as brainy, as intelligent, and as worthy of receiving the friendship of the general student body as any one else; and yet I hear that Jews are barred from most student activities. Why aren't they accepted as equals by the rest of the student body?' (His facts were incorrect with respect to every detail, but we shall let that pass.)</p>
   <p>"The youth who was reading the paper threw it down in disgust. 'Who in the hell wants to associate with the Gentiles?' he said. Yet the same student was always among the first to protest when he heard a report that any Jew had been barred from a fraternity or from a club, or hadn't made a particular team. I seem to <pb facs="5423972_3_1341.jpg" n="3"/>remember that there were some Jews who were active socially as members of the athletic teams, debaters, actors in college plays, and representatives on committees on class activities. Still in all, whenever a Jewish boy tried for a college team and didn't make it, the self-conscious Jews would say: 'Ha! anti-Jewish prejudice!' If he did make the team then they would stick out their chests and make themselves positively unbearable by their conceit--as if each one had made the team himself through his own efforts and it was not really to the glory of the boy who had worked his head off until he made the team despite the gloomy predictions of his fellow Jews.</p>
   <p>"It never seems to occur to them that maybe the Jewish boys who didn't make the team simply weren't good enough; and the fact that there are plenty of Jewish track stars, basketball players, football players, crew men, baseball men, and hockey and lacrosse players proves that the only bar to success was the inability of Jewish candidates to meet the rigorous physical test. Instead of boasting about each Jewish boy who makes a team as if it were a victory for all the Jewish students, and denouncing the failure of a poor performer to make a team as if it were an anti-Semitic act, each student who cared for such <pb facs="5423972_3_1342.jpg" n="4"/>activities should have striven to make good by his own efforts and not basked in the glory of a basketball star just because he happened to be Jewish. I remember that a few Jewish boys did manage to become bright social lights in college life. The other Jewish students usually charged the successful few of fawning. I could not prove or disprove this assertion since the poverty of my family made it impossible for me even to attend the class dances--let alone take part in the class social activities.</p>
   <p>"No Jew, of course, made any of the important college fraternities. The reason was, as we were given to understand, that the fraternities were oath-bound, Christian organizations--that one had to be either a Catholic or a Protestant in order to belong. Yet there were also a Young Men's Christian Association, a Monorah Society, a Newman Club (for Catholics), and a Socialist club. Just as a Gentile would not be welcome in the Menorah Society, just as a Republican or Democrat or Single Taxer would not be welcome in our Socialist Club, or a Protestant welcome in the Newman Club, just so were Jews not welcome in the Young Men's Christian Association, the Newman Club, and the fraternities--organizations <pb facs="5423972_3_1343.jpg" n="5"/>that required prescribed Christian oaths to be taken and that had Christian ceremonials. And no sensible Jew could object to that, much in the same way as no New Yorker would object if he were barred from an Illinois Society.</p>
   <p>"As a matter of fact, I have always maintained that a person receives from college what he puts into college. Those who were interested in social activities could participate in all the social activities they desired. They who wanted to be active athletically could do so. Those who wanted to go around with chips on their shoulders and stew and complain about prejudice, could find all the prejudice they wanted. And those who wanted to be good fellows and participate in student activities and try out for the teams could always find plenty of people who would be glad to take them into such activities. It is this latter group of Jewish student which will overcome snubbishness and prejudice and destroy anti-Semitism."</p>
