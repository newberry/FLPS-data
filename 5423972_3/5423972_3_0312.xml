   <p>The Jewish working class of Chicago is now facing one of the most vicious conspiracies ever plotted against the trade-union movement here. It is the fabricated conspiracy against the Progressive Cigar Makers' Union, Local 527, which was raided last week by a crew of detectives from the State's Attorney's office. All documents were seized and 17 officers arrested and put under bail on charges that they have extorted money from bosses, plotted against their business enterprises, and committed other illegal acts.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Federation of Labor had at its last meeting, indorsed the strife and pledges to apply means in order to show the public who is actually <pb facs="5423972_3_0313.jpg" n="2"/>responsible for the conspiracy which is evidently aimed at the Cigar Makers' Union, which is one of the most progressive Jewish organizations in the city. We are convinced that the whole plot will ultimately burst like a soap bubble. It will not be difficult to expose the reasons for the frame-up. Nevertheless, it is rather interesting to render an account of the conspiracy.</p>
   <p>About a year and a half ago, the Progressive Cigar Makers Union, not yet affiliated with the International, was undergoing preparations to demand from the La Curba Cigar Company better and more human conditions for its one hundred workers. The firm had immediately become frightened at the demands, and made preparations to move its plant to Benton Harbor, Michigan, in order to escape the union's proposals. And this is what happened.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0314.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>As soon as a strike was declared, La Curba Co. moved to Benton Harbor in the assurance of erecting a new fortress.</p>
   <p>The union, however, strengthened its forces in the strife, which forced the firm to hold a series of conferences with representatives from the workers which resulted into hot air, and again the bosses determined to move. A brother of Assistant States Attorney Berger is head bookkeeper at the La Curba. It is also asserted that all members of the Berger family are stock-holders of the same firm, which made it no more than natural for the Assistant States Attorney Berger, to threaten the leaders of the Union, Levinson, Friedman, and Winfield, with imprisonment if they would not settle the strike which was called in March of last year. The threats were meaningless and the <pb facs="5423972_3_0315.jpg" n="4"/>Union renewed its fight to carry on a strong campaign against its cigars, Gil-Bornard and Lord Claire, La Fonta, Dreamer Boy, and Chicago Motor Club, which was rather successful; undoubtedly affecting the company's trade in Chicago, because the public sympathized with the union.</p>
   <p>Apparently, the La Curba Co. has finally discovered that it is "playing with the devil," so they called to aid the States Attorney's office for protection. This is how the alleged conspiracy was created against the bosses.</p>
   <p>The conspiracy was interwoven with the anti-draft affair so as to make the raid on the union's office and the arrest of its members more impressive.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0316.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Even the naive - if such exist - can understand that the whole affair emanated to impede the union and Jewish labor movement of Chicago, which must crush the conspiracy purporting to suppress one of the most outstanding and strongest Jewish unions here.</p>
   <p>The first hearing of the accused will be held June 14, before Judge Mahoney at the Harrison St. Station. We have no doubt that the case will be dismissed from Court.</p>
