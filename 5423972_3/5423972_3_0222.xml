   <p>The disputes between the local Jewish Bakers and their bosses over the question of night work will, it appears, possibly lead to a strike which may break tomorrow or Saturday if neither side can reach an agreement.</p>
   <p>The Bakers Union, Local 237, held a special meeting yesterday. According to the statements of Mr. Philip Lazar, 1528 So. Kedzie Avenue, one of the leaders of the Bakery Owners Association, the workers are willing to return to night work if the bosses will agree to a raise of six dollars a week and time and a half for night work.</p>
   <p>The employers claim that the Union, having made the last agreement May 1, promised [to permit the workers] to return to night work if the then striking non-Jewish workers would return too. Particularly do they argue thus since the wage rates established by the union contract are: first <pb facs="5423972_3_0223.jpg" n="2"/>hands, $37 a week--second hands, $34 a week--and third hands, $32--while wages now are $50, $45, and $38 a week which is more than the agreement calls for. They do not, therefore, have to give any special "raises".</p>
   <p>The Union, it appears, is strongly determined to fight for its demands and a strike is at present [thought to be] almost inevitable.</p>
