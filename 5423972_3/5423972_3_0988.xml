<title level="a">STUBBORNNESS OF DRESS MANUFACTURERS OVERCOME; TWO NEW ASSOCIATIONS FORMED</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The stubbornness of the dress manufacturers who refused to accept the peace terms of the Union, or to attend a conference in order to prevent a general strike which was planned, has finally been broken, and today their association is completely shaken.</p>
   <p>A considerable number of firms, about seventy-five, have organized, forming two new associations: The Downtown Manufacturers, and the Northwest Side Manufacturers. These associations will confer with the union tomorrow regarding a peaceful settlement.</p>
   <p>This news has not been altogether unexpected. As was printed in last Tuesday's Courier, several large manufacturers had already expressed their willingness to sign the agreement with the union. But new associations for <pb facs="5423972_3_0989.jpg" n="2"/>collective bargaining were not yet organized. The present step taken by the majority of dress firms proves that there are other ways of avoiding a general strike such as was scheduled to begin tomorrow or the day after.</p>
   <p>Attorney Leo S. Boski, 8 South Dearborn Street, was the first to organize the association of the downtown manufacturers. His law partner, Judge V. Fenington acted as secretary. The law office of Max and Bernard Shulman and Meir Abrams, 1607-11 Ashland Block, is responsible for the association of the Northwest Side manufacturers.</p>
   <p>As Attorney Fenington explained to a representative of the Courier, his association will meet at his office tomorrow at nine o'clock in the morning. From there they will go to the conference with the Union [representatives]at the Morrison Hotel. The Northwest Side [Manufacturers] Association, Attorney Abrams <pb facs="5423972_3_0990.jpg" n="3"/>explained, will meet tomorrow too, at 12:30 in the afternoon and will then decide when to meet with delegates from the union.</p>
   <p>Both of the above-named associations represent the majority of the dress manufacturers. This can be seen by the names listed with the Downtown [Manufacturers] Association, as announced yesterday: Herman Spivak, H. Lowenthal, Dorir Manufacturing Company, Grey Garment Company, Stein and Seiden, Black Manufacturing Company, Miriam Costume Company, and thirty others. The Northwest Side [Manufacturers] Association includes Mole and Coopersmith, Greenberg and Novack, Northwestern Garment Company, Roth and Shwartz, J. Horwitz, Stone and Coopersmith, and more than twenty others.</p>
   <p>It is believed that an invitation to attend these conferences will be extended to Federal Judge Julian Mack or Samuel Alshuler, to act as arbitrator. Either can be depended upon to aid in the settlement of all disputes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0991.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Among 4,000 dressmakers, the news that the old obstinate bosses' association had fallen, and that two new ones had arisen which would bargain with the union, produced a very favorable response. Though everyone believes that the chances to prevent the general strike which has been planned, are very promising, yet we find all the workers prepared to answer the "battle cry" of the union, should a peaceful agreement with the union fail to materialize.</p>
