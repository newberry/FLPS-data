   <p>The week of April 19 was one of the busiest weeks in the organization's activities. Not only the presence of Vice President Schlossberg made it successful, but preparations for these meetings and the speeches made by Schlossberg, marked them as successful. The speeches that Schlossberg and others made were filled with the earnest belief and hope that the tailors of Chicago have for the first time enjoyed the results of an honest and faithful administration.</p>
   <p>Besides these two large mass meetings, two or three shop meetings were called everyday. It is remarkable that no other week was as successful as this.</p>
   <p>All preparations for the May First street demonstrations are being made, and if weather is favorable it is possible to have a historical day for the beginning of a new life for the tailor's workers of Chicago.</p>
