   <p>The question of unemployment has brought out an important discussion among the delegates of the Federation.</p>
   <p>Some of them were under the impression that all unemployed should be assisted financially whether they are union members or not.</p>
   <p>Most of the delegates came out with a statement that conditions in the unions are rather bad. It will be impossible to gather enough funds with which to furnish relief to such a large army of unemployed among the unions and other organized workers.</p>
   <p>It was decided not to start any activities in the unemployment relief situation until the unions and the Federation agree on plans as to how <pb facs="5423972_3_0145.jpg" n="2"/>the unemployed relief fund could be raised.</p>
   <p>At the discussion, it was shown that the local Federation should participate in the campaign which The Chicago Federation Of Labor is carrying on against the open shop of the Citizens' Committee, and the cause of the present unemployment. The Federation, has decided to join the conference which is to elect three delegates for this project.</p>
   <p>At the same time, the unions proposed that the Federation elect delegates to the conference of the Chicago Federation Of Labor which is doing such excellent educational work among the working class.</p>
