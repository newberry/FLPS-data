   <p>The 50,000 members of the Amalgamated in Chicago will invest $40,000 in shares of the Russian American Industrial Corporation. This was the decision of the Amalgamated shop chairmen at a special meeting held last night.</p>
   <p>Sam Levin, Manager of the Joint Board, was Chairman of the meeting, and Sidney Hillman, President of the Amalgamated, and Joseph Schlossberg, Secretary and Treasurer, addressed the shop chairmen regarding the necessity of helping the Soviet government to continue the clothing and textile factories in Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>Hillman talked with animation on the plan, which the Amalgamated approved, to go into partnership with the Russian government on the basis of operating and controlling the clothing and textile factories of Moscow and other cities, and installing the best modern machinery and American methods of <pb facs="5423972_3_0540.jpg" n="2"/>producing clothing. Hillman announced that he will leave for Russia, in the very near future, to make all preparations to take possession of the clothing factories, and Mr. V. A. Thompson, former arbitrator for the Amalgamated at Hart, Schaffner and Marx, will also leave for Russia to arrange the business and the administrative part in the factories.</p>
   <p>The shop chairman will soon start a drive in the factories, shop meetings will be called, and the members will be shown how to make this huge undertaking a success.</p>
