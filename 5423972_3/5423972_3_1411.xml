   <p>If one should ask us how many organizations have we of the Jewish working women, who devote themselves to cultural work, we would have to answer that there is only one Jewish working womens' organization and that is the Mothers' League. There are a few minor organizations by the Jewish working women, that are connected with the labor movement, but they do not exist, exclusively, for the same purpose as the Mothers' League.</p>
   <p>The Mothers' League formed at a time when high prices were a new phenomenon, when the wages of the workers were low and the cost of living was increasing rapidly. Then, several Socialist women thought of organizing the Mothers' League, with the object of fighting the high prices. Mass meetings were held in several halls, which were well attended by thousands of women, and they had pointed out to them the causes of high prices and the methods for combatting them. Great results were not accomplished by those activities, from a material standpoint; however, the work was a success morally.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1412.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The members of the Mothers' League, who have undergone the first struggle, must be organized in order to educate themselves, to develop culture, and they fulfilled their task as far as it could possibly be done with the fiery energy that they possess within their ranks.</p>
   <p>The program of the Mothers' League is not systematically formulated, although it is clear for one who is acquainted with the leaders and with the aim of the organization that the Mothers' League strives for: First of all to develop the women of the working class spiritually and culturally, - they should know that being women of the working class they are subjected to the very same conditions as are the men. They should understand their role in society as women, as human beings, as citizens, and as a part of the class that produces all wealth.</p>
   <p>The Mothers' League is, therefore, the only one in Chicago which stands nearest with its aims to organize workers and earns the recognition and support of every labor organization in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1413.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The League is already existing for a few years and under present conditions it has grown, but unfortunately there are so many Jewish women of the working class who are tied down to the house and kitchen which kept them from devoting any time in becoming members of the Mothers' League.</p>
   <p>We find many, many organizations of Jewish women for philanthropic and charitable purposes. We find organizations of Jewish women that support institutions to aid various helpless elements. But we do not find any organization by the Jewish women of the working class, besides the Mothers' League, for the purpose of improving their own cultural, spiritual and social condition. The Mothers' League comes to the women of the working class telling them: The period has passed for a women of the working class to consider herself as a slave. She need not consume her entire energy in cleaning, scrubbing and cooking.</p>
