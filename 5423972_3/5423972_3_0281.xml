   <p>A meeting was held yesterday of the officials and the most active members of local 152 with friend Rosenblum as chairman, to organize a drive in the North West side shops that are still unorganized.</p>
   <p>Comrade Sam Diamond, President of Local 152, was elected chairman of the organization's committee together with Comrades Kleinman, Clickman and Gulski.</p>
   <p>The organizer of the Amalgamated has already started the work of organizing Myer Bros., Nathan &amp; Fisher, Chas, Kanfman, Davy Rosenthal, and Kuppenheimer's workers, all of whom are on the Northwest side. The drive will be carried on, with the workers of four or five shops at a time. When these five shops are organized, we will take four or five more and so on, until all the Northwest shops, will all be organized.</p>
