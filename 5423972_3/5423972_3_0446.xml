   <p>The Worker's Ghetto (A Labor News Column).</p>
   <p>New activity among Jewish Workers. - For the third time a United Jewish Gewerkschaften. - What the other two have failed to do and what this one must accomplish. - A certain success. - The Cigar-makers strike continues - The duty of the Jewish worker to the strikers. - The Ladies Tailor's Union are again on strike.</p>
   <p>A new storm of life and activity has penetrated the quiet of the Jewish workers ranks. For this new life and activity we owe thanks to the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, Local 71. True, they have achieved better pay and more favorable working conditions but that is not enough. They desire other Jewish workers to have working conditions as good as theirs. Thus the afore-mentioned, show that they are not working for themselves, but for the general strengthening of trade union movement. In short the Ladies Tailors Union want to organize a United Jewish Trade Union.</p>
   <p>Twice an attempt was made to unite Jewish Trade Unions but each time they were unsuccessful. Years of effort, work, and money fell by the wayside. However, <pb facs="5423972_3_0447.jpg" n="2"/>let us not lose heart. Our previous failures should point the proper way to success.</p>
   <p>Many will make light of this new attempt, but we should pay no attention to them. They are short-sighted and insincere. They are not true to the ideals of the labor movement. The fact that they are not union members, do not purchase union made goods, and lift not a finger to achieve our goal, proves to us that we should ignore their smoke.</p>
   <p>The previous attempts at organizing a united trade union organization failed because; (1) the organizations backing the previous attempts were not directly connected with the trade union movement proper, (2) the previous attempt spread its work outside of trade union fields and failed to devote enough of its energies only to the trade union movement.</p>
   <p>Now when we are again attempting to organize the trade union movement, we should bear in mind the above causes for failure on the previous occassions. This Gerwerkschaft <pb facs="5423972_3_0448.jpg" n="3"/>should be organized of trade unions only. If we bear these things in mind, we shall be certain of success.</p>
   <p>The cigar-makers under the leadership of the Progressive Cigar Makers Union are still striking at Soloras and Co. This makes it seven weeks, and the strikers have not lost heart.</p>
   <p>This once again shows us that the Jewish worker can achieve better working conditions and economic betterment if they apply themselves and use the proper tactics.</p>
   <p>The strike is a small one but a significant one, not only for the strikers but for the entire trade. That is why all eyes are strained to observe their accomplishments.</p>
   <p>The strikers have acted in a heroic manner. Their greatest problem at present is a financial one. The union is young and financially weak. It is the duty <pb facs="5423972_3_0449.jpg" n="4"/>of all Jewish workers to help their fellow men achieve their goals.</p>
   <p>The Ladies Tailors Union has again called out a strike on Gray and Co. of the Stewart Building, State and Washington. The strike was called because the company broke the agreement which was made at the end of the last strike. The firm is dissatisfied with the 8 hour day. They would gladly pay time and a half for all over the 8 hour day, but workers must agree to work more than 8 hours per day.</p>
   <p>The union well realizes that bosses are dissatisfied with the existing agreement and that they seek an opportunity to change it. The union however will not tolerate it and have called the entire shop out on strike. The workers have already tasted victory and they will not give in. They will achieve their goal.</p>
