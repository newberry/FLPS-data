<title level="a">AMALGAMATED GIVES TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO HELP THE DRESSMAKERS' STRIKE</title></bibl>

   <p>Twenty girls and one man, all striking dressmakers, were brought yesterday before Judge Sullivan on the charge of breaking an injunction. They were all found guilty. Heavy sentences were given to many of them.</p>
   <p>Meyer Kunz received the most severe sentence. He was fined four hundred and fifty dollars and sentenced to twenty days in jail.</p>
   <p>Wanda Koleta was fined three hundred and fifty dollars and sentenced to fifteen days in jail.</p>
   <p>Yetta Hornstein was fined three hundred and fifty dollars and sentenced to twenty days in jail.</p>
   <p>Everyone of the rest was fined three hundred and fifty dollars and sentenced <pb facs="5423972_3_0789.jpg" n="2"/>to ten days in jail. Among them were Jennie Miller, Mary Siegel, Rose Prince, Rose Prill, Eva Jacobs, Anna Birnbaum, Lilian Greenberg, Bertha Noel, Ida Dubno, Sarah Seidel, Esther Richman, Jennie Cahan, Caroline Weglowsky, Rose Finesilber, Rose Silber, T. Road, Bessie Gilman, and Julia Bruza.</p>
   <p>All cases will be appealed. The strikers were freed on a thousand-dollar bond each.</p>
   <p>The Union headquarters received with jubilation the news that the local Joint Board of the Amalgamated had resolved, at its last meeting, to help the striking dressmakers with ten thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>The Amalgamated is the first union of another trade which has extended such brotherly help to the striking dressmakers. The brave strikers received from the other unions only sympathy and promises of help.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0790.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The manufactures, it seems, have decided to get rid of the Union forever, because yesterday all the manufacturers' associations, big and little, united into one association under the name of "The Chicago Association of Dress Manufacturers".</p>
   <p>The Union believes that this step by the manufacturers means a long and bitter fight.</p>
