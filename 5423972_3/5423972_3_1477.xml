   <p>The "leaders" of the comrades of the left who boast that they have captured the Douglas Park Branch of the Socialist Party have issued a leaflet in which they state that Comrade Calnitz, the secretary of the branch, "has absconded" with the money (of the treasury) and with the books. The truth of the matter is, that Comrade Calnitz has remained with the members who are loyal to the Socialist Party, and to the Federation, and Comrade Calnitz has read a report of the past six months and our cash balance is $26.89 which he has turned over to the new secretary, Comrade Bloom.</p>
   <p>If the comrades of the left were able to tell the truth, they would tell that certain of their adherents have not turned in the money for tickets of the last picnic of the Party against which they worked with all their strength. Other monies have also remained with them, about which they do not speak. Besides this, they have assumed possession of the Club rooms and furniture and they refuse <pb facs="5423972_3_1478.jpg" n="2"/>to return it to the Socialist Party branch.</p>
