  <body>
   <p>The conflict between the Jewish bakery workers and bosses is an entirely ordinary labor struggle. It deals with wages, working hours, etc. The demands are moderate, which is to be seen from the fact that nineteen bosses have signed the contract with the Union, whereupon the workers returned to work. Concerning its loyalty to America, the Bakers Union has shown its position when it bought Liberty Bonds for several thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Comes the lawyer of the bakery bosses, Louis P. Jacobson, with an insinuation, published in the Tribune, that the bakers' strike has something in common with German propaganda. This is a little "informing" from a "common informer", who knows that he cannot prove his falsehood, and this has as much to do with the practice of a lawyer, as the bakers' strike has to do with the Germans. Mr. Jacobson makes use of patriotism to cover the vile "informing", that has no foundation in fact.</p>
