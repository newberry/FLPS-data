<title level="a">THE AMALGAMATED NEGOTIATES A NEW AGREEMENT</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Sol Pozner</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The conference between the representatives of Chicago's Amalgamated Clothing Workers and the manufacturers' Association has begun. Nobody, of course, can foretell what the result of this conference will be. However, one thing is certain: the Amalgamated representatives will never agree to the demands of the manufacturers, even if such a decision should mean the dissolution of the conference and the breaking off of all negotiations.</p>
   <p>It would be impossible for the union representatives to act otherwise, because the demands of the manufacturers have to do not only with dollars and cents, but with the very existence of the union.</p>
   <p>The manufacturers did not present many demands; they presented only eleven, <pb facs="5423972_3_0624.jpg" n="2"/>of which the most important are: A reduction of wages of twenty-five per cent, an increase in working hours per week from forty-four to forty-eight hours, the sole right to hire and fire workers, and the abolition of the "closed shop".</p>
   <p>It is unnecessary to enumerate the other demands. It is obvious, from the four demands mentioned above, that the question of granting them cannot even be discussed. Only one of those demands, the question of wages, could be discussed by representatives of both sides. The other demands cannot even be discussed. The workers do not even want to discuss the question of why they cannot grant the demand for longer hours, or the right of the manufacturers to give or take away jobs from the workers (which means giving jobs to whom they like when they like); to grant those demands would mean a death blow to the union which is so young, so energetic, and so capable of fighting. The union is getting ready to live, not to commit suicide.</p>
   <p>There is one thing which makes the situation less serious than it appears, and <pb facs="5423972_3_0625.jpg" n="3"/>that is that the manufacturers, themselves are not taking their own demands seriously. Very likely, the demands were made as a declaration of principle. The manufacturers wanted to indicate that these were the conditions which they would like to see prevailing in the industry; they expressed their sentiments.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the Amalgamated also revealed their attitude. At a meeting of the joint board of the Amalgamated, held after the manufacturers presented their demands at a conference, it was unanimously decided to fight against those demands by every means possible. The labor leaders declared confidently that they expressed the true sentiments of the forty-four thousand members of the union. We do not doubt it. It is to be expected, therefore, that the representatives of the manufacturers will withdraw their demands at a conference, and that peace in the men's clothing industry will continue to prevail, in the interests of both sides.</p>
