<title level="a">"RETURN SABATH TO CONGRESS!" SAYS JUDGE FISHER</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Judge Harry M. Fisher came out yesterday with an important statement in which he outlined his reasons for feeling that the citizens of the Fifth [Congressional] District should re-elect A. J. Sabath to Congress. The judge of the Municipal Court and Jewish civic leader of Chicago made the following statement:</p>
   <p>"Very few citizens realize that proper representation in Congress is received only by those congressional districts which re-elect the same congressman time and again until he has served long enough to occupy important places on committees. Newly elected members of Congress are not appointed to committees.</p>
   <p>"The first term of a new congressman, regardless of his abilities, is devoted to the study of the rules and tasks of the Congress. Although he may be a capable man and may learn something during his first tenure of office, nevertheless, he will be of very little use to his constituents during his second term. Only those congressmen who have served ten, twelve, or more years, <pb facs="5423972_3_1735.jpg" n="2"/>have a real hand in the work of Congress.</p>
   <p>"The House Of Representatives is not an advisory body: its membership is too large. Hence it is compelled to work in committees. Having served a number of terms in Congress, Congressman Sabath is on very important committees. It would take a long time for a newly elected congressman to reach the position enjoyed by Sabath in Congress.</p>
   <p>"If, by chance, a new congressman should be elected in the Fifth Congressional District, the latter will have to consider itself almost entirely devoid of representation in Washington for the next two years.</p>
   <p>"Congressman A. J. Sabath has served fourteen years in Congress. He is one of the well-known and influential members; he is a prominent member of two important committees, which are particularly significant so far as the constituents of his district are concerned: the Foreign Relations Committee and the Immigration Committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1736.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Congressman Sabath has done splendid work in these committees, not only for his own constituents, but for every American citizen who has a friend or relative in Europe, whom he wishes to help in immigrating to this country or in any other way. Millions of impoverished and desolate people in Russia, Poland, Rumania, Hungary, and elsewhere consider America as the only place on God's earth from which they can expect help. The persecuted and oppressed hope that America will exercise its influence and will liberate them; the majority there live in the hope that help will eventually come from this country.</p>
   <p>"Only with men like Congressman Sabath on committees dealing with the above-mentioned problems, can we hope to have a liberal policy so far as foreign affairs and immigration are concerned. The service rendered by Congressman Sabath in keeping open the gates of America for immigration is such that it alone entitles him to re-election.</p>
   <p>"It is very important that we have a man like A. J. Sabath in Congress. The war <pb facs="5423972_3_1737.jpg" n="4"/>not only closed the gates of America for almost six years, but also brought destruction to the population of Eastern Europe. We must without question, have in Congress a man whom we could see in Washington, who could use his influence to help us to bring over here the greater part of those who are so desolate and so poor over there across the sea.</p>
   <p>"The man in Washington upon whom we can rely for help at any time is Congressman A. J. Sabath. Let's hope that it will be a special privilege for every upright citizen to cast his vote on November 2 for A. J. Sabath and re-elect him to the office of Congressman, which office he has served so honorably for himself and for all of us."</p>
