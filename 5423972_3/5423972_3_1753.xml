<title level="a">JULIUS H. QUASSER IS CANDIDATE FOR JUDGE</title><title level="a" type="sub">by Dr. A. Lebenson</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>In the last two days, we have presented [in the Jewish Courier] two Jewish candidates for judges of the Municipal Court--Philip P. Bregstone and Jacob H. Marx. All Democrats may vote for these two candidates on Wednesday, September 13. As we stated at the beginning of this series of political articles, the forthcoming primary is not a general election in which candidates are elected to office; it is an election in which candidate are nominated. Mr. Julius Quasser happens to be a Republican candidate for judge of the Municipal Court to fill a vacancy.</p>
   <p>What is meant by a judge filling a vacancy? The Municipal Court is composed of thirty judges. Each of them is elected for a period of six years. Ten judges are elected every two years to replace those judges whose terms expire. But it sometimes happens that a judge of the Municipal Court either dies, resigns, or is elected to a higher court in the middle of his term, <pb facs="5423972_3_1754.jpg" n="2"/>[thus] leaving a vacancy--a vacancy in the Municipal Court. Someone must then be elected in his place for the duration of the unfinished term.</p>
   <p>In this year's election, the terms of the following ten judges expire: John R. Caverly, P. B. Flanagan, J. R. Rooney, F. B. Flangan, Jacob H. Hopkins, Jame C. Martin, Harry P. Dolan, John R. Newcomer, Charles A. Williams, H. W. Welles, and J. W. Beckwooth. Ten other judges will have to be elected in the place of these ten judges for a term of six years each. Besides these ten judges, another one is to be elected to fill a vacancy of a two-year term caused by the election last summer of Judge John Sullivan to the Superior Court. We must, therefore, elect another one in his place to act as judge for the next two years.</p>
   <p>The Republicans have selected the Jewish lawyer, Julius H. Quasser, to fill this vacancy. His name will not appear together with the names of the regular candidates for judges of the Municipal Court, but will appear at the bottom of the ballot under a different heading, which will read: "For Judge <pb facs="5423972_3_1755.jpg" n="3"/>of the Municipal Court--to Fill a Vacancy." Three candidates on the Republican ticket are running for this vacant office. Only one of them will be nominated; the Jewish citizen will certainly do his best to see that this one is Julius H. Quasser. He is entitled to win this nomination because he is naturally qualified to hold the office of a judge.</p>
   <p>Mr. Quasser is now middle-aged, in the prime of life. He is forty years old and has been for the past ten years, a resident of Chicago. He was educated in Cincinnati where he received his LL.B. degree. At twenty-two years of age he obtained permission to practice law in Ohio. He worked up a fine practice in Cincinnati until the latter part of 1906. When he came to Chicago, he obtained permission to practice in all courts of Illinois.</p>
   <p>In the last twenty years in which Mr. Quasser has been practicing law in Chicago, he has built up a practice which can be envied by many older and better-known lawyers. Due to his devotion to the science of jurisprudence and his serious interest in his clientele, he has gained the reputation of <pb facs="5423972_3_1756.jpg" n="4"/>being a lawyer upon whom one can rely in all matters of law. All of these characteristics caused the leaders of the Republican party to select him as a candidate for the nomination of judge of the Municipal Court. They know that if he were nominated and elected, he would conduct his court with dignity, honesty, capability and suitability, all of which are the results of his upbringing and education.</p>
   <p>As a Jewish candidate, Mr. Julius Quasser is entitled to the support of every Jewish citizen. If he is nominated and elected he will not only bring honor to the Municipal Court, but also to the Jewish people. Mr. Quasser is a member of the well-known Davis family in Chicago and like the entire Davis family, he devotes a large portion of his time and energy to Jewish welfare work. He is also active in Jewish philanthropic institutions. He was a director of the Orthodox Home for the Aged for a long time. While there was still a hope of saving the Maimonides Kosher Hospital from extinction, Mr. Quasser was elected vice-president and for a long time he fought for the existence of this <pb facs="5423972_3_1757.jpg" n="5"/>Jewish institution. He is now one of the most active directors of the Federated Jewish Charities.</p>
   <p>Mr. Quasser is a brother-in-law of Mr. James Davis, president of the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities, and of Mr. Able Davis, president of the Jewish Aid Society. He is a nephew of Mr. Benjamin Davis, secretary of the Orthodox Home for the Aged, and president of the Jewish Aid Society. Together with the whole Davis family, Mr. Quasser works in the Jewish social and philanthropic field in a quiet and imperturbable manner without seeking any honors.</p>
   <p>The candidacy of Mr. Quasser is a compliment to Jews. His character is such that he brings prestige, honesty and loyalty everywhere he goes.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Republican voter will do his duty as a citizen and Jew by voting on Wednesday, September 13, for Mr. Julius Quasser, Republican candidate for judge of the Municipal Court. On the ballot, his name is the second on the list of judges under the caption: "For Judge of the Municipal Court--to Fill a Vacancy".</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1758.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Besides having the support of the United Republican party, Republicans and Progressives, he is supported by the best Jewish elements, regardless of their party and political affiliations.</p>
