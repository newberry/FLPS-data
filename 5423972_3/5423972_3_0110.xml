<title level="a">SCHOOLMAN TELLS WHAT HE PLANS TO DO AS DISTRICT SUPERVISOR OF THE INTERNATIONAL LOCALS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Mr. H. Schoolman, the vice-president of the Chicago Joint Board, has been appointed the local district supervisor of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. A Forward reporter visited the new district supervisor and asked him what he planned to do for the locals he will supervise. Mr. Schoolman answered:</p>
   <p>"The last convention in Cleveland, Ohio, divided the entire country into districts, and each one of the districts was to be managed by one of the fifteen vice-presidents. I should have accepted this new office immediately. I decided to stay with the Chicago Joint Board until a certain element in our Union began to spread lies about me. I found that I could no longer carry on the work I have done for the past ten years. This certain group had become too strong in the Union for me to carry on the local organization work.</p>
   <p>"Needless to say I consider it a great honor to be responsible for my work in the labor movement only to the main office [in New York]--to the principal <pb facs="5423972_3_0111.jpg" n="2"/>leaders of one of the greatest labor organizations in the world.</p>
   <p>"With regard to my work as district supervisor, I cannot tell you exactly what my work will be. One thing is clear. In the four states, over which I shall have charge, there can be found less than 25,000 unorganized ladies' garment workers. They must be organized. Before I approach this task however, a thorough investigation must be made regarding the conditions [in the nonunionized shops] and the possibilities of carrying out such a great piece of work. I expect to make such an investigation in the near future and will present the result, as well as the recommendations, to the General Executive Board for approval.</p>
   <p>"As far as Chicago is concerned, I shall give all my energy and time to help the local dressmakers organize their trade. My main office will be in Chicago. The prospects for successful work in Chicago are bright because the local Cloakmakers' Union, which is a strong and rich organization, has pledged itself to consider this organization campaign as a 'personal' affair, and the locals <pb facs="5423972_3_0112.jpg" n="3"/>have faithfully promised to support this work morally and financially. The willingness to help Local 100, for example was shown at the trail of Vice-President Neifoe. The delegates of Local 5 then undertook, on behalf of their membership, to support Local 100 in every possible way. The Cutters' Union, Local 18, also was willing to help Local 100."</p>
