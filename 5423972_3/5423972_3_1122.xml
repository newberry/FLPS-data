   <p>The thousands of organized cigar makers of the Progressive Cigar Maker's Union, may mark another victory to their credit, the strike at the cigar manufacturer Spector Bros., that was entirely won to the satisfaction of the strikers.</p>
   <p>This victory at Spector Bros. has again shown and proved the necessity for workers to be organized. This is an example for unorganized workers, whether cigar makers or any other kind, to see what the united strength of workers can accomplish to improve their circumstances. It is years now that the workers of Spector Bros. have suffered, working under the worse conditions, receiving a lesser price for their work than that given in other factories. Every worker was just like a "hand" to bring riches. They could do nothing since they were unorganized and against them, individually, the bosses were much stronger and able to enforce what they pleased.</p>
   <p>But, when the workers organized and united, then, all together, with one will, one desire, they proved that they are not merely "hands" but people <pb facs="5423972_3_1123.jpg" n="2"/>with souls, who will not be stepped upon nor degraded. United they have proven themselves stronger than the bosses of Spector Bros. Factory.</p>
   <p>The Progressive Cigar Maker's Union is now a power with whom the cigar manufacturer must reckon. Sooner or later the union will control all the shops. Those workers who stand at a distance must enter the union. They should know by now that the one and only way to alter their circumstances is to unite in a strong union. Cigar makers! March forward, hold fast the flag of unity since it is the only stronghold against exploitation and slavery.</p>
