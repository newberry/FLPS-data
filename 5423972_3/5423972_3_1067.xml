   <p>The Jewish bakers, now on strike, yesterday discussed the proposal of the Bakers' Association that the strike should be arbitrated, and that the arbitration board should be composed of Judges Harry M. Fischer, Hugo Pam and Henry Horner; they finally adopted the following resolution in reply to the proposal:</p>
   <p>Whereas, For ten days previous to the expiration of our contract we talked with our bosses; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, We have agreed to every possible compromise in order to minimize our just demands; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, The larger half of the bosses of the Association has already settled with the Union, and considering that the bakery workers are in principle for arbitration; be it therefore</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1068.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Resolved, That a struggle shall be made for democratic arbitration and that the public alone shall be the arbitrator of our claims.</p>
   <p>A copy of this resolution was mailed to Judge Fischer with an expression of thanks for his sincere efforts to help settle the strike.</p>
   <p>At the same time the strike leaders announced that boss Abe Kauffman, 13th and Laflin Streets, who was instrumental in the arrest of two pickets on Monday, yesterday settled with the Union.</p>
   <p>Yesterday afternoon the bosses held a meeting at which the strike situation was discussed. After lengthy debates about the different clauses, the bosses unanimously decided to fight it out with the Union until the bitter end--for the principle of arbitration.</p>
   <p>"All we want is arbitration," said Mr. Blumenthal of the bosses' Association, "and every boss is ready to risk everything in order to obtain arbitration <pb facs="5423972_3_1069.jpg" n="3"/>from the Union."</p>
   <p>At a special meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Union of Baker and Confectionery Workers it was resolved that besides paying strikers, all four locals of the Bakers' Union should be obligated to furnish work to the strikers.</p>
   <p>The statement of Mr. Rosen, the well-known bakery boss on the Northwest Side, that he was not at the shop when the three strikers were arrested, was challenged by the Union. The latter claims to have proof that Mr. Rosen was in the shop when the arrest took place.</p>
