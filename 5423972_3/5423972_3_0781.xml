<title level="a">GENERAL STRIKE OF JEWISH BAKERS IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The baker workers, in a lock-out for seventeen weeks, have yesterday evening unanimously agreed to call a general strike of all union bakers of the North West Side and the Lawndale district.</p>
   <p>The reason why the bakers union has decided to apply this method in the present struggle for its rights, is because the baker bosses of the Lawndale district have proposed that the bakers should work for smaller wages and that the unemployed members, who used to get a few days work during the week, should remain without work entirely.</p>
   <p>The members of the bakers' local yesterday afternoon discussed thoroughly the plan which the conference committee has proposed in the name of the baker bosses of the Lawndale district. All bakers from the above district resented this proposal bitterly.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0782.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Many members of the union claimed that if they agree to work for low wages now, they will soon receive another cut and so be deprived of making a decent living and of the means to help their unemployed fellow workers.</p>
   <p>The members of local 237 have bitterly complained of the attitude of the baker bosses, who were treating them inhumanly and are trying to force upon them impossible deals, which the union cannot and will not accept.</p>
   <p>These bosses also try to weaken and dissolve the union altogether.</p>
   <p>The baker workers agreed that the only weapon is to call a general strike and fight for the existence of the union and its members.</p>
