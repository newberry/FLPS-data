   <p>The Worker's Ghetto. (Column of Local Labor News).</p>
   <p>Ten Unions have elected delegates to the Gewerkschaften (United Hebrew Trades). What delegates must remember. - Where workers are happy. - The Lamin brothers incident. - A hindrance. - The American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Workers of the World.</p>
   <p>A United Jewish Trade Union movement is a necessary organ in the life of the Jewish worker of today. That Trade Unions are realizing this can be seen by the response given this movement. Ten Unions have already elected delegates and many more have signified their intention to do so. Delegates whould remember that we are organizing an organization of organizations, and not of delegates. This Gewerkschaften shall help in solving the problems of its individual member organizations. Otherwise there is no point in its existence. Then to, the individual Unions with their rank and file should at all times be interested in the problems of the Gewerkschaften. Delegated to the Gewerkschaften should give their reports at every meeting of the Union.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0444.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We say this from experience. One of the reasons for the failure of the former Gewerkschaften was the fact that the rank and file lost contact with their delegates and consequently with the Gewerkschaften proper.</p>
   <p>The workers of the Lamin brothers shop have had some very interesting esperiences all of which have not taught them very much. Refusing to countenance the organization of a union in their very skilled trade, they organized a "Club" for apparently social purposes. The boss immediately fired the secretary of the Club. The rest of the shop went out on strike and the boss was compelled to take the discharged worker back and promise better treatment of the workers. Later the bosses reneged on their promises and the workers went ahead and formed a union, but instead of affiliating themselves with the United Garment Workers which is affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, they affiliated themselves with the Industrial Workers of the World, thus creating rival unionism. Regardless of what the differences might be, they should have affiliated with an already strong union with a great deal of experience in the trade. It is not too late to change this affiliation.</p>
