   <p>Judge Joseph Sabath, who is running for re-election to the Superior Court, is one of the most influential and beloved figures in the judiciary in Cook County. The Jewish voters of both parties will have an opportunity to vote for him next Monday.</p>
   <p>Judge Joseph Sabath is an experienced jurist and a just man. He was elected to the Municipal Court bench in November, 1910, resigned from that office in July, 1912, and was appointed on the same day by Governor Edward F. Dunne to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Richard J. Burke. He was elected judge of the Superior Court to succeed himself on November 7, 1916, an office which he is still holding.</p>
   <p>Judge Sabath is a member of many organizations, public and philanthropic. He <pb facs="5423972_3_1677.jpg" n="2"/>has made himself known, far and wide, for his good deeds and just decisions, and he is beloved and respected. Judge Sabath is confident of his election next Monday, but the Jewish citizens of both parties will show him their regard when they all, as one man, give him their full support--give him a tremendous number of votes. The Jewish citizens can do it next Monday when the judicial elections take place.</p>
