   <p>In a recent conversation with us, Mr. Abe Weinstein, president of the United Hebrew Trades, complained that the United Hebrew Trades is in need of both financial support and active members in order to continue its work. At the same time, Mr. Weinstein admitted that now, more than ever before, there is a great opportunity to carry on successful activities on behalf of the United Hebrew Trades.</p>
   <p>Why is the United Hebrew Trades in such a plight? Because, first, those at the head of the United Hebrew Trades have neither understood nor devoted themselves to the mission that such a body should have, and,second, the United Hebrew Trades has not pursued the democratic policies to which a people's institution should adhere.</p>
   <p>The mission of the United Hebrew Trades is, or should be, to organize the <pb facs="5423972_3_0745.jpg" n="2"/>unorganized Jewish workers, to strengthen the existing Jewish unions, and to improve as much as possible the economic condition of Jewish workers.</p>
   <p>It would seem reasonable for such a body to receive full moral and financial support not only from Jewish workers, but from all groups, parties and factions among the Jewish people. We cannot imagine a Jewish organization worthy of more sympathy.</p>
   <p>However, the United Hebrew Trades has not pursued the course it should have; instead, it has devoted itself to irrelevant activities. The leaders have engaged the United Hebrew Trades in such work as was of interest either to them personally or to their parties. In many instances, the leaders have made these side issues their principal activities, and have neglected and pushed aside the work for which the United Hebrew Trades was founded and to which it was dedicated.</p>
   <p>We must admit that the United Hebrew Trades has still not thought seriously <pb facs="5423972_3_0746.jpg" n="3"/>of its mission, and has not, as yet, formulated a complete plan for carrying on its work. The United Hebrew Trades is more than a Yiddish-speaking organization, more than a Jewish trade union or propaganda club. It is a central body which should organize Jewish workers and at the same time should help to alleviate their conditions. It is an organization involving far-reaching activities. The United Hebrew Trades has not as yet been able to concentrate its efforts enough to accomplish anything worth-while. It is for this reason that so important an organization is in such an undesirable condition.</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the central directing authority, which consists of elected representatives, should be far more responsive to the wishes of the members whom they represent. To our regret, the delegates of the United Hebrew Trades have in the past taken unto themselves too many rights and have forgotten to consult the members whom they represent. The result of this situation is that the unions--at least a large number of them--ignore all reports of the United Hebrew Trades.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0747.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There is a lack of affinity and co-operation between the unions and the United Hebrew Trades. Consequently, there is undoubtedly an imperative need for such an organization, and the members of the United Hebrew Trades themselves must make it powerful and successful.</p>
   <p>If the United Hebrew Trades has not, until now, fulfilled its mission in practice, it must be admitted that the failure is largely the fault of the intellectual leaders of the Jewish workers in Chicago, who stand aloof, doing practically none of the work in which the United Hebrew Trades is engaged. The handful of intelligent and capable men whom we possess have concentrated their energies chiefly in organizations that cannot and should not be directly represented in the United Hebrew Trades. But this does not free them from their obligation to this work. A plan should be devised which would enable these men to co-operate more effectively with the United Hebrew Trades.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades, itself, should give this matter serious thought, and <pb facs="5423972_3_0748.jpg" n="5"/>devise workable plans for securing the intellectual support of these men, as well as the material support of the vast number of labor organizations in Chicago.</p>
