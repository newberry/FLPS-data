   <p>The Crown Prince of Japan is expected soon to celebrate his nuptials to a princess of his land, and a special correspondence from a staff representative of one of our large dailies describes the elaborate ceremonies that will take place not only among the participants and their invited guests but also among all the classes of the land. It will be a bit of feudalism in the twentieth century. We in America, at least, fail to see the import of this marriage and birthday and other celebrations that until recently were quite the popular custom not only among the semi-civilized countries like that of Japan but in the countries of Europe as well. When a great artist or scientist weds, we hear of no national fetes, yet it is conceivable that the resultant progeny may be at least as useful as that of a royal family. Every year there are a number of significant achievements in the fields of art, literature, and the sciences, which influence profoundly the <pb facs="5423972_3_1392.jpg" n="2"/>lives of all men, yet no national celebrations with song fests and lantern and electric illuminations take place. The popular enthusiasm is confined to a two to five minutes' reading up of the new achievement in the newspaper. The royal celebrations are either pretenses of hypocrisy, or else idol worship is still the vogue among large masses of men.</p>
