   <p>The United Hebrew Trades has been in existence in Chicago for three years. Without summing up the total of its accomplishments these past three years, we can, nevertheless, justify its existence and admit the absolute necessity of such an organization. Under prevailing conditions the United Hebrew Trades has accomplished a great deal in regards to organizing new trades. It is true that it did not always succeed in carrying out this or that work which it had undertaken, but, as we pointed out last week, the reason for this was the scarcity of active members and the lack of financial means.</p>
   <p>Up until now the United Hebrew Trades has failed to make clear to the multitude of organized workers the importance of such a central directing body so as to obtain the necessary moral, and perhaps financial support from the American Federation of Labor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0330.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The importance of such central bodies as the United Hebrew Trades for the strengthening of the organized working class ought to have been demonstrated because, truthfully speaking, the American Federation of Labor, itself, should have founded similar organizations and supported them. But, as has been stated, the American Federation of Labor has not been totally convinced of the importance of such central bodies, and to some extent this is the fault of the United Hebrew Trades itself.</p>
   <p>We do not mean to approach the outside labor world in a humble and submissive manner but rather as proud, self-respecting people. We must bring to light the definite circumstances and conditions of the Jewish workers, with regard to their language, psychology, and unusual economic and social conditions. To a great extent it is necessary that those who have endured, and know the specific conditions of Jewish workers shall and must carry on and complete this work.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0331.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The chief objective, viz., organizing the workers to improve their economic conditions, is the same throughout this country, facing all workers. But the form and tactics used in achieving this objective must vary according to different groups of workers and their mode of living. Otherwise the work is wasted. And as a leading organization, this is what the United Hebrew Trades, in order to become a recognized organization, should have made clear to the American Federation of Labor and thus obtained the necessary support from it.</p>
   <p>The "Lords" of the United Hebrew Trades</p>
   <p>As previously mentioned, the United Hebrew Trades is, essentially, a vital force which should, and can be the dominating factor within the Jewish working class. It can be this without question if in its midst are found intelligent forces capable of understanding their mission and willing to understand the spirit of those whom they lead. But as we stated last week, the present leadership of the United Hebrew Trades lacks the power of concentration necessary to fulfill its mission.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0332.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Moreover, for the above-mentioned reasons, the people's spirit of democracy and of a true progressive people's movement are also lacking in the United Hebrew Trades. The set-up and representation in the United Hebrew Trades is not, in our opinion, a democratic one. The founders and organizers of the United Hebrew Trades did not clearly understand the psychology of Jewish workers, which, incidently, is highly democratic. Therefore, the present representation in this central directing body yields nothing but misrepresentation, and this prevents the broad Jewish laboring masses from participating in this organization as they should.</p>
   <p>It was understood, and on these basic principles the United Hebrew Trades was established, that representatives or elected delegates from Jewish unions exclusively, would carry on the work of strengthening the unions which they represent by means of their united force, and would, at the same time, help to organize the unorganized Jewish workers. This should have been the basic principle to which the United Hebrew Trades should have adhered. The true spirit of democracy is this: the leaders of an organization should be elected <pb facs="5423972_3_0333.jpg" n="5"/>by those who are led.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades forgot this democratic principle and instituted a system known as honorary delegates, somewhat similar to the "Lords of England," or to be more explicit it is this: when a represented union [in the United Hebrew Trades] withdraws entirely or merely recalls its elected delegates (sending others in their place), then there appear good fellows who propose that the title of honorary delegates be bestowed upon the former, and that those who represent no one and are elected by no one, should have equal status with the rest.</p>
   <p>Is such a form of representation democratic? Is it just or logical? It is wrong committed by both the United Hebrew Trades and the delegates who permit themselves to be earmarked as honorary delegates.</p>
   <p>The work of the United Hebrew Trades should, and must be carried on by the people, of the people and for the people. This is a responsible organization <pb facs="5423972_3_0334.jpg" n="6"/>that must conduct itself with responsibility. To whom do they [the honorary delegates] submit their reports? Who authorizes them to act and to participate in activities that are to be carried through? Who gives them instructions and whom do they direct? It is simply ridiculous and un-businesslike to give such important and responsible work to people who have no conception of the work and who are neither elected nor engaged by anyone to do the work.</p>
   <p>The United Hebrew Trades should not, at least, be subordinate to the individual unions. Would the Capmakers Union, at its meeting, permit, let us say, people from the carpenters or printers union to carry on the most important work? We do not believe so. Then why does it approve of having no representation in the United Hebrew Trades?</p>
   <p>It is understood that such "lords", such honorary delegates, men who share no responsibility with others, who take no instructions from others, who have nowhere to submit their reports, must in the long run represent themselves, <pb facs="5423972_3_0335.jpg" n="7"/>their personal interests, or, if they belong to a party, their party's interests. Such men do not become sufficiently serious about the activities of the United Hebrew Trades. Therefore, the United Hebrew Trades must reluctantly deviate from its destined course. This evil must absolutely be eradicated from the United Hebrew Trades if it wants to be that which it pretends to be.</p>
   <p>If the United Hebrew Trades is in need of external forces, they should be sought in a systematic way, not by salving the elite, but by turning to the existing labor organizations, which cannot and need not be directly affiliated with the United Hebrew Trades; these organizations should then be asked to elect delegates to build an auxiliary organization for the United Hebrew Trades.</p>
   <p>Educational Work in Amalgamated</p>
   <p>A conscientious and enlightened membership is just as essential to a union as is its own existence. With such a membership half of the battle is won.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0336.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>Unfortunately the educational aspect has been neglected until now. Unions have done nothing by way of enlightening their members not only on labor problems in general, but also on trade union questions, particularly in their respective trades.</p>
   <p>The Amalgamated, therefore, which is the first organization to give this work considered thought, deserves thanks. According to reports, educational work in the form of lectures and discussions is now being conducted in several locals.</p>
   <p>The Jewish Local 197 is preparing a broad educational program for the coming winter. Other Jewish unions ought to follow the good example set by the Amalgamated. There is a saying, "Knowledge is Power", and especially for organized workers is class consciousness a double power.</p>
