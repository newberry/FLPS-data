<title level="a">SIDNEY HILLMAN IN CHICAGO TO CONFER WITH MANUFACTURERS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Sidney Hillman, president of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, arrived here yesterday from New York via the Twentieth Century. Hillman will spend a few days in conference with manufacturers, discussing a new agreement for the workers in the tailoring industry, and also the resolution on unemployment insurance which was adopted at the last convention.</p>
   <p>Chicago is the most powerful citadel of the Amalgamated Union. The [tailoring] trade is organized one hundred per cent here, the market is normal, and the workers indicate their satisfaction with their employers and their union.</p>
   <p>Samuel Levin, manager of the Chicago Joint Board, who is one of the most able generals in the Amalgamated army, will also be present at the conference with the manufacturers.</p>
   <p>Hillman has recently returned from a visit to Russia, where he represented the <pb facs="5423972_3_0495.jpg" n="2"/>Russian-American Industrial Corporation, of which he is the president. Hillman has opened branches of the Amalgamated Bank of Chicago, in Russia and the Ukraine. This is the only bank in America which has received permission from the Soviet Government to send money directly to Russia and the Ukraine, where it will be paid out in dollars. The bank charges only seven percent for transmitting the money.</p>
