   <p>We have here in Chicago many trades in which the Jewish workers are not organized. There are many reasons why the workers fail to grasp and understand the necessity for trade unions which will build up the workers' living conditions....Bad living conditions prey on the minds of workers to the extent that reactionary influence get the best of them.</p>
   <p>The Ladies' Waist, Underwear, and Dress Workers, are constantly showing their interest in the Jewish workers question, for it is nothing short of being a living condition problem and something must be done in the way of building up a union with a strong well-fortified local.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0756.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We must remember that our Jewish working girls in these trades, not only have to support themselves, but also must look out for the support of others, such as their old parents and other relatives who were left behind on the other side of the Atlantic. So just as long as they are not organized and their wages are low, just so long will their own living conditions be bad, and their dependants will suffer.</p>
   <p>The United Jewish Federation should do all in its power to organize these trades. The fact that they have already had a union and failed, does not mean they must give up hope, for there is not a single Jewish trade union which did not fail at first, and then make great strides and success on the second venture of new locals. In these trades it takes more hard work and more energy to organize than it takes in other trades. All we need is to get busy, start things going, and the results will be surprising.</p>
