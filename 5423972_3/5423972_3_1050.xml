   <p>International Tailoring Company grants demands of Cutters.</p>
   <p>The cutters of International Tailoring Company won a victory. All their demands were granted after bring out on strike a day and a half.</p>
   <p>When the cutter were locked out, Mr. Meyer was under the impression that the workers would come back individually, begging to be taken back to work, but as it happened, the bosses, one by one were inspired by their union and their demands. A committee called on Mr. Meyer and informed him that the cutters want a $6.00 raise and he will have to sanction it if he wants cutters. Mr. Meyer, at first offered a $4.00 raise.</p>
   <p>Through the influence of Sidney Hillman, the general president, the strikers insisted on the $6.00 raise.</p>
   <p>When that message came to the ears of that firm, Mr. Meyer realized that it meant a battle not only for the cutters, but for the tailors as well.</p>
   <p>So he thought it best and agreed to give the $6.00 raise. He also agreed to pay for the day and a half that the cutters were on strike.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1051.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>For the Amalgamated this victory means more than the raise, for it indicates that before long all manufacturers will follow the example of this firm.</p>
