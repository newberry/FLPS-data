   <p>Now that the elections are over, and the election returns from nearly all the states are known, it is possible to analyze the so-called Jewish vote.</p>
   <p>In New York, the so-called Jewish vote went to the Democratic nominee for governorship, Mr. Smith, who is known for his liberalism and for his straight-forwardness, and who is probably the most popular political figure in the East. He ran ahead of the national Democratic ticket with one million votes, and it is conceded that a good part of this million votes is Jewish. As far as the national elections are concerned, the Jewish vote in New York went partly to the Republican and partly to the Socialist presidential nominees, though it is self-understood that tens of thousands of Jews voted for Governor Cox in recognition of his services rendered to his own state and in recognition of the services <pb facs="5423972_3_1693.jpg" n="2"/>the Democratic party has rendered to the Jewish people. The Jews in New York have been as much affected by the Republican landslide as other sections of the population. The division of the Jewish vote in New York only corroborates the statement that there is no Jewish vote at all, and that Jews vote not as Jews but as American citizens, and as members of the various political parties.</p>
   <p>In New York, the greatest industrial center in the world, and the greatest proletarian Jewish center, there is always a large radical Jewish vote. But we certainly do not exaggerate matters when we say that the Italian proletarians or the Irish proletarians are as much radically inclined as their Jewish brothers, and that their vote too goes to the Socialist candidates.</p>
   <p>In the city of Chicago, the radical Jewish vote was not as heavy as in New York, though the Socialist politicians make a fuss about the vast radical numbers. The Debs' vote in Chicago was forty-two thousand, and we doubt very much whether more than five thousand Jewish citizens voted for Debs. The entire Jewish vote <pb facs="5423972_3_1694.jpg" n="3"/>in Chicago is probably from sixty to seventy thousand. Chicago is the center of the I. W. W., and the center of many other radical groups and sections, and if the Chicago vote for Debs is forty-two thousand all told, then the Jewish Debs' vote must have been a very small one. The bulk of the Jewish vote was given to both major parties, the Republican and the Democratic.</p>
   <p>We suppose that the same state of affairs prevails in Philadelphia, Boston, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, and other Jewish centers in the East. As a rule, the Jewish vote goes to the best man, and not to a certain party. This can be best seen from the fact that Governor Smith in New York, considered one of the best governors New York has ever had, drew such a tremendous Jewish vote in spite of the Republican landslide. And it is conceded that his staunchest supporters are to be found in the ghetto. Senator Lewis in Chicago, who, because of his excellent qualities as a man and as a public worker, is so popular among the Jews, also drew a considerable Jewish vote in the city of Chicago, though it is also true that thousands of Jewish citizens voted for the Republican nominee for <pb facs="5423972_3_1695.jpg" n="4"/>governorship.</p>
   <p>The conclusion is, therefore, justified that the so-called Jewish vote, of which the politicians talk so much during the election campaign, is a myth and exists only in the imagination of certain politicians.</p>
