   <p>A left wing group, influenced by bolshevism, had grown upon the branches, which had organized themselves into a caucus, this caucus decided a plan of action which bound its membership, who attempted to carry out these plans at the regular meeting.</p>
   <p>The right wing which controlled the City Central Committee, attempted to offset this, by proposing a resolution that no member could adhere to any other political organization (meaning the caucus). This resolution was voted down whereupon the City Central used its right to proclaim this as a basic principle. This caused a split - the socalled lefters leaving the Socialist Party and organizing a "left wing."</p>
   <p>The split is termed reorganization' that is, only members of the right wing remained. Sympathy to Russia is still maintained.</p>
