<title level="a">BANNED SHOHET DENOUNCES UNION OF SHOHATIM BEFORE STATES ATTORNEY, CHARGING "CONSPIRACY"</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Benjamin Ruben who "works" as a Shohet [slaughterer of animals in accordance with Jewish law] in a butcher shop, at 1242 South Kedzie Avenue, and whom the rabbis, after a thorough investigation, had declared to be unqualified to be a Shohet, assumed the role of an informer by denouncing the Union of Shohatim before the States Attorney, accusing the Union of a "conspiracy" against him.</p>
   <p>This Shohet's case is particularly interesting because it reflects the arrogance that prevails, unfortunately, in matters of Kashruth (dietary laws). Some time ago, a Jewish man came to Chicago from Waterloo, Iowa and asked that the Va'ad Hashehita (Board which licenses Shohatim) authorize him to slaughter animals. Benjamin Ruben prepared for the rabbis of the Board a slaughterer's knife and answered a few questions pertaining to the rules of slaughter. But since he was not personally known to the Board, the latter decided to inquire about him in Waterloo. Four Jewish residents of Waterloo replied <pb facs="5423972_3_0096.jpg" n="2"/>that Ruben was a junk dealer there, that he kept his shop open on Sabbath, and, in general, did not live up to the traditions of the Jewish faith. Therefore, the Board refused to permit a person who had overtly desecrated the Sabbath, to slaughter animals. Ruben, however, insolently scoffed at the Board and continued his work in the butcher shop at 1242 South Kedzie Avenue. To those who were not acquainted with the matter, he would claim that they [the members of the Board] did not want to grant him a fair trial, and that he was willing to appear before the Dean of Rabbis, Rabbi Yehudah L. Gordon, with his case. In order to discredit this claim, the matter was brought up again at a meeting of the Board under the chairmanship of Rabbi Gordon.</p>
   <p>The meeting was held on the eighteenth day of Elul (the twelfth month in the Jewish calendar, corresponding to parts of August and September). Rabbi Gordon, together with fourteen other rabbis of Chicago and fourteen members of the Shohatim Committee, participated in the meeting. Rabbi Gordon listened to Ruben's pleas and then rendered the decision that the latter had no right whatever to be a Shohet and that the poultry he slaughtered was not kosher.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0097.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Rabbi Gordon also demanded that Ruben immediately cease slaughtering fowl and other animals.</p>
   <p>But Ruben paid as much attention to Rabbi Gordon's decision as he had paid to the previous decision rendered by the Board, and he continued to slaughter poultry and animals. The Board, therefore, found it necessary to issue the following warning to the Jewish public:</p>
   <p>"Announcement: To all Jews in Chicago who observe Kashruth in their homes: at 1242 South Kedzie Avenue there is employed a man by the name of Ruben, who has been banned by the Va'ad Hashehita with the approval of the Dean of Rabbis. Everybody who goes to buy poultry should guard against buying non-kosher food.</p>
   <p>"In the name of the rabbis and the Va'ad Hashehita of Chicago, "Mordecai Hirshenson, president."</p>
   <p>Now the banned Shohet has taken to the noble task of "informing" and has denounced <pb facs="5423972_3_0098.jpg" n="4"/>the Board in the States Attorney's office. The States Attorney, to whom the whole matter is vague summoned the following shohatim: Reverend S. Resht, president of the Union of Shohatim; Reverends H. Wine and Nahum Grossman, who are members of the Shohatim Committee, and who, together with the Rabbinical Committee, compose the Va'ad Hashehita. It is hoped that after the States Attorney has familiarized himself with all the details of the case, and has found that this is purely a matter of Jewish religion, with which the rabbis alone are competent to deal, he will contemptuously reject the denunciation.</p>
