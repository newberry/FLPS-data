   <p>Joint Board of Cloak-Makers Union Calls Two Strikes.</p>
   <p>The Joint Board of the Chicago Cloak-Makers Union declared a strike in two dress shops, bearing the same address.</p>
   <p>The strikes were declared at Aldrige and Franklin, 337 S. Market street and at J. B. Berman in the same building. The dress-makers, acting in unison, left the shops, and paraded to the union office of Local 100, 49 N. Wells street, where the organizer, Mr. Fineberg, addressed the strikers showing the causes of the strike.</p>
   <p>These employers had a union shop some time ago. One of them has gone bankrupt and the other closed his shop on account of poor times. They both reopened dress shops recently and agreed to maintain non-union shops. The Joint Board discussed this issue and decided to urge them to recognize the union and establish union conditions. The bosses, of the two firms, refused and the result was a strike. The Joint Board will continue this strike until they recognize the union.</p>
