   <p>It is high time to remind the Jewish citizens of Chicago that several Jews are running on the Republican and Democratic tickets for various offices, and these Jewish candidates are men of the highest order.</p>
   <p>Adolph J. Sabath for Congressman. Congressman Sabath is running for the fourth time for re-election, as representative of his district in Congress.</p>
   <p>In the American Jewish Annual, published by the American Jewish Committee, the work of Congressman Sabath in Jewish matters is highly praised.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_1781.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All these activities speak for themselves, and that is the best reason why Congressman Sabath should receive every Jewish vote.</p>
   <p>Harry M. Fisher for Judge. Harry M. Fisher is entitled to receive the vote of every citizen, because if he is elected judge he will make one of the best judges of the Municipal Court. The Municipal Court is the "poor man's court," and the judges must ascend from the masses, sympathize with the masses, and understand the masses. Harry Fisher possesses these qualifications and is the right man for the bench. He is one of the first founders of the Hebrew Institute. Founder and President of the Maimonides Hospital.</p>
