<title level="a">MOONEY COMMITTEE SAYS ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ON STRIKE IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>"More than a hundred thousand workers in Chicago were on strike yesterday, demanding the release from prison of Tom Mooney and Warren K. Billings, California's labor martyrs. Their numbers will certainly increase today, the last day of the general strike."</p>
   <p>This statement was issued yesterday by the publicity bureau of the Mooney General Strike Committee, 113 South Ashland Boulevard. It was also stated that besides tailors, waist makers, capmakers, iron structural workers, machinists, ladies' tailors, carpenters, raincoat makers, and workers of other industries, who partially or wholly participated, there were also thousands of individual workers who deserted their work in recognition of the significance of the occasion.</p>
   <p>According to figures submitted by the Strike Committee, machinists and carpenters alone numbered around thirty thousand. About five hundred waist makers and seven hundred tailors left the shops on their own initiative, although their unions had not officially called a strike. In the afternoon, <pb facs="5423972_3_1007.jpg" n="2"/>some one hundred apprentice tailors held a meeting at which they spoke of the Mooney strike.</p>
   <p>The General Strike Committee received reports yesterday from Michigan, Ohio, Montana, Washington, and other states where participation [in the strike] was strongest. From Peoria, Illinois, came the report that all workers are striking, including the police. The Committee believes that about a million workers throughout the country are participating in the strike. The Committee hopes to arrange a similar strike on September 1 (Labor Day), if Mooney and Billings are not freed from prison by then.</p>
   <p>Aside from the minor disturbances occurring when police interfered with the distribution of literature in various parts of the city, no disorders were reported yesterday in connection with the demonstration.</p>
