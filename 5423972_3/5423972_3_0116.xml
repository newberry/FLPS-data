   <p>The Cleaners and Dyers Union, Local 189, at its last meeting determined to create a large fund to carry on an organizational campaign in the interests of the unorganized workers of the inside Cleaners and Dyers.</p>
   <p>Local 189 has organized the majority of the trade, but lately a few large plants have sprung up, employing a few hundred workers, who work 50 and 54 hours a week for small salaries and under poor conditions?</p>
   <p>The bosses of the original plants are complaining to the Union that they are forced to compete with the unorganized shops, and the Union workers realize that, if in the trade there are some who work longer hours and for less pay, this endangers their present working conditions.</p>
   <p>It was, therefore, very practical of the members to accept the recommendation <pb facs="5423972_3_0117.jpg" n="2"/>of their Executive Board and business agent, Abrams, to tax themselves a day's pay, to create a fund of Ten Thousand Dollars, to carry on a strong organizational campaign for the inside cleaners and dyers who are working under poor conditions. The Union, at its last meeting acknowledged the good work of its officials, Secretary Weise and the business-agent, and elected them both for a year, and entrusted them with the further important work for the organization that has done a great deal in improving the condition of the cleaners and dyers.</p>
   <p>The unorganized plants should take an example from the Union shops where the men work only 44 hours a week, with mere pay and under more humane conditions. Everyone working in a cleaning and dyeing plant should not wait until he or she is approached, to come and join the Union. Every man and woman must realize the importance of belonging to the Union, and each Worker knows that long hours and small pay are bad for the family.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0118.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Workers of non-Union Shops prepare to be unionized if you don't want conditions to be worse than they are now.</p>
   <p>The conditions in the cigarmaking industry in Chicago are deplorable, and the workers are suffering the consequences.</p>
   <p>The organized workers should take more interest in the strike, which the Amalgamated Cigar Makers Union is carrying on in Byron Brothers shop, where the High Sovereign Cigar, which were sold all over before the strike, are manufactured. The battle against Byron Brothers was forced upon the Union. The truth is that the Amalgamated Cigar Makers Union was too decent to Byron Brothers. Work was done in that shop at $2.00 cheaper than anywhere else, and when the Union reduced the union-members $2.00 a week per thousand in the shops where they paid the Union price, Byron Brothers followed suit, when they knew that they never paid the union-price, as the rest had done.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0119.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Union protested against Byron Brothers cutting $2.00 per thousand, without the consent of the Union, so that their price would be in line with all the other union-manufacturers; but Byron Brothers insisted on having the same privileges as before, and union workers refused it, and that caused the strike, or rather the lockout.</p>
   <p>The people who smoke cigars can be of great help to the union cigar-makers in winning the battle. So far there is no law, forcing cigar smokers to buy cigars made by strike-breakers. You can satisfy your conscience and smoke union-made cigars, and in this manner you can help the workers.</p>
   <p>In the last few days the United Hebrew Trades have tried to bring both parties to a conference, to settle the strike.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the Byrons will come to a peace settlement, to prevent further discomfort.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0120.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The bad feature is that they can obtain strike-breakers in the time of a strike. There was a time when strike-breakers were hard to find, everybody would wonder how well the cigar-makers were organized, but now it seems, conditions are changed. It is very important that all unions should now take great interest in the organizing problem and see that all unorganized cigarmakers shall join the Union; if the organized cigar-makers are not to lose the foundation they have already built.</p>
   <p>The Shoe Repairers' Union has, in the last five years, improved its conditions and shortened working hours. The group of shoe repairers belonging to the Union realize the value of being organized, and make all efforts to keep up their organization, and will do all in their power not to give up the union, which is so dear to them. But the conditions of their trade forced them to carry on strikes, and they were arrested and fined, because they defended their interests against the bosses. The United Hebrew <pb facs="5423972_3_0121.jpg" n="6"/>Trades, at their next meeting, will determine what can be done for this Union. No doubt, the delegates of all the Unions will find a plan which will help the Shoe-Repairers Union to continue with their work.</p>
   <p>Do the the Lunchroom Waiters want to be organized? It is known to everybody that the waiters in many of the largest lunchrooms, where thousands of Jews eat, are not organized. The owners of these lunchrooms know that they have Workers as customers, who are not bothered about the serves them. The Waiters' Union hopes that the workers who eat in these lunchrooms, will help the Union in their task to organize the waiters in Messingers' and other lunchrooms.</p>
   <p>Everyone eating in a lunchroom should inform the Manager, as well as the Waiters, that the place is not organized and that for the money they pay they must be served by Union Waiters. Only through the influence of the customers, can we succeed in organizing this class of workers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0122.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Store clerks and salesmen should be organized. Of co thousands of store-workers, clerks and salesmen, both men and women, only a few hundred are organized.</p>
   <p>This surely is not a credit to the thousands of organized workers who are customers in the many stores which employ unorganized workers.</p>
   <p>The Retail Clerk's Union made many efforts to reach the unorganized workers in the various shoe, clothing, furnishings, and cloak stores, but was not successful.</p>
   <p>If the organized workers and their wives would take a little interest in these workers, and if the Union people, the progressives and the radical members would only want to help organize the workers of these stores, then it would not be long before every salesman, clerk, and other store-workers would belong to the Retail Clerk's Union, and everyone buying shoes, clothing, gent's furnishings, or ladies garments, would be served by Union clerks and salesmen.</p>
