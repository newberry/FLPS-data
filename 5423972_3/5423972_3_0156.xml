   <p>Just what is the "open shop"? No better explanation is necessary than the one given by a capitalist who defends the open shop. We, therefore, wish to print a resolution adopted at the national conference of the Manufacturers Association, held January 21, 1921, when the Association began its campaign for the open shop.</p>
   <p>"Whereas, It is recognized as a fundamental principle in this country that all law-abiding citizens have the right to work when they please, for whom they please, and according to whatever conditions they have arranged between themselves and the one giving them work, without anyone else attempting to arrange things, or better conditions for them; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we declare it our aim to defend the fundamental principles <pb facs="5423972_3_0157.jpg" n="2"/>of the American plan of employing anybody as long as the open shop exists; and be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we urge our members to receive, through discussion and education, the active help of the workers, businessmen, bankers, professional people, and all other groups in fighting for the American ideals embodied in the open shop plan."</p>
   <p>Here we have, clearly and concisely, the fundamental concepts of the open shop as it was expressed by a representative of the Manufacturers Association of this country. One of the delegates claimed that he had no trouble with his factory workers. He has signs in every department which read: "This is an American shop, operating on the American plan, by Americans." In these twelve words are expressed the ideals of the open shop according to the true American plan. You can readily see where our manufacturers stand or what they think of collective bargaining or the closed shop, industrial democracy, and other <pb facs="5423972_3_0158.jpg" n="3"/>similar labor policies which should be made familiar to the American public.</p>
   <p>In its statement of principles, the Manufacturers Association at San Diego, California,gives us a good idea of what the open shop is, and what it means to the workers: 1. Employ workers, men and women, whether they are members of a union or not; 2. Protect the wages of these workers according to their ability and experience in the industry; 3. Pay your workers wages as high as the circumstances will permit; 4. Give them regular working hours and arrange for the best working conditions; 5. Expect from each worker an honest day's work, according to his best ability; 6. Protect the rights of each worker and the right to earn enough to live; 7. Recognize the right of each worker to bring his complaints, grievances, and questions regarding wages, individually or in groups through a committee, to you; 8. Do not permit any outsider or union representative to interfere in questions between the employer and the employee; 9. Justice and a square deal for everyone and special privileges for no one; and 10. Help every organization, capitalist or labor, which stands for law and <pb facs="5423972_3_0159.jpg" n="4"/>order and for the rights of American citizens.</p>
   <p>From these "ten commandments" we may deduce that the open shops are similar to those shops in which the workers are not organized. Each individual worker arranges his own conditions with his boss or his representative. This is contrary to the fundamental principle of collective bargaining. The worker has no voice in the matter of wages, hours, or working conditions. The boss is the dictator; he operates his business to satisfy and benefit himself. The employers, with their customary false phrases, claim that in their open shops union men can work as well as nonunion men. The truth, however, is that a union man cannot work there unless his connection with the union is unknown, so that no one will know that there are union men in the shop.</p>
   <p>What is the aim and purpose of a union? A trade union is an organization of men and women working in the same trade who organize themselves of their own free will to further their common interests. They pay dues, conduct meetings, <pb facs="5423972_3_0160.jpg" n="5"/>accept a constitution and make by-laws, and follow all the laws by which they are governed. They elect officers and accept their policies. A trade union is the most democratic organization in existence. Furthermore, a trade union makes every effort to allow the public to know all about its policies and its aims. The aim of a union is to take into its membership all persons working for a living, i.e., the great majority of the people, because the workers must be organized in unions if they wish to defend themselves against the great, organized combines of capital that control all the large industries.</p>
   <p>Here we see the vast difference between a union and a manufacturers association. A trade which is organized one hundred per cent allows the greater majority of its members to speak for itself, and is, therefore, American through and through. The main purpose of a trade union is to increase the number of union shops. It attempts to enter into agreements with the employers defining the conditions under which the members of the union will work. The union claims that such a relationship with the employer is just, right, and American.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0161.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Now let us see what the term "American" means. We mean by it one who is born in the United States or is a citizen thereof and who does his share in perpetuating American ideals and in building American institutions. He is a citizen, a member of society, and the beneficiary of the good things America has to offer to its inhabitants. Moreover, he must also assume responsibilities: pay taxes and obey the laws. What does the union say? The union says that every person working in a shop where the working conditions, hours, and wages have been improved by the efforts of the union shall become a member of the union, pay dues, and share in responsibilities with the other members. If a person receives the benefits the union won for him he should become a member. The nonunion man is an industrial alien.</p>
   <p>What is the main objective of a union? Just this: To bring about greater comforts, better pay, shorter hours, better working conditions, and a larger span of life for all who work. Does not all this conform with the idea advanced by the American government of providing for the general welfare? Can all these objectives be attained by the workers if they compete with one another? No!</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0162.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>The trade union and the union shop are the true guardians of Americanism.</p>
   <p>Why blame America when the nonunion man works for himself and stands alone in the nonunion or open shop? What new lessons have we workers learned in the open shops? None. They are against Americanism; they stand outside the labor movement; they do not permit organizations to develop; they do not unite with their co-workers; and they are of no help to their co-workers.</p>
   <p>The trade unions have developed the American ideal that all must stand united and carry out the will of the entire membership. The trade union has rejuvenated the idea that while you are helping yourself you can also help others. The open-shop movement is directed against all of us--union members or not. The capitalists and the employers aim to reduce wages, to force the workers to work under miserable conditions, and to take away the rights that the union has won for us. It is planning to reduce the workers to slavery to such an extent that they will be despised--all under the guise of Americanism and the American plan which is not American but is the very reverse of true American traditions and principles of democracy and free citizenship.</p>
