   <p>The Industrial Labor Conference, organized in Chicago two weeks ago for the purpose of creating a permanent organization to assist strikes, which have increased to the point where they have taken on a mass character, has already succeeded in gaining considerable popularity in the ranks of the local Jewish labor movement. As I recently predicted, it is evidently true that the success of this new and immensely important organization is as good as secured.</p>
   <p>The organized Jewish labor ranks understand the seriousness of the present moment. When the class struggle flares up in such an impetuous form, it is no more than natural that the call to this conference should find a warm echo everywhere, in all trade unions and other Jewish labor organizations.</p>
   <p>In order to understand the reasons for the founding of this newly organized <pb facs="5423972_3_0946.jpg" n="2"/>body, one has only to read the appeal which this conference recently issued to all local Jewish labor bodies. Among other things, the appeal read as follows:</p>
   <p>"The wonderful development of the labor movement, which has spread so powerfully throughout the entire country and which has so courageously accepted the struggle against the general enemy of labor, capital, has crossed the boundaries of a local struggle of individual pioneers, into a great and powerful struggle of the entire labor movement against the whole of the capitalist class.</p>
   <p>"In order to direct this struggle successfully, it is imperative that all our forces be concentrated into one big united organization which shall be able to give assistance and support where assistance and support are necessary. For this purpose the Industrial Labor Conference was founded; it appeals to you for support in order to begin immediately to carry out this task. Thousands of workers are now on strike in Chicago. Whole <pb facs="5423972_3_0947.jpg" n="3"/>industries are now in open struggle for better living conditions.</p>
   <p>"The carpenters, knitters, cigarmakers, clerks of the United Cigar Stores, the Argo workers, etc., are now on strike. They are facing the bitter and obstinate resistance of the bosses, who are united for the sole purpose of destroying the labor organizations. The rich trusts and wealthy contractors spend gold in order to starve the workers. They empty their treasury to hire thugs and police to scare the workers.</p>
   <p>"We must not neglect the strikes which are now going on in our city, as well as the labor struggles throughout the country. It is a crime to remain passive at the present moment.</p>
   <p>"The strikes which now occur are all alike. Almost all of them are of the same character, and each passing day increases the ranks of the strikers.</p>
   <p>"You fortunate ones who are still at work, will certainly soon be in the <pb facs="5423972_3_0948.jpg" n="4"/>same position as those who are in the struggle now, and, therefore, you must extend assistance to those who are fighting so heroically and splendidly.</p>
   <p>"Two things we ask of you. First, moral assistance, and second, financial aid. You must respond generously and at once. We have about a quarter-million striking workers in Chicago at the present time, and you can imagine under what conditions they are striking when you consider the present high cost of living. Many families are on the verge of starvation, the need is very great, children beg for food and the landlords demand rent.</p>
   <p>"The workers who are engaged in the strike are enduring the pangs of hunger. They are sacrificing themselves upon the altar of the entire labor movement. And we, you, and all those who sympathize with the just demands of the strikers, must come to their assistance."</p>
   <p>Of course, it is still a little too early to try to predict and definitely shape the course of the activities of this conference which will be formed <pb facs="5423972_3_0949.jpg" n="5"/>later. It is possible that this organization will remain only as a relief organization for strikes, and possibly--I believe it will happen--the conference will in time broaden its activities and will become the leading force in the present serious struggle against organized reaction.</p>
   <p>In short, the conference is a great labor enterprise--an undertaking which answers the challenge of these present critical times and it will depend entirely upon the conscious workers themselves to see that this enterprise shall grow and become stronger in its achievements for the organized labor movement.</p>
