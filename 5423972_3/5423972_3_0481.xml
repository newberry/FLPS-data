<title level="a">THE MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL CONTINUES BUILDING WITH NON-UNION LABOR</title>.
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The new building of the Mount Sinai Hospital, California Ave &amp; 15th Street, is still being built with non-union painters and non-union laborers. Many will be amazed to read this insertion. They will be justified in asking: Did not the Jewish social leaders such as Jacob Loeb, Sol Klein, and many others, faithfully promise the representatives of the carpenters and painters unions, and the manager of the Forward, the United Hebrew Trades, the Workmen's Circle, and other labor representatives, that the Mount Sinai will be completed by union carpenters and painters?</p>
   <p>Ten days before the four million dollar drive started in Chicago, a conference was held in the Straus Building, where all the above mentioned were present, and the representatives of the Jewish institutions faithfully promised that the Mount Sinai Hospital would be completed by union painters, union carpenters, and union contractors.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0482.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On hearing these promises, the Jewish labor organizations and all right thinking people, expected that the hospital would be completed with union labor. Ten weeks have passed since that conference and the responsible officials have not even made an attempt to keep the promise made by the prominent Jewish social leaders to the Jewish union representatives.</p>
   <p>Within that time the union and the Federation representatives met Mr. Soul Klein, Judge Fisher, and others, and called their attention to the position taken by Mr. Morris Kurtzin, the president of the Mount Sinai Hospital. They claimed that he is doing nothing toward fulfilling the promises but he is hindering them from reaching some conclusion.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0483.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It seems that Jacob Loeb, Sol Klein, Mr. Deutsch and other social leaders could not fulfill the promise they have so faithfully made that no strike-breakers, no non-union labor will be hired for the Mount Sinai Hospital. Now after waiting ten weeks and believing that the Jewish social leaders and Jewish philanthropists will have an influence on the leaders of the Mount Sinai Hospital, the true fact is that there is a great power that will not permit disgrace upon the Jewish name, by one or two people who are sworn enemies of organized labor.</p>
   <p>After ten weeks you can see, as you pass, the new building which is being built to enlarge the hospital, where non-union painters and carpenters are working. The promise, the agreement, the word of honor of such prominent social leaders has no value, no meaning. The Jewish organized workers and their friends want to know why Mount Sinai is being completed by non-union people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0484.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The broad Jewish masses are interested to know why the agreement with the union labor representatives the faithful promise to the Forward, Jewish Federation, and the Workmen's Circle was broken. This question will be confronting them until the responsible Jewish social leaders will reply to the organized Jewish workers in Chicago. It is hard to believe that they have no influence, or nothing to say about the Mount Sinai Hospital and its administrators, that laugh at the promises of Loeb, Klein and others that faithfully promised that the hospital will not be touched any more by the dirty hands of non-union carpenters and painters.</p>
   <p>Here must be mentioned that Judge Fisher, who helped to bring about the conferences between the Union representatives and leaders of the joint drive, did good work. He skimped on nothing in working out plans of settlement.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_3_0485.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>After the settlement insignificant people came along and broke the contract and they betrayed the Jewish labor movement, who will have plenty to say in that regard in the near future.</p>
   <p>In the meantime there is ill feeling against the officials of the hospital to tread upon the most sacred principles of Jewish workers and progressive people.</p>
