   <p>An annual report was given, Tuesday evening, February 13, 1923, in the Jewish Socialist Institute, 2642 Lemoyne Street.</p>
   <p>The secretary declared that Comrade S. P. Kramer,presidentof the Institute, was unable to attend because of illness. Comrade C. Altshul was appointed chairman for the evening.</p>
   <p>Comrade Wallman, financial secretary, stated in his report, that the sum of $7,603.91 was paid out for mortgages and rebuilding. The report was applauded and every one unanimously extended his appreciation to Comrade Wallman's tireless and energetic work for the Socialist Institute.</p>
   <p>Comrade Blumen submitted a report from the Board of Directors stating, "We are in a poor condition. We have paid a great deal of notes on the second mortgage and if it weren't for the City Central Committee of the Jewish Socialist Alliance, we could not carry through the heavy burden. Their loan of $1,200.00 to the Institute alleviated the unprecedented condition."</p>
