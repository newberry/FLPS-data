   <p>Peace in the tailoring industry of Chicago is assured as a result of the conference held May 21 by representatives of the Amalgamated Clothing Worker's Union with those of the National Wholesale Tailors Association.</p>
   <p>In a joint statement to the Courier, both sides explained their consent to an agreement on mutual principles, such as that just signed between the Amalgamated and the Wholesale Clothing Association.</p>
   <p>By means of this agreement, Chicago, as the center of the tailoring industry, is assured of a calmer and greater market.</p>
   <p>At the conference the Amalgamated was represented by president Sidney Hillman, Sam Levin, Frank Rosenbloom, and A. D. Mariempietri. Representatives of the Association were president William Cohen, agents of most of <pb facs="5423972_3_0248.jpg" n="2"/>the more important manufacturers, and officers of the Association.</p>
   <p>The conference took place in the offices of Darchau and Zisman, lawyers of Mr. Peter Zisman.</p>
