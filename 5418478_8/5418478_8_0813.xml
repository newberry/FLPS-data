   <p>P.1--That which the most famous artists have not succeeded in and which they probably never will succeed in doing, was accomplished by our Kubelik and our Milada. At three concerts given in a short period of time, the colossal Auditorium Hall, was so filled, that people were turned away from the box-office in droves. But Kubelik and Milada Cerny, with the aid of enthusiastic countrymen will accomplish even more. They will fill the Auditorium again for the fourth and fifth time. Kubelik's fourth concert will be given next Sunday. A week from Sunday, that is, on February 18th, these celebrated artists, in the same great concert hall, will aid in relieving the suffering of poor and forsaken countrymen, with a benefit performance, the proceeds of which will be donated to the most important Bohemian undertakings. The concert will attract thousands of countrymen, it is certain. The art of both these famous countrymen enraptures and intoxicates everyone and those of us who can, will surely be at the Auditorium. The successes of Kubelik and Milada are Bohemian successes; their fame is the fame of all of us.</p>
