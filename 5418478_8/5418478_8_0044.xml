  <body>
   <p>We were advised by a telegram from Washington last night that Congressman Adolph J. Sabath succeeded in having the House pass his bill, according to which the immigration commissioner's authority will be enlarged by the right to establish immigration stations, which would facilitate his office's care for immigrants from the time of their disembarkation to their safe arrival at their destination. The first of such stations will be in Chicago, and the appropriation for this, according to Mr. Sabath's bill, is $75,000.</p>
   <p>This bill has had the support of all true friends of the immigrants. Here in Chicago it was particularly the Immigration League which worked for its passage. Our Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) is a member of the League and has done very valuable work for the bill by intervening with various Senators, especially with Senator Fitzgerald, who is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee of the House.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0045.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Congressman Sabath has devoted all his time and effort to this problem, and he may consider the passage of his bill as one of the most important and most meritorious single jobs of his congressional career.....</p>
