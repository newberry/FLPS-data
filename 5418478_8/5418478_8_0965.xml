   <p>P.2--The well-known Bohemian lawyer Jos. Sabath has been elected grand master of the nation-wide organization, the Sons of Benjamin. This society, which has about 40,000 members, held its convention and election in New York City recently.</p>
   <p>Many distinguished members of the order sought the honorable office of grand master, and Moses Lewy, coroner of New York, exerted all his influence to win the election, but Lawyer J. Sabath was elected by an overwhelming majority.</p>
   <p>On his return trip Mr. Sabath experienced an adventure which very nearly cost him his life and the grand-mastership. He was traveling by way of the Philadelphia and Reading Railway. About twenty miles beyond Reading Mr. Sabath's train was following a freight-train. While both trains were running at full speed, several cars broke away from the freight-train and began to roll back along the track, which is there steeply graded, toward the passenger-train, crashing into the locomotive, which was completely demolished.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0966.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The engineer and the fireman were both fatally injured, and several passengers suffered critical injuries. Lawyer Sabath was in the dining-our and was thrown under a table, where several pieces of wreckage followed him. A car of immigrants was attached to the train, and Mr. Sabath was astonished to hear Bohemian spoken. The majority of the immigrants were on their way to Chicago and doubtless are still telling their friends about the accident.</p>
