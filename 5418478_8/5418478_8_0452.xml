   <p>A Czech delegation paid its respects to the representatives of the republic of Russia yesterday morning. One member of the Czech delegation was Henry Pavloff of the staff of the Denni Hlasatel. Others were: Dr. L. Fisher, Dr. Jaroslav F. Smetanka, and J. F. Stepina. The introduction took place in the amphitheatre on West 49th and South Halsted Streets. The Russian Ambassador, Mr. Bachmetev, was presented with a gift in the form of a book, in which the friendly relations between the Czechs and the Russians were especially pointed out. Doctor Smetanka addressed the Ambassador on this occasion, speaking in English, and appealed to him to intercede for and aid the cause of the Czechs. "The liberation of the Czech homeland would be greatly furthered by united action of Russia and America," Doctor Smetanka said. The Russian Ambassador answered by assuring the Czech delegation of the sincere sympathies of the Russian people.</p>

   <p>The Russians later met the Czechs again in the Douglas Park Auditorium, where Doctor Smetanka spoke again in the name of Chicago Czechs, and those of all other Czech communities of America. It can be said that the Czechs have made very valuable contacts with the Russians, which is expected to have a far-reaching effect upon Czech aspirations.</p>
