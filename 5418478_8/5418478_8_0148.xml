   <p>On Tuesday May 23, 1922, the members of the Cesko-Americka Obchodni Vyprava (Bohemian-American Commercial Expedition to Czechoslovakia) arrived in Domazlice. They were led by Reverend Vaclav Vanek of Chicago, who is a native of that town....Most of them were industrialists and businessmen some of whom desired to visit their native town, others wishing to see the ancient and historical place itself.</p>
   <p>The members of the Expedition were greeted warmly by the mayor of the <pb facs="5418478_8_0149.jpg" n="2"/>town, Mr. Matej Kelner,....who assured everyone that he would be warmly received by the inhabitants of Domazlice. Reverend Vanek responded on behalf of the visiting group, after which everyone busied himself with getting settled in his hotel. The afternoon was devoted to a joint visit to all important historical memorials and the shady woods at the outskirts of the town. In the evening there was a banquet in honor of the visitors in the local Sokol hall followed by a soiree. The program was entertaining and varied....Brother Jan Kristof, representing the Sokol Domazlicky, officially greeted the members and was thanked on behalf of the Sokol Slavsky of Chicago by brother Bohumil Hak. [Translator's note: Here follows a list of names of the Chicago and other visitors. The list is one-fourth of a column long and are omitted in translation.]</p>
