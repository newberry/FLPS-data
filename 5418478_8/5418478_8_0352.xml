   <p>Nearly all English language newspapers in Chicago have given prominent space to the recognition of Czechoslovakia as an independent state, and some of them have even added historical explanations of the decision of the Allied governments and its political aspect. The Chicago Daily Journal and the Chicago Evening Post were the most outspoken among these papers, and their articles were very elaborate. These two publications have always acted very favorably toward the movement for Czechoslovak independence, and their reception of the news regarding the Allies' proclamation of Czechoslovak rights was most enthusiastic.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Daily Journal printed an article captioned "Hail Bohemia" in the issue of last night.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0353.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Government of the United States has recognized the Czechoslovak nation as an Allied nation, and the Czechoslovak National Council, whose head is the heroic Professor T. G. Masaryk, as the provisional government of an independent state. This news is hardly less gratifying than the reports of the Great British victory in Picardy. It is the recognition of a people small in number but great in intellect, which has rendered services to humanity which exceed their visible value.</p>
   <p>It is the death sentence for Austria-Hungary. It is the end of all attempts by the degenerate Hapsburg family, to keep the possessions it has succeeded in accumulating by stealth. This step has removed the danger and fear that the coming peace would be nothing more than a bungled affair. It gives new impetus to the revolutionary movement which has already permeated the Hapsburg monarchy, and awakened every Serbian, Croatian Slovenian, Pole, Ruthenian, and Rumanian, as well as every Czech and Slovak.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0354.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Chicago Daily Journal, in particular, has every reason to rejoice, since it was one of the first, if not the first, American paper to advocate a declaration of war against Austria-Hungary and full recognition of the Czechoslovak nation. The benefit to all mankind far exceeds our rejoicing, and the Chicago Daily Journal is only joining in the general outcry from the entire American republic when it says "Hail Bohemian".</p>
   <p>The Chicago Evening Post welcomes the Czechoslovaks into the midst of free nations. The Czechoslovak people have taken up arms against Austria and Germany, and put an organized army of their own into the field. This Czechoslovak army is fighting under officers of its own nationality. It is fighting our enemies according to the rules of civilized warfare. This is why the Government of the United States recognizes the Czechoslovak National Council as the de facto government. One hundred thousand warriors, three thousand miles from their home, have created their own new nation. This is the drama of the recognition of Czechoslovak independence, which was proclaimed yesterday. The Czechoslovak soldiers [in the <pb facs="5418478_8_0355.jpg" n="4"/>Austrian army] who surrendered to the Russians in the last mighty offensive are the ones who formed the nucleus of the Czechoslovak army.....</p>
