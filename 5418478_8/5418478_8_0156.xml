   <p>.........It remains to say that the expedition to Czechoslovakia will surely make a good impression on everyone, mainly because it will greatly benefit our homeland. Besides accomplishing its avowed purpose, it will substantially aid the most important charitable institutions. Mr. F.J. Skala waived all profits which would otherwise accrue to him as a representative of a steamship company. By so doing he laid a foundation for a charitable fund. This fund will increase considerably by a sale of flags and insignia, and likewise by means of a collection which will be made on board the liner. Mr. Jan Pecha, president of the board of delegates of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery), will, no doubt, add to the fund the $500.00 which he received from the said organization, and which he is supposed to devote to some charitable causes in Czechoslovakia. To this he and his wife will personally add the sum of $200. Mr. A. Zahrobsky and Mr. Antonin Ratajik have further swelled the fund by their contributions. It is now certain that several thousand dollars will be thus <pb facs="5418478_8_0157.jpg" n="2"/>collected for charitable causes in Czechoslovakia, and one may say that such an amount will be useful for the purpose for which it was intended.</p>
   <p>Reverend Vaclav Vanek informed us that the charitable concert which he arranged in the Hubbard Memorial Church on April 26, 1922, with our famous musicians, Mr. Vaclav Jiskra and Mr. and Mrs. V. Machek, netted him $195. The incidental expenses connected with the concert were paid by Reverend Vanek himself. Of the above amount he gave $50 to Mr. J. K. Valha for the purpose of building a monument in Jan Zizka's native village of Trocnov, [Czechoslovakia]; $50.00 to Mr. V. Jiskra as a contribution to a building fund for the erection of a Sokol hall in Mr. Jiskra's native village of Zinkov; $50 to Mr. Josef Dusek for the indigent families of Domazlice, Czechoslovakia; and $45 to Mr. Karel Vesely for the poor people of the town of Novosedla, [Czechoslovakia]. Besides these gifts the Reverend Vanek has set aside other sums of money for various charitable purposes in Czechoslovakia. We shall make mention of this in our future issues.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0158.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is not to be doubted, therefore, that the Ceskoslovenska-Americka Obchodni Vyprava (Czechoslovak-American commercial expedition) will bring much good to Czechoslovakia and America as well. At the present moment the expedition is on the high seas. It left us happy and contented.....We hope that it will come back to us equally happy and satisfied with the work which it will have accomplished for Czechoslovakia and for America.</p>
