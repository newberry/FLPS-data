   <p>The home of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, 2609 South Lawndale Avenue, will be the scene of a mass meeting of the Czechoslovak people of Chicago.</p>
   <p>For the first time in Czech Chicago history, we are going to welcome into our midst one of the greatest workers and foremost fighters for the cause of the liberation of Czechoslovakia, Dr. Milan Ratislav Stefanik, a native son of downtrodden but now recuperating Slovakia. Who would not know the hero who joined the French army as an ordinary private, became a famous aviator, and attained the highest rank possible--that of commander in the air force? Dr. Stefanik has been well known to us from the time when he spent a few days in Chicago several years ago on his way to Tahiti, where he had been sent by the French Government to make astronomic observations on Halley's comet. At that time, certainly none of us would have thought that the retiring young scientist who has become distinguished among astronomers would return as an <pb facs="5418478_8_0447.jpg" n="2"/>heroic aviator, a lavishly decorated officer of the French Army, and one of the first and most fearless fighters for the independence of the oppressed Czechoslovak nation. We may now reveal to our readers that his daring flight over the Austrian front created a sensation and accomplished a great deal. The handbills with which he flooded the Austrian trenches from his plane contained the proclamations of the Czech and Slovak peoples, urging their fellow countrymen to escape and join the Italian Army.</p>
   <p>We now extend our welcome to Dr. Stefanik as the representative of our highest national institution, the Czechoslovak National Council; to him, the hero, the scientist, the diplomat who, although seriously ill, still carries on the battle for the Czechoslovak nation.</p>
   <p>There was a mass meeting in New York recently....and now it is Chicago's turn to show that it is the center and hub of the great movement, and also that it knows how to value the great merits of Dr. Stefanik.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0448.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>For three years we have been working in harmony for our people across the ocean. Let us demonstrate in this meeting for the representative of the Czechoslovak National Council that we are as loyal as ever to the cause of our people.</p>
   <p>The rare opportunity for welcoming one of the greatest Slovaks of this turbulent time offers itself now, and it surely will not be overlooked by our Czechoslovak fellow countrymen.....</p>
   <p>Czech and Slovak legions are assembling upon the soil of that ancient democracy, France. Those volunteers are going to be recruited into a Czechoslovak army which will become a guarantee for the fulfillment of our demands and a security for a better future for our liberated Czech and Slovak lands.</p>
   <p>Onward, men and women! Rally tomorrow at the hall of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs and show your unconditional devotion to the cause of your nation which is so <pb facs="5418478_8_0449.jpg" n="4"/>heavily oppressed by the German-Magyar yoke!</p>
   <p>The speakers will be: Dr. M. R. Stefanik, vice-president of the Czechoslovak National Council; Charles Pergler, director of the Slav Press Bureau, New York; Dr. Ludwig J. Fisher, president, and Joseph Tvrzicky, secretary of the Czech National Alliance.</p>
