   <p>The arrangements committee for the Czechoslovak Day celebration in the War Exposition in Grant Park was composed of representatives of the Czech National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics in America, and the Slovak League. This committee voices its appreciation of the splendid support given the celebration by our Czechoslovak public, and expresses its heartfelt thanks. The manifestation, held September 14, 1918, was a glorious event. It is not possible for us to single out organizations and point to their individual share in the success. All we can say is that our hopes in the Czechoslovak people were not only fulfilled, but excelled.</p>
   <p>Our brothers, the Slovaks, also participated in large numbers, forming a considerable part of the throngs, and thus have won a lion's share in the final results.</p>
   <p>Our ladies, as always, have testified to their patriotic sentiment in a manner that commands respect. Sokols of each group did their duty. They <pb facs="5418478_8_0324.jpg" n="2"/>showed that they can be fully relied upon, and are always ready to help in our struggle. Our Czech and Slovak butchers, also, appeared in large numbers, thus showing their thorough grasp of the deep significance of the celebration. Organized labor and political unions were in their places, and merit the gratitude of our public. Our aid societies and brotherhoods made up a large and beautiful part of the parade.</p>
   <p>Long rows of members of our clubs and associations with such various aims as mutual aid, entertainment, etc., were in the procession, augmented by many individual patriotic workers; among these were our women, and this completed the parade. We wish to thank every individual who came to lend a helping hand to our noble work. Many heavy burdens have been placed upon our shoulders lately, and, therefore, the readiness of our people to sacrifice is evermore to be commended.</p>
   <p>The raising of the Czechoslovak flag on September 14 has made this day a genuine holiday for all Czechoslovaks of Chicago. The memory of this day <pb facs="5418478_8_0325.jpg" n="3"/>will be written in indelible letters in the hearts of everyone who took part in the event. The presence of our officers and of many patriotic visitors materially aided the success of the manifestation.</p>
   <p>The Arrangements committee.</p>
