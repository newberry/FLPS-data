<title level="a">CAPTAIN OF THE CZECHOSLOVAK ARMY STAFF IS GUEST IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Central Committee of the Czech National Alliance and the Czechoslovak Military Committee have arranged for a mass meeting to be held tomorrow at 8 P.M. in the auditorium of Sokol Chicago, 23rd Street and Kedzie Avenue. The Czechoslovaks will express their gratitude to France for giving the Czechoslovak Army a status of its own, which made its existence possible as a military, diplomatic and political unit. By her recognition France has helped our struggle for independence and recognition by other nations. She has consented to let us fight on French soil for our independence. This is our most important achievement in western Europe and the greatest success, so far, in the movement for our liberation.</p>
   <p>While the organization of our Czechoslovak Army and the re-organization of Czechoslovak prisoners meet many obstacles in Russia, France aids our movement in every possible way. She even honorably discharges our volunteers from her army so that they can join the Czechoslovak unit. This unit, which has been augmented by several hundred volunteers from America, has <pb facs="5418478_8_0434.jpg" n="2"/>become a symbol of the sovereignty of the Czechoslovak people. By the noble consent of France our Nationality is enabled to raise its own banner upon the world forum in order to show that we are one with the great democracies of the world and that we are determined to stand shoulder to shoulder with them until a glorious victory is won.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow's meeting was called in order that Czech Chicago, the largest transoceanic settlement in America, may manifest its gratitude and loyalty to the French nation.</p>
   <p>The meeting is called so that the masses of our Czech-Chicago community may welcome into our midst Captain Firlinger of the staff of the revolutionary Czechoslovak Army in Russia, a young man who has attained a high position in that army. As one of the Army's ablest officers he has been sent to America by Professor Masaryk in order to contact Mr. Jancek who represents the Slovaks in Russia. He is to help in the very difficult task of organizing the Czechoslovak volunteers. Although the agitation for volunteers has been quietly carried on, several hundreds of them have already left for Europe.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0435.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is our duty to make the reception of the undaunted captain magnificent and representative of all the tens of thousands of Czechoslovak volunteers who are unselfishly sacrificing their lives.....</p>
   <p>Tomorrow then, we shall hail two representatives [trans. note: The other representative is probably Mr. Jancek] of the Czechoslovak Council of Russia. They are sent by our dear leader Professor Masaryk, and they come from the heroic Czechoslovak Army!</p>
   <p>Don't fail to appear, all of you! Czechs from Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, Slovaks from Moravia and the Trenczin and Liptov districts, all members of the Czech National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, the Slovak League, Sokols, Socialists, Freethinkers, Catholics, Protestants--let us prove to our guests that our Czech Chicago does its duty, and at any moment can demonstrate its solidarity and its loyalty to the cause of our nation.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow in the Sokol Chicago hall! Czechoslovak volunteers will march from <pb facs="5418478_8_0436.jpg" n="4"/>Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs at 7:30 P.M., accompanied by a band.</p>
