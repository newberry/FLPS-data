   <p>At the last meeting of the committee, with Mr. Jan K. Valha presiding, a letter from the Czechoslovak secretary for foreign affairs was read. The Czechoslovak Government through its departments is willing to do its utmost to make our stay in Czechoslovakia profitable. That government representative writes also that there will be no customs inspection at the border, but will take place after the arrival of the expedition in Prague. The Kancelar Americke Korespondence v Praze (American Correspondence Bureau of Prague), through its director, Captain E. Tuma, agreed to reserve a special train which is to take us from Bremen to Prague, to make preparations for a welcome in Prague, to arrange for trips throughout Czechoslovakia, and finally to organize a festival on the Fourth of July. It will likewise manage all matters connected with the housing of the members of the expedition, and will facilitate commercial and industrial contacts between the members of the expedition and the industrial and commercial concerns of Czechoslovakia. The hotelkeepers' association made ample reservations for all of the members of the expedition in every part of Bohemia and other provinces of the Republic. The room rates will be reduced.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0185.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It was also decided in the meeting that upon arrival in Prague the authorities be requested to order a performance of Bedrich Smetana's "Prodana Nevesta" (Bartered Bride) in the Narodni Divadlo (National Theater) on May 20. Two hundred and fifty seats for that performance are to be reserved for [our Chicago members]. There will also be trips to Plzen (Pilsen), Domazlice Sumava [Translator's note: Sumava is the native name given to the Bohemian Forest], Kladno, and Karluv Tyn (Karlsstein), Moravia, and Slovakia. The Fourth of July will mark a great celebration of Bohemian-Americans in Prague.</p>
   <p>Almost all of the staterooms on the liner "George Washington" have been reserved, and there are only eight left at a price of $140, and for men only. Whoever wishes to make a reservation for one of these must make an immediate deposit of $25 with the secretary, Reverend V. Vanek, 2324 South Central Park Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. All participants will receive a prospectus with detailed in-formations about a week from today. The expedition itself leaves on May 6 from New York.</p>
