   <p>Among our fellow-countrymen whom a successful career has placed upon the summit of the political and social life of our rapidly growing Chicago Czech community, Judge Joseph Z. Uhlir surely ranks as one of the foremost. He is one of those young, energetic Czech-Americans who have made their way by hard work and persistency. His activity has won the recognition of the highest strata of the American intelligentsia. As Alderman of the Twelfth Ward, he was, according to the consensus of the English-language press, a brilliant addition to the city council, a faithful sponsor of his constituency, and an efficient official of our metropolis. As a judge of the Municipal Court, he proved to be a jurist of brilliant ability, a man with a humane feeling, and an outstanding jurist. There is no judge more popular in Chicago today than Judge Uhlir. He is liked, not only by his colleagues, but also by those who are seeking redress in court.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0907.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Judge Uhlir was born in Bohemia on December 19, 1872, the son of Joseph and Mary Uhlir. He lost his father very early, and came to the United States with his mother when only three years old. He finished the public schools and, since he could not afford a high school education, studied in the evenings after work. While his companions played, he spent his time with books in order that he might finally pass the severe examinations for enrollment at Lake Forest Law School, from which he graduated in 1893. After passing the final examinations prescribed by the State, he opened a law office with a clientele which soon increased by leaps and bounds.</p>
   <p>The first year of his public life brought him into the political limelight. He was chosen Republican candidate for Alderman from the Twelfth Ward, although this Ward was considered a bulwark of the Democrats. Mr. Uhlir won by a majority of 1700 votes. Two years later, in 1895, he was re-elected by a 2700 vote plurality, and again after another two years by 3500 plurality. In his work as an alderman, he was often pointed out as <pb facs="5418478_8_0908.jpg" n="3"/>a shining example of honesty and assiduousness; his acute mind secured places for him on the most important council committees.</p>
   <p>The logical result of such an enviable record as this was his nomination in 1908, on the Republican ticket, as candidate for the municipal bench; he was elected by an overwhelming majority. His re-election in 1914 was nothing short of triumphal. He won as a Republican by a 20,000 majority, although the Democratic ticket had won by a sweeping majority of 80,000 votes. Judge Uhlir's popularity had thus outweighed fully 100,000 votes. Chicago has in this manner expressed its esteem for this man whom it considered one of its outstanding representatives.</p>
   <p>Judge Uhlir's activity on the bench is well known. He has presided over every branch of the municipal court, but he is best known from the Court of Domestic Relations. Here, he was well-nigh irreplaceable. He knows <pb facs="5418478_8_0909.jpg" n="4"/>almost every Slavonic tongue, and being an immigrant himself, he had a better insight into immigrant life than others. He knew how to conciliate contending parties, and by the mild manner in which he administered admonitions, he has brought many wayward men and women back to their families. He introduced numerous reforms, some of which are standards in the Court of Domestic Relations up to this day. Similarly beneficial work was performed by Judge Uhlir in the Morals Court, to which he has been recently re-assigned. Chief Justice Olson of the Municipal Court, as well as professional magazines, has repeatedly paid tribute to him.</p>
   <p>On August 15, 1900, Judge Uhlir married Miss Caroline Zacek. Three children were born to them. One of them, Joseph, 15 years old, is now a student of Harrison High School. The judge's residence, 2410 South Clifton Park Avenue, has become a veritable mecca of the lovelorn. The judge has married more couples than any other judge on the bench.</p>
   <p>Judge Uhlir is an arduous worker in our national life. He is one of the</p>
