  <body>
   <p>p.4--The enemies of immigration do not allow any opportunity to pass without slinging mud at that part of the population of the United States without which this country would not be more now than Canada is today. When they have no occasion for an attack on the immigrants they create one artificially, as was done by the grand jury of Cook County in April.</p>
   <p>That body, in its report to the court, advocated the creation of strict laws against the immigrants on the grounds that ninety percent of the cases before them had to do with immigrant witnesses who--oh horror!--did not know English enough to testify, and so interpreters had to be employed.</p>
   <p>We do not know just how the grand jury arrived at ninety percent, for statistics show that the native population is much more frequently involved in criminal cases than the immigrants, although these are heavily handicapped in starting life in the new homeland; we are, however, confident that the voice of the grand jury will not be given much attention.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0097.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He who is not smitten with blindness must acknowledge what immigration has already done for this country and is destined to do in the future, and he will not be instrumental in opposing it.</p>
