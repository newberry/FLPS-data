   <p>From the Americky Pomocny Vybor (American Relief Committee ?) in Vienna we have just received a proclamation asking us to organize collections for the benefit of blinded and crippled Austrian soldiers. The senders have not even had sense enough to have the proclamation which they want to see published in Bohemian newspapers translated into the Bohemian language. All they have sent is a German and an English copy. But we should be willing to overlook this lack of good manners--which, by the way, shows what kind of people are behind this action--publish it, and bespeak most generous contributions, if there were the slightest hope that the money collected among our Bohemian people would be used for the benefit of blinded and crippled Bohemian soldiers, the most pathetic of all the soldiers, because they were forcefully sent to the slaughter against their will, against their convictions. But there is no such hope. If Austria should continue to exist, if it should have the means to take care of the victims of a war which it has waged for the sole purpose of promoting pan-German ideals, the Bohemian crippled soldiers will be the very last to receive any support.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0486.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Besides this, it appears very doubtful if any crippled soldiers would receive the benefit of money collected as a result of that proclamation. The money is supposed to be sent to the Austro-Hungarian Embassy in Washington, D.C., which will send it to one or another Imperial and Royal bureau in Vienna. And the Imperial and Royal bureaus now need every penny to equip other unfortunate young men and send them to slaughter, to cause new thousands of them to be blinded and crippled, and that is undoubtedly the purpose to which any money that the Imperial and Royal bureaus can lay their hands on, would be turned.</p>
   <p>We certainly shall not neglect our duty toward our crippled brothers, and shall do it as soon as we have the certainty that the money we send will be received by them, and that our contributions will not be used for some more killing and crippling.</p>
   <p>Finally, we should like to know who is behind the Americky Pomocny Vybor. The letter accompanying the printed proclamation is signed by one Dr. Geo. A. Kubler. That name is absolutely unknown to us and sounds very much German. Why are there <pb facs="5418478_8_0487.jpg" n="3"/>no Slavic or American names? All this supports our suspicion that the whole action is nothing but a trap set by the Austrian government to catch some American dollars, one of which is now worth more than six crowns.</p>
