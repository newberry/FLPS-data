   <p>p. 3, col. 1.. Those who complain about our indifference, such as is manifest in our public and social life, are mostly right. Just let us consider, how some years ago, when there were only about half as many Bohemians settled in Chicago as there are today, and they were not as well situated as they are today, hundreds of dollars were sent annually to the Central School Association in Bohemia, and every action in the old country and here was supported generously.</p>
   <p>At that time, not only lodges, but individuals also contributed toward national undertakings. At present, here or there, some lodge still remembers the orphanage or our local Bohemian schools, some also remember to contribute a little for the Havlicek memorial, but the great majority of the public is indifferent, inattentive and miserly. It is to be especially regretted, that the Central School Association is being forgotten by us.</p>
   <p>The influence of the Association is recognized alike by friends and enemies of the Czech nation, and the complaints of the Association are serious. The Central School Association is the subject of all attacks by German Nationalists; these, at the same time, use it as an example among themselves when <pb facs="5418478_8_0817.jpg" n="2"/>they wish to arouse their countrymen to work and sacrifice.</p>
   <p>Everyone who is interested in seeing the Bohemian race perpetuated in its age-old homeland, in that its possessions should not diminish, that its children do not become denationalized, should contribute according to his means to the beneficial work of the Association. As is known, the leaders of our race in the old country are not doing anything to preserve relations between us and the land of our birth, to preserve the bonds which attract us to the homeland. But in spite of that, there has existed in Bohemia for decades the sincerest love toward us, the liveliest interest was manifested toward us. All of us know it, who followed the course of public events in Bohemia twenty or thirty years ago. With what pride we read the reports, when they appeared in the old country newspapers, that Bohemian-Americans had sent their contribution to the Association.</p>
   <p>One report reads: "How we admired our brethren beyond the ocean, how we rejoiced over their national consciousness, and how we were fortified by the knowledge that in America there dwelled a strong healthy branch of our nation. How enthusiastically we welcomed every Bohemian-American, who came to Bohemia, with what respect and love we looked upon him and especially how the missions <pb facs="5418478_8_0818.jpg" n="3"/>from America were welcomed!"</p>
   <p>The memories of this even today are recalled by the participants with tears in their eyes and longing in their hearts. Today everything has changed, both here and in Bohemia. We think only about ourselves - would that we might at least do that properly! We utterly neglect national undertakings in Bohemia. The people of Bohemia do not see in us those generous enthusiasts as formerly, and it is becoming indifferent toward us.</p>
   <p>When we read something about Bohemian-Americans in the newspapers of the old country, we notice that they never show admiration for our national consciousness any more, that they never bring out our sacrifices, but simply indicate how we measure everything in dollars, and what practical Americans we are. These conditions certainly are not correct or sound. Many among say: "First of all we must look after ourselves, the raising of our children, and our national and humane undertakings."</p>
   <p>That we should look after these things, and must, is self-evident; but it is just as obvious that we must maintain enthusiasm for our old country, support the most important undertakings there, and keep up an active interest. We <pb facs="5418478_8_0819.jpg" n="4"/>are a branch on the Bohemian tree and have life only so long as we are connected with the tree, so long as sap is being transfused from the common roots to our bodies, and so long as we also contribute our share to the nourishment, sustenance and strengthening of the whole race.</p>
   <p>We must keep up an ardent contact with the old country, take an interest in everything that is happening there and help in that which is best and most important. If we destroy these ties we will wither and perish.</p>
