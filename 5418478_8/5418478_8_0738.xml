   <p>If our old country were in open conflict in a bloody fight, with the Austrian Government, we should consider it our duty to sacrifice both our property and our lives upon its altar. But the fight of our nation in the old country against an antagonistic government and aggressive German neighbors is blood less but continuous, full of strain, and of greatest importance.</p>
   <p>Our nation is fighting there for its rights, its existence, and its place in the family of nations; but it would seem that this fight is leaving us here in America quite unconcerned, quite indifferent and apathetic. We are simply doing nothing to help our brothers to victory. In this fight the Ustredni Matice Skolska (Central Scholastic Union) and the two local protective unions, the Jednota Severoceska a Jednota Posumavska (North Bohemian Union and Bohemian Forest Union) are principally engaged. While the Deutscher Schulverein <pb facs="5418478_8_0739.jpg" n="2"/>(German Scholastic Society), the Deutscher Boehmerwaldbund (German-Bohemian Forest Alliance), and whatever else they call the various German aggressive organizations, are receiving financial support from a nation of one hundred million people outside of Bohemia, we Bohemians are confined to ourselves, our own resources.</p>
   <p>Our nation is small, which is one more reason why every one of its members should do his or her full duty. There is no other way to help in this great historic struggle than to give financial support to the above-mentioned three national protective institutions. And how do we fulfill this duty of ours? We have to admit that very little, if anything, is being done in this respect these days. Such a contribution as the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) sent to the Ustredni Matice Skolska a few years ago should be sent every year. And it would not be difficult. If we realize that there are five hundred thousand of us in this country, we must feel ashamed that we are not contributing at least five thousand dollars every year to the fight. This would mean only one penny a year for each one of <pb facs="5418478_8_0740.jpg" n="3"/>us--certainly a paltry sum. We are convinced that it would not be difficult to collect a tidy amount of money every year, but the collecting would have to be organized and conducted in a lively manner.</p>
   <p>Let us remember what a single but enthusiastic man, our late Mr. Zavadil, did in this respect a few years ago. Since then there has not been as active and self-sacrificing a worker among us. Perhaps if the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) would interest itself in this matter, something worthwhile could be accomplished. There are many of us here who know their duty, but we appear to forget about it in the hustle and bustle of everyday life.</p>
   <p>If somebody would make it his business to remind us of it from time to time, would undertake the collection, and send the proceeds to the proper place, he would certainly meet with full understanding and generous hearts. The Ustredni Matice Skolska is having a hard time this year, for it is struggling with financial difficulties. Economic conditions in the old country are bad; the population is financially exhausted. What a splendid surprise it would be for all good patriots if Bohemian-America would awaken and do her duty!</p>
