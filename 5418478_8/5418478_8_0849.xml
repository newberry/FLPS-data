   <p>The large assembly hall of the crematory at the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) was filled by our countrymen yesterday who came in spite of rain to honor the memory of F. B. Zdrubek. The memorial services were organized by the Svobodna Obec (Bohemian Free Thought Community), the Illinois Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), the patronat Zdrubkovy Skoly (managing board of the F. B. Zdrubek [Bohemian Free Thought] School), the Sokol Tabor Slovanske Lipy, and the Lincoln Lodge of the Spolky of which Zdrubek was a member.</p>
   <p>The program arranged for the occasion pleased everyone. Mr. S. Erst's playing of the organ was very artistic and filled the pauses between the numbers on the program. Mr. B. Simecek, vice-president of the board of delegates to the Hrbitov, was in charge of the ceremony. He opened the program with a very <pb facs="5418478_8_0850.jpg" n="2"/>fine address, and was followed by Otto Pergler, president of the Grand Lodge of the Spolky; Josef Lang of the Sokol; and Vaclav J. Petrzelka, the official orator for the Svobodna Obec ([Bohemian]Free Thought Community). All of these men spoke about the significance of Zdrubek's work and made suggestions as to how to continue the work begun by him. After the conclusion of the program the entire gathering went to Klacel's monument near which is located the urn containing Zdrubek's ashes. A beautiful wreath, which was donated by the board of delegates, was placed upon the urn. Mr. V. Rehak, secretary of the Obec, and Mr. Petrzelka, its official orator, spoke again, and the services ended. Among those who attended were a number of old timers, men who had belonged to the Free Thought movement for many years. Many children of the Zdrubek School were also present, accompanied by Mrs. Raeck, a teacher in that school.</p>
