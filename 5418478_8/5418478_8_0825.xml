   <p>The Bohemian singer, Boza Umirov, whose laudable reputation preceeds him, arrived in Chicago yesterday, to give two public concerts and a group of private performances before local millionaires.</p>
   <p>His arrival was announced for 5:00 o'clock P.M. over the Lake Snore in the Grand Central Station on Fifth Avenue and Harrison Street by Dwight Newman, the concert manager. Deputations were present from the Singing Society and from the Singing Association. There were also the newspaper representatives from Hlasatel, Svornost, and Licove.</p>
   <p>However, when the New York train arrived, it was discovered that the distinguished guest, who was expected, was not on board. Nevertheless, a committee, which was sent out to investigate, soon found out that Boza Hmirov already was at the Auditorium Hotel. He arrived at the Union Station by way of the Pennsylvania Railroad, where no one awaited him. He therefore left immediately with the committee, to return <pb facs="5418478_8_0826.jpg" n="2"/>to the railroad depot, where he was warmly welcomed by countrymen present and thanked the for the honor prepared for him. He promised to be present at an entertainment. prepared in his honor by the Bohemian Singing Society, in the premises of the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society at Mr. Soustka's place, 612-18th Street.</p>
