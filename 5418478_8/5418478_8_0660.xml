   <p>The quiet but diligent work toward the creation of conditions for a better future of our nation in the old country has not yet found full appreciation and understanding in some groups of the Bohemian-American public. It is certain, however, that the calm and efficient work of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni V Chicagu (Bohemian National Alliance of Chicago) and the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) which, in fact, acts as the press committee for the Narodni Sdruzeni, is finding increased recognition, as may be seen from the growing number of testimonials that have been addressed to the two bodies in these past few days. This, however, is quite natural. The American-Bohemians' action for the old country must be based on a foundation which is as solid as its aims are important, and must be conducted in such a way as to insure real and permanent beneficial results. For this reason, all of our press releases are prepared after very <pb facs="5418478_8_0661.jpg" n="2"/>serious deliberation on their probable effects and are based on thorough research of source material and the use of reliable, unassailable data. Therefore, none of our press releases fails to impress its readers with a seriousness of purpose. The same applies to actions other than publicity work. But for reasons which should easily be understood by anyone using good judgment and common sense, not all of our activities may be disclosed publicly at this time. The time will come, however, when all correspondence conducted by our responsible officers will be published, and all of our countrymen will be given the opportunity to judge what has been done for our beloved old country.</p>
   <p>That even the influential English press is being reached by our propaganda work and does not remain uninformed about the position of the Bohemian nation in this conflict is proved by The Out Look (sic), a magazine which is being published in London. Its issue of November 7 carries an article, "Bohemia and the War," by our friend R. J. Kelly, from which we have translated a few especially interesting paragraphs.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0662.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>[There follow eight long paragraphs about the position of the Bohemian Crown Lands in Austria, the cultural and intellectual standards of the Bohemian nation, and its right to an independent future. The last of these paragraphs reads:]</p>
   <p>"This [Bohemian] nation has been suffering under the German yoke for a long time. Even if the Bohemians are a part of the people of the Austrian Monarchy, and as such cannot and must not publicly proclaim their sympathy for the Allies, they are keenly aware of the fact that their men are being recruited to fight against the Allies. There is no doubt that they are in full sympathy with the common Slavic cause, because it is also their cause, and they hope for its early and permanent success."</p>
   <p>In this way Mr. Kelly is educating the English public, and we should be truly grateful to him for publishing his views in a magazine with such prestige as The Out Look enjoys in the great English-reading public.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0663.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>His deductions are supported in the same issue by Mr. Francis F. Marchant, one of the group of Englishmen, accompanied by the present editor of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar, who visited Prague, Kutna Hora, Tabor, and other interesting cities of Bohemia some time ago. What deep impressions this visit has left upon these thinking Englishmen is evident from a remark Mr. Marchant adds to Mr. Kelly's article:</p>
   <p>"It is deeply to be desired that Mr. Kelly's wishes be heard in the proper places. English visitors to Prague and all other Bohemian cities and country towns were most cordially welcomed for many years. In Bohemia there is a surprisingly large number of people who learn English and are interested in English literature and the constitution. Not so long ago, an old, historical church in Prague was given to the English and Americans for their worship by the Prague Municipal Council. The Bohemian University of Prague conducts a seminary for students of the English language.....</p>
   <p>"Before, as well as after the battle of the White Mountain, the Bohemians <pb facs="5418478_8_0664.jpg" n="5"/>suffered a great deal at the hands of their Teuton neighbors. Some time ago I wrote an article for you about the victims of the 'Kultur,' the Danubian Slavs. Mr. Kelly's reasons and speculations also apply to the Slovaks, both in Moravia and in Hungary. Their language is most closely related to the Bohemian language, and the name of Father Hlinka is rather well known even in England. Also, the Slovaks are obliged to fight for their own schools....."</p>
