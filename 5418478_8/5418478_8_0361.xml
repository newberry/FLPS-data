   <p>Nowadays only one thing can really impress us--that which shows strength, enthusiasm, and willingness to sacrifice. Slovak Day, to be celebrated in the well-known White City park next Sunday, will surely excel in this respect. This is going to be a grandiose patriotic pilgrimage, and to pass it up would mean a national sacrilege for every sincere Slovak man or woman, and equally for every Czech man or woman, for we are united with the Slovaks in soul and in body.</p>
   <p>That day will, in the first place, serve to honor those sons of the Slovak nation who are at present fighting for democracy and liberty, for their own nation, for America, and for all mankind. A gorgeous Slovak "Service Flag" is going to be raised there, and Czechs and Slovaks will take a solemn oath to support their soldiers with everything in their power, and not to cease to sacrifice everything they can possibly spare until the enemy, who is choking our dear ones in the land of our birth, lies in the dust--until the foe that <pb facs="5418478_8_0362.jpg" n="2"/>is menacing our dear new homeland has signed a peace which will secure a happy, free life to the Czechoslovak nation and to all the downtrodden and exploited.</p>
   <p>The golden Slovak heart--that inexhaustible well of enthusiasm and understanding for everything that is beautiful, noble, and just--is going to throb next Sunday with a beat that all Chicago will hear, and its echo will reverberate in the trenches in France, in the Italian Alps, in the vast spaces of Siberia--wherever Czech and Slovak youths are battling to provide for better days for their nation, where they are suffering untold hardships and are sacrificing their health and their lives for the most beautiful national and humane ideals.</p>
   <p>No Czech, no Slovak should miss those glorious moments. Come all! Let all be prepared! It is so very little, indeed, that is asked in a time when thousands of our best sons are making the supreme sacrifice, the greatest sacrifice, within the gift of man--life itself! Let us, at least, show that we recognize their heroism, their strength of conviction, and that we know how to honor them as they fully deserve. That is why we call on Czechs and Slovaks to be at the <pb facs="5418478_8_0363.jpg" n="3"/>White City park.</p>
   <p>Colonel Hurban of the Czechoslovak army is expected there for Slovak Day. He is one of the foremost leaders of our army and one of the closest friends of our great leader, Professor Masaryk. His name is dear to every patriotic Slovak and will surely prove a mighty magnet Sunday.</p>
