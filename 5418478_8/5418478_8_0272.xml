  <body>
   <p>The Bohemian National Alliance and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics in America are calling on our people to make next Thanksgiving Day an occasion for the payment of a national tax, which will be collected under the name of "Thanksgiving Day National Tax of the Czech People in the United States and Canada". We sincerely hope that there is not a Czech man, nor a Czech woman, in these countries who would hesitate to give a contribution for the cause of liberation of the Czech people.</p>
   <p>Members of the Bohemian National Alliance are going to call at your homes and farms in all Czech settlements on Thanksgiving Day. They will not forget to call on every one of you. They will appeal to your heart, to your Czech national sentiment, to your devotion to the cause of liberty for the old motherland, and to your willingness to sacrifice. Receive them like you would receive good people--they will come to you in the name of our suffering <pb facs="5418478_8_0273.jpg" n="2"/>people who wish a better future!</p>
   <p>Let there be no Czech men or women in this country who could so forget themselves, and their nation, that they refuse to aid.</p>
   <p>Such behavior would cover them with everlasting shame. Therefore, those who are prosperous should give in accordance with their resources. Those not so prosperous should contribute one dollar for national tax on that day.</p>
   <p>One million Czechs in the United States and Canada should contribute one million dollars for their motherland!</p>
   <p>Our people in the motherland are fighting a terrible battle against starvation and violence. Our boys on the Russian front are fighting and dying for the liberty of their native land. Precious Czech blood was shed on the Italian front for the fatherland. An army of our warriors stand in France ready to die for liberty.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0274.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>What are you going to do, brothers and sisters?</p>
   <p>Our banner has, for four years, been tossed about in a storm of misgivings, and hopes as well. The declarations by the Governments of France, Great Britain, Italy, and our new homeland, the United States, have lifted our own nation to the level of other free nations. After centuries of humiliation and shame, the red and white banner is waving among those of the free nations. Our day has come, and our nation, tortured for ages, is awakening from a stupor: the sun of liberty glories over our motherland.</p>
   <p>It is our duty to see that this sun does not set again. It is our duty to consolidate our victory on the day of peace, so that we may carry our banner to the city of Prague and plant it on the soil of liberated Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>Keep this in mind: We must not cease to fight!</p>
   <p>Thousands have been helping for this day--thousands have not yet done their <pb facs="5418478_8_0275.jpg" n="4"/>duty. Up to now we have only received the aid of those who gave it with love and devotion. But the time for sublime and sacred obligations for everyone has come. This is why we shall come to you, to the homes of all Czech people in the United States.</p>
   <p>Prepare for that glorious day, and be prepared. The day of the national tax is a day of Czech sentiment. This will be a national holiday for the Czech people in America. Our committees will give you emblems which are the insignia of your Czech sentiment. Be proud of that symbol and keep it, not only by words but by doing your duty.</p>
   <p>The entire proceeds will be delivered to the Czechoslovak National Council, which is the provisional government of the future Czechoslovak state. Brothers and sisters, do your utmost, so that the proceeds on that day will do honor to the Czechoslovak branch in America.</p>
   <p>We want to know all of our fellow countrymen here--We want to know how many <pb facs="5418478_8_0276.jpg" n="5"/>there are, we want to count those who are faithful. We want to know the one who betrayed the land of his forebears, and does not heed its entreaties: "Child! Give aid to Thy native land!"</p>
   <p>On Thanksgiving Day of the year 1918, Czech America is going to openly proclaim its love, and trust in the happier future of its motherland. "Hej Slovane" (Ho, ye Slavs), our old anthem, should be heard all over our settlements in America. All of us should rally around the banner upon which is written, "The depth of the earth will open, and swallow him who quits--a traitor!"</p>
   <p>No, indeed, no one of us is going to desert. Czech America will faithfully fulfill its predestined mission, so that on that day it can be said that the day of the national levy was a day of honor for the Czech people in America.</p>
   <p>Czechs! Men and women! Do your duty. Your honor and the liberty of <pb facs="5418478_8_0277.jpg" n="6"/>your nation are at stake! Do not give, but sacrifice upon your motherland's altar!</p>
   <p>The Committee for the National Tax:</p>
   <p>For the Czech National Alliance:</p>
   <p>Dr. J. P. Pecival, Fr. Layer, Anna Stolfa, </p>
   <p>J. Cerny, F. Kubec, Vojta Benes--For the </p>
   <p>National Alliance of Czech Catholics:</p>
   <p>Reverend F. W. Jedlicka, Jan Straka,</p>
   <p>Mary Novotny, K. Radous, J. F. Novotny,</p>
   <p>and J. J. Rada.</p>
