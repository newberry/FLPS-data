  <body>
   <p>That famous guest of Czech-America, Count Frantisek Luetzow, was heartily welcomed upon his arrival in Chicago yesterday. The entire local Czech population awaited his coming with great interest and enthusiasm. Count Luetzow is visiting in Chicago after having delivered a successful lecture at the University of Michigan.</p>
   <p>The arrival of the Count and his wife was scheduled for 3:30 P. M., and long before that time representatives of the Ceska-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) and many countrymen who desired to welcome the distinguished guests had gathered at the depot. So far as we were able to ascertain, the following were present: Messrs. Karel Vopicka, Beranek, F. J. Skala, Karel Fucik, James F. Stepina, Kolacek, Bachman, Otto Kubin, Lev. Lerando Zelenka, Bevka, Egermayer, and many others.....</p>

   <p>The guests were accompanied by Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan and Messrs. Kaspar, Geringer, and Jos. A. Holpuch. The latter, a former student at the University of Michigan, had taken part in the lecture at Ann Arbor, Michigan. The committee originally intended to escort the guests to the Congress Hotel where the official welcoming ceremony was to have taken place, but due to the apparent fatigue of the Countess, this plan was abandoned. Instead the guests were taken to the large waiting room at the depot where the Count and his wife desired to meet their countrymen. They shook hands with everybody and manifested unaffected pleasure over the evident sincerity of the Chicago Czechs.....</p>
   <p>After the introductions were completed, the committee escorted the guests to waiting automobiles in which they were taken to the Congress Hotel. The committee accompanied them to the hotel and shortly thereafter took leave of our guests, for both the Count and his wife were very much in need of rest after their tiresome journey.</p>
