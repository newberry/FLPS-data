   <p>It seems that the St. Cyrill and Methodius Branch of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics in America will do better than it has up to the present; in other words, this Branch will take a more active interest in the movement for Czechoslovak independence. It is time for us to get into action and work in harmony, to stop walking to the left when the other fellow is going to the right. This only hampers co-operation and impedes the progress of necessary and important work. How many meetings have been held in the Czech-American Hall, the headquarters of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics! How many patriotic people have expended their energies in behalf of our sacred Czech cause! Yet there is no unity in our actions.</p>
   <p>An exchange of petty grievances, and a certain antagonism have been rampant among some of our women's associations for a number of years. This obstructs the path to beneficial co-operation. The Lord will, let us hope, work a change in these conditions. We are confident that the ladies of our Czech Catholic organizations will forget the past and get together to accomplish <pb facs="5418478_8_0416.jpg" n="2"/>something useful for the liberation of our enslaved homeland and for our dear Czech brothers and sisters abroad.</p>
   <p>In our meeting at the Czech-American Hall we were informed of the invitation to co-operate with the bazaar committees. This call came from the Czech National Alliance and the National Alliance of Czech Catholics. Our Branch immediately called a meeting for the next Sunday evening, a meeting that was filled by members of almost every association of our district, Town of Lake. We decided to open a tent of our own at the bazaar. Our branch distributed booklets in which any gift contributed to the bazaar was checked, while white slips were handed the donors as receipts. The treasurer, Mrs. Marie Vones, 500 South Hermitage Avenue, was in charge.</p>
   <p>All gifts were stored free of charge by our member, Mrs. Antonia Sereda, 5026 South Hermitage Avenue. She is one of our most devoted workers for the cause. The officers of our Branch are requesting collectors, men and women, to deliver gifts at the addresses mentioned above. We wish to explain that the reproach contained in the introduction of this article is not meant for <pb facs="5418478_8_0417.jpg" n="3"/>our young girls' groups, for they have always responded to any call from our Branch of the Catholic Alliance, and we know that they will continue in their endeavor.</p>
