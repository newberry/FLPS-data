<title level="a">THE BELGIAN COMMISSION'S VISIT TO CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In a White House audience, President Wilson received a delegation of Belgian citizens, consisting of two members of the Belgian government and two prominent private citizens of that small but valiant nation.</p>
   <p>The delegation presented to the President and the people of the United States the ravaged country's and war-torn nation's complaint against the unbelievable acts of cruelty and savage barbarism committed on the defenseless Belgian people by the German soldiery. The delegation included the Belgian minister of justice, Baron Carton de Wiart; minister of Foreign Affairs L. Van De Veld; Mr. P. Hymans, and Mr. L. De Sadeleer.</p>
   <p>President Wilson replied to this commission's complaint to the effect that it would be premature and improper for America to take the part of any of the belligerents while the war still rages, but that all these facts would be taken into consideration in the final accounting.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0714.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>No other reply could be expected from such a serious-minded President of a neutral country as President Wilson is; but the principal purpose of the delegation was to call the attention of the American public to the depredations of the Germans who call themselves the bearers and defenders of the European culture, and this purpose was fully achieved. There is not a newspaper in America that did not carry an article about the arrival of the commission and its reception by the President, and many of them printed the full text of the complaint, containing specific data and facts on which the complaint is based.</p>
   <p>As soon as it became known in Chicago that President Wilson would receive the Belgian delegation, a handful of Germans, led by the editor of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, Mr. Horace L. Brand, pretending to be representatives of Germans of Chicago and the midwestern states, set out for Washington with the idea of asking the President for an audience and refuting the accusations which the Belgians have placed into the hands of the President.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0715.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Although Senator J. Hamilton Lewis did all he could to secure an audience with the President for the German delegation, the doors of the White House remained closed for them, and they came home with only the consolation that they could present their "protest against protest" in written form. The President expressed the opinion that it is improper for American citizens to take sides with one or the other belligerent, and that American Germans cannot claim the same consideration and courtesies as an overseas delegation.</p>
   <p>Immediately after the audience, the Religion commission left for Philadelphia and New York. Upon an inquiry of the secret of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau), Mr. Felix: J. Stroyckmans, a Chicago lawyer with officers it 155 North Clark Street, and the secretary of local Belgian association that the delegation is also planning to visit Chicago and is expected to arrive here next Monday or Tuesday.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar took immediate steps to secure the delegates of the generally admired little nation for an evening as guests of <pb facs="5418478_8_0716.jpg" n="4"/>Bohemian Chicago, and is pleased to announce today that its efforts have met with success. Only an unforeseen obstacle could prevent the meeting of these prominent Belgians with the representatives of American Bohemians of Chicago. This meeting will offer an excellent opportunity to strike up a mutual acquaintance and have a heart-to-heart talk about the types of experiences with the admired German "kultur" which the Bohemians had been experiencing in so-called "peace times" and the Belgians are unfortunate enough to discover now, and which are leaving such indelible marks in their beautiful country.</p>
   <p>The opportunity to welcome the representatives of the heroic Belgian nation, to give them our very best wishes, and to express our deep-felt sympathy will no doubt be welcome to our local community.</p>
   <p>According to the present plans worked out by the secretary of the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar and Mr. Streykmans, there will be a representative meeting arranged in one of the largest halls in the city, such as the <pb facs="5418478_8_0717.jpg" n="5"/>Auditorium, to which the nationals of all small European countries will be invited, particularly those countries that have grievances similar to the Belgians. In addition to this, the Belgian delegation will be guests of the Ceska Boseda (Bohemian Club) and the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) in the Reseda's clubhouse.</p>
