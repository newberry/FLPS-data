   <p>Today the Department of State sent the name of our well-known countryman, Mr. Charles J. Vopicka, to Bulgaria in order to find out whether he would be acceptable as the future ambassador of the United States. The appointment of Mr. Vopicka for the post of ambassador to one of the Balkan countries had been under consideration by the Federal Government for quite some time. However, a definite decision was not made until yesterday, because Mr. Vopicka's appointment was strongly opposed by the "drys" who based their principal objections on the fact that Mr. Vopicka is part owner of a Chicago brewery.</p>
   <p>Today's dispatch would indicate that Mr. Vopicka's nomination will be definite if the Bulgarian Government has nothing to say against him. If the Bulgarians remember all that the Bohemian people, both in the old country and <pb facs="5418478_8_0942.jpg" n="2"/>here in America, did for them in the first period of the great Balkan war, Mr. Vopicka's nomination will have to be accepted by them with gratefulness and pleasure.</p>
