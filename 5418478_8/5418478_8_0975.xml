   <p>Hans Balatka, distinguished critic, musician and composer, died yesterday morning in his home at No. 216 Fremont Ave. His death was caused by heart trouble. He was 75 years old, but up until two years ago he was still able-bodied.</p>
   <p>During the past year he had been twice stricken with influenza, and this sapped his strength. The body will lie in state in Haendel Hall on Thursday. from 10 o'clock in the morning until 1 o'clock in the afternoon, following which a funeral service will be held.</p>
   <p>By origin, Balatka was a Bohemian, but he was active among the Germans all his life.</p>
   <p>He was born, March 5, 1826, at Hoffnungsthal, Moravia.</p>
   <p>Gifted with a fine voice, he sang as a child in the local church choir and <pb facs="5418478_8_0976.jpg" n="2"/>later in the larger churches such as the great cathedral in Olomduce.</p>
   <p>He received his first musical education in that city. At Olomouce, he received his elementary schooling. Afterward he studied law at the University of Vienna.</p>
   <p>In Vienna he became director of the "Academic Singing Society" and he was an instructor at the conservatory. He took part in the student uprising, and in the stormy year of 1848 he was forced to leave Vienna and flee from his homeland to America. He settled in Milwaukee, where he immediately made friends with the Germans and began to work among them. He organized a "German Singing Society" in the year 1850, which is still in existence. In the year 1860, there was performed, under his direction at the local cathedral, east Superior and State Sts., "Mozart's Requiem," with such surprising success, that shortly thereafter Balatka was called to Chicago to become the director of the "Philharmonic Society," which position he occupied for six years. Later he became a director of other musical and vocal societies. He managed a series of symphonic concerts, and in 1867 he became director <pb facs="5418478_8_0977.jpg" n="3"/>of the "Germania Maennerchor," and wrote several operas. The great fire" of 1871 destroyed his valuable collection of music, and he again accepted a position as director in Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>In 1873 he again returned to Chicago and, with the exception of a short period in St. Louis, he resided here until his death. Here, he organized the choral society "Liederkranz" and the "Mozart Club" and arranged many concerts and operas, which were participated in by such artists as Mme. Parepa Rosa, Adelaide Nielson, Gertrude Pappenheim, and Carz, Whitney, Candidus. He wrote: "Kurze Geschichte der Musik" and "Geschichte der Orchestermusik in Chicago."</p>
   <p>He was the music critic of the German journal Illinois Staats Zeitung.</p>
   <p>During his younger years he often met with the local Bohemian settlers and at such times always spoke Bohemian.</p>
   <p>We said that by origin he was a Bohemian, but that circumstances had made a German of him. All honor to his memory.</p>
