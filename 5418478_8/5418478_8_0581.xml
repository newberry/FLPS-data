   <p>The appeals directed to our more affluent countrymen to contribute larger amounts of money to the movement aiming to secure for our old country the best possible advantages, or even full independence, when the war shall be ended and peace negotiations closed, seem to be all in vain. It would almost seem that there are not even one hundred people among us who could donate fifty or one hundred dollars for the realization of the supreme desire of our nation. But once the war is over, and again tours to the old country are being drummed up, we shall see that there are among us hundreds, perhaps thousands, who will find a few hundred-dollar notes, or even a few thousand-dollar notes by which to show the people "at home" what "big shots" they have become in America. But we have considerable doubt that such tours will be receiving as an enthusiastic a welcome and as much hospitality as they used to, when our countrymen overseas learn how small, selfish, and <pb facs="5418478_8_0582.jpg" n="2"/>indifferent we have proved to be in times when the most sacred desires of the Bohemian nation were at stake.</p>
