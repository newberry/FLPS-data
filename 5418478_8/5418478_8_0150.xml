<title level="a">A NEW PATRIOTIC DEED OF THE BOARD OF DELEGATES TO THE BOHEMIAN NATIONAL CEMETERY</title></bibl>

   <p>Although last night's meeting of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova (Board of Delegates to the Bohemian National Cemetery) was not as well attended as on other occasions, the proceedings of the meeting were not only very interesting, but new evidence of the patriotism of the delegates was demonstrated......It was decided by an overwhelming majority, and after a lengthy debate, to order the executive committee to purchase more bonds of the Republic of Czechoslovakia for $25,000. The debate followed a statement made by the chairman of the executive committee, Mr. J. A. Smejkal, that "the cemetery has $40,000 on hand which ought to be used for the purchase of some good bonds". A motion that Czechoslovak government bonds be bought met with opposition from some of the delegates who were of the opinion that "some good reliable American bonds should be purchased" instead, but after a calm and orderly debate in which other delegates declared that "in the <pb facs="5418478_8_0151.jpg" n="2"/>interest of the old homeland, and in spite of certain risks, such Czechoslovak bonds, which are guaranteed by the present government--customs receipts and the income of tobacco monopoly--should be purchased. F. David moved that $15,000 be used for that purpose. John Kalas thereupon moved that $25,000 be used for the purchase of such bonds. The motion was adopted. After discussing the question in great detail with Vaclav Cipra, who is an expert in these matters, and after further speeches by Messrs. K. Kopecky and V. J. Petrzelka, who....insisted that...."we do our patriotic duty and buy the Czechoslovak bonds," the matter was voted on. Since the mere raising of hands was not found adequate (not clear whether some of the delegates voted for the $15,000 or the $25,000 sum) Mr. Petrzelka moved that all voting be a done by roll call. This resulted in the delegates deciding that the sum of $25,000 be used for the purchase of the Czechoslovak government bonds. About eleven delegates voted for $15,000, and about two or three abstained from voting. No one voted against the purchase. Thus, the last meeting of the Sbor did honor to the delegates when we consider <pb facs="5418478_8_0152.jpg" n="3"/>that on one previous occasion $10,000 was voted for the same purpose, that on all other occasions they always showed themselves generous when any patriotic matter was to be supported financially, and that the Sbor is extremely economical in handling the financial affairs of the Hrbitov.</p>
   <p>The executive committee was ordered to furnish estimates in connection with the proposed enlargement of the columbarium and in connection with the "artistic execution and filling of the empty spaces within the cupola of the crematory."....A request made by the Czechoslovak Legionnaires that the Hrbitov pay the cost of laying the foundation for the monuments to be erected on the graves of two Legionnaires (the monuments to be paid for by the Legionnaire society), was referred to the board of directors. The request of the Ostrostrelci (Sharpshooters), whose society disbanded and who desired that their delegacy be transferred to some other organization, was scrapped.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0153.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>From the plats worked out for the Hrbitov by Architect Vlk, it appears that, according to the survey just completed, the Hrbitov gained somewhat in property rightfully belonging to it, but was not aware that it owned additional property.</p>
   <p>The sum of $1,450 was paid to the Hrbitov for the perpetual care of certain graves. The executive committee of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies Union) paid $300 for the temporary care of the graves of [seven members of the Jednota].....The payroll of the cemetery workers for the month of May was the largest in its history, but there was also more work done this May than in any preceding May. The income for May was $45,034.70; the balance from the previous month was $50,660.74; the balance in the treasury, after making the necessary disbursements, is $59,258.16.</p>
