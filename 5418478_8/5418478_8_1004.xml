   <p>August Sala, born in Bohemia and for many years a resident of Chicago, was a quiet, unassuming man, a glass worker by trade, employed by the California Manufacturing Company. He lived for, and enjoyed, the tranquillity of his home, which he shared with his wife, Mrs. Anna Sala.</p>
   <p>There was, however, a hobby in which he indulged with great passion--that of collecting insects. On Saturdays and Sundays he would take a ride to Riverside and Lyons, usually in the company of his friend, V. Musil, another Chicago Czech. There he hunted for butterflies and beetles, picking them with the judgment of an expert. During the course of many years, he accumulated a great variety of insects, which he preserved in scores of showcases with great skill. He pursued his avocation with great zeal, so that his acquaintances thought him a freak. Sala did not mind his chuckling neighbors--they could not dampen <pb facs="5418478_8_1005.jpg" n="2"/>the spirit of the ambitious collector. He was extremely proud of his beetles and butterflies, for many of them were rare specimens indeed, and he considered his collection a unique one.</p>
   <p>....His entomological activities came to a sudden halt, for death surprised him and left his wife wondering what to do with the maze of queer things that had given her husband such infinite delight. Some friends advised her to sell them to the Field Museum. She had, in the meantime, moved to 1404 South East Avenue, Oak Park. She gave some consideration to the advice, which was offered by Mr. Bambas, 2346 South Kedzie Avenue. An inspiration came to her, however, which lifted the rare collection above the level of mere salable material. She decided to offer it to the Field Museum as a gift.</p>
   <p>Mr. William J. Gerhard, curator of the entomological section of that institute, appeared in person to inspect the collection. He not only expressed his full satisfaction, but declared the collection to be a very valuable one which will <pb facs="5418478_8_1006.jpg" n="3"/>be appreciated by generations to come. He accepted the offer, adding that cach case will be provided with a plate bearing the donor's name, which is Sala-Makovicy now, for she married again.</p>
   <p>The donor is not a woman of means, and she could have made good use of the money which she so nobly relinquished.</p>
