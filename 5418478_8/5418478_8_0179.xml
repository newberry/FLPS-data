   <p>Preparations for your reception on the soil of Czechoslovakia are in progress....Everyone who takes part in the expedition, under the banner of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America), will be warmly received by the people of Czechoslovakia.... After our arrival in Prague, we will be met officially by a number of organizations that will welcome us at the railroad station. The welcome will be spontaneous and brotherly.</p>
   <p>On the Sunday following our arrival, a mass will be celebrated in the Metropolitan Cathedral Church of Saint Vitus. In the evening of the same day a performance of Bedrich Smetana's "Bartered Bride" will be given in the Narodni Divadlo (National Theater of Prague).</p>
   <p>On Monday there will be a reception by the President of the Czechoslovak <pb facs="5418478_8_0180.jpg" n="2"/>Republic, Professor T. G. Masaryk, and in the evening there will be a soiree on the island of Zofin [Translator's note: This island is located on the Moldau River in Prague, and serves many social and aesthetic purposes. Concerts and balls of the better kind are usually given in the Zofin Hall].</p>
   <p>The following few days will be devoted to short trips into the country, and these trips will be advertised in the daily press.... The Fourth of July, our Independence Day, will be celebrated jointly with the American legation at Prague.... To stimulate commercial and social intercourse, a "guide through Prague" will be issued to all the participants of our expedition. This guide will indicate the historically important places of Prague as well as the commercial and industrial concerns owned by Christians. It is therefore desirable that every businessman, worker, farmer, etc., who takes part in our expedition, avail himself of this opportunity, and he may be assured that he will be well taken care of....</p>
   <p>The information bureau will be located in the editorial offices of the periodical <pb facs="5418478_8_0181.jpg" n="3"/>Cech (Czech) [Translator's note: This is a Bohemian Catholic newspaper, the official Catholic publication of Czechoslovakia.] This newspaper is located in the center of Prague; its offices have been reconditioned for our visitors who will find them pleasant and comfortable. Its address is Praha, II, Pstrosova Ulice 200 (Prague II, Pstrosova Street, No. 200) Czechoslovakia. [Write to] the information bureau of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku in Prague.</p>
   <p>We are certain that every participant will be satisfied with the results of our expedition, and that he will bring home the best impressions of the Republic of [Czechoslovakia]. The expedition will have its own news reporter who will regularly supply our American people with news from the homeland; these reports will then be transmitted through the medium of the local press bureau of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku to our local press.....</p>
