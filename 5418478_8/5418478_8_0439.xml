   <p>Dear fellow countrymen: We have been fighting for fully three years in behalf of Czechoslovak independence. For three years we have been willing and eager to contribute to the cause. The decisive moment has now arrived. Our Czechoslovak armies are assembled in France and Russia, which means that we have proclaimed war on Austria-Hungary. Three contingents of our Czechoslovak soldiers from America have already reached the soil of France, there to form the nucleus of the Czechoslovak Army. We consider it the duty of the Czechoslovak in America to pay a self-imposed head tax of five cents per month. This national tax will be used to sustain and boost the fighting strength of the movement for the liberation of our old homeland.</p>
   <p>The Czech National Alliance is addressing itself to all Czech organizations with the request that they incorporate into their statutes a clause concerning this monthly patriotic contribution.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0440.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The national tax is to be delivered by the various organizations to their governing bodies, such as grand lodges, etc., which, in turn, will give the money to the executive committee of the Czech National Alliance in their district.</p>
   <p>We feel confident that all of our societies, associations, clubs, etc., will gladly agree to our expedient suggestion. The national head tax is going to be used for the following purposes:</p>
   <p>1. Financing the political action which aims at the recognition of the rights of our nation.</p>
   <p>2. Traveling expenses, exclusive of railroad and steamship fares, for our volunteers who will fight in France.</p>
   <p>3. Aid for the wounded or crippled volunteers of the Czechoslovak Army in France.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0441.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>4. Exceptional cases of needy families of Czech-American volunteers. </p>
   <p>5. Furthering of the Czech cause in America.</p>
   <p>Czech America has, indeed, always donated generously to the promotion of our national aims. Today, we are fitting out our own army which will fight with the Allies. We have declared war on Austria and have begun a relentless combat. This is the time when our duty demands that we change into sacrifice what we have been giving our nation as mere charity!</p>
   <p>Is there a single member of our organizations who would hesitate to part with as tiny an amount as five cents a month for his people? Where is the Czech who would not be eager to testify in this manner to his allegiance to that heroic nation, which is the most respected among the oppressed nations today, and which has, on that account, the best chances of winning its independence?</p>
   <p>We request all organizations to elect delegates who will represent them in <pb facs="5418478_8_0442.jpg" n="4"/>the Czech National Alliance. The annual dues to the Alliance are five dollars per organization.</p>
   <p>There is not one sincere Czech who would not consider it an honor to contribute gladly and regularly to the great aspirations of his nation in its crucial moment!</p>
   <p>Thousands of our fellow countrymen are shedding their blood at this hour, and hundreds of our volunteers are leaving America for France to sacrifice their lives. We implore you: Do not allow your nation to perish or permit its hopes for a happier future to be blastod!</p>
   <p>Be unanimous in acceding to our request, and show that our ranks in America are kept firm and indestructible. Demonstrate that liberal-thinking America, which is standing up for Czech rights to independence, follows our great leader under the slogan, "We are going to hold out under any circumstances, and we won't give in!"</p>
   <p>We wish you success in your work!</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0443.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>For the Central Committee of the Czech National Alliance: Dr. L. J. Fisher, President, Joseph Tvrzick, Secretary. </p>
