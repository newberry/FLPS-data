   <p>The doors of the Thalia Theatre opened yesterday at noon to allow the throngs of people assembled to enter the auditorium and view with grief the remains of Karel (Charles) Splavec, the well-known and beloved actor. The body lay in state, in front of the state, upon which the deceased had stood so often during the deceniums of his activity in the service of the good and the beautiful. All of the collegues of the departed, actors of the "Ludvikovci" (Ludwik Theatrical Group), were there among hundreds of friends and admirers, their eyes filled with tears. Among the mourners appeared members of the Singing Society Lyra, for which Splavec had a great liking and an ever helping hand; there were many of our artists. After a dirge sung by the Lyre Society, the spokesman of a large group of Croatians delivered a farewell address. After this, Mr. Jaromir R. Psenka, publisher and editor of the Denni Hlasatel, spoke for the Czech fellow-countrymen <pb facs="5418478_8_0928.jpg" n="2"/>of the dead artist.</p>
   <p>A climax in the emotions of the mourners was reached when the orchestra, under the direction of Prof. J. K. Capek, intoned the overture to the play "Strakonicky Dudak" (The Bagpiper of Strakonice), by Antonin Dvorak. The composition has two main subjects: "Kde Domov Muj?" (Where Is My Homeland?), the Czech national anthem, and "Na Tom Nasem Dvore" (Out There in Our Yard), a folk song. Professor Capek could not have made a better selection - the role of "Kalafuna" in the play was one in which Splavec paraded, one of the best in his vast repertory. The funeral march by Chopin closed the obsequies.</p>
   <p>Splavec has ended his earthly pilgrimage. He is no more, but his name will live among us, and his memory will be treasured as an artist of unusual <pb facs="5418478_8_0929.jpg" n="3"/>qualities and as a man with a heart of gold. His remains have been laid at rest in the Bohemian National Cemetery.</p>
