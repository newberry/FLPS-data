   <p>The appointed representatives of the Bohemian people in our native land have issued a truly touching request to all Bohemian people, to all hearts who, thus far, for the sacred cause of our nationals have so dreadfully been tried, to give up all charitable collections of various associations and unite and offer all their talents, otherwise devoted to national purpose only, for the benefit of the Central Liberal School and the two national unions in Bohemia, which have found themselves suddenly in a most violent conflict with the age-old destroyers of Bohemian people, namely, the Germans and their unnatural allies, the Bohemian renegades. In this wild struggle which has broken out, and whose unfavorable results could easily be ill-fated to the life of the entire Bohemian people, all the moral and material assistance of our entire nation is needed. We believe that the American-Bohemians will not neglect their national duty, because their love for their beautiful Bohemian land will again flare up within them. They will give with enthusiasm, according to their means.</p>
   <p>For this reason, we are calling a general meeting for Friday, January 14, at <pb facs="5418478_8_0829.jpg" n="2"/>8 P.M., in order to undertake a definite organization so that we may start activity.</p>
   <p>The manner in which we intend to carry out this general collection will be announced shortly and we hope that it will meet with approval.</p>
