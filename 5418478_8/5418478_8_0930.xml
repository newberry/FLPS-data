  <body>
   <p>Yesterday was a great day for Czech Chicago. It was, alas, a day of parting forever from John Siman, the first president of the American Sokol community, clerk of the city of Chicago, good citizen of this country, who nevertheless had a warm feeling and respect for everything Czech, a man with a heart of gold.</p>
   <p>That he was an outstanding man must have been obvious to all who had come to the Plzen (Pilsen) district yesterday morning. There were great throngs of people near the Pilsen Sokol Hall and automobiles with mourners arrived from every direction. They came to say good-bye to him whom they had known either personally or by his achievements, to render homage to his memory, and to pay tribute to his reputation as a public servant and as a man.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0931.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At 9 A. M. the remains of the departed were taken from the family residence, 2233 S. Ridgeway Avenue, by members of the American Sokol community, while a motorcycle squad of Chicago police led the procession which moved on 22nd street to South Western Avenue, then to 19th Street, and finally to South Ashland Avenue to the home of the Plzen Sokol, where the deceased was placed in the main hall, there to lie in state amidst uncounted floral offerings. Sokols and members of the police force alternated as guards of honor until the beginning of the funeral rites.</p>
   <p>From the moment the coffin was placed in the building, which Simen might well have called his home, lines of men and women clumped toward the doors to cast a glance upon the features of the dead. During this time the great mass of mourners began to assemble from Blue Island Avenue and 18th Street down to the Sokol Hall. There were city and county officials from all departments. Mayor William Hale Thompson arrived with the members of his staff.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0932.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The funeral rites proper began at 1 P. M. with a dirge, sung by the Masonic Quartet, whereupon County Judge Thomas F. Scully remembered the departed and his meritorious activities, mentioning that he had known him from early childhood, that he treasured his acquaintance with the man who had a friendly word for everybody and who knew no difference of political party, nationality, or creed.</p>
   <p>Alderman Merriam then set forth the excellent qualities of the deceased with whom he had been in constant official contact. He made the blunt statement that men of Siman's honesty were veritable rarities in the field of political endeavor. He further emphasized the administrative talent of Siman, and laid stress upon the economies he had introduced and upon the various benefits accruing therefrom for the tax-paying public. Alderman Merriam closed by calling Siman man of whose name the entire city of Chicago may be proud.</p>
   <p>Dr. J. Rudis-Jicinsky was the next speaker (only excerpts translated):</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0933.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"We stand at the threshold of our patheon of great and powerful nature, while time is carving into the marble panel of History: 'John Siman was a good man.' from the time he came to be more closely acquainted with the Sokols his name was being mentioned by every organization. His untiring labor for our Czech cause was crowned by the moment in which he signed the last manifesto. One other great moment in his activities was his address to Dr. Schneiner, who represented the Sokols of the old country in the great convention in Chicago, in which he pointed out the importance of unity in thought and purpose for the Sokols. These words have gained in significance while Siman was active in the unification of the Sokol organization which has always been a thorn in the eyes of the Hapsburgs. Siman was one of the most arduous workers in the Pomocny Vybor (Auxiliary Committee) for the aid of our oppressed nation in the old country. But he did not live to see the full results of his efforts. Yet his work was not in vain, for it shows that he has done his duty as a Sokol.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0934.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The final words in the funeral ceremony were spoken by Mayor William Hale Thompson, who had come to honor the memory of his colleague in the highest offices of the city. He related how he became acquainted with Siman two years ago and how he learaed to value his acquaintance more and more, and how it grew into high esteem, when he continued observing the spirit of devotion with which Siman served the people at the expense of his own interests and health. They had get in the City Hall a few days ago, both afflicted with a cold; the Mayor admonished Siman to take a rest; they both did. But the Mayor returned after a few days, whereas Siman paid with his life for his conscientiousness and sense of duty. He also said that Siman was an assiduous worker and attained his high station in life through his own efforts, for he was the child of poor people; his honesty was his guide in all his actions, and his name should be revered by this and the future generation as a shining example for ambitious youth.</p>
   <p>After the last choral was sung, and the Mayor and other dignitaries of the city and county had left the hall, the remains of John Siman were lifted into the hearse by Sokols, and the convoy then started through the district of Plzen toward the place of burial. Dr. Rubringer's musicians furnished the lugubrious <pb facs="5418478_8_0935.jpg" n="6"/>background. Hundreds of officials, as well as many judges, representatives,and members of organizations to which the departed had belonged, the bereaved relatives, and thousands of friends joined the procession.</p>
   <p>The burial took place in the Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) in the main hall of the crematory.</p>
   <p>While the remains of John Siman lay in state in the hall of the Plzen Sokol, considerable excitement was created when a policeman, one of the guards of honor, suddenly slumped and fell to the floor unconscious. The strong fragrance of the floral offerings had overcome him. He was brought into a side room where he soon recuperated.</p>
