   <p>P.2--Jaroslav Kocian, the celebrated violinist, was welcomed yesterday afternoon in Chicago, arriving from the old homeland, Bohemia, to make another professional tour of America.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kocian, in good health and in splendid humor, arrived from New York and was escorted to the residence of his friend, Mr. Bohumil Kryl, vice-president of the Michigan Central Railroad. At the railroad station he was welcomed by Dr. Vojan, manager of the C. A. T. K. (Bohemian-American Press Bureau), who also represented Denni Hlasatel and Svornost on this occasion.</p>
   <p>The young artist stated that he had had a pleasant journey both by sea and by rail, and he anticipated with pleasure his visit to the Garden City, where he has numerous friends and is much esteemed. He had often thought of them, he said, in his travels through Russia, England, and Bohemia and had ardently longed to revisit them.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0795.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>After a short and friendly conversation which was carried on while he waited in vain for his baggage, which had probably been left at some other station, the young artist left with Mr. Kryl for the latter's residence, where he will be entertained as a guest of honor.</p>
