   <p>When we read Bohemian newspapers from the old homeland, we must wonder what in America arouses their greatest interest. Mention of some interesting event from our Bohemian life, about the influence of our benevolent and building and loan societies, or about our schools, is as scarce in their columns as white crows. However, gossip about American millionaires and distorted reports of crimes committed are frequently published with special zest. We do not know of a single large Pargue newspaper which has a permanent correspondent here who would keep his readers correctly and honestly informed about everything important in our lives. There are about one million Bohemians in America. To a Bohemian nation of seven million people, this proportion should be significant.</p>
   <p>Prague newspapers publish regular reports from Paris, London, St. Petersburg, <pb facs="5418478_8_0758.jpg" n="2"/>and other places, but they do not care about us--sons of the same nation to which we want to remain faithful. It is nice, at least it sounds nice, when mention is made of the sympathy which the Bohemian people enjoy in France. What practical benefit will be derived from this relationship by the Bohemian people? Will the French assist the Bohemians in their national and economic struggle against their age-old enemy? we doubt that an opportunity to do so will ever offer itself and, if it should, that the French would take advantage of it.</p>
   <p>Just after the recent Sokol Slet (Gymnastic Mass Exhibition), where the French were shown the greatest respect, where leading circles and the masses paid so much attention to the French that other guests almost felt snubbed, the City of Prague was negotiating a new loan and turned first to the French financial institutions. These, however, required such conditions that Prague could not accept.</p>
   <p>We believe that among the French people there can be found learned people <pb facs="5418478_8_0759.jpg" n="3"/>who have inclined toward our nation through the study of our wonderful history. We admit that there are hundreds of politicians among them who have realized that the Bohemian people are the greatest obstacle to the realization of the Pan-Germanic dream. But we absolutely do not believe that the Bohemian nation can derive any practical benefit from its friendship toward the French nation.</p>
   <p>In us, however, our motherland has an always will have devoted and generous brothers; it will have them in our children and grandchildren who will always feel favorable toward the Bohemians even if they are not masters of the Bohemian language. In Bohemia many consider us lost. But they cannot deny that active collections are made among us for all national purposes; that we send money to the victims of natural disasters; and that at every opportunity we prove our love for them. If they were wise and far-sighted, they would endeavor to make use of this fact. They would try to get as much as possible from us. They would notice us, encourage us, create the warmest contacts with us.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0760.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>However, until we read something else in the Prague newspapers besides the rascalities carried on by some American millionaire; as long as the source of information about America is that of journalists a la "Arizona Kicher"; as long as large Bohemian newspapers do not bother to see that they are regularly and truthfully informed about American matters, especially Bohemian-American, we shall not be able to believe that leading Bohemian circles have a correct understanding and evaluation of the Bohemian branch in America.</p>
