<title level="a">BOHEMIAN MALE QUARTETTE IN PILSEN SOKOL HALL.</title></bibl>

   <p>p. 1, col. 3.. Yesterday evening in the Pilsen Sokol hall there was actually a holiday evening, an evening such as is seldom offered for the enjoyment of the general public. A quartette of Bohemian vocal artists appeared there, who have gained world fame while touring the world. The Bohemian quartette sang in Pilsen for the last time yesterday. For that reason, no lover of song, no lover of art, allowed the opportunity to hear them to pass. The Quartette prepared a surprising program for this farewell occasion.</p>
   <p>It is unnecessary to go into detail about the accomplishments of our artists. Many words of praise have been uttered about them; they do not need them, for their fame has reached all strata of the Bohemian people in this land and everyone knows on hearing the name of the Bohemian Quartette mentioned, that it pertains to four singers whose voices are firm as steel, ringing and crystal pure as a diamond, whose recitation is moving, overwhelming and irresistable.</p>
   <p>This was demonstrated during their appearance yesterday in Pilsen hall, where the public listened to them with rapt attention, calling them forth after each <pb facs="5418478_8_0821.jpg" n="2"/>number with stormy applause. Our artists were generous to the public last night, for they gave an encore after almost every number.</p>
   <p>The quartette left the finest impression upon the listeners; they left a pleasant remembrance and at the same time leaving many admirers who will await their next visit in America with eagerness. The Bohemian Quartette will remain in Chicago until Sunday and will give two more concerts before their departure. These concerts will be held Sunday afternoon in the hall at 48th and Honore Streets in Town of Lake and Sunday evening in the Sokol Chicago hall at 24th Street and Kedzie Avenue. That will be the final concert of the quartette in Chicago. Whoever missed the opportunity of hearing them will have an opportunity to do so at these last concerts.</p>
