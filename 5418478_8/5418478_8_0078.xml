  <body>
   <p>p. 1.. The American newspaper, Record-Herald, printed an article in its Sunday edition about undesirable immigrants in which it throws us into one and the same bag with the Italians, the Greeks, the Slovaks, and others, who come to America in the springtime, work hard, save money, and leave in fall to go back to their homeland.</p>
   <p>The paper advocates the passing of a law to prevent these people from entering our land. Congressman Sabath, before leaving for Washington, sent an elucidating letter to the editor which was printed in full by the paper under the caption "Stands up for the Czechs," and reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"I have carefully perused your article, headlined 'Exodus of Immigrants.' In it you unjustly advocate the exclusion of certain immigrants. In order to demonstrate to you that your views are incorrect, and without foundation, I take the liberty of quoting your passage: 'It is widely known that a great number of Hungarians, Italians, Czechs and others return to their country every fall, because the mines, railroads and other enterprises turn out thousands of workers. These workingmen take along the money that they have earned. They <pb facs="5418478_8_0079.jpg" n="2"/>use their savings to pay mortgages and other liabilities incumbent on their properties, while some live on savings until the following spring, when they hope to regain their old jobs. The immigration laws hold no terror for them, for they know how to circumvent them, and always have money enough to gain entrance.'</p>
   <p>"If you refer with these words to the Czechs also, you are doing an injustice to them without doubt, on account of inadequate knowledge of the conditions. The Czech immigrant is an ingenuous, liberty loving, honest and diligent workman. He comes to this country in search of liberty, guaranteed to him by our constitution, and which is denied to him in his old homeland.</p>
   <p>"He aspires to become a citizen and to build up an existence; he tends to his work, and is law-abiding; he puts away his savings, and in the long run settles down in his own little house which fulfills one of his most cherished hopes. He becomes quickly Americanized, and does not give the remotest thought to a return to the old country.</p>
   <p>"By a more pains-taking study of the immigration statistics you will become convinced of the insufficiency of your information. Your article is correct in so far as it does not refer to Czechs specifically as taking money back, <pb facs="5418478_8_0080.jpg" n="3"/>because it is not true that they save money here, and then return home. I hope you will readjust your article, as I believe it was not your intention to insult the Czech people."</p>
   <p>The Record-Herald printed this amendment on its editorial page where it certainly shall arrest the attention of the public. From the foregoing can be concluded that when the American language papers take a fling at us, it is rather because of faulty information than of any unfriendly attitude, and that they are amendable to a hint from a man of the caliber of Congressman Sabath, who will always say a word in defense of his constituency.</p>
