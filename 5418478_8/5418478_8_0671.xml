   <p>Paris, October 1, 1914.</p>
   <p>Countrymen: Through centuries, our nation has been fighting for liberty and for the preservation of its national rights. Several times it succeeded in regaining its independence, only to lose it again and again.</p>
   <p>It has been suffering for many years under the Austrian yoke. The whole Bohemian nation--Bohemians, Moravians, Silesians, and Slovaks--has keenly felt the subjugation and oppression by the Austro-Hungarian government.</p>
   <p>The greatest desire of all liberal-thinking Bohemians has been to shake the government of unjust Austrian tyrants once and for all, to raise their nation to the level of other nations in Europe, and to lead the nation, as a peer among its peers, to a beautiful life of freedom, happiness, and culture.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0672.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>They have only been waiting for the proper moment.</p>
   <p>Today, when the whole civilized world stands partly in actual war, partly in ideological opposition, against the German imperialism and the domineering spirit of Austria, the time has come for us to join the civilized world and to defend our liberty as well as the liberty of all oppressed nations.</p>
   <p>Our people in Bohemia are being watched too well and threatened too much by the Austrian bayonets and Prussian guns to stand up and demand their rights.</p>
   <p>It is therefore up to us, Bohemians living outside of the country, to take advantage of this opportunity and work for the liberation of our brothers and sisters in the Bohemian lands.</p>
   <p>We here in Paris put our hands to it during the first few days after the war <pb facs="5418478_8_0673.jpg" n="3"/>had broken out. All local countrymen of ours refused to return and join the Austrian army, and those who were able-bodied immediately enlisted in the French Army, eager to fight our common enemy, the Germans. By doing this we have proved that we are real friends of the French nation, and our political committee succeeded, through an appeal to the President of the French Republic, to the minister of war, to the Governor of the City of Paris, and to the Russian Ambassador to France, in having the Bohemians officially recognized as a nation of friends of France and Russia (sic) [the wording is not very clear, but it does not say "allied"]. The political committee is continuing now in its activities to acquire new and influential political friends, and, with the publication of a new French-Bohemian paper, Na Zdar (To Success), we are winning the hearts of the French public.....</p>
   <p>The political committee has accomplished all of this practically without any financial means except the little which its members could contribute <pb facs="5418478_8_0674.jpg" n="4"/>out of their own pockets. The continuation of this work is possible only with the support of our American countrymen, because until now it has been impossible to get in touch with influential factors at home, and therefore it seems quite impossible to rely on any support from that source.</p>
   <p>Knowing our American countrymen's unselfish patriotism, their usual readiness to perform sacrifices, we ask you in behalf of all those who love their country and desire to see an independent Bohemian State soon to support our action as much as you possibly can. We addressed you by cable at the time of the formation of our volunteer division, but so far have not received any reply. Therefore, (and because the prevailing diplomatic conditions make it imperative to be ready for immediate action at any moment), we ask you to comply with our request by return mail.</p>
   <p>For the political committee,</p>
   <p>[There follows a list of seven names.]</p>

   <p>Paris, September 12, 1914.</p>
   <p>I am certain to express the opinion of all my colleagues of the Municipal Council of the City of Paris, an opinion which will be shared by all of France, if I call the publication of your new paper most welcome.</p>
   <p>A long time ago near Cressy, one of your most august rulers, the brave John of Luxemburg, lost his life in the service of our country. The ties of sympathy that existed then between Bohemia and France have never been forgotten, and you are still our friends. As a result of occasional visits which we have exchanged with the Municipal Council of the City of Prague, we are glad and proud to say that the French cause has become dear to your hearts.</p>
   <p>As far as we are concerned, you know that we love you very much, and we thank you for your efforts to become mutually well acquainted.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0676.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Please accept the expression of our deepest esteem.</p>
   <p>President of the Municipal Council, A. Mithouard</p>
   <p>This proclamation was received by us from the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau) in this morning's mail, together with a recommendation and explanation to the Bohemian public. According to the cancellation stamp, the letter was mailed yesterday at 3 P.M., and its senders should have known that we could not get it in time for complete publication today. Therefore, we have published at least the proclamation, but the article by the Kancelar has been withheld. </p>
