   <p>Professor Jaroslav J. Zmrhal, principal of Herzl Grammar School, has returned from Washington D. C., where he was appointed delegate of the National Educational Association to the Czechoslovak Republic. He is now preparing an exhibition, which he intends to take with him to Prague, Czechoslovakia, where he will act as an assistant superintendent of education. This exhibition will consist of schoolwork of many pupils of the lower grades, in Chicago and other cities. Professor Jaroslav J. Zmrhal intends to transfer this entire exhibition to his new offices in Prague, Czechoslovakia, which he will have at his disposal during the time he is reorganizing the schools of Czechoslovakia. He will depart from the United States during the last week of March and will be accompanied by Dr. Mach, who accepted the Chair of Dentistry at the University of Bratislava, Czechoslovakia.</p>
