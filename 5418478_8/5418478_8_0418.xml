<title level="a">MEETING FOR CZECHOSLOVAK INDEPENDENCE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>In these times, when the German hordes have invaded Russia, and the Austrian slavers' army is swarming over the Ukraine and the big cities that once were the camps of our glorious army, and where, in the land of the Volga, tens of thousands of Czechs are settled--in these times our people in the motherland, true to their traditions, speak to the world in words consonant with the prompting of their conscience.</p>
   <p>Their voice is smothered; Czech papers cannot reach the outer world to demonstrate the determination and courage of the Czechoslovak people, they are suppressed by the Austrian censor.</p>
   <p>Our workers for Czechoslovak independence have succeeded, nevertheless, in obtaining a document of great value, the Narodni Listy (National Newspaper), in which the gigantic demonstrations of the masses of workers and the statements by Czech representatives in the parliament are described.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0419.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are also in possession of a proclamation issued by the Austrian prime minister by authority of Emperor Karl. This proclamation and the Czechs' answer to it should be heard by everyone. We must seek to make this proclamation and its answer known in Washington, so that the voice of the Czech people will influence the peace overtures made to the Government of the United States by the Austrian minister, Count Czernin.</p>
   <p>To this end the Czechoslovak people will hold a demonstration Tuesday evening. Speeches will be given in Czech, Slovak, and English. The position of our people, their attitudes and demands, will be discussed in the presence of representatives of the English-language press. From this meeting resolutions will be sent to the President and to other governmental officials. The proclamations of Count Czernin, minister of foreign affairs, the Austrian premier, and, of course, the report on the manifestations of the Czech people and their representatives, will also be sent out.</p>
   <p>It is evident that this meeting should play an extremely important role in <pb facs="5418478_8_0420.jpg" n="3"/>securing the liberty of our Czechoslovak people. It will be shown that the Czechs and Slovaks of America are ready to support their nation in the old homeland, because it demands only what is recognized by general principles to be the right of all nations, liberty, independence, and self-determination. By the declaration of its representatives our nation proclaims that it insists that its demands for independence should conform with the slogan, "Liberty or Death". The demonstration will begin at 8 P. M., Tuesday, in the auditorium of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, 26th Street and Lawndale Avenue, and is sponsored by the Czech National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics and the Slovak League.</p>
