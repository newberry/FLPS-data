   <p>All Czechoslovak America is filled with deep emotion and joy, over the memorable events of yesterday and today. Telegrams heralded the glad tidings that the Czechoslovak people has proclaimed its independence, in a document issued by the provisional government of the Czechoslovak Republic, and has stated the principles upon which it was built. We are publishing the news of this most significant act in our history, which was indorsed by President Wilson.</p>
   <p>In answering Austro-Hungarian peace proposals, the President declared that the cannot accept the mere granting of autonomy for the Czechoslovak people under Austrian rule. The President declared that he does not consider it within his province to decide on this point, and that it is left to the Czechoslovak people to decide for themselves what steps should be taken in this matter. It is up to the Austro-Hungarian Government to see how it will be able to satisfy the rights and aspirations of the <pb facs="5418478_8_0271.jpg" n="2"/>Czechoslovak people, according to its conceptions as a future member of the family of free nations.</p>
   <p>This solemn declaration by President Wilson is one of the most significant points in our fight for independence. Such glorious events must be celebrated in a befitting manner.</p>
   <p>The Czech National Alliance requests every Czech and Slovak to decorate their houses with red and white, our national colors.</p>
   <p>Decorate, and manifest your joy over the birth of the Czechoslovak Republic, and the President's solemn declaration!</p>
