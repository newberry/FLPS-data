   <p>p. 1--Chicago Bohemians, the majority of them Sokols, held a meeting last evening to make necessary arrangements for a contemplated excursion to Czechoslovakia in the near future.</p>
   <p>Mr. Polivka presided at this meeting which consisted of eighty persons who were interested in joining this excursion.</p>
   <p>It was announced and approved that the North German Lloyd Steamship Line would be used during this excursion, and the Bohemian steamship ticket office of J. F. Skala &amp; Co. was recommended as the most capable to handle the reservations. It was agreed upon to reserve one hundred (100) cabins of which seventy (70) were already reserved by those who were sure to join this excursion. The other thirty (30) cabins were held for those who were expected to join later.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0806.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The excursion is to leave Chicago on June 1, 1907, and will stop to view the Niagara Falls the following day and will continue on that same evening going east to New York, from where it would sail on June 3, 1907.</p>
   <p>A farewell banquet was to be given at a later date at which all members of the excursion were requested to be present. The proceeds of this banquet is to be taken to Prague, Czechoslovakia, by an appointed committee consisting of prominent Bohemians who are participating in the excursion. There this fund is to be donated to some worthy cause which would benefit the homeland.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian people love to travel; therefore they visit their homeland quite often.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian Sokols (gymnastic organization) hold their meets regularly in Prague, Czechoslovakia. This organization has many branches in Chicago and other parts of the United States.</p>
