   <p>In the absence of president E. St. Vraz, the meeting of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada (Bohemian-American National Council) was called to order by Mr. Joseph Triner.</p>
   <p>Professor J. J. Zmrhal explained that a bill has been passed by the United States Senate, according to which any European emigrant who might sin against the American Government while here, or merely inspire some act which would be directed against it, or if he should write anything which the Government considered as an attack against itself, could be deported. This legislation is being protested, not only by all emigrants but by Americans themselves, and already there have been noted many manifestation meetings in almost all cities, at which sharp resolutions have been adopted, and transmitted to both houses of Congress and to the President of the United States. A mass meeting will be held next Sunday in the Auditorium, and our countrymen are invited to attend <pb facs="5418478_8_0056.jpg" n="2"/>that meeting as numerously as possible. A special appeal is made to societies and corporations to take interest in the matter, and to take definite action to aid in defeating the proposal.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the Congressional Committee to which the bill was referred, Congressman Fitzgerald of New York, to whom the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada wrote in this case, promised to do everything possible to prevent passage of the bill by the House. Attention has been called to the serious dangers of this bill which is directed against immigration and it is, therefore, our duty to place ourselves on guard immediately. The meeting to be held in the Auditorium is to be addressed by some nationally popular speaker. It will be either W. J. Bryan, T. Roosevelt or W. Wilson.</p>
   <p>Mr. [Jindrich] Ort moved that a resolution be prepared and that a committee of five members be elected to prepare the resolution and send it to Congress. The committee elected consists of: Professor J. J. Zmrhal, Frank J. Petru, Dr. J. E. S. Vojan, Jindrich Ort, R. Jaromir Psenka, with Mr. Hospodsky as scribe.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0057.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At the same time a communication, in the name of the Bohemian people of Chicago, is to be sent to the meeting in the Auditorium. The committee will meet Wednesday at 8 P. M. at the Press Club. The annual meeting of the Cesko-Americka Narodni Rada will be held on Friday, May 31, at 8 P. M.</p>
