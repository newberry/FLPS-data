   <p>All nationalities, whose countrymen are moving in great numbers to this land, have societies, which have as their purpose the protection of their immigrant countrymen against unconscionable and evil-doing people, against oppression by officials, against exposition to the many vampires awaiting the immigrant at ports of entry, which also strive to advise their countrymen, and are helpful in the search for employment and the founding of the new home. Only we Bohemians, have nothing of the kind. Our national societies continually work on plans for the expansion of their ranks so as to assure their existence. We think that they have no better opportunity for this than when they prove to the immigrant, immediately upon his arrival in this country, that they actually practise true benevolence, and that love of their countrymen is not a mere farce with them. Every immigrant who in this manner <pb facs="5418478_8_0103.jpg" n="2"/>would become acquainted with our national and welfare organizations, would surely become their friend, and just as soon as it was possible for him, he would become a member also. Especially our liberal-minded, purely nationalistic societies should quickly take hold of this situation, because it might so happen, that they will be forestalled by sectarians and others, whose aims are not of the best.</p>
