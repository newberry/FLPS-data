   <p>"Great, glorious tidings have arrived in the metropolis of Czechoslovak America. With joyful hearts we are making the announcement to the Czech and the Slovak people that our beloved 'Daddy' Masaryk, the 'Grand Old Man,' dear to every Czech and Slovak heart, has arrived on American shores, to be welcomed in a few days bythousands of his loyal people.</p>
   <p>"After the terrible days of the Russian Revolution, which he endured with grief in that country itself; after a lordly sojourn among Czechoslovak soldiers in the Russian Army; after times of privation and suffering, this dear old man has come to be greeted by us. We shall gaze at the kindly countenance and listen to his energetic message on the pursuit of our struggle.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0411.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The 'Empress of Asia,' with Professor Thomas G. Masaryk aboard, arrived in Vancouver, British Columbia, on April 29, after a voyage of ten days. Our leader will step off the train at the Northwestern Station, Madison and Canal Streets, this Sunday at 2 P. M. He will be accompanied by Mr. Charles Pergler, who went to Vancouver to welcome him to our American soil. Three Chicago leaders are at St. Paul, Minnesota, for his reception. They are Dr. Ludvik Fisher, president of the Czech National Alliance, Reverend John Kestl, president of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics in America, and Mr. O. Schustek, president of the Slovak League.....</p>
   <p>"We have been fighting for three long, hard years in Masaryk's name. For three years the value of his work was doubted, and his aims were snubbed. Now the moment has come when there will be an end to slights and checks, when we shall look into his eyes and soul, when tens of thousands will welcome him on the streets of Chicago.</p>
   <p>"Thomas Garigue Masaryk, our pride and our strength, our hope and our pillar:</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0412.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Hail to Thee!</p>
   <p>"We shall receive him in a manner befitting a king, as a representative of our nation--of that tortured nation, of that fighting nation, of that nation that cannot be conquered in its great, sacred love for its rights and liberty. We shall greet him as the leader of the revolutionary Czechoslovak Army of liberty.....</p>
   <p>"We are appealing to Czechoslovak Chicago to participate in the mass meeting which will be held next Sunday at which our people will loudly proclaim their loyalty to our nation. Let the streets from the Northwestern depot to Michigan Boulevard be lined with our people!....Let this wonder in the Czechoslovak history of America become a reality that we can see our leader here in person!...."</p>
   <p>Arrangements for the festive reception will be discussed in a meeting at the hall <pb facs="5418478_8_0413.jpg" n="4"/>of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs on April 30, and leaders of our organizations will be present.</p>
