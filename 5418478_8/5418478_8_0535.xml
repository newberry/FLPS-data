   <p>The Denni Hlasatel has received the following letter with the request that it be forwarded to the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance) in Chicago:</p>
   <p>"Dear Friends:  Circumstances compel us to write to you, as the representatives of the Bohemian nation in America, and to ask you to intervene for us with a letter to the local town council and to the Canadian government.  Working in the local coal mines here, there are 115 Austrians and Germans, all of whom are considered England's enemies, although we have told the authorities that we are Bohemians.  There are really only fifteen Germans here, and the rest are Slavs who do not even know the German language. The English do not want to work with us, being afraid that we might cause some explosion or fire, so they want to start a strike.  The officials do not know what to do; they threaten to send us into a camp.  We should very much appreciate anything you can do for us, and we promise to continue supporting the Bohemian cause.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0536.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Sincerely,</p>
   <p>"Alber Vavera,</p>
   <p>"Box 286, Springhill, Nova Scotia, Canada."</p>
   <p>The letter was accompanied by five dollars, which we have returned. No doubt the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni will take up this matter and do all they can to help our countrymen in Springhill. But such is the lot of our countrymen everywhere. The aims and desires of our nation are so little known that we are being considered Austrians not only by the people in Canada, but also by the British and French, who should know more about us. It was quite a task to achieve decent treatment of our countrymen in France, and this matter has not been settled until very recently in Great Britain. But we are sure that this case in Canada will be properly adjusted in due time.....</p>
