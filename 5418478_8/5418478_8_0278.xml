<title level="a">ABOUT CZECHOSLOVAKS</title></bibl>

   <p>One of the most widely circulated American weeklies is the Saturday Evening Post, founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1728. In this week's issue there is an article on the Czechoslovaks which is one of the best and most sympathetic ever written about us in America.</p>
   <p>Charles Downer Hazen, the author, describes with rare understanding our century-old struggle for liberty. He emphasizes it with the obvious intention of making the American reader acquainted with our past history.</p>
   <p>He dwells upon the years of oppression which we have had to endure, and particularly--and this is rarely found in the American press--passes judgment on the current misconception of what is called the chivalry of the Magyar nation, which outdid even Austria, whenever it came to oppressing the Slav nations.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0279.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Hazen, in the introduction to his article, asks: "Who are the Czechoslovaks? The entire world is speaking of their glory, and yet, it is safe to contend that the majority of those interested in them, and praising their deeds, hardly know how to pronounce their name, or know any particulars about them. This in spite of the fact that Czechoslovaks live in the heart of Europe and can boast of a thousand years' history, which appears sometimes in a brilliant light, at other times, tragic--a people independent in the Middle Ages, then groaned for years under Austrian rule, and today is seeking liberty and the establishment of an independent state of its own among other free nations--a people whose inestimable services, rendered to the Allies, are sufficient proof of their ability to direct its own destinies.</p>
   <p>"The Czechoslovaks have been for four hundred years under the rule of the Hapsburgs, who are now trying to break their spirit because of their search for freedom. These aspirations will be a reality when the Allies win. An independent Czechoslovak state should be an issue of the World War".....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0280.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In closing his article Mr. Hazen says: "After four years of combat and suffering the Czechoslovaks have erected the structure of their independent state, which is only waiting for victory in order to become a fact. Thus the Czechoslovaks will not be found unprepared when the time comes for them to solve their political problems.</p>
   <p>"All that remains to be done is to overthrow Austrian control--and Bohemia will be free.</p>
   <p>The famous words pronounced by Palacky, one of the most eminent Czechs of fifty years ago, are about to come true. He said: "We existed before Austria and will exist after it."</p>
   <p>"A new Czechoslovak state has been promised by the democratic states, and they will fulfill that pledge with their lives. Czechoslovakia will thus represent, in the heart of Europe, the principles of government and social life to which our new homeland has dedicated itself. We should consider it a high honor and a priceless <pb facs="5418478_8_0281.jpg" n="4"/>opportunity to aid in building a Czechoslovak state. If we are concerned with the liberation of the world, our responsibility becomes high and our duty clearly defined."</p>
