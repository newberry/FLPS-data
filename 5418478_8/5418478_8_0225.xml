  <body>
   <p>Jaroslav F. Smetanka has been appointed by the Czechoslovak Republic as its first Consul for the Chicago district. Coincident with entering upon his new duties, he severs his editorial connection with the Czechoslovak Review.</p>
   <p>Before and since the first appearance of this publication, Mr. Smetanka has consistently striven to place before the thinking public the cause of the Bohemian and Slovak people. In this he has been singularly successful. Rightly, he belongs to that band of seers led by President Masaryk, who first conceived the practical means of realizing the ideal of an independent Czechoslovakia.</p>
   <p>Principally through Mr. Smetanka's efforts our American public was brought face to face with the oppressed Slavs of Central Europe. His presentation of their aspirations and ambitions was lucid, accurate and simple. Its force carried conviction. Being one of the foremost American journalists of Czechoslovak origin, his forceful personality will be sadly missed by the Czechoslovak Review.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_8_0226.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Nevertheless, we have the satisfaction of knowing that he will give his energies to useful work in which his training and abilities will serve the Czechoslovak people. An intimate acquaintance of almost twenty years convinces us that the confidence bestowed has not been misplaced.</p>
