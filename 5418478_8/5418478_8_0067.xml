  <body>
   <p>The Commission appointed by Congress to investigate conditions in the Immigration Department--primarily on Ellis Island, New York--rendered its report.</p>
   <p>From its report, it appears that the Commission has come to the conclusion that the present method of secret proceedings during the examination of immigrants should be discontinued; that the Examining Commission should constitute a body fully independent of the Immigration Commissioners. The Examining Commission should be made up of men who are capable and free from prejudices of all kinds.</p>
   <p>The report of the Congressional Committee shows that this body recognizes <pb facs="5418478_8_0068.jpg" n="2"/>that there is something rotten in the Immigration Department--something which should be removed or corrected. It is something altogether different from what our Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Nagel, under whose jurisdiction the Immigration Department is operated, said publicly. Mr. Nagel is a German, and it was chiefly the German National Council, which in its last session, sharply criticized the practices of the Immigration officials and called upon their countryman Mr. Nagel to see to it that relief is obtained. But Mr. Nagel proclaims that everything is in good order on Ellis Island, and that if some mistake is made, it is not done purposely.</p>
   <p>In short, Mr. Nagel approves the manner in which the immigrants' entry into this country is rendered hard and even impossible.</p>
