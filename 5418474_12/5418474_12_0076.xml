   <p>The former publisher-printer, died yesterday, deliberately, by ending his life with a revolver bullet at his home, 307 West Division Street, 9 P.M. He was well known, since his various activities brought him in contact with a large part of the population. He probably never was happy during his entire life, since his inherent nervousness and haste with which he always labored, precluded him from realizing outstanding success. He was blameless, yet his life proved a chain of misfortunes. He left German-Bohemia at the tender age of 11 years, became a printer's apprentice of the "Seeboten" (Sea-Messenger) Milwaukee.</p>
   <p>After his adolescence, a few years before the Chicago fire, he published a labor paper, "The Friend of Progress" but without pecuniary benefit accruing to him. The labor question was of paramount importance to him; therefore he functioned in very numerous instances as speaker in Assemblies;-organized trade-brother- <pb facs="5418474_12_0077.jpg" n="2"/>hoods and published a booklet, entitled: "The Labor Movement of The Present." Amongst his acquaintances he often declared and showed, that he actually was the "first one" who founded the now popular labor and 8 hour movement; the he only retired, after radical elements obtained the upper-hand. He also published articles in other newspapers, the Staats Zeitung, issuing them at intervals. A friend, visited by a reporter ascribes the act to suicide to the lack of financial success which his literary efforts produced. Lichtner was 47 years old, a member of many clubs, a typesetter in New Orleans, Louisville and Indianapolis before Chicago's fire.</p>
   <p>He left his family in fair circumstances.</p>
