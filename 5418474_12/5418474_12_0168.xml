   <p>To the Editor of the Tribune.</p>
   <p>Chicago, June 30th. The office of Mayor, soon to be vacant, must be filled by an election on the 12th. Many good names have been mentioned, names of gentlemen, who are doubtless well qualified for the position. But I desire to suggest the name of a well known and very popular citizen, who is preeminently qualified for Mayor. From his earliest manhood he has been a leading spirit among the people and has enjoyed their suffrages and their confidence. He was Mayor of the city of Mannheim in Germany, when comparatively a youth. He was also a member of the parliament at Frankfort and was afterwards elected President of the Republic of Basen, which his genius, eloquence and great influence had mainly contributed to revolutionize, and whose people, instead of the grand duke, were made sovereigns. After the republic was overthrown by the aid of Austria, President Brentano, who with many other heroes and patriots (among them Siegel and Hecker) were condemned to death as traitors, sought an asylum in this country, and for over seventeen years has made Chicago his home. Although an able lawyer, he was a grand success so an editor, as all the patrons of the Illinois Staats-Zeitung, which he made the leading German paper in the West in 1860 will bear witness.</p>

   <p>Mr. Brentano ably and creditably served one city in the Legislature and also in the Board of Education. He is a large propertyholder, and in every way greatly interested in the growth and prosperity of our city. This election would insure a first class man as one Mayor, one who would be a credit to one city, and capable of discharging his duties with honor to himself and to the entire satisfaction of our people.</p>
