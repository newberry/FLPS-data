   <p>Dear Sir:</p>
   <p>You will without doubt be surprised, in view of our unfriendly relations shortly before my departure, to receive a letter from me. But I have received a copy of the Chicago Tribune, which contains surprising revelations concerning your financial difficulties. This information brings me genuine sorrow. I can give you the assurance that the report of this misfortune which has befallen you, makes me forget all the harsh things your paper had to say about me, while I was performing my sworn duty. Shortly before my departure, I had heard some rumors that you had advanced a considerable security for the Garden City Manufacturing Company. But I was of the opinion that the amount did not exceed thirty to forty thousand dollars and I knew that you could easily shoulder this burden. But when I now learn that through your endorsements your responsibilities reach a quarter of a million, besides your heavy losses through the fire, I cannot help but feel a most sincere sympathy; then I cannot forget that we both are beyond fifty, that physically our best days are behind us and that life becomes uncertain at the approach of sixty. Without doubt <pb facs="5418474_12_0201.jpg" n="2"/>you will face this misfortune valiantly; but it is a very heavy burden to carry; the interests alone devour one as a consuming fire; they require the merit of a good business and always let the mountain of capital hover over one's head, constantly threatening to fall down and to annihilate us. I consider my loss through the fire pretty big, but it is nothing in comparison with the burden you have to carry. I respect your decision to pay the debt and I hope you will be able to do so, earlier than you expect. I cannot forget that but for our unfriendly relations from 72 to 73, we have always been true friends from 1854 to 1872, and have worked together harmoniously in all public matters. In the hope that matters will adjust themselves and I remain in remembrance of old times,</p>
   <p>Your devoted friend,</p>
   <p>Joseph Medill.</p>
  </body>
