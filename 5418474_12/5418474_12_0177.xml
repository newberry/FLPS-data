   <p>The insolence of the English newspapers, Tribune, Times, Inter-Ocean and Journal reached its highest point yesterday in reproducing an old story of bribery of which A. C. Hesing was the object.</p>
   <p>In April 1875, just before the city convention, Mr. Hesing received the following letter, "Chicago, April 7, 1875. A. C. Hesing: Inclosed you will find $20 in consideration of which I beg you to use your influence to secure for me the position of police court clerk. Should I get the nomination come and get $20 more.</p>
   <p>Yours truly,</p>
   <p>Joseph Liness"</p>
   <p>Mr. Hesing was indignant and when the turn for the police court nomination came at the convention, he arose, showed the $20 bill, and declared that a man who expects to get the nomination through bribery should not get it. Liness did not get the nomination.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_12_0178.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Hesing gave the money to a women's club for wounded soldiers, under the direction of Mrs. Magnus, and Liness had the audacity later to claim the money. Mr. Hesing refused to return it, was indicted, but the Supreme Court decided that Liness no longer had any claim on the money. But the Tribune, although its editors, and Mr. Medill in particular, know the facts very well, deliberately lies by stating that Mr. Hesing kept the money for himself. This shows how diabolical are the means used by the Law and Order party to defeat the candidates of the opposition.</p>
