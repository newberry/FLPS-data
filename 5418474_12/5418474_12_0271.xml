   <p>Katherine Spohrer, perhaps the oldest German female settler of Chicago, born in Weingarten, Baden, died here last Thursday at the age of 78 years. She came to Chicago with her husband in 1833 at the time when the Indians still were here where later on was Diversey's Brewery (near the present main water works.) They sold at that time ten acres of land near town for $200 and the present Lincoln Park could be had at $1.25 per acre.</p>
   <p>Her Husband who was a mason and later a gardener, bought three acres of land on Clark and Division Streets, for $280. He died twelve years ago. Mr. Spohrer remained after the death of her husband at the old homestead. Mrs. Spohrer saw the development of Chicago from its beginning to a city of the world having half a million inhabitants as it has been permitted to a very few and it is a pity, that it is too late to get her statements of the first view of the town and the first Germans living here.</p>
