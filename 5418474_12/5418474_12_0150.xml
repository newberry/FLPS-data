   <p>The appointment of Wilhelm Vocke as member of the Board of Education by Mayor Heath, has become nullified through the absence of ten members of the City Council at that session. Mr. Vocke is a self-made man who, through his great ambition and diligence became one of the well-known German-Americans of Chicago. Born at Minden (Prussia) in the year 1839, he emigrated at the age of seventeen to America. He found work in New York and later in Massachusetts, sometimes as a clerk in a grocery store and sometimes as a factory worker. He not only made a living for himself, but supported his family in Germany.</p>
   <p>He came to Chicago in 1857 and the struggle to make a living began anew. He did not scoff even at the hardest handwork, that of road building, a fact of which he is proud. He became a newsboy in the year 1859 and found time enough to complete his general education with the intention of studying law, which was his heart's desire.</p>
   <p>At the outbreak of the war in 1861 he enlisted in the army and served the country three and a half years, during which time he rose to the rank of a <pb facs="5418474_12_0151.jpg" n="2"/>colonel. Returning to Chicago he joined (under Brentano) the staff of the Staats-Zeitung and in 1865 became police court reporter. In the year 1867 he was admitted to the bar. Finally in 1869 he started to practice law and soon enjoyed an excellent reputation. But he kept on studying and was considered by the Philosophic Society of Chicago to be one of those members whose lectures are followed with special interest and are always greatly acclaimed. He carried his activities even into the literary field when through his translation into the English he introduced to the American people the German poet Rodenberg.</p>
   <p>Mayor Heath was inspired to the appointment of Mr. Vocke as a member of the School Board by his mode of living and his education, and by the fact that he was as much of an American as he was a German. He was in full accord with the liberally minded views of the Germans, but could also fully satisfy the wishes and requirements of the Americans. Several of the members of the City Council who voted against Mr. Vocke's appointment, are his personal enemies and are low enough in character to spread lies about his attitude toward the School Board's activities.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_12_0152.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But lies are short lived....As a member of the School Board he would have the distinction of being one of the most diligent, best fitted and most honest of men.</p>
