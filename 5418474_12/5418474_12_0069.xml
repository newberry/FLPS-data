   <p>An Exalting and Enthusiastic Festival.</p>
   <p>The public celebration, the silver anniversary of the priest, Karl Rosenbauer's office tenure at the Catholic St. Alphonsus Church, which was given yesterday evening at Lincoln Turnhall, became a glorious ovation. Within one hour, after the doors were opened for admission, a multitude of festively adorned parish members and friends appeared, upon the floor and gallery. The festivities were opened with a speech by the Rev. Father, wherein he expressed in a few touching words, how he esteems the good wishes and the visit of his friends in such numbers. After the completion of his short address, a tremendous, reverberating burst of greeting, accompanied by a trumpet fanfare vibrated into the air such as this hall never experienced before. The Arion Male Chorus presented him with a magnificent bouquet of flowers, whereupon the Rev. Father, surrounded <pb facs="5418474_12_0070.jpg" n="2"/>by the priestly members of his staff was directed to his place of honor, where-upon the regular festivity, consisting of musical numbers and theatrical performances, commenced. The Arion Male Chorus and Caecillia Song Circle were exceptionally good. Soloist were splendid, and let us not forget the directors of the music. Professors Ino Beuel and O. Schmoll. The Rev. was born at Wuertenberg, 1842, came to America in 1865; has been active here in Chicago for 20 years.</p>
