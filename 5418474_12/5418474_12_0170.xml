   <p>Von Hollen was born in the village of Driefthsethe, Hanover, Germany, March 2, 1834, and is therefore in his 42nd year. He came to this country in 1849, and to Chicago in 1854. He was for a time a grocer and butcher. From 1863 to 1865 he represented the eleventh ward in the common council. He was also foreman of the foreign and general delivery departments in the post-office for some time.</p>
   <p>In 1869 he was defeated for City Collector, and in 1870 was elected a member of the Board of Health, which position he resigned in 1871, when he was first elected City Collector, on the Fire-Proof Ticket. Von Hollen also served as a soldier during the War, and after the battle of Perryville, Kentucky, was taken prisoner by Morgan's guerrillas...</p>
