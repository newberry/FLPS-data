   <p>We do not know of one professional politician who deserves more contempt than Phil<gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>. When he succeeded two years ago in <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> his <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> put on the <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> forced the committee to <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> by every one.</p>
   <p>Shall we elect <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> short <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> reaches farther <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> kin<gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> citizens. His great-grandfather immigrated <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> 1720 to settle in the Lebanon Valley in Pennsylvania. Both his grandfathers were born in <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>. Independence under the comand of <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> ington. <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>was born in Lebanon in 1819. At the age of fourteen he became apprentice in a printing shop and remained there four years. In 1839 he founded at <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>iles, <gap unit="chars" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> English paper, the Republican, <pb facs="5418474_12_0215.jpg" n="2"/>and in 1844 he moved to Kalamazoo where he founded another English paper, the Telegraph.</p>
   <p>In the year 1845 he moved to Buffalo, where he became publisher of a German paper, the Telegraph. In 1849 he was appointed by President Taylor as chief inspector of the lighthouses of the great lakes.</p>
   <p>Later he became contractor of public works. Buffalo elected him in 1858 as state congressman. Later he came to Chicago. He is now chairman of the county council of Cook County.</p>
   <p>Every means is being used by Horace White, Charles Wilson and their ilk, to defeat Miller, simply because he is not ashamed of his German origin. The fact, that he speaks German instead of English while with other Germans, makes him a foreigner, a Dutchman. Better a full blooded American swindler than an honest Dutchman is the motto of our political adversaries.</p>
