   <p>Among all the praises that one has showered over Theodor Thomas and his brilliant orchestra one always forgets to mention one of his merits that people in Chicago should be especially able to appreciate. This is that he begins his concerts always punctually at 8 P. M. In all our theaters and with all our concerts the announcement,"start at 8 o'clock" is a lie.</p>
   <p>Anybody who goes to a performance in the Opera, or in the Dearborn Theater or to a recital of Mrs. Nilsson with the idea that it will start at 8 o'clock can be sure to have to wait for a quarter or half an hour. Thomas was practically, the only director who did not permit himself to be impressed by the fashionable people who are always late, and who could be depended upon to give at 8 o'clock the sign to gebin, unperturbed by no matter many silk gowns there were rustling on the staircase.</p>
