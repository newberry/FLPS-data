   <p>Dr. Fessel celebrated the day before yesterday his fiftieth jubilee as physician. To the sorrow of his friends and especially to his colleagues Dr. Fessel has just recently moved to New York. The physician enjoyed in Europe already great esteem where he worked himself up to the position of a member of the Board of Health. Wherever he was known in America, Milwaukee, New York, and here, he was considered as one of the foremost in the medical profession and was consulted by almost all of his German colleagues in any difficult and complicated case: Notwithstanding the successful but strenuous activities as physician, he always, found time for fostering and promoting music, and many a Society is indebted to him for its existence as for instance the Philharmonic Society in Milwaukee which at the time of his residence there and under the management of Hans Balatka, Dr. Fessel's son-inlaw, reached its climax. His Chicago friends expressed their participation at this jubilee, by sending Dr. Fessel a letter of hearty congratulations and a valuable gift.</p>
