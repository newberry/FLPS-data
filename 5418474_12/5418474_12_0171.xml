   <p>Because the Tribune yesterday morning printed a report concerning the statements of A. C. Hesing before the Grand Jury, one of our reporters went yesterday to interview him and had the following conversation with him:</p>
   <p>Rep: Mr. Hesing, have you read the report of the Tribune, concerning your examination by the Grand Jury? Hesing: Indeed, I have. Rep: Is this report exact? Hesing: One can see that some members of the Grand Jury have given hints to the reporter; he is far from having related the true facts. Rep: Would you mind giving the public a true relation of the facts? Hesing: Not at all - the law does not order a witness to keep silent. Rep: Who conducted the examination? Hesing: Storey himself. He said to me: "Mr. Hesing we have started an investigation concerning corruption in this county. As your name has often <pb facs="5418474_12_0172.jpg" n="2"/>been connected with it by the press, we would like to know if you have ever tried to bribe some alderman or public official by offering him money for corrupt purposes?" I answered: "No, I have never tried to bribe anyone, with one exception. That was when I went to see former alderman John Comiskey and offered him (upon your request, Mr. Storey), first $500 and then $1,000 if he would vote in favor of the Times receiving the city printing. Rep: What did Storey answer to that? Hesing: He said, that he did not remember the matter and feigned surprise that I should make such an assertion. The faces of the other jurors also registered surprise in the meantime.</p>
