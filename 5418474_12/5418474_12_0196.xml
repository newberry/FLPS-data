   <p>Since Mr. Hesing told a reporter of the Times, that the scoundrel who is at the head of this paper should be shot down like a mad dog, Storey has had no rest. He trembles, he has barricaded himself. No one may see him. If he hears the slightest noise, he believes that murderers are on his tracks.</p>
   <p>He sent a reporter to fetch Mathews. "Mathews," Storey said to him, "Go at once to Judge Hinsdale and have Hesing arrested, because he has threatened to shoot you."</p>
   <p>Judge Hinsdale wrote the warrant and Mathews then signed it. The warrant was given to constable Laimbeer who was to arrest A. C. Hesing the next day.</p>
   <p>In the meantime Mathews met his lawyer and told him what he had done. "You are an ass," the lawyer informed him. "Get the warrant back at once and burn it, else you will have plenty of trouble. What do we care about Storey. Let the rascal take care of himself. Mathews got the warrant back and burned it.</p>
