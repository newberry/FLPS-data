   <p>The Dusty Diamond Corporation Departs To The Klondike.</p>
   <p>The Dusty Diamond Corporation, founded by A.H.C.Seeger, a former officer of the City fire dept. will start for the Klondike today, fully equipped with arms, and luggage. Fifty members comprise the organization and they intend to remain with the expedition for 18 months. As we reported previously, Captain Seeger and his associates have made extensive preparations for this venture. Besides provisions, tools, clothing and an ample supply of arms, the Company also has two small but strong steamboats which were built for the purpose in Chicago. The gold seekers will navigate the Yukon, starting from St.Michaels, and they intend to live in their ships as well as work there. One of their vessels is fitted out with excellent dredging machinery and with it, the members of the Dusty Diamond Company hope, to extract large quantities of gold from the tributeries of the Yukon river. The expedition is composed mostly of Germans or German descendants.</p>
