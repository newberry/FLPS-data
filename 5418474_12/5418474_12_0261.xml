   <p>In Ogden's Grove, the Suabian Welfare Society opened their 9th anniversary and festival flag inauguration. The attendance was exceptionally good on account of the excellent weather and the true comradeship which unites the dapper Suabians in the new fatherland. Besides the members numerous friends had arrived and amongst them the Baden Welfare Society, the Westside Suabian Welfare Club, the Suabian Club, The Baden Singing Club "Vorwaerbs (Forward), and the Saronia Club. Songs, plays and dancing followed in gay succession and entertained the guests satisfactorily.</p>
   <p>The main celebration was the transmission of the magnificent flag by Miss Batter to the president Albert Floms who took possession of same with a heart-felt speech. The festival speech held by Mr.G.Roessler was a masterpiece of real German popular National people's festival, which caused jubilant applause in the great hall. We owe our special appreciation and thanks for the great success of this People's festival to Mr.Jos.Schlenker, George Unrath, J.Vatter with Hummel, Jacob Fleimei and Jacob Pfeifer by the careful attention with which they arranged and carried through this beautiful festival.</p>
