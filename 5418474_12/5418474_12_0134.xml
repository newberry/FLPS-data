   <p>Theodore B. Weber's will was submitted to the Surrogate's court yesterday afternoon.</p>
   <p>The original document was executed in June, 1876, witnessed and signed by H. H. Anderson, Harry Rubens, and Edmund Juessen.</p>
   <p>The provisions: The widow receives the house and lot which, after the widow's death, shall become the property of Lydie Winter, Weber's niece. The two life insurance policies of $2,500 each and the income from $15,000.... shall go.... to other relatives.....</p>
   <p>The sum of $10,000 was set aside for a German high school to be built between Chicago Avenue and Fullerton Avenue, provided that other parties raise an additional $90,000, and that the German language, German history, and <pb facs="5418474_12_0135.jpg" n="2"/>German literature be always taught in the institution, and that Bible reading, praying, and religious instruction be permanently excluded from the curriculum. If these provisions find no acceptance within five years, then the money shall revert to the children of his sister.....</p>
   <p>A codicil, dated May 1, this year, revokes the sum given to his wife as well as the stipulations and money originally provided for the high school.</p>
