   <p>Captain Seeger of Fire Engine Company No. 55, at Sheffield Avenue, near Diversey Blvd., will retire next month, after 14 years of service. He and 50 other German-Americans from the Lake View district will leave for Alaska, to search for gold in the Klondike region.</p>
   <p>Everyone connected with the expedition, contributed $1,000 to defray expenses and agreed to remain for two years. Captain Seeger has been elected as leader of the exposition, and according to the stipulations of the contract he will have considerable authority. The Company had a small but very strong steamship built, at a local ship-yard. This vessel is constructed in sections, so that it can be assembled or taken apart and is equipped with the latest dredging devices and the company expects excellent success for its capacity. The departure is scheduled for the 26th of March.</p>
