<title level="a">COMPETITION FOR THE THADDEUS KOSCIUSZKO MONUMENT IN CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The competition for the Thaddeus Kosciuszko monument in Chicago, as we learn from newspapers published in Poland, has already been advertised by the United Association of Fine Arts in Lwow. It was advertised on the authority of Doctor Dunikowski, into whose hands the Chicago committee for the erection of the monument had entrusted this authority. The conditions of the competition as established by the association in Lwow are as follows: all Polish sculptors, either in Poland or abroad, may compete. The model should represent Kosciuszko on a horse, in an American uniform, wearing the order of the Cincinnati. The group is to be one and a half times life size on a granite base. Models should be in plaster, one-tenth the size. The cost is not to exceed 80,000 golden rubles [approximately $60,000], without the base. The sides of the base are to be bas-reliefs portraying first: the battle of Raclawice; second: one of the battles of the American Revolution, or the meeting of Kosciuszko with Washington.</p>

   <p>All projects must be submitted by May 15, 1893, and the judges' decision will be published on May 30. The names of the judges will be published on May 1; Doctor Dunikowski will be among these, of course. There will be three money prizes awarded; 1,000, 750, and 500 golden rubles each [$750, $562.50, $375]; besides these, three honorable mentions will be awarded. All models submitted will be placed on public display. Those models receiving money awards will become the property of the Chicago committee, which will choose the model to be used.</p>
   <p>Such are the conditions of the competition. It has already been officially advertised and the money forwarded to the Lwow institution. We hear that the competition has aroused great interest among the artists in Poland and abroad, and we can be certain that May 30 will bring us some beautiful projects for the monument of our hero. Before the end of the World's Columbian Exposition, we shall have them here in Chicago--and we will be ready to display them before all America.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1414.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The plan of erecting the monument progresses steadily. The committee wants to demonstrate Polish life in this country, its patriotism and its past, not only by churches, schools, and institutions for the promotion of faith and nationalism, but by a monument of a hero who for the past hundred years has been a link between Poland and America. In order to accomplish this purpose, material support will be necessary. It should not be especially difficult to gather the twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars required for the monument's erection. If a sufficient number of Poles contribute, even penny donations will be acceptable. The fund already amounts to $4,000. The matter is already so far advanced that it cannot be dropped without impugning Polish-American honor. Undoubtedly, the project will be carried to a successful completion, and the Poles will prove that they never lack in generosity where honor to a great hero is concerned.</p>
