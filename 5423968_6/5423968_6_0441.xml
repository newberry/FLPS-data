<title level="a">A NEWSPAPERMEN'S CONVENTION</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The idea of a convention of Polish newspapermen from all over the United States has long been discussed in Polish newspaper circles of Chicago. Such a convention would have a great many extremely important matters to discuss--matters which we touch upon daily. Somehow, something has always prevented it.</p>
   <p>A Polish congress was to have been held in Washington in May; then again, we awaited the convention that was to be called by the [Polish] National Department. Not wishing to delay the matter further, the press committee of the Polish Press Club decided to take the matter up and, after discussing it thoroughly, has called the convention for September 2 and 3, to be held in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0442.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is to be expected that the first convention of Polish newspapermen to be held since the beginning of the war will be attended by a great many Polish journalists who must seriously and shrewdly confer upon present-day problems. They must have a great deal of information to exchange, confidential information on many matters, and, by taking the proper attitude on these questions and consolidating their effort, they can do much toward their better and more effectual solution.</p>
   <p>We know that the pre-convention committee has planned several lectures which are to be prepared for presentation at the convention, in addition to appropriate resolutions, by newspapermen both of Chicago as well as of other cities. These lectures will concern such matters as the Polish Army, the [Polish] National Department, re-emigration, mutual co-operation, relief questions, and finally, professional matters, which are also important.</p>
   <p>The convention, then, has a large and serious field of action. It is to be <pb facs="5423968_6_0443.jpg" n="3"/>expected, then, that the project of a newspapermen's convention will be greeted with enthusiasm, not only in newspaper circles, but by the general public also. It should be added here that the presidents of all the larger organizations and of the [Polish] National Department have been invited to attend, for they can give much information and can explain many details which will require explanation.</p>
   <p>The convention will be held at the headquarters of the Polish Press Club. The proposal to hold the convention in Chicago won out because it is here that nationalistic activity is concentrated, thus enabling our journalistic colleagues from other cities to gain such general information as they may desire--and for which there appears to be a great need. Whoever has observed the Polish-American Press, even only that of "very wide interests," as the hirelings of our enemies call us, can see that there are many discrepancies (and often involuntary blunders) resulting purely from a lack of first-hand information, and that this condition should, once and for all, be rectified.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0444.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>One who understands the issue clearly can see that we need to consolidate our efforts.</p>
   <p>To the convention then, colleagues! Let no one of us fail to be present! The present times demand that we get together and work together--the more so for our arising homeland. The pre-convention committee will soon announce further details, and will undoubtedly arrange that all from out of town will be hospitably received and will be made to feel at home here in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Be ready, then, for we shall see each other in a short time, we shall become mutually acquainted, and shall share with each other our joys and sorrows. We shall gather with but one thought in mind--to unite in a task that will be beneficial in its results, not only to the entire Polish element in the United States, but to our brethren in our beloved homeland.</p>
