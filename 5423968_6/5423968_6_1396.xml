   <p>The three hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the death of Nicholas Copernicus, the astronomer who originated the present theory of the Solar System, was celebrated with appropriate ceremonies by the Polish National Alliance at Bohemian Hall, 32 Emma street, yesterday afternoon. The principal address was delivered by John S. Smulski, who gave an interesting and instructive talk on astronomy and the life of Copernicus, and furnished many proofs that the great astronomer was born on Polish soil in the town of Thorn, in Poland.</p>
   <p>The speaker said that the principal object of the meeting was to prove and establish the fact that Copernicus was born a Pole and not a German, as was often asserted by German historians and scientists.</p>

   <p>Sigmund C. Slupski was the next speaker. After his address he presented the society with the plaster cast of a medallion made by himself, which bore the faces of Columbus and Copernicus. Music was furnished by the Chopin Singing Society.</p>
