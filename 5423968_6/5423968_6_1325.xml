   <p>The plan to erect a monument to Thaddeus Kosciusko in Chicago seems to be gaining momentum right along.</p>
   <p>At present we are quite busy with the great Kosciusko festival (July 4th, at Schuetzen Park), which promises to be a grand success.</p>
   <p>A new project has been proposed which would, if properly organized, help greatly in hurrying the erection of the monument.</p>
   <p>One Polish singing society in Chicago has proposed to give a concert to raise funds for the monument, and two or three other societies have already accepted this idea.</p>
   <p>The project as a whole is excellent, but it needs a few corrections. One, for instance, is the manner in which the concert is to be held. We believe it should be held in connection with a contest of singing societies, as this would assure <pb facs="5423968_6_1326.jpg" n="2"/>its success. A similar contest, held not long ago in the Auditorium for the benefit of certain Swedish and Norwegian societies, was a huge success.</p>
   <p>So much for the first observation. There is also another: We should not announce the concert now because it is a trifle too early. At present our attention is focused on the Kosciusko festival on July 4th. To advertise the concert now would harm the first plan. The concert should be held either in the autumn or winter months. To talk about it now would distract our attention from the Kosciusko picnic, which surely is more important.</p>
   <p>Let us, therefore, be a little patient.</p>
   <p>Let us first be done with the July festival, whose net profit should amount to two or three thousand dollars. Then will be time to think of the concert and the contest, which will surely bring in sufficient money to begin building the monument.</p>
