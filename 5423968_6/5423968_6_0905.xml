   <p>"Trendowata" one of the most beautiful plays written in the Polish language, will be shown on the screen, at the Orchestra Hall, 216 S. Michigan Avenue, near Adams Street, next Monday and Tuesday, October 24th and 25th. There will be only one show each evening, at 8:15 P.M. Tickets may be purchased at any of the following places: The Northwestern Bank, The Ashland State Bank, Preyss Restaurant, Zalewski Pharmacy at 47th. and Ashland Avenue, and at the Logan Realty Co., 2549 Milwuakee Avenue.</p>
   <p>The story portrays the tragedy and romance of old Polish Aristocracy. Prince Michorowski, in his youth becomes enamored of a poor noblewoman, Stephanie Korwicz; whose caste proves a barrier to their love, and Stephanie marries another after her unhappy affair with the Prince; and years pass on. The tragedy, however, is reborn in the third generation of the principal of the story, Waldemar, grandson of the unhappy Prince, is thrown by fate, into the path of Stephanie Rudecka, granddaughter of the poor noblewoman Stephanie Korwicz, and here again, tragedy follows. Waldemar succeeded in breaking down the caste barriers set up by his family, but intrigues were insurmountable.</p>
   <p>See this beautiful and pathetic story at Orchestra Hall next Monday and Tuesday. Sub - titles are in English to enable our American friends to grasp the fine points of the story.</p>
