  <body>
   <p>In the evening classes of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish School the boys study catechism, arithmetic, and Polish, Separate classes in English, Polish, and German are held for adults and children. Many adults attend.</p>
   <p>Polish history and literature are taught in the higher grades.</p>
   <p>About two hundred boys attend the four classes that are held every Sunday. Instruction is given in catechism, arithmetic, history, and singing.</p>
   <p>Every father should see to it that his sons attend classes; he should question them about what they are studying.</p>
   <p>Parents should co-operate with the school in the care of their children, for the greatest obligation of the parents is to rear their children as righteous <pb facs="5423968_6_1015.jpg" n="2"/>Catholic citizens and, above all, as Poles.</p>
   <p>At present there are day, evening, and Sunday classes. Every boy, young or old, should attend one of them. Are parents concerned about this? If not, that is their affair. They will have to give an account of this before God.</p>
