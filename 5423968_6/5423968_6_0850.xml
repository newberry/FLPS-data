   <p>For the past several days rumors have been heard, also by us, that a corporation is being formed in New York which has for its aim the publication of an English periodical, dedicated to the defense of Polish interests. As long as this rumor did not become more concrete, we made no mention of it because we did not wish to spread unreliable information. Today we have received two statements relative to this publication with a request that they be published. We are complying with this request and are printing the statements, changing nothing in them, although they have evidently been submitted to us rather hastily written and marked even more by hundreds of errors.</p>
   <p>However, the hurriedness in the composition is of minor importance; we are concerned with the text, or rather with the main point, with the subject matter of the statement. The idea of publishing a periodical of that nature is, <pb facs="5423968_6_0851.jpg" n="2"/>undoubtedly, commendable and we cannot cast any aspersions upon that proposal. Despite this we were doubtful whether we should print the statement, and only the fear of being accused of some unfound prejudice compels us to publish this reply before it is too late.</p>
   <p>The cause of our uncertainty was the fact that we really do not know with whom we are dealing. The publication of a periodical of such a nature as the proposed Freedom and Art requires two principal conditions: in the first place, we would say "solidness" of the publishers and second, ability of the editors. The signature of "committee," or even that of only one name (A. F. Koziell), does not suffice as a guarantee that such a perioducal will be essentially the expression of the sentiment and opinion of the Polish people. We know well that at times our enemies undertake similar measures in an underhand manner, so as to harm us only the more effectively; we also know that at times, there are people having praiseworthy intentions but lacking the power to bring them into action; by their incapability they bring more harm than gain. Consequently it is essential that we know who stands at the head of this venture, so that we <pb facs="5423968_6_0852.jpg" n="3"/>can awaken the confidence of the people.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that the "committee" will soon correct this error by sending us the particulars which we have a right to demand--in the meantime we present the statements with reservations and only as a project that is commendable in itself, although it might be difficult to accomplish, especially considering among our status in America, our need of men of education and our unfortunate abundance of people who in their own imagination "know everything," and yet in reality know so very little.....</p>
