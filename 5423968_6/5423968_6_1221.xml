   <p>One hundred and fifty years ago, the original colonies in America numbered thirteen; these colonies announced to the world their independence of the British rule, which resulted in the war for the freedom of this country, in which our national heroes Casimir Pulaski and Thaddeus Kosciuszko became known in the history of America.</p>
   <p>From the time of Kosciuszko and Pulaski, the people of Polish descent participated in the various wars of America, the Civil War of 1861 to 1865, the Spanish-American War, and the World War in which thousands of Polish youths had taken part.</p>
   <p>In honor and memory of these heroes who lost their lives on the battlefields in France, a monument was erected by the Polish-American mothers and fathers of the Gold Star Society, who have for the past several years collected funds for this monument.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1222.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This monument will be consecrated and unveiled on July 4, 1928, at Saint Adalbert cemetery in Niles, Illinois, near Saint Hedwig orphanage. It will be consecrated by His Eminence, Cardinal George Mundelein, who also donated the foundation for the monument, which cost about one thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Four Gold Star Mothers who lost their sons in the World War will unveil the monument. Following the unveiling, the children from Saint Hedwig's orphanage will sing Polish selections, accompanied by church and national choirs.</p>
   <p>Speeches will be made in both the Polish and English language. The English speakers will be His Eminence Cardinal Mundelein, Mr. Charles S. Deneen, United States Senator of Illinois, Brigadier General Paul. B. Malone, of Fort Sheridan Illinois, and Admiral Howard P. Savage, of the Great Lakes Naval Training Station; the Polish speakers will be Mr. J. Lipowicz, State Senator of Buffalo New York, the only Polish Senator in New York State, who organized and is the secretary of the Mothers and Fathers Gold Star Society; George Menkicki, and many others.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1223.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The program will begin at 1:30 p. m. with a parade starting at Raven Avenue and North-West Highway, near the Norwood Park "L" station, and the Chicago Northwestern Railroad station. The parade will be lead by the United Stated Army unit from Fort Sheridan; The United States Navy unit from Great Lakes Naval Training Station; The National Guard of the 33rd division; veterans of the Civil War, Spanish-American War, and World War; reserve officers of the Haller Polish army, and various American Legion Posts, the members of which belong to many nationalities.</p>
   <p>Escorts for prominent guests will be furnished by the Chicago and State police departments. The escorts for His Eminence, Cardinal Mundelein, will be the Catholic Circle, John Nering, president as leader. Escorts for General James E. Stuart, 87 years old, Brigadier General of the Civil War, Martin Powroznik, representing the citizens' committee in the lead.</p>
