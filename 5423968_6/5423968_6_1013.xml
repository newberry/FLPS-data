  <body>
   <p>The evening school of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish is steadily growing. There are six classes at present, requiring the services of six teachers. Two of these classes are especially devoted to instruction in English; one deals with the rudiments of English, while the other is more advanced. Three classes offer instructions to boys and young men who are to receive their first Holy Communion; the Polish language and arithmetic are also taught. There are also two classes for young men which offer instructions in confirmation, Polish history and literature, mathematics, etc.</p>
   <p>The school offers great advantages to Polish youths, especially to those who must earn a living during the day. Those young men who have spare time during the evening should not pass up this opportunity.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The article says that there are six classes and mentions seven. Probably one of them was divided into two groups.]</p>
