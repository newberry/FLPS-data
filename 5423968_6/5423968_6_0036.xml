   <p>The musico-literary society, Promien, gave a concert and ball on November 4, in Columbia Hall, at 1815 West Division Street. The program was indeed varied, and was faultlessly executed. The Misses I. Statkiewicz and J. Sikucka deserve particular mention. They performed Liszt's "Rhapsody for Four Hands" with such understanding and feeling that they were forced to give an encore. Both of these young ladies are no longer dilettantes, but artists in the full sense of the word. Miss Sophia Koehler, who played Tchaikovsky's "Serenade" as a piano solo, showed herself as no mean artist. Her playing disclosed an extraordinary technique and depth of feeling. Miss Sophia Koehler also appeared with Mr. Z. T. Osiecki in a playlet called "The Poet Husband," by K. Przerwa Tetmajer. Further triumphs were enjoyed by the orchestra of J. L. Rikk; by Miss Onecka, who read "The Wedding," an excerpt from the novel, Jan Bielecki, by J. Slowacki; by Mr. Rikk, who played Dand's "Resignation" (violin solo), accompanied by Miss I. Statkiewicz; by Mr. P. Krseslowski, who read "The Free Lance," by Konopnicka; by Mr. Z. T. Osiecki, who read "Awaken" (his own composition), with orchestral accompaniment.</p>

   <p>During a long intermission between dances, the figured mazurka was performed by four couples, with a great deal of animation.....The evening was most enjoyable.</p>
