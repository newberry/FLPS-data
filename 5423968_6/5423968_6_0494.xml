   <p>The Polish Press Club in Chicago is gradually acquiring noticeable proportions. Each evening the Club's headquarters, opened for the past several days, attracts a rather large number of members, who occupy themselves by reading books, having discussions, playing the piano, and playing checkers and the like.</p>
   <p>The society, to date, numbers sixty-seven active members. During the recent administration meeting, which was held on September 12, eleven new candidates were presented. This number will undoubtedly increase considerably by the time of the forthcoming mass meeting, which will be held on September 20, 1910.</p>
   <p>The following program of meetings was passed upon during the last session of the Club:</p>
   <p>(1) General social meeting, monthly, on the first Wednesday after the first of the month.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0495.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>(2) Mass meeting of members, once a month, on the Tuesday preceding the previously mentioned general social meeting.</p>
   <p>(3) Administrative meeting, once a month, on the Monday preceding the general social meeting.</p>
   <p>(4) Newspaper Department meetings, twice monthly, on the Thursdays after the first and the fifteenth of each month.</p>
   <p>(5) Literary Department meetings, twice monthly, on the Saturdays after the first and the fifteenth of each month.</p>
   <p>(6) Recreational Department meetings, four or eventually five times each month, on Fridays.</p>
   <p>(7) Every Wednesday is known as "Ladies Day."</p>
   <p>During the last meeting of the administration several topics of a general nature <pb facs="5423968_6_0496.jpg" n="3"/>were discussed--for example, the establishing of a permanent Polish theatre, a businessmen's association, and the like. The members of this committee finally exchanged opinions as to what position the Club should occupy eventually in relation to the press.</p>
