   <p>The national order of Polish Falcons (Sokols) was established, in Poland, almost one-hundred years ago and is now rounding out fifty years of meritorious service in this country. The aims of its founders were the fostering of brotherhood, discipline, subservience of private interests for the good of all, and equality of rights and obligations within the nation; to bring up coming generations, healthy in body, sound in mind, beautiful in character, lofty in ideals and conscious of their duties as citizens of a free common-wealth. As an embodiment of these virtues the Falcon order selected for its patrons two characters: General Thaddeus Kosciuszko, the great humanitarian, brilliant soldier, and national hero of Poland, and Abraham Lincoln, the great American statesman, martyr, and no less great humanitarian.</p>
   <p>The Falcon order develops strength, health, and hardiness among its members by instilling gymnastics, physical exercises and supervised sports. It stressess national discipline, equality and cooperation by inculating calisthenics, mass drills and competitive events; it fosters the appreciation of nature through the study of trees, birds and flowers; it impresses the lasting qualities of character and accomplishment with the study of the great minds of the world, it instils patriotism, by the study of language and tradition of the land of its forefathers, the land of the great Boleslaw, Copernicus, Kosciuszko, Pulaski, Chopin, Paderewski, Madame Curie <pb facs="5423968_6_1141.jpg" n="2"/>Sklodowsk, Joseph Conrad (Korzeniowski), and Pilsudski, the soldier and statesman of modern Poland. It molds a most desirable type of Americanism, of upright character, loyalty to country, and a pride of Polish ancestry. Cognizant of the inevitability of the last World War the Falcon Order in America broadened the scope of its program to include military training for officers, non-comissioned officer and first-class soldiers, during the period of 1911 to 1917, by establishing three military schools. When our beloved president, and benefactor of Poland, Woodrow Wilson, issued a call for volunteers to fight for the freedom of Poland, and was followed, with a similar cry to arms, by that illustrious son and citizen of Poland, Ignace Paderwski, over five-thousand Falcons who were not subject to American draft, joined a Polish military force, which, during the rest of the war covered itself with a valor and glory. The Polish Army fighting beside the American army, and side by side with the rest of the allies who were alligned against the Central Powers, gave Poland an undeniable right to participate in the Versailles Peace Conference from which emerged the modern Poland of today.</p>
   <p>After the thunder of guns had ceased, and peace settled over the troubled world, the Polish Falcons of America took up anew its great work of moulding the younger generation into manhood and American citizenship of the highest type - the aim of its founders - by conducting, day in and day out, physical culture, general education, gymastics and national and classic dances, and spreading Falcon Clubs in states mostly east of the Mississippi River.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1142.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Falcons Order of America, was originally organized in Chicago, about fifty years ago. It is divided into fourteen districts, each district holding annually, or bienially, field meets and bymnastic festivals in which all rest? classes, of that particular district, participate. National field meets and festivals are held every three or four years at different parts of the country. Besides this, individuals or classes most accomplished in this field of work are quite frequently sent abroad, especially to Poland, to take active part in the International Sokol meets and lectures which are organized and conducted by highly trained instructors abroad.</p>
