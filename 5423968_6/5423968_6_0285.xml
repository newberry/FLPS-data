   <p>Day before yesterday, Saturday evening, January 28, a meeting was held at the Hotel Sherman located at Clark and Randolph streets for the purpose of forming an association of Polish physicians.</p>
   <p>After finishing the usual formalities and the current affairs, the president of this association, Prof. Walter Kuflewski, M. D., explained to the members the program of its activities, which was accepted unanimously. The following is the program: (1) Unification of all Polish doctors in Chicago; (2) Solidarity with and faithful support of all Polish druggists; (3) Popular lectures for the Polish public about contagious disease and sicknesses, particularly tuberculosis; (4) Every member of the Polish Physicians' Association is obligated to present at least one case in the coming year to the members; (5) Unification of all Polish physicians in America; (6) Convention of all Polish physicians in America; (7) Propagation of the Polish language and the systematical efforts for its growth; (8) To enlarge our interests in the different societies, and compel our members to attend meetings regularly; (9) To support all Polish institutions, Polish business men and Polish working men; (10) To hold discussions on affairs of the world with the Polish people; (11) Our strongest efforts are: to unite all Polish people whether they were born under the rule of Germany, under Austria, or under Russia, always bearing <pb facs="5423968_6_0286.jpg" n="2"/>in mind that if we were united and worked as one group, we would have the largest group of any nationality in the United States; (12) To support the Polish medical periodical.</p>
