   <p>Mr. Miecislaus Haiman, editor of the Polish Union Daily, is the author of the book entitled "From the Past of the Poles in America." It contains many facts regarding Polish immigrants in America, beginning at the seventeenth century, when the first English colony was established in Virginia, to the Civil War. This book consists of eighteen, short and long, historical anecdotes, and many interesting episodes and figures of the past which the author discovered by patient research in old archives.</p>
   <p>The text of this book is as follows:</p>
   <p>1-Poles among American pioneers.</p>
   <p>2-How His Excellency, Governor P. Wojewoda, with his miracle salve tried to buy a "New Poland" in America.</p>
   <p>3-Pulaski at Brandywine.</p>
   <p>4-History of the Pulaski banner.</p>
   <p>5-Death, burial and monument of Pulaski at Savannah.</p>
   <p>6-Defender of the honor of Pulaski.</p>
   <p>7-The second pamphlet in defense of Pulaski.</p>
   <p>8-Kosciuszko at West Point.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0855.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>9-The United States congress regarding the death of Kosciuszko.</p>
   <p>10-The fight for Kosciuszko's inheritance.</p>
   <p>11-James F. Cooper, the famous American author and friend of Poland, and Mickiewicz.</p>
   <p>12-Dr. Samuel G. Howe, imprisoned for supporting the Polish cause.</p>
   <p>13-History of the Polish grant in Illinois.</p>
   <p>14-An American in Poland in 1834.</p>
   <p>15-Major Gaspard Tochman, the forgotten Apostle of the Polish cause in America.</p>
   <p>16-Dr. Charles Kraitsir, Hungarian friend of Poland in America.</p>
   <p>17-Count Adam Gurowski.</p>
   <p>18-The year 1863, and American diplomatic correspondence in regard to the Polish Revolution.</p>
   <p>Every American, of Polish descent who is interested in knowing the important role played by the Poles in American history, and especially students who attend high school, shoudl read this book. Some of the facts we find in this book, are that the Poles were the first nation to arrange a strike in America, and that the Poles staged the first war for American Democracy; during the reign of King Stanislaus August, of Poland, plans were being prepared for a colony for the Poles in America. Many other interesting articles are contained in this work.</p>
