   <p>The Polish Roman-Catholic Library was organized in 1915. It contains more than 7000 volumes-most of which are Polish. Books printed in English can also be had, but they are mostly reference books and books of a scientific nature. More than 500 people, including 300 school children make use of the library and its facilities regularly. Rules for borrowing books from the library are the same as those of the Chicago Public Library.</p>
   <p>More than 2000 volumes pertaining to the history of the Poles in the United States may be found here. They form The Polish-Americana collection, the largest of its kind in the United States. Books in this collection are, however, for reference only. The library is conducted according to the most modern and scientific methods. Catalogs of the most recent date are always on file.</p>
   <p>The books are classified as follows:</p>
   <p>a) Juvenile and folk stories</p>
   <p>b) Novels</p>
   <p>c) Poetry</p>
   <p>d) History, geography, social and pedagogical questions</p>
   <p>e) Philosophy, psychology, ethics, aesthetics, fine arts.</p>
   <p>f) Medicine, hygiene, natural sciences, commerce and industry, school text-books.</p>
   <p>g) Drama, music, instrumental and vocal.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0132.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>h) Theology, catechism, live of saints.</p>
   <p>j) Bibliography, encyclopedias, dictionaries, jubilee editions and books in English language.</p>
   <p>The library is located in the Polish Roman-Catholic bldg. at Augusta and Milwaukee Ave.</p>
