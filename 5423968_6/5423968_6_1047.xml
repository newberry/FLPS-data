   <p>Sunday, December 17, three lectures, arranged by the Committee on Lectures of the Department of Education of the Polish National Alliance, were given in three districts of the city.</p>
   <p>On the Northwest Side, at the Alliance's building, Mr. Wladyslaw Koniuszewski delivered a lecture before a large audience on the subject "Chelm and Its Proposed Detachment". The lecture was very well prepared and vital as to subject matter. It greatly interested the audience, which rewarded the lecturer with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>Many people also attended Professor Romvald Piatkowski's lecture on Mickiewicz, which was given at the parish hall of St. Casimir's. This lecture, which was a continuation of last Sunday's lecture, interested the audience greatly, as was demonstrated by the enthusiastic applause it received. Reverend K. Furman was present.</p>

   <p>Fewer people attended the lecture at Davis Square Park in the district of Town of Lake, where Mr. Stanley Jakiel lectured on the subject "Adam Mickiewicz and the Ode to Youth". The organizing committee is partly to blame for selecting a district so remote, but this will be corrected.</p>
   <p>Wednesday, December 20, at 8 P. M., Mr. John Kozakiewicz will deliver a lecture at the Alliance building on the subject "The Appreciation of Beauty". Admission is free to all.</p>
   <p>Lectures will be suspended for the Christmas season and until December 31, when they will be continued in several districts simultaneously. The Committee has a plan already worked out in detail and will announce it soon.</p>
