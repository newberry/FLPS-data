   <p>(The following article has been received for publication):</p>
   <p>The Thaddeus Kosciusko Society at South Chicago opened its library for public use on September 16.</p>
   <p>Those wishing to take advantage of the services of this Polish library must observe the following rules:</p>
   <p>1. The societies that wish their members to make use of the facilities must sign as a guarantor for each member.</p>
   <p>2. In the event that a society does not wish to sign as a guarantor for an <pb facs="5423968_6_0190.jpg" n="2"/>individual member, the member may obtain a card by having a private businessman sign as a guarantor.</p>
   <p>3. Books also may be taken out by making a cash deposit, the amount of which is not to exceed the value of the book or books taken out. The money will be refunded upon the return of the books.</p>
   <p>This society requests all readers who wish to join the library to get in touch with L. Szleger, librarian, who is at the library daily except Sunday from 9 A. M. to 9 P. M.</p>
   <p>The library and reading room of the Thaddeus Kosciusko Society is located at 8454 Superior Avenue.</p>
   <p>Books are loaned free of charge.</p>
