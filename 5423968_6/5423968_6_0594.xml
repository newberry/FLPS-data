<title level="a">THE CONVENTION OF POLISH-AMERICAN JOURNALISTS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Everybody agrees that one of the most important factors in social life is the press. It reflects through the printed word social needs and movements and gradually influences the education of society.</p>
   <p>In our rapidly developing Polish-American society the role of the press is even more important than elsewhere--only God knows how much evil is caused to society through its restlessness, its groping along detours, and its useless spending of force, along with its fratricidal warfare. For a long time, people of good will and intelligence have seen the dangers of these evils and have often thought of remedying the conditions of Polish journalism. They were concerned about placing the Polish-American press under certain ethical bonds, about regulating its activities and turning them onto proper paths. It was apparent that along with this a closer personal understanding of our journalistic forces ought to be brought about, by a convention of the press and the organization of a society of Polish journalists in America. This was realized in 1891.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0595.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>During the Diet of the Polish National Alliance at Detroit in 1891, the initial gathering of the Polish newspapermen of America was held. Eleven representatives of the Polish press from Chicago, Detroit, Buffalo, New York, Nanticoke, Toledo, and Milwaukee participated in this affair. Despite numerous obstacles, especially the lack of time, the Polish-American Press Society was formulated. The decision was made to exclude temporarily any mutual-aid department, and to make no attempt to regulate the views of the members on any social or political questions. The Society dedicated itself to the keeping together of the interests of the Polish press and the creation of an honorary tribunal for the express purpose of putting an end to the practice of personal attacks in our papers. A one-dollar entrance fee and a twenty-five cent quarterly charge were fixed. Ten persons joined this new organization and a few entrance fees were collected.</p>
   <p>A temporary committee of four was chosen and M. J. Sadowski, of Buffalo, was selected to perform the duties of secretary and treasurer. This temporary committee was to have chosen a fifth member and continue the work of this Society, having as its ultimate aim the complete organization of the Polish press, completion of its laws, etc. Thus far this committee has not accomplished <pb facs="5423968_6_0596.jpg" n="3"/>a thing and the entire idea of this group is at a standstill.</p>
   <p>The question of a Polish journalistic convention was brought up anew by Joseph Bernolak, editor of the Baltimore Polonia, in an article published in the New Year issue of Dziennik Chicagoski this year. The thought expressed by him found favorable reaction and several papers agreed that another convention should be held. Buffalo was chosen as the site and July 4, 1895, as the day.</p>
   <p>It seemed that the convention would be held without any trouble, for the idea took hold and was strongly favored by all. In fact there was talk about it for over two weeks. But suddenly this enthusiasm died out. New fights and wranglings broke out in the Polish papers. A wide breach relative to the principles of this organization developed as a result. At the present time a part of the press is not in favor of this convention. On the other hand other Polish papers are strongly in favor of it, such as Polonia of Baltimore.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0597.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Because the day of the convention is nearing, Mr. Henry Nagiel, editor of Dziennik Chicagoski, feels it his duty to express his opinion on the following questions:</p>
   <p>(1) Will the convention be held?</p>
   <p>"In my opinion it should be held by all means. We are nervous and sensitive. A little good will can bring about favorable results. At any rate it is worth trying, and the aim of regulating some of our obnoxious journalistic policies is worthy of consideration."</p>
   <p>(2) Where and when will this convention be held?</p>
   <p>"As has been mentioned before, on July 4, 1895, at Buffalo, New York."</p>
   <p>(3) Who is to call the convention to order?</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0598.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"In this respect I wish to call attention the fact that the present initiator, Mr. Bernolak of Baltimore, has proposed that a special committee take this matter up. He appointed the editors of Dziennik Chicagoski, and Zgoda to act on this committee; he also suggested that they pick a third member. The editor of Dziennik Chicagoski wishes to announce that he cannot accept this offer, for he does not possess any mandate to this committee. As far as is known, the editor of Zgoda also wishes to decline the offer. In their places I wish to suggest that the originator, Joseph Bernolak, and M. J. Sadowski, temporary secretary and treasurer of this organization, take care of the entire affair. The fact that Mr. Sadowski resides in Buffalo, the site of the convention, places him in a better position to act."</p>
   <p>(4) How is the convention to be called to order?</p>
   <p>"Its method will be very simple. Messrs. Bernolak and Sadowski <pb facs="5423968_6_0599.jpg" n="6"/>will send a short announcement to all editors of the Polish press, announcing that a meeting will be held at such and such a place and at such and such a time. The letter will also state the purpose of the gathering and adopt a program according to the plans of the previous convention held in 1891.</p>
   <p>"All those invited should write to the secretary or announce in their papers that they are going to attend. This should be done before July 1. If by July 1 only eleven agree to be present at the convention, it will be held. If the number is less the affair will be dropped. If necessary, the convention can be postponed for another year.</p>
   <p>"Preparations for this assembly will be made by this special committee at Buffalo, and the committee is permitted to invite other Polish editors of that city to co-operate."</p>
   <p>(5) What is to be the platform of this convention?</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0600.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>"An answer to this has been stated before. The convention will be, in effect, a carry-over of the first convention held at Detroit in 1891. The major points are two, namely: resistance to any attempts to exert pressure upon personal convictions or to discipline those writers whose views do not coincide with those of the majority, and the establishment of an ethical standard which will elevate the dignity and moral quality of the papers by halting personal squabbles, attacks, etc.</p>
   <p>"These are the cardinal issues to be discussed. In the event the representatives of the respective journalistic factions deem it proper to effect an understanding among themselves in their own circles prior to the convention, relative to obtaining their aims and spreading their convictions, no one will interfere with this, providing the plans are prepared in a series of conferences outside the convention grounds. If the assembly follows this form it is probable that the convention will be held and it is hoped that it will have successful results.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0601.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>"This opinionated article has not only been published for public consumption but a copy of it also has been sent to J. Bernolak with the plea for an immediate realization of the convention. I judge that all the members of the Polish press will agree upon this."</p>
