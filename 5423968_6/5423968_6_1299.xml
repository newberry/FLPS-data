   <p>Brothers! As you know a suggestion was first made in 1892 for erecting a monument to our great hero, Thaddeus Kosciuszko in the city of Chicago. That beautiful thought has been approved all over America with great enthusiasm and attempts are being made for realization of the plan. A committee has been organized for the purpose of carrying out the plan which shall bring us fame and glory. The committee did not spare time nor hard labor in the selection of a suitable model and artist. The Committee engaged a noted Polish artist, Mr. Kazemiers Chodzinski of Crocow, Austria, Poland, to cast the model for a very reasonable charge of $18,000.00 (Eighteen Thousand Dollars). According to the agreement the model must be finished and transported to its place of destination this year.</p>
   <p>During the last seven years the Committee collected only $11,000.00 a sum insufficient to defray the cost of erecting such a monument. It being high time for the completion of the project and in order to speed it up a great mass-meeting of Polish Societies had been held in which 48 organizations took part. As a means of acquiring the balance of the necessary funds, it was decided to conduct a fair (or bazaar.)</p>
