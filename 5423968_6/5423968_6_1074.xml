   <p>We have received the following correspondence with a request that it be published in the Dziennik Chicagoski.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's lectures in the Holy Trinity Parish Hall gave convincing proof that the lecturers know how to interest the listeners, and the audiences appreciate their efforts and care in preparing these discourses on various subjects.</p>
   <p>On this occasion the lecturer, Mr. Casimir B. Czarnecki, in understandable words spoke at length about the Constitution and form of government of the United States, about the troubles and tribulations it has passed through, how the various states were formed and how they joined the Union, why the American flag has thirteen stripes (because thirteen states originally formed <pb facs="5423968_6_1075.jpg" n="2"/>the Union), how a President is elected, how the senators and the cabinet are selected, and what their terms of office are, what their duties are, what salaries they receive, etc.</p>
   <p>Mr. Czarnecki also spoke about the privileges and duties of good citizenship, but because the time was getting late he had to curtail his lecture, and he will finish it on a subsequent occasion.</p>
   <p>After the lecture a general discussion and question period followed; the lecturer cheerfully answered all questions.</p>
   <p>Next, Dr. Sieminowicz concluded his lecture on "Hygiene". The speaker urged all to take care of their health, saying that it is important to us; he designated the various foods that the hard-working laborers should eat, and what foods the white-collar worker should partake of; how to dress and how the wife and <pb facs="5423968_6_1076.jpg" n="3"/>"home manager" should keep a home neat and clean.</p>
   <p>Another discussion then followed, and Dr. Sieminowicz answered the many questions asked him to the satisfaction of the questioners.</p>
   <p>Dr. Czarnecki was asked some additional questions, as for example: "What was Johnson before he became President of the United States?" He answered that Mr. Johnson was a tailor by trade and that originally he could neither read nor write, but that later on he began to study and made such rapid strides that, besides enriching himself in knowledge and education, he earned the respect of many who became his steadfast friends, and in proof of their devotion to him elected him senator, then Vice-President. After the death of the martyred Abraham Lincoln he took possession of the Presidential Chair.</p>
   <p>The hall was crowded with an intelligent audience, and most important is the fact that when one once attends one of these lectures he invariably comes again and brings his friends with him.</p>
