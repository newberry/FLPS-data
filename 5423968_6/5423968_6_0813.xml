   <p>The weekly Zgoda for men and women is already appearing in its own format, no longer borrowing from Dziennik Zwiazkowy, as has been the case for the past three years. This change is decidedly beneficial to this publication of the Polish National Alliance, and of even greater benefit to the members [of the alliance] who read it. At the head of this publication stands a man of broad knowledge and impeccable character, who knows both how to teach and how to interest members of the alliance. Zgoda, in its new format looks very well. Its old form has been returned to it--the form to which members of the alliance had grown accustomed; besides coming out each week, it will give the readers a great deal of educational and historical material.</p>
   <p>He who wants to learn, who enjoys interesting historical material and [information about] other branches of human knowledge, will find these things in the weekly Zgoda; because besides the official material which must go into this <pb facs="5423968_6_0814.jpg" n="2"/>publication, the editor in chief, Professor [T.] Siemiradzki, publishes original educational articles of a popular nature. Furthermore, he has begun the publication of an original historical work entitled Survey of the Political History of Poland. This book is a "meaty" work, though readable by all, worked out with an excellent knowledge of the material. We, therefore, earnestly recommend it to our brother and sister members of the alliance who want to know the true happenings and facts of our country's past.</p>
   <p>The Zgoda for women, under the editorship of Mrs. Michalska, should interest our women readers to an equal degree. They will find therein material suited to the needs of our women.</p>
   <p>However, he who wants to know what is happening daily throughout the world, and have the latest news, short descriptions of various happenings and reports from various Polish settlements; who enjoys reading observations and short <pb facs="5423968_6_0815.jpg" n="3"/>polemic articles and other material; and who likes to read excellent novels etc., should subscribe to Dziennik Zwiazkowy, which is the cheapest daily newspaper, costing only two dollars yearly outside of Chicago, and one cent an issue in Chicago, where it can be obtained from the newsboys or agents in various neighborhoods. Members of the alliance! Support your own daily newspaper, which will not feed you with falsehoods and sensationalism, but will give you clean healthy food in the true Polish and alliance spirit.</p>
