<title level="a">THE NEW SUNDAY EDITION OF THE DZIENNIK CHICAGOSKI</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The new Sunday edition of the Dziennik Chicagoski made its appearance yesterday for the first time.</p>
   <p>Although the first attempt in this new field is always coupled with difficulties in the editorial as well as in the administrative departments and, as in this case, in distribution, our first endeavor managed to overcome these difficulties in time so that the paper was able to appear on the streets as scheduled.</p>
   <p>We are proud to announce, from the publication point of view, that our Sunday edition was a real success. Thousands of copies were distributed all over Chicago. And even today many have inquiries about the Sunday number and purchased copies.</p>
   <p>Many letters have been received by our office commending us for our efforts.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0584.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Such response makes this new venture in Sunday publication a certainty.</p>
   <p>It is not for us to extol the value of this new issue. Suffice it to say that it has some merit. We wish to point out, however, that we have found a number of errors in this first Sunday issue, mistakes that cannot be separated from an initial attempt. But we can make certain that these mistakes will be eliminated in the future. Efforts will be made to make the Sunday editions more interesting and appealing to our readers.</p>
   <p>Apologies are offered for the mistakes that were overlooked in composition, and also because of difficulties in the printing department, which were caused by shortage of time, many issues were not made according to our expectations. All these minor errors will be overcome.</p>
   <p>For those who have not seen a copy of yesterday's edition, we are giving a complete list of the articles which appeared:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0585.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>First page: From the Editorial Department: News telegraphed from abroad, domestic news by telegram, local news, poetry from the homeland, news about the Kosciusko Monument Fund, and an illustrated verse by a poetic dreamer.</p>
   <p>Second page: Editorials, small items, "The Fall of a Millionaire," "Dziennik Polski, of Antrim, Pennsylvania," and small news items.</p>
   <p>Third page: Illustrations of various notables, "The Latest Bicycle," "About Women and for the Ladies," "Latest Styles for Women," "Accomplishments of Women," "The War of the Future," with illustration, and small articles.</p>
   <p>Page four: Literary Section: "Na Wyzynach" (On Lofty Heights), by Mary Rodziewiczowna, and "Dzieci Maryi" (Mary's Children), by Stan....R.</p>
   <p>Page five: "Hurko and His Cohorts" [Hurko was a Russian general who was <pb facs="5423968_6_0586.jpg" n="4"/>noted for his hatred of the Poles]; riddles; "Miatiez" (Mobs), a poem by A. Urbanski; "The Mass of Cardinal Ledachowski"; "Polish Art"; and small items.</p>
   <p>Page six: "Czy to Polak" (Is this a Pole), a poem by Szczesny Zahajkiewicz; "Steps That Assure Successful Marriage," by Burton Kingsland; "Observations of Max O'Reilly about America and Americans"; "Patriotism of an Egotist"; six humorous anecdotes with illustrations; excerpts from the poem "Krzyz" (Cross), by C. Tetmajer, Polish poet; and other poems.</p>
   <p>Page seven: An illustrated poem, "W Tatrach" (In the Tatra Mountains); "Aphorisms of Alexander Dumas"; "Polish Immigrants"; "The Exploitation of Brazilian Emigrants"; "Summer Night," a fantasia by Vincent Kosakiewicz; and statistics on the three largest cities in the world.</p>
   <p>Page eight: Life of the Poles in America; news from the various Polish communities in the United States; news from Poland; and a poem from the <pb facs="5423968_6_0587.jpg" n="5"/>Warszawski Kuryer (Warsaw Courier).</p>
   <p>Page nine: "Pictures from the Future," a novel in serial form by Eugene Richter, and small items.</p>
   <p>Page ten: "Bismarck and Gladstone," "A Year's Residence in a Cemetery," "Legends about the Blessed Mother," "Russian Censorship," "A Sea Serpent," "Chinese Empress-Mother," and small items.</p>

   <p>In all there are twelve pages or seventy-two columns. Of this only twelve columns are taken up by advertisements.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0588.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>This Sunday issue contains a variety of two hundred articles and twenty drawings. All this for only three cents.</p>
   <p>We put it up to the readers to judge for themselves whether or not we can give more for this small amount.</p>
   <p>There are still several hundred copies of yesterday's edition on hand. Copies may be obtained at the offices of the administration, 141-143 West Division Street, at the regular price of three cents a copy.</p>
   <p>Out-of-town readers can get copies upon request with the regular subscription, or upon sending four cents in postage stamps for each copy. Subscription rates are published on page two, column one [three dollars per year or twenty-five cents per month].</p>
   <p>We ask the Polish public to take notice of our Sunday edition and give it support. In this way our work will be made easier and at the same time <pb facs="5423968_6_0589.jpg" n="7"/>it will help to increase the popularity of the Polish press in America.</p>
