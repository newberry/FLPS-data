   <p>We were informed that Doctor Orlowski is making statements in company of his friends that he controls the Bicz Bozy and is fifty-fifty with the "Stinger," the editor of Bicz Bozy.</p>
   <p>Dear Sir: Do you know what is ahead of you for bearing such a title as controller of Bicz Bozy? Do you know what it means for a faithful and pious Christian, who for the sake of Christian Faith was imprisoned in Austrian and Russian dungeons to be closely associated with such condemned person as the "Stinger," the editor of God's Whip? My dear sir, that means hell fire, black boiling pitch and brimstone. Yes, Mr. Orlowski, you better deny your controllership of Bicz Bozy and do not boast about your acquaintance with the "Stinger," because it is very dangerous to have a close connection with such insects; they bite.</p>
