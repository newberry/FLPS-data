<title level="a">A NEW WEEKLY PERIODICAL FOR POLISH WOMEN</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The first edition of the Polish weekly periodical, known as Glos Polek (The Voice of Polish Women), has come into being. This worthy periodical was made the official newspaper of the Polish Women's Alliance by the consent of delegates at the last convention of that organization.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Zwiazkowy wishes to take this opportunity to extend its sincerest wishes of success to this new periodical. Judging from the first edition, we believe it will be not only well edited but also free of various useless polemical onsets. It is anticipated, and sincerely hoped, that there will be no repetition of the printing of personal attacks upon its members, which occurred when the activities of the Polish Women's Alliance were published weekly in one of the Polish newspapers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0486.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Polish Women's Alliance is a rival organization of the Polish National Alliance, in which women enjoy equal rights with men. The women in the Polish National Alliance take part in conventions and in the administration and can take a more extensive part in national affairs than elsewhere. Consequently, one could consider a separate organization for women useless, just as a separate organization for men might be thought nonsensical. We can see no basic difference between a man and a woman in the realm of mental life--in art, education, politics, or any general social or national activity. Such great Polish literary personages as Mmes. Konopnicka and Orzeszkowa wrote for all--men and women alike--as did Adam Mickiewicz and Henry Sienkiewicz. The Polish legendary queen, Hedwig, sacrificed herself in behalf of the whole nation--both the men and the women.</p>
   <p>Our ideal, therefore, is to have all Polish immigrants united in the closest of bonds. This would include all Polish men and women in one large political organization, in which the one and only distinction made between two members would be made on the basis of their relative mental value and their ability to <pb facs="5423968_6_0487.jpg" n="3"/>work for the cause of national solidarity, regardless of age, sex, or personal convictions.</p>
   <p>Our Polish National Alliance is already such an organization. It is anticipated that at some future time we shall see all right-thinking Polish men and women in its bonds, united in common aims and endeavors and working for the welfare of our Polish people and the motherland.</p>
   <p>But that is a thing of the future. The present finds us working side by side with fraternal and sympathetic women's organizations, whose principles and teachings are related very intimately to those of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>In such instances, although rivalry is unavoidable, it does not in the least exclude good and sincere relationships. Such rivalry must be noble or else it would be unworthy of a noble organization and the noble people who belong to it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0488.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Upon what, then, does nobleness in rivalry depend? In the first place it depends upon this: that no rival should resort to the use of unbecoming tactics in order to benefit his organization at the cost of the other. The rival organization should neither be presented in a bad light nor should it be exposed to insincere criticism. In other words, the two factions should not oppose each other with the aid of bitterly cruel, and at times poisoned, tools.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik Zwiazkowy cannot occupy itself with propagating the interests of any other organization, because its duty and need is to work only in behalf of the Polish National Alliance. This duty and that need of heart and mind command us even to petition all sisters of the Polish Women's Alliance, also, to enroll in the Polish National Alliance, either as insured or as uninsured members.</p>
   <p>But it is not permissible for the Polish National Alliance to harm the Polish Women's Alliance by lowering it in the eyes of the public, through <pb facs="5423968_6_0489.jpg" n="5"/>some insincere criticism or something of that nature. After all, the Polish National Alliance, because of its nobleness and its feeling of strength, has never resorted to improper tactics in any of its fights.</p>
   <p>The Polish National Alliance has a right to expect the same consideration from the Polish Women's Alliance. The events of the past year, if they are to serve as a norm, assure the National Alliance that it will obtain a fair deal.</p>
   <p>Let us, therefore, strive among ourselves with fraternal love. Let each praise his own without lowering the others and, let us rival each other, but in the field of social endeavor.</p>
   <p>Such a war will bring the two organizations closer together and society will only benefit by it.</p>
   <p>If one judges from the first edition, he will conclude that Glos Polek will <pb facs="5423968_6_0490.jpg" n="6"/>be a good periodical, and there never are too many of that type. Many men will undoubtedly read this periodical with interest, in the same way that many women, even if they do not belong to the Polish National Alliance, will read with benefit the monthly publication of Zgoda. The latter has been termed, incorrectly, a publication for men, whereas, in reality, it is a paper for everybody. [Translator's note: Zgoda is a monthly paper edited and managed by the Polish National Alliance.]</p>
   <p>Glos Polek will have a sufficient amount of material, if only it wants to edit it. It will have an opportunity to combat every antinational and anti-patriotic trend that steals in among our American Poles, as wolves steal among sheep. It will be able to discuss--with any biased person, with any bigot, with anyone who has plotted against the rights of people to govern themselves, and, finally, with all other elements that destroy sound work among Polish people--a work in the direction of preparing our people to be worthy of fulfilling their civic duties</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0491.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>The newly published Polish periodical can be sure to find a brave and sincere ally in the Dziennik Zwiazkowy in any war for such a principle that Glos Polek may engage.</p>
