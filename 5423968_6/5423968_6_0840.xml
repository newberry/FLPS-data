   <p>Sigmund Slupski has advertised in the last issue of Zgoda that publication of the monthly Art and Freedom will be postponed. Art and Freedom was to have been a monthly magazine dealing with Polish culture. It was to have been written in English and published here in Chicago. As the reason for its postponement, Mr. Slupski gives the recent death in England of Iza Slupski Young, well-known translator, who had prepared a number of articles for the new magazine. Mr. Slupski suggests that no more subscriptions be sent in; money will be refunded upon request to those individuals who have already paid for subscriptions. As to those who have sent subscriptions to Mr. Koziello, of New York, who at present has no connection with the publication, Mr. Slupski suggests they apply to Koziello himself.</p>
   <p>We regret the necessity of this postponement. Such a publication as Art and Freedom could be of real benefit. It was for this reason that Paderewski donated five hundred dollars toward it. Unfortunately, the management--from <pb facs="5423968_6_0841.jpg" n="2"/>the time the idea first arose ten months ago, until today--offers little indication that it will ever be realized. Too bad!</p>
