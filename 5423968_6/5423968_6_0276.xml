  <body>
   <p>For some time past the Polish students of the Armour Institute of Technology have intended to form a club of Polish technicians. After overcoming many obstacles, Mr. J. Burda, one of the students, invited to his home a group of students, who agreed unanimously that a club of this kind would be an important factor in their fraternal and social development. The club is essential, especially if the students hope to participate in [Polish] national affairs and assist each other. That has been done and is still practiced by college students of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>The newly organized club will bear a name that will specifically indicate the nationality of its members and will stand on an equal basis with other clubs of students of the Institute. At the next meeting, which will be held on October 13, 1916, the name and the constitution of the club will be adopted. The constitution will be submitted to the president of the Institute for approval. For the time being, the following students have enrolled in the club:</p>

   <p>J. Burda, F. Szwajkart, A. Klawikowski, E. F. Klajda, J. S. Kula, L. Ablamowicz, S. Modzikowski, L. Jaglowski, and M. F. Winiarski. Mr. W. Pawlowski, a former student of the Institute, was accepted unanimously as an honorary member. In conclusion, it might be mentioned that the Armour Institute of Technology is recognized as one of the best schools of its kind in America.</p>
