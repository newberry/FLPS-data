<title level="a">ZORZA LITERARY AND DRAMATIC SOCIETY HOLDS ITS FIRST MEETING IN BRIDGEPORT</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The newly organized literary and dramatic club held its first meeting on February 1 at Czeslawski's Hall, Bridgeport. The temporary president, M. A. Wleklinski, opened the session; Dr. W. Statkiewicz acted as recording secretary.</p>
   <p>A motion was made to decide upon an official name for the group, and after some discussion it was agreed to adopt the name "Zorza (Northern Light) Dramatic and Literary Society." An initiation fee of twenty-five cents and a monthly fee of ten cents for each member was voted upon and adopted.</p>
   <p>An election of officers was also held, and the following were named: N. L. Piotrowski, president; Dr. W. Statkiewicz, vice-president; M. A. Wleklinski, recording secretary; Dr. J. Weintraub, financial secretary; Max Wojtalewicz, cashier; Stanislaus Cichowicz and Dr. Statkiewicz, singers' committee; Michael Pozarowski, librarian; Stanislaus Marczewski, F. Pniewski, and <pb facs="5423968_6_0050.jpg" n="2"/>S. Chichowicz, library board; Dr. J. Weintraub, dramatics director; N. L. Piotrowski, Dr. Statkiewicz, and Dr. Weintraub, lecture committee.</p>
   <p>The new Society has sixty members and is one of the finest organizations in the community of Bridgeport. It will be to the advantage of the Poles to affiliate themselves with this society. Singing and reading provide a pastime which is both pleasant and educational.</p>
   <p>The aim of the Society is to establish a local library, so that the Polish people may be able to acquaint themselves with their native literature. It is the desire of this organization to spread the seed of culture throughout the community during this year of mourning [anniversary of the Poles' unsuccessful revolt against Russia]. All Poles are requested to support this movement by contributing books for the proposed library.</p>
   <p>Thus far, thanks to the contributions made by several kind citizens, the <pb facs="5423968_6_0051.jpg" n="3"/>librarian has received one hundred books. The names of the donors will be announced soon.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be held Wednesday, February 13, at 7 P.M. in Czeslawski's Hall. Since the choir [of the Society] is to be a mixed one, all women from Bridgeport desiring to sing are invited to participate.</p>
   <p>The first singing lesson will take place Friday, February 15, at 7 P.M. Professor Henzl is the music director.</p>
