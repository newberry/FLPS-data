   <p>A second educational and literary meeting was held by the Poles of Town of Lake on Sunday, February 17, at 6 P.M., at University Hall. The meeting was opened by Dr. T. Kodis.</p>
   <p>The first speaker of the evening was Mr. Chrzanowski, who spoke on the Polish insurrection of 1863. He pointed out its significance as an example of the awakening of the Polish spirit in the nation. His speech was enthusiastically received.</p>
   <p>This address was followed by a musical duet. Mr. Grysinski, playing the violin, and Mr. Wilkoszewski, at the piano, gave a lively rendition of Polish airs. Miss Zurawska contributed a beautiful recitation of "Placz Nad Rzekami Babylonu" (Tears on the Rivers of Babylon), by Ujejski. Her delivery was forceful and stirring.</p>
   <p>The fourth and final number on the program was a talk by Dr. Kodis dealing <pb facs="5423968_6_1097.jpg" n="2"/>with the influence of alcohol on the human organism. He presented a clear and convincing word picture of the reasons for the agitation against the use of alcohol. Dr. Kodis was rewarded with warm applause for his lecture.</p>
   <p>Reverend Pyplatz and the committee deserve credit for arranging these instructive programs, in which variety is injected so that they will prove not only interesting but beneficial to the public.</p>
