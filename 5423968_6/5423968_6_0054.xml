   <p>Last Sunday the Polish Young Ladies' Educational Club gave a reception, which was a great success not only because the attendance was large but also because the public was pleased. The wife of Dr. Lande delighted the audience with her piano selections, and Dr. Janczewski thrilled everyone, carrying us upward with the tones of his violin. Listening to his music made us forget the troubles of this world. Such moments are rare, most uplifting. No wonder that the public was charmed. There was also a lecture and several recitations.</p>
   <p>The next two receptions of the Club will be held on March 4 and 11. If they turn out as successful as this one, then we may count on another donation for the Polish hospital, a donation that will come straight from the heart.</p>
