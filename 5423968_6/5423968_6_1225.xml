   <p>In a Polish neighborhood along Long Avenue between Roscoe and Addison Streets, there lies a parcel of land bought at one time by the Park Commissioners on the North Side of the city. At first the commissioners were undecided what use to make of its new acquisition. But when a Pole, Prof. Szymczak, became a member of the commission a good idea was found, which was put into realization in a short while. The committee resolved to turn the parcel of land into a park.</p>
   <p>Next came the question of naming the park. And Prof. Szymczak suggested holding a contest for naming the park. The contest was held. The park was given the name of Chopin, the Polish musical genius. This name was submitted by a Polish woman, Mrs. Blasczenska, for which she received a medal from the Park Commissioner, Mr. Hill.</p>
   <p>The formal opening ceremonies were held at the park yesterday afternoon. The members of the park commission and other specially invited speakers addressed the numerous public assembled. Prof. M. S. Szymczak acted as chairman.</p>
