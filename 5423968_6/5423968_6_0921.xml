   <p>Studies in the higher school of music, in all its departments, have reached a top speed tempo. Both the younger and the older orchestra classes, have been taking tests for the past two weeks, under the careful direction of Mr. K. Jasinski. On January 29, 1928 the orchestra which is composed of advanced students only, will give their first concert. Wednesday, October 19, will be the young artists's evening, and is arranged by the welfare circle of the Polish American Veterans Organizations, in the Sons of Freedom hall. The following artists will take part: Mr. Waclaw Malinowski young violinist, student of Mr. K. Jasinski; Miss M. Wvrst ballet dancer, student of Miss Marie Hoyne of the school of Mr. K. Jasinski. The very distinguished member of the faculty, Mr. J. Rankel, baritone, will give his first concert in the beautiful school hall at 1110 Milwaukee Ave. on Sunday Oct. 30, 1927 at 4 p.m.</p>
   <p>Another ballet, and entertainment of great interest to all Poles, is being arranged by the advanced classes, for November 20th; and will be given at the Polish National Alliance hall at 1309 N. Ashland avenue. Admission will be free. Our ballet of last season, which was given at the Pulaski hall, attracted 1000 persons.
