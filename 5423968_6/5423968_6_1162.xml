   <p>It requests that all athletic clubs and associations interested in any kind of sport kindly mail the results of their games to this paper. The baseball season is now on. Mail in the scores, line-ups, name of your team, and the place where the game was played. You can also announce coming contests and games in our sport page.</p>
   <p>In accordance with an unofficial report made by this paper to Polish young men to the effect that the Polish Roman-Catholic Union of America is going to organize a baseball league we would like to hear from the various societies and organizations on their standing in this matter. We would be glad to give you any further information in this regard. Just address your mail to the sport editor of the Polish Union Daily.</p>
