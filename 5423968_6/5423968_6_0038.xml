   <p>The Polish Press Club has at last been organized; its membership will include not only professional journalists, but also those engaged in literary work, together with outstanding friends of the journalists and editors. The Polish Press Club comprises representatives of local Polish papers, three of which are daily, and three weekly publications, and hopes that ultimately all Polish newspapers in Chicago will be represented in the club by their editorsand collaborators.. Workers in every branch of industry are forming unions; even the employers and capitalists have their own organizations; so that today - starting with the city street sweeper and ending with the millionaire - everyone is organized to defend his interests and his rights. Only the Polish journalists and literary men remain unorganized, as if unmindful of their mutual concern.</p>
   <p>Though the Polish Press Club will not exert any influence on the individual policies of our newspapers, its existence may raise the ethical standards of our work, by mitigating personal differences, and wiping out offending controversies, which so often inundate and defile our press.</p>
