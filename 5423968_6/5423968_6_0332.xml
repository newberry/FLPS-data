   <p>The Polish-American press, with the small exception of a few journals on which, it seems, the censor's scissors take the place of editors, has dedicated volumes in behalf of the recent all-Polish convention in Detroit. Thirty-five newspapers were represented at this convention; of this number five were dailies, and the others were weeklies or monthlies. Included in this number are also three newspapers of the opposing faction. These three wrote little during the convention itself. They simply noted the facts. When the convention was over, they stretched these facts, often even introducing falsehoods, and they wish to subject the facts to their low private purposes.</p>
   <p>The most space was devoted to matters of the all-Polish convention and to the Polish cause promoted by the Polish National Department by the following Polish dailies: Dziennik Zwiazkowy, Dziennik Narodowy, Dziennik Chicagoski, Polish Daily Record, The Pole in America, and Free Poland. The convention <pb facs="5423968_6_0333.jpg" n="2"/>had a marked influence upon these newspapers, since they discuss seriously the various measures adopted by it.</p>
   <p>Of the weekly publications the following express themselves favorably and enthusiastically about the all-Polish convention: Zgoda, The Polish Nation, The Home Fireside, and The Friend of the People. Many papers have failed to send copies of their issues to the Polish National Department, and it is therefore difficult to determine their position, although it is certain that they wish the cause well. The Polish National Department therefore requests these publications to send their copies to its office that a proper estimate of their views may be made.</p>
