   <p>Books from various sections of America continue to be contributed to the Educational Department of the Polish League. C. J. Szerszen of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, has given fourteen books, and five maps of the United States of North America. This, by the way, is his second contribution.</p>
   <p>Michael Kruszka, publisher of the Kuryer Polski (Polish Courier), has donated twenty-two volumes.</p>
   <p>Miss Mary Jablonska of Chicago has given six Polish books.</p>
   <p>Valentine Liss of Chicago also gave three books.</p>
   <p>Sincere thanks are extended to all donors.</p>
   <p>There are many Polish printing houses in the United States, but to date only <pb facs="5423968_6_0215.jpg" n="2"/>three have offered their publications. More contributions from this direction would be greatly appreciated. An appeal is also directed to those who have books which are no longer of use to them. Gifts of such books would be greatly appreciated.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Educational Department,</p>
   <p>Reverend E. Sedlaczek, president;</p>
   <p>I. Kowalski, secretary,</p>
   <p>141-143 West Division Street,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
