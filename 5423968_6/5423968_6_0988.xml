   <p>We have the greatest hope that the St. Stanislaus Kostka School Hall will be filled to capacity tomorrow at 9:30 A.M. According to previous announcements, tomorrow will mark the opening of regular classes.</p>
   <p>Not only the Polish youth but the older persons should make it a point to attend, for there are enough interesting subjects to please everyone. All have an equal opportunity to learn many things of interest from all fields of learning. Those that have studied and read have a chance to round out their education. Undoubtedly every person will find at least one subject of interest and of value. Once again we wish to repeat that young and old are invited to take advantage of these educational opportunities.</p>
   <p>So far as is known there will be four lecturers, the same that conducted classes last Sunday.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0989.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish will present his second lecture on religion.</p>
   <p>Casimir Neuman will present a talk that will cover the prehistoric times of Poland up to 965 A.D.</p>
   <p>Stanislaus Szwajkart will lecture on astrology.</p>
   <p>Boleslas Klarkowski will present a lecture on Polish literature.</p>
   <p>Between the lectures, songs and declamations will be rendered by the school boys.</p>
   <p>Admission is free.</p>
   <p>Last week the lecturers gave only introductory discussions on their particular subjects. Tomorrow the lectures will begin in earnest. All those that wish to learn are urged to take advantage of these free Sunday school classes.</p>
