   <p>Members of the Polish Press Club held a mass meeting on October 10 at the Polish Roman Catholic Union Hall to conclude the purchase of Mr. John F. Smulski's residence, which will be used as the Club's headquarters. The members approved the purchase and ordered the administration to go ahead with the deal. As a result, a contract will be signed this afternoon, October 11, between Mr. John F. Smulski and the adminstration of the Polish Press Club.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the Club will be on Saturday, October 14, at 2 P. M., at the new headquarters, 2138 Pierce Avenue.</p>
   <p>After settling many matters that affect the Club directly--matters which will be made public in due time--the members listened to a lengthy report by Mr. K. Wachtel relative to the Fredro Theater, a Polish playhouse. According to Wachtel's report, the Fredro Theater will present its inaugural play on <pb facs="5423968_6_0459.jpg" n="2"/>Sunday, October 15, at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish Hall. The management of the theater promised to donate forty per cent of the net profit from this play to the Polish Press Club. The offer was accepted with gratitude, pending the decision of the Club's administration on what to do with the money. It really is a rare occasion that a generous offer like that of the Fredro Theater is made by one organization to another. The Poles in America, and particularly the Polish Press Club, are very grateful for this gift.</p>
