   <p>The Turners' Convention was held last Saturday, Sunday and Monday, in the Pulaski hall. Twenty-four delegates were registered. Mr. Adam Blaszczynski was chosen Chairman and Mr. Stanislaus Osada and Mr. I. G. Szczodrowski were chosen as secretaries.</p>
   <p>The report shows that the Polish Turners' Alliance has over two hundred members, while a year ago there were only one hundred and fifty. During the year one hundred and nineteen members resigned.</p>
   <p>At yesterday's meeting new officers were elected: Mr. Casimir Zychlinski, president; Mr. Leon Czeslawski and Dr. W. Statkiewicz, vice-presidents; Alfons Dziadul, secretary; Anthony Groenwaldt, treasurer.</p>
   <p>The Tribune published a long article in which it announced that the Polish Turners' Alliance has decided to support McKinley at the next election.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1194.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The article was filled with false information and exaggeration. Writing about this Turners' Convention, the Tribune states that there were 250 delegates and as many alternates, and that these delegates were supposedly representing 10,000 active members and that the Polish Turners' Alliance also possessed over 30,000 associate members.</p>
