   <p>Sztandar (The Standard) was probably the first Polish newspaper, with the exception of our journal, to express its opinion about the newly-founded Polish League. Sztandar commented as follows:</p>
   <p>"We have described as concisely as possible the work of the Polish mass meeting. The limited space of our journal does not permit us to write more extensively. In the next issue we will comment upon the newly-founded League. Today we only wish to say that no matter what kind of a league it happens to be it is better than none at all.</p>
   <p>"Those who join it--will begin to work for the good of the nation; and those to whom it appears too conservative, will find in it an inducement for progressive work. It makes no difference from what viewpoint we may discuss it, we must admit that it will do some good, and even in the worst case it will prepare the ground for nationalistic work. On account of this alone we should rejoice that <pb facs="5423968_6_0634.jpg" n="2"/>it was founded."</p>
   <p>These are kind words, and in general they express our own opinion on the subject.</p>
