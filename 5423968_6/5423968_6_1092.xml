   <p>The following article was received by the Dziennik Chicagoski for publication:</p>
   <p>"The third in a series of educational programs was given Sunday, March 3, by the Poles of Town of Lake at the University Settlement House. A Polish historical lecture was delivered by C. Zurawski; it was elaborate in scope and well executed by the speaker.</p>
   <p>"A guest from the University of Chicago, Mr. Settler, who is English, rendered a violin solo. His interpretation of Wieniawski's "Mazurka" was received with enthusiasm by the audience.</p>
   <p>"The third number on the program consisted of solos by Mr. Wojnicki, who sang a number of Polish songs. The crowd was pleased with his singing.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1093.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"This concluded the short but interesting and entertaining program. Although there were no other numbers listed on the entertainment program, a surprise awaited the audience.</p>
   <p>"As is well known, these educational and variety affairs are held in the University Settlement House, which is operated by the University of Chicago. The aim of this settlement is to foster education in this section of the town. These programs are made possible through the co-operation of the public. Lectures, concerts, etc., make up the many programs that are held from time to time.</p>
   <p>"The president of the institution, Miss Mc Dowell, offered the use of the hall free of charge in view of the year of national mourning. [1895 was set aside by the Poles of Chicago to commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of the third partition of Poland.] At the previous meeting, she expressed a desire to say something to the Polish group. This was granted. At the close of last Sunday's program, Miss Mc Dowell expressed a warm <pb facs="5423968_6_1094.jpg" n="3"/>sympathy for the Polish nation. Later, she ordered the Polish flag raised in the hall. She ended her short address by urging the Poles to take advantage of the various concerts, lectures, readings and plays. Then she invited the entire audience to remain and take part in open discussions.</p>
   <p>"Mr. Zurawski, in the name of the Polish group, thanked the speaker for her condolences and her kind invitation. Everyone remained and spent a few interesting hours in conversation and in listening to fine music.</p>
   <p>"The public is urged to attend these interesting gatherings in larger numbers. They will find real satisfaction in the programs of variety.</p>
   <p>"According to the ninth issue of the Kropidlo (Sprinkler), a notice was published to the effect that Reverend Pyplatz has declined to make announcements of these lectures at the Settlement from the pulpit. This is erroneous, for Reverend Michael C. Pyplatz, pastor of St. Joseph Parish, never <pb facs="5423968_6_1095.jpg" n="4"/>refused a request of the committee in charge of the programs. In reality, an announcement was made about this affair.</p>
   <p>"It might be a good idea for the Kropidlo not to take part in something it does not know anything about.</p>
   <p>"One of the audience"</p>
