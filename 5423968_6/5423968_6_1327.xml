<title level="a">SAINT STANISLAUS KOSTKA PARISH SOCIETIES MEET TO DISCUSS FESTIVAL</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish societies met yesterday at 2 P.M. in the Bradley Street Hall to discuss plans for the coming Polish picnic.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by Reverend Vincent Barzynski, who appointed John Nering secretary.</p>
   <p>The pastor explained the noble purpose of the picnic and urged all societies to participate. He called upon those organizations unable or unwilling to take an active part, to make at least some contribution for the benefit of the Kosciusko monument.</p>
   <p>The following societies were represented at the meeting and have signified their intention to participate:</p>
   <p>Holy Trinity Society (260 members),</p>
   <p>Holy Cross Society (150 members),</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1328.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Saint Cecilia Society (190 members),</p>
   <p>Saint Michael Society (190 members),</p>
   <p>Saints Peter and Paul Society (120 members),</p>
   <p>Saint Casimir the Prince Society (240 members),</p>
   <p>John Sobieski Society,</p>
   <p>Saint Hedwig Society,</p>
   <p>Blessed Virgin Mary Society (240 members),</p>
   <p>Saint Joseph Society Number 2,</p>
   <p>Saint Adalbert Society,</p>
   <p>Saint Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Society,</p>
   <p>Saint Anthony Society,</p>
   <p>Saint Stephen Society, and Polish Uhlan's Society.</p>
   <p>Officers of other societies which have not as yet decided to take part in the picnic were present at the meeting. They were invited to participate and promised to talk to the members of their organizations as soon as possible.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1329.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Other societies represented, but which had not as yet held their regular meetings, announced through their representatives that they would heartily support the picnic, and that even in case they were unable to take part in the parade, they would at least make a collection among their members for the benefit of the monument.</p>
   <p>This concluded the meeting.</p>
