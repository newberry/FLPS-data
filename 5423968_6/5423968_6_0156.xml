   <p>A grand picnic was held yesterday for the benefit of the Polish National Alliance Library and Museum. Three special trains brought about 1,500 persons to the park. The park, however, was not overcrowded, as has been the case on previous occasions, therefore, there was sufficient space to accomodate all.</p>
   <p>The program was arranged by the committee to the complete satisfaction of all. The young element and also the older people enjoyed themselves, dancing to the tunes of a first class orchestra. In another section of the park, stands for refreshments were conveniently located.</p>
   <p>Friends and acquaintances were camping in great numbers on the bank of the stream which flows through the park. Contests, races, and various other games were also part of the program. One group of picnickers left the grounds at 7 p.m., the last group left on the 9 p.m. train.</p>
   <p>Although tired, all returned in good spirits with pleasant memories of an excellent time; and there is no doubt, all enjoyed a well earned sleep.</p>
