<title level="a">AN OPEN LETTER TO THE POLISH TECHNICIANS OF AMERICA</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The support accorded to the Polish Technicians' Association of America by our people and particularly by the Polish professional technicians has made it possible for the Association to lease its own headquarters. The new quarters will consist of an office for the secretary, a clubroom in which a well-equipped library will be found, and a reading room. In addition there will be a lecture hall for classes and for recitals.</p>
   <p>Regular evening lectures will commence when the hall is adequately furnished, and when a sufficient number of listeners are willing to gather to take the courses. At any rate,it is anticipated that the new headquarters will open their doors to the public approximately on October 15, 1918.</p>
   <p>Since for the time being regular evening courses will be conducted for members <pb facs="5423968_6_0933.jpg" n="2"/>only, it is understood that those who wish to benefit by these classes should file their applications in advance with the Association. Every person enrolled for such courses must attend them from the very beginning in order to benefit by them. It must also be remembered that equipping a classroom involves considerable expense. This the Association cannot meet without the support of its members. Applications for membership in the Association should be filed by those who wish to gain the full benefit of the lectures no later than October 1, 1918.</p>
   <p>Listed below are the courses that will be given:</p>
   <p>1) A course in drafting, mathematics, and the mechanical construction of machinery. These classes will be conducted by Engineer J. B. Wasilewski</p>
   <p>2) Mechanical and chemical technology, a course on materials and their production, transformation, and technical application. Engineer T. Krakowiak will conduct the classes.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0934.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>All inquiries for further information and applications for membership should be addressed to the headquarters of the Association. All interested persons should address their letters as follows:</p>
   <p>Mr. Roman Turczynowicz, Secretary,</p>
   <p>Polish Technicians' Association of America,</p>
   <p>1152 Milwaukee Avenue,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois</p>
   <p>(Signed) Engineer C. Szymanski, president</p>
   <p>Engineer R. Turczynowicz, secretary</p>
