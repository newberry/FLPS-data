   <p>One of the primary duties of a loyal Polish paper is to publish all the news pertinent to the Poles. After this is accomplished, elaboration of certain articles or ideas which the paper represents or supports, may be of secondary importance. Only then should the publishers and editors give vent to their feelings.</p>
   <p>This policy is followed, for example, by the Dziennik Chicagoski, which deems it irrelevant who introduces a new project of general importance, who builds new churches, schools, or hospitals, who arranges lectures, readings, theatres, concerts, or socials, who starts a campaign for contributions, who starts new organizations, whether they are religious or national.</p>
   <p>We are of the opinion that every regular priest consecrated by a bishop and <pb facs="5423968_6_0549.jpg" n="2"/>living according to the teachings of Rome [Vatican] belongs to one religious order [Roman Catholic]. It is not for us to be in sympathy with individual cases, nor antagonistic for that matter; that is to say, it is not for us to glorify publicly the accomplishments of one at the expense of another.</p>
   <p>The same applies to those who arrange lectures, theatres, concerts, or public socials. It does not matter what parish, organization, or faction arranges them. We are prepared to accept any good endeavor as an accomplishment, and will often avoid commenting on its shortcomings if they are not of evil intent but are caused by inability or lack of funds.</p>
   <p>In the event that criticism is cast at factions of opposition it is done objectively, after reading the facts and arguments. Ironic or sarcastic remarks are made only when an overabundance of subversion and quackery are apparent.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0550.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Thanks to our policy, no one is bold enough to accuse us of onesidedness, and we do not lose any standing among faithful Catholics, but gain supporters among the nationalists.</p>
   <p>Does the Zgoda (Harmony) pursue such a policy? As far as it is concerned nothing exists except the Rapperschwyl Fund, Polish National Alliance Home, Standard of Polish Women, Polish Army Corps, Dziennik Narodowy [Proposed Polish National Daily], and a systematic attack on the Polish clergy. It takes little interest in the value of the programs staged by societies belonging to the Polish National Alliance, such as concerts staged by choral groups, lectures by "professors," and the like, which might stimulate the reader's interest.</p>
   <p>Manifestations of Polish Roman Catholic life do not exist insofar as the Zgoda is concerned. If they do mention this subject it is only after <pb facs="5423968_6_0551.jpg" n="4"/>certain changes have been made or to arouse bitterness. Polish Roman Catholic churches are nothing but exploiters of ignorant people, its schools sources of superstition, its exercises nothing but farces, and its patriotism a delusion, according to the Zgoda.</p>
   <p>Did the Zgoda publicize and give support to the evening and Sunday school opened at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish? Surely the courses are advantageous to the few hundred that attend.</p>
   <p>Let us take other examples. Last week the St. Casimir Young Men's Society celebrated its tenth anniversary at the Polish Hall on Bradley Street. This was a gala affair. This will not be denied by one of the editors of the Zgoda who was there in person. Everything on the program was overflowing with patriotism. One of the finest speeches made was delivered by John F. Smulski, an Alliance member, who a few hours previously made <pb facs="5423968_6_0552.jpg" n="5"/>an address at an affair staged by the Kosciusko Society at Holy Trinity Parish. He deemed this occasion important enough to attend.</p>
   <p>The Zgoda treated this affair as it does political bosses who have done nothing for the Polish people. It is content with calling the Dziennik Chicagoski merely a parish mouthpiece.</p>
   <p>In conclusion we wish to ask: Is the Zgoda a Polish paper?</p>
