<title level="a">DZIENNIK CHICAGOSKI PUBLISHES TWO EDITIONS DAILY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Yesterday for the first time Dziennik Chicagoski published two daily editions. This was made possible by the installation of new presses.</p>
   <p>This change has made it possible to render better service to our readers. Patterned after the American press, two editions will hereafter be published daily. The early edition is off the press at 2 P.M. the second at 4:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>The first edition, as usual, contains news and telegrams received up to 12 o'clock noon. The second edition contains "final news"; that is, news received after the first edition has gone to press. Among this news, items from Washington, D. C. will be found; for example, today a dispatch was received at 1:15 P. M. about a fire in the Patent Office. This is a feature that is not practiced by the Polish press at large.</p>
   <p>The second edition, thanks to the speed of the new presses, was found on the newstands between 5 and 6 o'clock in the evening yesterday.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0623.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In this respect we stand on an equal basis with the American press, and ahead of the German publications.</p>
   <p>The second edition, of course, can only be sold in the vicinity of the publication office. Communities farther away, and out-of-town subscribers, receive the first edition.</p>
   <p>From now on two editions will be published. Efforts will be made to make the final edition replete with news of the day for our readers in the nearby Polish communities.</p>
   <p>Gradually other changes, such as better information, feature articles, correspondence, etc., will be introduced.</p>
   <p>Those desirous of placing announcements, facts, or other news in the second edition may do so if they call at our office before 3 P. M.</p>
