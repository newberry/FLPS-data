   <p>Yesterday should be long remembered by Chicago Poles. The day was marked by two noteworthy occurrences, two important manifestations that give proof of our national vigor.</p>
   <p>The lecture on Polish art was given yesterday at the Memorial Art Palace on the lake front; the Polish Art Section was also inaugurated yesterday at the Fine Arts Palace in Jackson Park.</p>
   <p>The lecture was delivered in Hall number three at the Memorial Art Palace. The rather small hall was filled to capacity, and among the audience a great many Poles were to be found. The lecture was prepared by Mr. M. Zmigrodzki and delivered by M. Drzemala. The text of the lecture will appear in <pb facs="5423968_6_1119.jpg" n="2"/>Monday's issue. It was carefully prepared and presented a clear outline of the history of our art, past and present. The lecturer concluded by emphasizing that we have risen to our present cultural level in spite of political oppression. In general, the lecture held the attention of the audience and was applauded vigorously at its conclusion.</p>
   <p>The lecture itself was admirably illustrated by numerous reproductions of the more important works of our masters, which were used by the speaker as examples. After he had finished, these specimens were circulated among the audience. "Torches of Nero," "Rejtan," "Union," and especially the three Grottger Cycles attracted general attention and called forth numerous questions, which were willingly answered by the Poles who were present. The most important paintings were explained by Mr. Zmigrodzki. Grottger's martyrological cycle of our nation was particularly appreciated.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1120.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In a word, the lecture was successful. It served once again to bring our cause to general attention, it demonstrated our cultural level, and it retraced the injustices which we have suffered.</p>
   <p>Most of those who attended the lecture were present at the inauguration of a Polish Art Section at the Palace of Fine Arts in Jackson Park. The program began at 4:15, in Hall number sixty-two. The little hall was filled mostly with Poles, but a number of Americans, newspaper reporters, etc. were present. The program was opened with a speech in English by Peter Kiolbassa. He explained the purpose of the gathering and pointed out the reasons for the comparatively small number of Polish paintings exhibited. He spoke of political conditions in Poland, conditions which barely permitted our artists to exhibit their work as Poles at the World's Fair. Finally, he called the attention of those present to three paintings by Malczewski--"Death Of An Exiled Woman," symbolizing Polish martyrdom; "Jadwiga," symbolizing our <pb facs="5423968_6_1121.jpg" n="4"/>spiritual strength; and "Wernyhora," prophesying the resurrection of Poland. These paintings appeal directly to our hearts, and to the hearts of all peoples; in any case, these and other works prove definitely that we work and progress despite political oppression.</p>
   <p>After this beautiful address, which was applauded enthusiastically, the gathering moved to the gallery on the second floor, at Mr. Kiolbassa's request. The next speaker, M. Drzemala, spoke on the significance of this first exhibit of Polish art in America. He called attention to the good points in the works of our artists, and to the fact that these paintings are our only representation at the Fair and that they remind people from all corners of the world of the name of Poland. In conclusion, he acknowledged the noble American hospitality, which permits us to take our place beside other nations despite political conditions in Europe.</p>

   <p>Professor Dunikowski spoke next in the name of the visitors from Poland, expressing his joy at being able to view the work of Polish genius at the Exposition. "In view of our presence here and our efforts", he said, "Poland is not lost--nor will it be lost!" ("Polska Nie Zginela--i Nie Zginie!")</p>
   <p>Mr. Basset, one of the directors of the Exposition's congresses, expressed himself sympathetically on the activity of the Poles and on our art in particular.</p>
   <p>The last Polish address was made by H. Nagiel, who said that it was a joy to see Polish paintings exhibited under the same roof with the artistic accomplishments of all other nations, that our Polish tongue, resounding through these halls, protests against the political oblivion to which we have been doomed. After calling attention to a few of the paintings exhibited, the speaker concluded by paying homage to the Stars and Stripes, under the <pb facs="5423968_6_1123.jpg" n="6"/>protection of which we may participate in this Exposition--as Poles. All of the addresses were generously applauded. Mr. Nagiel's speech closed the inauguration program. After viewing the exhibit, the invited guests proceeded to the Polish restaurant, where the Committee of 101 had prepared a modest reception. A few hours were spent thus in pleasant companionship over a glass of wine.</p>
   <p>The inauguration was eminently successful; everyone was satisfied and happy. All sections of Chicago's Polonia were numerously represented by their more important citizens. The Polish clergy was represented by the Reverends J. Barzynski, A. Nowicki, F. Lange, and E. Siedlaczek. Most of the visitors from Poland who are in Chicago were also present. Representatives of both Zwiazek (Polish National Alliance) and n (Polish Roman Catholic Union) attended; in fact, all parties and factions were represented.</p>
   <p>A majority of today's American newspapers have made favorable comments on the inauguration.</p>
