<title level="a">FOURTH LECTURE PRESENTED IN TOWN OF LAKE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The fourth in a series of lectures was presented in Town of Lake last Sunday, March 17. [Translator's note: This series of programs was held at the University of Chicago Settlement House.] Countess Lubienska spoke on the life of Vincent Pol, an outstanding Polish poet, and specimens of his work were recited. The large audience applauded the speaker enthusiastically for her splendid lecture.</p>
   <p>Miss Dziekonska, a local pianist, presented Chopin's "Impromptu" as the second number on the program. The third number was a declamation by little Miss Sniegocka. Mr. Nuszkowski, popular businessman of Town of Lake, then appealed to the audience to continue its support by attending all future lectures. This appeal was followed by a piano solo by Miss Brown, and a violin solo by Mr. Cheese.</p>
   <p>The hall was filled to capacity. All those that attended left with a lighter heart and a firmer spirit.</p>
