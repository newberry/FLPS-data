  <body>
   <p>Since the Lwow Exposition Committee for America has placed me in charge of the journalistic section, I am preparing a report about the Polish-American journalism which will be displayed at the Exposition. I am also sorting Polish-American newspapers which were or are published in America. This collection will be sent to Lwow in a few days.</p>
   <p>I have on hand a large accumulation of material necessary for the report and the exhibits at the Polish pavilion. The information still lacking, as well as some missing copies of newspapers, will be supplied by private persons to whom I have applied. Therefore, I appeal once more publicly to all present and former editors and publishers of Polish newspapers, and also to all persons of good will, to supply me with information and exhibits suitable for my purpose.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0636.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In my opinion, we should present the history and condition of Polish journalism in America objectively, and specimens should be exhibited.</p>
   <p>Editors of Polish publications are asked to send short autobiographical sketches, notes on their journalistic and literary works, and histories of Polish publications which they have edited or are editing.</p>
   <p>Publishers are asked to offer or lend copies of Polish publications, especially the first issues and bound volumes of newspapers which were published between January 1 and April 5, 1894.</p>
   <p>All are asked to send the necessary information and newspapers as soon as possible, because my work must be completed in ten days.</p>
   <p>H. Nagiel</p>
   <p>In charge of Polish journalism in America. 141 West Division Street, Chicago.</p>
