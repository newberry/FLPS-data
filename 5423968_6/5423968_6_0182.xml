   <p>The Educational Department of the Polish League held a meeting in the editorial room of the Dziennik Chicagoski last Monday, November 18. At the meeting it was agreed that one hundred books should be sent to the recently organized library at Antrim, Pennsylvania. The Library Committee was also told to complete plans for a ninth library.</p>
   <p>Because the members from distant Polish communities did not attend this meeting, it was decided to postpone the discussion of other business until November 27. All members are urged to attend this coming session because there are some very important matters to be discussed. The meeting will be held at the Polish Publishing Company, 141-143 West Division Street. The meeting will be called to order promptly at 7:30 P.M.</p>
   <p>In view of the present hard times, it is imperative that the Educational <pb facs="5423968_6_0183.jpg" n="2"/>Department try as hard as possible to fulfill the requirements imposed by the Polish League. Only education supported by the principles of the Holy Faith [Roman Catholic religion] can lift us from the moral downfall and direct us to the road of peace, unity and love for one another.</p>
   <p>If we are to accomplish much it must be by deeds, not words; by quiet industry, not by creating noise and confusion; and by our own sincere efforts, not by degrading others. If we work in this way the fruit of our toil must be good.</p>
   <p>Let us admonish those who stray from the straight and narrow path, but let this admonishment be sincere, brotherly, without sarcasm. The harvest is truly abundant, but there is a lack of harvesters. Wherever you turn there is a need, but no one volunteers to fill these needs. That is why it is a cardinal duty of the Educational Department to uplift the fallen and to instill a patriotic and religious spirit, and a respect for the servants of the church.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0184.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Let us work, but let us do so sincerely, with the help of God and people of goodwill, and we will live to see better times.</p>
   <p>In the name of the Educational Department,</p>
   <p>Reverend John Kasprzycki, vice-president,</p>
   <p>I. Kowalski, secretary,</p>
   <p>143-145 West Division Street.</p>
