   <p>There was a very beautiful celebration yesterday, Sept. 22, 1921, at the new headquarters of Dziennik Zjednoczenia (Polish Union Daily). It was the dedication of the enlarged headquarters and the printing establishment of Narod Polski, which are now being occupied by Dziennik Zjednoczenia.</p>
   <p>The speeches given by the chaplain, the president, the editor, and the vice-president of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union made a very profound impression upon the participants.</p>
   <p>There is a great ardor for work and willingness to serve the immigration. Mr. John F. Smulski, the president of the Polish National <pb facs="5423968_6_0321.jpg" n="2"/>Department, took active part at the banquet.</p>
   <p>The first number of Dziennik Zjednoczenia appeared right after 10 P. M. on Sept. 22, 1921. An hour later Rev. B. Celichowski, the chaplain of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, and Mr. N. Piotrowski, the president of the Union, entered the editorial offices of our paper. There were also present other officers of the Union, the editors and friends of our organization and the newly founded paper.</p>
   <p>The Chaplain's Talk. After the dedication of the headquarters and the printing press, Rev. Cichowski, the chaplain of the Union, delivered a short talk to the participants, stressing the great importance of the newly established newspaper, the chief supporter of the laws protecting our poor working people.</p>
   <p>Not only the American chauvinists, but also other perverting elements <pb facs="5423968_6_0322.jpg" n="3"/>are trying to warp the traditional adherence of our people to their faith and country; to make them a prey of fate in the struggle for existence. The newly established newspaper must protect the Polish spirit and Polish language and stand guard over that lofty adherence of our people to the Roman-Catholic faith. The editors of this paper ought to work zealously in this direction, cooperating, rejecting all personal interests and caring only for the welfare of the community.</p>
   <p>The words of the chaplain made a profound impression upon the listeners; his faith in the mission of the new propagator of the true Catholic and Polish principles filled the hearts of the listeners with a strong faith and assurance that our paper will fulfill its mission.</p>
   <p>The Resolution of the Editors. Mr. Z. Stefanowicz, the head editor of our paper, then took the stand and assured the listeners that with <pb facs="5423968_6_0323.jpg" n="4"/>the cooperation of his well qualified co-workers, he will be able to fulfill his mission. He did not make any extraordinary promises.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Agnes Klawiter, the vice-president of the Union, also spoke wishing the new paper success and stating that the women members of the Union are proud of the new paper. Mr. H. Piotrowski, president of the Union, spoke about the dangers caused by the subversive elements in Polish communities.</p>
   <p>The final speaker was Mr. Peter Rostenkowski, ex-president of the Union.</p>
   <p>The celebration was ended by the banquet at the Wawel Restaurant.</p>
