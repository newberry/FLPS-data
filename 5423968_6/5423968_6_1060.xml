   <p>Professor Lutoslawski writes us, from the West Coast, that he has given several lectures at Stanford University, and the University of California. He also received invitations to lecture, from the University of Nevada, at Reno, The University of Nebraska, at Lincoln, and the University of Wisconsin, at Madison.</p>
   <p>Besides lecturing on Poland, in general, and the renowned Plato, he announced - that in the near future, in both California Universities, he was to lecture on the following subjects: "Socialism in Poland", the "Constitution of Poland", "Hindoo Reincarnation", "Polish and Greek Poets", "Willpower", "The Yogi System in India", "Ungodly comedy of Krasinaki", "Darwins predecessor of Poland", "The Polish Theory of Evolution and their Method of learning foreign languages".</p>
   <p>This renowned scholar, who has ability to lecture on so many subjects, is certainly making himself very useful in America. Due to his grand education and practiced use of the American language, Professor Lutoslawski is one Pole from Europe to whom the doors of American Universities are readily opened. So - let him reap a long and extensive career. Because of his great learning, he will be able to shed light on our Poland; bringing to the attention of the American intelligentia, not only the facts, but also the spiritual history of the Polish Nation, for the good of those in this country.</p>
