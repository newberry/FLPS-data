  <body>
   <p>From the very beginning of its existence your Dziennik is characterized by outmoded views which have no reason for existence in these days of progress and enlightenment. Being characterized by biased formulas, Dziennik does not possess a judgment or a mind, of its own, but listens only to the commands of certain factions which consider themselves infallible. Consequently, it is biased; it does not consider anything good which is not in conformity with the extreme views of these factions. It is, in a word, only a page boy, an instrument in the hands of a few people who desire to govern and to force their convictions upon others. There are thousands of examples that I could present in this matter, but I will limit myself to only a few of them.</p>
   <p>The Dziennik, it is true, does not occupy itself with mathematics, but, for the sake of a better understanding of the ensuing arguments, I must here present a mathematical example, which, until recent times, was considered the most absolute <pb facs="5423968_6_0676.jpg" n="2"/>truth of science. As a child, I was taught that two times two equals four. What a reactionary notion! Today I wonder at myself that I could believe such an outmoded and antiquated formula. Learning to count better, I discovered that in our age of progress it is possible to prove clearly that two times two is only two, or five, or three, according to the need. I submit a most evident proof of this, recognizable by the enlightened and progressive.</p>
   <p>(Editor's note: This proof, truly not understandable by all, but very comical, we submit in explanation:</p>
   <p>2 2-2 2=(2+2) (2-2)</p>
   <p>2(2-2)=(2+2) (2-2)</p>
   <p>2=2+2</p>
   <p>2=4)</p>
   <p>Logic is mathematics in words. This you employ in your service. But your error lies exactly in that, just as reactionaries in mathematics, you hold to certain set formulas, refusing to recognize the fact that in a progressive and enlightened <pb facs="5423968_6_0677.jpg" n="3"/>age these rules have absolutely no significance. Because somewhere in the catechism you have read the passage: "Man is created for that purpose; to know and love God and serve Him faithfully," you wish to apply this to everything, inferring from a logical pretext that in all actions it is necessary to rely upon religion, and you wish to apply religion to unrelated affairs, political, national, and social.</p>
   <p>How can this conform to the progress of the nineteenth century? It is well known throughout the world today that religion is a hindrance in the school and an obstruction in national matters, that, in short, it has nothing in common either with the progress of the citizens or the education of their children. It is possible to respect religion, but to mix it in civil matters, and especially in purely national ones--that is an unheard-of retrogression!</p>
   <p>It is a known fact that there are many denominations. You wish to present one denomination as the only true one, and you stubbornly adhere to the belief that it is infallible. Such is your logic. Yet progress teaches us that all professions of faith are good--but is it possible to talk with people who so stub <pb facs="5423968_6_0678.jpg" n="4"/>bornly adhere to worn-out formulas?</p>
   <p>The Catholic priests are governing you; hence, you claim that the Catholic religion should also be applied in Polish politics. You also assert that a majority of Poles profess the Catholic religion. That is a most evident falsehood. In reality, the Poles from the time of Mieczyslaw I have been Calvinists--and the Catholic priests and bishops have lost Poland! Do you believe it? Well, what of that? Neither do we believe you! If you are free to claim that two times two is four, then we are free to say that two times two equals two. We have proof to support us.</p>
   <p>On the basis of your biased logic, the Catholic priests are the most educated people among the Poles; they are the leaders of enlightenment; they are the best advisers in national matters. Let them tend to their breviaries--that is their trade. To interfere in the upbringing of our children, to direct enlightenment and progress, interfere in national matters--that is not their business. Are they the most educated? Is it because they have never read, and have prohibited <pb facs="5423968_6_0679.jpg" n="5"/>others from reading, the stories of Dumas, Zola, Kock, and so many other renowned and enlightened people? Is that the way they educate, when they do not allow reading and learning about the things that are beautiful? Is this the manner in which they serve progress, by prohibiting others from looking upon the ravishing and charming pictures of our national artists? Is this how they care about the national affairs, that at every step they obstruct every independent manifestation with some proscriptions, and endeavor to introduce prayers in our meetings?</p>
   <p>Behold, the profiteers! They amass wealth and erect palaces for themselves. For this, the poor people are toiling. Look at any of the parishes: rich property belongs to the priests, and the hard-working people in the vicinity of every church walk ragged, giving their every cent for these priestly palaces. But what prosperity there is, wherever there is no church or priestly government. What education! What a lively interest in national matters! what a pleasant life! It is sufficient to go to the mines of Pennsylvania to be convinced of this--it is enough to look upon the miserable creatures in the Chicago parishes to understand what priestly government leads to. Do you not believe it? Well, <pb facs="5423968_6_0680.jpg" n="6"/>then, we do not believe you!</p>
   <p>You also prevent us from playing. If a man, tired of the hardships of a full week's work and the burdensome battle against the profiteering, parasitic priests, wishes to dance on a Saturday night or spend Sunday pleasantly at some gay picnic, then you begin to rant. Dziennik, that priestly organ, immediately steps in with a moral lesson; it reminds us of some Baltimore enactments; it does not want to encourage any such pastimes, nor does it even want to write about them later. Behold, what your backward logic leads to! Praying in an age of progress means defending the people from profiteering monks; it means enlightening them and leading them upon the path of progress. Moreover, a picnic on a Sunday morning or a ball lasting all of Saturday night (followed by a good sleep on Sunday morning), is a better prayer than the mumbling of formal prayers in church.</p>
   <p>As you are subordinate to the priests in other matters, so in national politics are you dependent upon the Democratic party, and are sold to it body and soul. Why? Because you once imagined that it had policies favorable to you. It is <pb facs="5423968_6_0681.jpg" n="7"/>to your liking, for example, that in various states it defends parochial schools and, hence, supports ignorance.</p>
   <p>Without doubt, the Democratic party has some good policies, as, for example, its attitude on the question of tariff reform. It is worthy of support. But, at the same time, [political] independence should be retained, because if it were easier for a Pole to obtain a place after a Republican party victory, or if some Pole should see an advantage in combatting the Democratic party, it would be proper to support that Pole wholeheartedly in the fight. This would show that we were not dependent.</p>
   <p>In the first week of Dziennik's existence, we predicted that it would shortly collapse because of its servitude and its dependence upon reactionary and worn-out formulas, because of lack of judgment and a mind of its own. It has not collapsed as yet, but, evidently, it is now breathing its last. In desperation, it first enlarged its size; later, it even began to include a supplement; finally, it promised to pay for articles! But we are acquainted with such deceit, with <pb facs="5423968_6_0682.jpg" n="8"/>these maneuvers and all this trickery. It is known to our entire Polish settlement that already no one wishes to read the Dziennik and that you print larger editions only to befuddle the people.</p>
   <p>Reform while there is time! Develop your own mind and your own judgment, because the mind and judgment which you manifest in a pharisaical manner is only servitude and biased formulas! Reform--because you are heading toward oblivion!</p>
   <p>One of your well-wishers</p>
