   <p>The second special New Year edition of the Dziennik Chicagoski is off the press and open to the judgment of the Polish reading public. This edition was carefully prepared and edited according to a special plan which, in the main, gives a summary of all the Polish-American events of the preceding year. Along with this, many feature articles, penned by aspiring writers and those who write for a hobby, are included.</p>
   <p>It is needless for us to write about the reasons which prompted us to publish the first issue of this kind last year--and which prompted us to repeat the same this year. These were well publicized a year ago. A summary of the main purposes of the New Year edition is as follows: To take account of our strength and to take stock, at least to a certain degree, of the kind of writing abilities we [the Polish people] possess.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0631.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Truly, it is difficult to ascertain the results of this experiment after two attempts, mainly because such experiments do not take hold. The idea was too novel, and as a result many were wary of it. Conditions for common equality and general peace, in the wake of Kosciusko's year [Translator's note: 1894 was dedicated to the memory of the Polish hero], however, were more favorable; consequently, there was a common appearance of support for the various proposals. Today, as the echo of the quarrels of the numerous factions is heard anew, there is a lack of this feeling of common equality, which was so instrumental in conjoining everyone, if not under one standard, then at least in one place. No matter how one may look upon this experiment, it cannot be said that it is something tried at random.</p>
   <p>The fruits gathered by us from this experiment are not only satisfactory, but they are also abundant. Without question there are many interesting articles in our collection of material. The contributions are distinctive and of divergent views. We did not hesitate to place before us the semblance of characteristically contentious material, because the nature of the collection permits it. We were <pb facs="5423968_6_0632.jpg" n="3"/>not directed by individual sympathy or antipathy; we only removed from our collection of contributions articles from notorious calumniators and conductors of injurious scandals, which have no place amid respectable people.</p>
   <p>The nature of our annual literary contest should not be based upon the same conditions, nor be influenced by us--with the exception of one stipulation. In some respects this contest is appealing, it does encourage many persons to write, and many write a contribution, if only once a year, and pour out the opinions they have been harboring on things of the day.</p>
   <p>Our collection of contributions takes up most of the columns in this issue. It is replete with literary and current articles, and, above all, it contains many curious and interesting excerpts from the Lwow Polish-American Pavilion Memorial Book, a catalog of the Lwow Fair in which Polish-American life was represented. We especially recommend these articles to our readers.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: This special issue of January 2, 1895, contains twelve pages-ordinarily the paper contains only four pages.]</p>
