  <body>
   <p>In view of the coming conference, an old custom, I write the following article, in which I discuss my services as a director of Zgoda.</p>
   <p>My ideals. What interest do my ideals hold for you? Meditate a while, dear reader, upon this question.</p>
   <p>My ideals would be of no interest to you, dear brothers, if I were an ordinary human, but in my ideals as an editor of your organ there is much to note and they should be of some interest to you; since Zgoda is the soul of our organization it takes the necessary steps for our institution, it is the true mirror in which everybody can see the organization and see it as it truly is.</p>
   <p>And so every member of the organization should examine and familiarize himself with the ideals of his editor and judge their quality, whether <pb facs="5423968_6_0529.jpg" n="2"/>good or bad; whether they bring success and profit to our institution or destruction and loss.</p>
   <p>I should like to inform you that our institution is based upon principles that were changed and improved at the last conference. These principles or virtues which may be known better to us under any circumstances cannot be changed, because otherwise we would lose our character and position as a Polish national institution, we would handicap it and then we would not be able to fulfill the position of a great messenger to the Poles in America. It was stated at a conference that the P. N. A. admits every Pole agreeing to abide by the constitution, and carrying in his heart the sincere ambition to aid the general public, regardless of what faith he has adopted. It was rumored that the above paragraph might cause the downfall of the organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0530.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Other strict Catholics prophesied that the above paragraph would scare away those who are deeply and strongly bound to the Roman-Catholic Church, but what of this prophecy?</p>
   <p>Sincere, devoted Catholics were convinced, as it was said, that the Catholic faith among the Poles did not in the least suffer. The organization respects morals, and specially the Roman-Catholic Church, by which a greater part of the Polish nation abides and which it recommends.</p>
   <p>And so about my ideals!</p>
   <p>I am and shall remain the way I am. The people who find in me their own and good ideals can be assured that I shall not change. On the other hand, those "humans" who condemn me can be assured of this fact: that in their minds I shall never "improve." My ideals are rooted deeply in me, and I cannot change for anyone.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0531.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>So then now judge me! Every member shall state his opinion of me, the conference will try me. I am in fear of only one judge: my conscience.</p>
   <p>At present I seem to be successful in this matter. I have nothing to repent.</p>
   <p>And so I have related and illustrated my ideals to you, dear brothers of the organization, before I lay down my office and cross my hands in the coming conference.</p>
   <p>Remain healthy,</p>
   <p>Love and wishes,</p>
   <p>Francis Hier. Jablonski</p>
   <p>Editor of Zgoda.</p>
