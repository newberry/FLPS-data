   <p>The Polish Druggists' Association, organized in March 1904, has elected new officer for 1905. Those elected are: Stanley Kuflewski, president; Stephen Sass, vice-president; Victor Bardonski, cashier, and Stan. Kossowski, secretary.</p>
   <p>There were discussions as to the ways and methods to change the habits of our countrymen, Poles and Lithuanians, and to prevail upon them to have more faith in Polish doctors and druggists. It was resolved to determine how much better are the preparations of their own manufacture in Polish and Lithuanian drug stores, and how harmful are the patent medicine preparations purchased in department stores at cut-rate prices.</p>
   <p>It was resolved to write up the formulas for different preparations such as salves, drops, powders, etc., so that from these formulas everyone of the Polish and Lithuanian druggists would benefit by the same method and that each and every one of them should prepare them uniformly.</p>
   <p>It was also decided upon that with mutual understanding between the Polish <pb facs="5423968_6_0288.jpg" n="2"/>Doctors Association to give a ball for the benefit of charity and in this way give proof that the druggists are in no way less liberal than any other citizens in contributing to the welfare of charitable institutions but even more so and they feel it their duty as citizens to support national public philanthropies as much as is possible.</p>
