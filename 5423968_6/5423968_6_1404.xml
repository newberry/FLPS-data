   <p>The ball sponsored by the Polish Policemen's Club [elsewhere called the Kosciuszko Monument Club] for the benefit of the Kosciuszko Memorial Fund was successful beyond all expectations. Several thousand tickets were sold and the hall and galleries were filled to capacity. Every-where there were familiar faces; everywhere movement, hubbub, and revelry reigned supreme. It seemed as if all the Poles had hurried to Schoenhofen's Hall to contribute their but to the fund for the monument to our great hero Kosciuszko. The proceeds that will accrue to the fund are considerable, since it is estimated that the gross receipts amounted to more than a thousand dollars--probably fifteen hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>The ball commenced at six o'clock in the evening with a speech by Mr. E. Z. Brodowski, president of the Kosciuszko Memorial Association. The speech was followed by a polonaise, in which the first couple were <pb facs="5423968_6_1405.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Brodowski and Mme. Walczynski, the second Mr. John F. Smulski and Mme. Polczynski, and the third Dr. Charles Midowicz and Mme. Kowalski. Other dances followed the polonaise--and the revelry began. The ball was conducted in a most orderly manner. The president of the Policemen's Club, Mr. Polczynski, vice-president Frank Aranowski, secretaries Muchowski and Tamillo, treasurer Kroll, and the directors Frank Kubicki, Kallas Piniewski, and Rozanski kept watch to make sure that order would be preserved.</p>
   <p>A beautiful souvenir pamphlet, with a picture of Kosciuszko on its cover, with the order of dances ingeniously arranged, contributed to the general merriment. In a word, the ball was successful. For this noble idea and its competent execution, our Polish policemen of Chicago deserve acknowledgment.</p>
