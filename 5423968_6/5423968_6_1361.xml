<title level="a">REGARDING BUILDING A MONUMENT TO THADDEUS KOSCIUSKO</title><title level="a" type="sub">An Appeal of the Committee</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>In 1892, we, the undersigned, formed an association to build a monument in honor of Thaddeus Kosciusko, our beloved peasant leader who fought for freedom on two continents. We have endeavored, at all times, to devote all of our efforts to the building of a foundation for this enterprise that is so important to our people.</p>
   <p>Our people were immediately interested in this patriotic undertaking, and our efforts were rewarded to the extent that in the first two years of our existence, we were able to collect about $6,000 for this monument. Later on, when the depression came and other important projects were undertaken, our project was more or less overlooked.</p>
   <p>During this period, the Polish Day and the Kosciusko Celebrations, the Lwow Exposition, etc., were the most important projects undertaken. We did not <pb facs="5423968_6_1362.jpg" n="2"/>insist too much upon contributions for our project because the above-named enterprises were also important.</p>
   <p>Now, however, that the other projects have been disposed of, and in view of the approaching 150th anniversary of the birth of Thaddeus Kosciusko the Polish people have again become enthusiastic over the arrangement of celebrations in honor of our immortal leader. We feel,therefore,impelled to appeal once more to our Polish brethren for additional help in this great task which has been undertaken for the greater glory of our nation, and in honor of one of its greatest sons.</p>
   <p>Let every patriot lend his support to this inspiring enterprise. Let everyone at the Kosciusko Celebrations contribute his share for this monument, and we will gather the sum necessary to begin work. We cannot begin to build with the money we have at present. We need at least $5,000 more because if we wish to honor Kosciusko properly, we ought to erect a monument that will pay adequate tribute to his great accomplishments--a grand and imposing monument.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1363.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Then we will not have to be ashamed before our own people, or before others.</p>
   <p>The committee is fully aware of the situation. We have often reminded the Poles that they should contribute to this cause. Unfortunately, our latest appeals haven't brought any results. When the contributions ceased almost entirely, the committee tried another way to increase this fund.</p>
   <p>It loaned $5,000, the repayment of which was guaranteed. A note was signed by fourteen influential Poles,whose assets amounted to more than $250,000. All fear of any loss, as far as this loan is concerned, is eliminated, and the full sum can be withdrawn on a thirty-day notice. The interest earned by this loan amounts to nearly $500, and Mr. P. O. Stensland, the treasurer of the committee has already deposited the sum of $250.</p>
   <p>The committee is also working in another direction. Besides the models already sent to us, with which the Poles are somewhat familiar, we will soon be able to <pb facs="5423968_6_1364.jpg" n="4"/>display new sketches, which were promised to us by certain American artists free of charge.</p>
   <p>We can assure our Polish brethren that we are very economical with the money entrusted to us. Not only have the members of the committee been the first to contribute large amounts, but in addition, for their personal expenses, notably those connected with the shipment of models to us, they have not demanded a penny in return. We believe, therefore, that any criticism of the committee is--to put it mildly--entirely out of place.</p>
   <p>Those who criticize only hurt our cause because they are creating a feeling of distrust of the committee. In the name of our cause, we, therefore, appeal to these gentlemen, who, without justification, accuse the members of the committee of incompetence,of squandering money and of loaning it without adequate security, to refrain from such thoughtless accusations, either private or public. If we have not begun to build the monument yet, it is only because we haven't the money.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1365.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>We are giving the above explanation to the public with a renewed appeal that everybody support this committee in its work, and with God's help, we will soon be able to get started on this masterpiece, which will bring glory not only to ourselves, but also to our brethren across the seas. We specifically appeal to our Polish people in Chicago. They, especially, should feel duty bound to give generously for this cause. It is true that some of our patriotic societies have contributed large sums of money, but a much larger percentage of them have not yet contributed anything.</p>
   <p>We also appeal to individuals. All of us claim that we respect [the memory of] Kosciusko. Let us prove it by contributing even a small amount and a fund will be created that will be large enough to build a monument worthy of our great hero.</p>
   <p>With deepest respect,</p>
   <p>The committee.</p>
