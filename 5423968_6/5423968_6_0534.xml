   <p>A live ghost visited our editorial offices yesterday.</p>
   <p>It was Mr. Victor Karlowski, the former editor of Gazeta Polska, published by Mr. W. Dyniewicz, about whose disappearance on April 3 of this year we had informed our readers--and who was thought for some time to have been killed in a railroad accident.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karlowski informs us that he left Chicago on Good Friday, for personal reasons.</p>
   <p>He went to Danville, Pennsylvania, where he was sick for two weeks. He then went to Cincinnati, Ohio, and Evansville, Indiana. Later he worked for a while on a farm in Portsmouth, Ohio, and finally went to live with some relatives in Berea, Ohio. During all this time he did not read any of the Polish-American papers--and never knew that he was considered dead.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0535.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A week ago he heard of this and at once wrote to his daughter, Mrs. Dobrzynska, at 634 Dickson Street.</p>
   <p>He arrived in Chicago last Monday and visited his daughter where, strange to say he became a grandfather that same evening, when his daughter gave birth to a baby girl.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karlowski looks well. He claims to have traveled over 1,100 miles on foot since leaving Chicago. He promises to remain in Chicago permanently. He lives with his wife at 44 Fleetwood Street.</p>
