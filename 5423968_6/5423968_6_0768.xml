<title level="a">CONVENTION OF POLISH JOURNALISTS</title><title level="a" type="sub">(A reprint from Kurjer Polski)</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Polish journalists held a convention in Detroit, Michigan, last week, about which Kurjer Polski writes as follows:</p>
   <p>"Whether the convention of Polish journalists was a success is hard to say. It was not a success in this respect: respectable journals of religious and conservative tendencies were not adequately represented, and colleagues who know how to create discord and obstruct the work were also absent.</p>
   <p>"It is true that the participants in the Convention of Polish Journalists consisted of the members of the Polish National Alliance, who had credentials as delegates to the Convention or were hunting for the editorship of Zgoda [Polish Weekly], the organ of the Polish National Alliance, but it is also true that at the sessions of the Convention they lost the character of partiality, became interested in [the] Polish press, and considered the welfare of others.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0769.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Besides, we are anxious to know whether it would be possible to hold any-where another convention, with greater representation, which would humble the one which was held in Detroit, Michigan. Up to now all attempts in this direction were not very successful, and the condition in which our [Polish] journalism finds itself at present indicates very clearly that it would be unfair to demand more than what has been accomplished. Even the three sessions held on Tuesday, Friday night, and Saturday were more hasty than regular. However, a mutual understanding was reached and a new Polish organization, named "Stowarzyszenie Prasy Polsko Amerykanskiej" (Polish-American Press Association), was organized.</p>
   <p>"The new association will be represented by a temporary committee consisting of five members. The following members compose the committee: Reverend Barabasz, editor of Niedziela (Sunday); Casimir Neuman, editor of Kurjer Polski (Polish Courier); J. M. Sadowski, associate editor of Echo; Zbikniew Brodowski, a newspaper correspondent. These four members will ask Mr. W. <pb facs="5423968_6_0770.jpg" n="3"/>Dyniewicz the editor of Gazeta Polska, or Mr. Smulski, the editor of Gazeta Katolicka (Catholic Gazette), to be the fifth member. They will also choose from their midst a chairman, a cashier, a secretary, so that the committee may begin to function.</p>
   <p>"The[task]of the temporary committee will be[as follows]:</p>
   <p>"To ask publishers, editors, and associate editors of all Polish newspapers to join the Polish-American Press Association.</p>
   <p>"To form a constitution according to the suggestions made at the convention by the new members.</p>
   <p>"To form a court of ethics which would guard journalistic decency.</p>
   <p>"To help the editors of Polish newspapers by sending complaints to the Post Office against carelessness of the letter carriers and obtaining names of dishonest debtors.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0771.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"To defend[the]Polish name by exposing deliberate libels spread by unfriendly papers published in this country.</p>
   <p>"To care for the purity of the language by discouraging the use of colloquialisms which are not understood in[the]fatherland.</p>
   <p>"To arrange in a short time for another convention made up of actual members of the Association for the purpose of electing a regular management, approving the suggested constitution and passing other resolutions.</p>
   <p>"At the first convention, the members of the Polish-American Press Association were guaranteed freedom of speech in religious matters, social questions, and in respect to Polish organizations--however it was suggested to treat these matters objectively, without attacking personalities in controversies.</p>
   <p>"The result of the Detroit Convention is considered as a small seed but a healthy one. The fruit of this seed may be either valuable or worthless; <pb facs="5423968_6_0772.jpg" n="5"/>it will depend on the soil which we prepare for it.</p>
   <p>"We have fulfilled our duty as citizens, without any other object but one--to improve the condition of[the]Polish-American Press.</p>
   <p>"Non-members not satisfied with the temporary resolutions passed in Detroit, Michigan, may send one dollar to I. M. Sadowski, the secretary, Buffalo, New York, and express their wishes. They will be considered if they agree with the thought of the resolutions of the first convention."</p>
