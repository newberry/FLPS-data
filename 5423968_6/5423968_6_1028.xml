<title level="a">THRONGS HEAR MRS. TURCZYNOWICZ IN TOWN OF LAKE</title></bibl>

   <p>A mass meeting was held last evening at the large Slowacki Hall, 48th and Paulina Streets, in Town of Lake. Lecturer and guest of honor was the organizer and honorary president of the Polish Reconstruction Committee [Literally: Committee for Economic Aid to Poland], Mrs. Laura Turczynowicz.</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Henry Lokanski, president of the Polish Reconstruction Committee, who explained, in a few words, the purpose of the meeting and introduced the speaker of the evening, Mrs. Turczynowicz. The hall was filled to capacity with a public that had come to hear a detailed account of the Prussian invasion of Poland, to hear what an eyewitness had to say of Prussian government in Polish territory [Translator's note: Reference is made to German invasion of Russian partition of Poland], and of the misery and starvation in our homeland.</p>
   <p>After the singing of "Z Dymem Pozarow" [With the Smoke of the Conflagration], <pb facs="5423968_6_1029.jpg" n="2"/>Mrs. Turczynowicz delivered her lecture. She told of her experiences, describing scenes she had witnessed; she spoke of how the Prussians mistreated Polish girls, and of how they are plundering Poland and carrying away to Prussia everything of any value. Tears shone in many eyes while she spoke, and many a whispered vow was made "to kill the Prussians," while strong determination filled the hearts of Poles who have already been called or are soon to be called into the American army to fight on the battlefields of Europe.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the lecture by Mrs. Turczynowicz, Casimir Zychlinski, president of the Polish National Alliance, spoke. He described the activities of Mrs. Turczynowicz, her self-sacrifice for the Polish cause, and the difficulties she has encountered in order to bring aid to exhausted and suffering Poland. He urged, at the same time, that contributions be made for the reconstruction of Poland when the war is ended--reconstruction from its very foundation; he called upon the gathering for unity, harmony, and co-operation with Mrs. Turczynowicz in her noble work. Zychlinski's address was rewarded with a storm of applause.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1030.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The next speaker was Judge E.K. Jarecki, treasurer of the Polish Reconstruction Committee. He spoke of the task and aims of the committee, its field of action, and the necessity of such a committee, which will prepare a tomorrow for our homeland, although ruin and desolation mark Poland today. He described the field of activity Mrs. Turczynowicz has already opened, the committees she has organized, her activities in California from whench she has but recently returned, and so on. He placed emphasis upon the fact that, today more than ever, we need to act as a unit if our work is to bear fruit, if we are to give Poland the necessary aid.</p>
   <p>Committee For Town of Lake</p>
   <p>Finally, Lokanski rose again to speak, calling the community of Town of Lake to action. He told the gathering that the central administration of the Polish Reconstruction Committee has divided the City of Chicago into twenty-four circuits which will work together, and that Town of Lake comprises one of these circuits. He then called for a nomination of members to the local committee for Town of Lake.</p>

   <p>While the people present at the meeting consulted among themselves, a collection was taken, which netted $60.01. When the meeting came to order again, Lokanski called upon Mrs. M. West, representative of the Chicago Journal, to address the gathering in English. Mrs. West's address was short and to the point. She spoke of the task of the American press in respect to the Polish cause, declaring that the Chicago Journal is ready to give all possible assistance to the Poles and their cause, for it fully understands the significance of that cause. She added that, if she were a man, she would not hesitate to take up arms and fight until the Germans are destroyed. "Every bullet means a German less," she said, amidst tremendous applause, "and we should see to it that there are as many bullets as possible."</p>
   <p>The meeting was concluded with the election of a local committee which consists of W. Wrzesinski, president; Stanislaus Kleehammer and Mrs. Joanna Andrzejewski, vice-presidents; Felix Wisniewski, secretary; and Stanislaus Szymanski, treasurer. Other members of the committee are: Mrs. Theodosia Perlowski, Adam Majer, Mrs. Pearl Stranc, Stanislaus Deplewski, and Sigmund Kleczynski.</p>

   <p>At about 10:30, after the singing of "Boze cos Polske" [God Save Poland], and after Lokanski had thanked the public for so large an attendance, the meeting was closed.</p>
