   <p>A few months ago we entered a project of establishing a daily newspaper, the Dziennik Narodowy (National Daily). The conditions of this project were approved and understood by every member of the Z.N.P. The matter in question is if it should be a "compulsory" newspaper - that is whether every member should be compelled to subscribe for it or not.</p>
   <p>This newspaper cannot be governed with compulsion. Everybody, however, must admit that a daily paper is a necessity for us - that the benefits derived from it, for our cause, will be priceless. How will we make this project a reality at this convention?</p>
   <p>It is our contention that in view of the fact that a compulsory publication has been abolished, we should create a corporation under the control of the P.N.A., so that every member of the alliance can give his efforts towards creating a sorely needed newspaper.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0537.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We propose to sell shares at $1.00 each. The P. N. A., therefore, in order to control such a daily paper must buy shares amounting to at least $2,000.</p>
   <p>By this method we will collect in due time the necessary amount and Dziennik Narodwy will have a great prosperity; every stockholder will in time cash his shares because there is no doubt that the alliance will later take over the daily as its own property, as they did with Zgoda, which formerly was also the property of stockholders.</p>
   <p>This, in our opinion, is the only practical method of settling the question of Dziennik Narodowy.</p>
   <p>Brothers of the Alliance, at this particular time when the clergy, which has always attacked us and whose opposition we have resisted, is being torn asunder and is trembling, there is needed a national daily; it will be a screen, which in the name of the Polish cause and in the name of faith - and for faith only, not for profit - can and will group together the masses <pb facs="5423968_6_0538.jpg" n="3"/>of Polish immigrants from coast to coast.</p>
   <p>Such a Dziennik Narodowy (National Daily) conducted in an experienced way, with proven ideas and stability, will draw many thousands to our standard. We have already given thousands of dollars for education - can there exist a better means of spreading education than a daily newspaper?</p>
   <p>And so, dear brothers of the Alliance, consider wisely the above words; think over the great mission of our institution and about our obligations toward our fatherland, which needs whole columns of faithful soldiers.</p>
   <p>You will all agree that after the convention we should begin the publication of the Polish National Daily.</p>
