   <p>(We have received the following correspondence from South Chicago with a request that it be published in the Dziennik Chicagoski.)</p>
   <p>The societies of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish of South Chicago, encouraged by the success of the Kosciusko Library, decided, at a meeting held yesterday, to establish their own parish library.</p>
   <p>The pastor, Reverend Frank Wojtalewicz, donated $300 for this purpose and Dr. Borucki gave twenty-five dollars. When all the societies in this parish contribute their share, we will have a fund with which to establish a really fine and well-stocked library.</p>
   <p>The Kosciusko Library supplies books for both parishes at present. The Poles in South Chicago are avid readers, as can be seen from the librarian's report. No less than 700 books were read in January!</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0172.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If this keeps up, it will be difficult for the Kosciusko Society to satisfy all demands; the newly organized library in the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish will be of considerable help. No wonder the Kosciusko Society is happy; it can be justly proud that its initiative is producing such wonderful results.</p>
