   <p>The evening school at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, Noble and Bradley Streets, has been opened recently. There are several divisions of classes.</p>
   <p>There are preparatory classes for boys who are to receive their first Holy Communion. Besides getting religious training, the boys may also join the Polish language and arithmetic classes.</p>
   <p>Classes in the English language are given separately. Children and adults are eligible for these classes. The beginners are instructed by a Polish teacher, in order that persons who speak only Polish may grasp the subject better. The advanced course in English is given by an English instructor.</p>
   <p>The German language is taught by a Polish teacher who has had years of training in this field with the German government, where he had to conduct all affairs in the German tongue.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1017.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>An effort has always been made to get the best qualified instructors; in this way the students get better training.</p>
   <p>Enrollment for high school classes will begin this evening. All those qualified to enter are urged to take advantage of these evening classes. Classes in Polish literature and history are one of the many features. English subjects will also be given. In these classes the Polish youth may get training in public speaking, dramatics, literature, etc.</p>
   <p>Further information may be obtained by calling in person at the offices of the school between 7 and 8 P. M.</p>
