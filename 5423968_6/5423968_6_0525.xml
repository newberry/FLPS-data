   <p>Dear Fellow Men:</p>
   <p>For nearly two years we have been talking of the need of establishing and possessing a daily newspaper that would go hand in hand with our organization, spread ideas of sound patriotism and proper progress, one that could enlighten us in everything that is good, wonderful and noble. Everyone, in general, admits this fact now, this need. The conviction that really did assure us of this need were the hundreds of votes of our various groups in which a united request was expressed for a national daily. The convention did not undertake the question of a national daily, which was just. A question of this kind should have been given to the City of Chicago, in which city such a paper should emerge.</p>
   <p>Today we are very happy to inform the general members of our organization <pb facs="5423968_6_0526.jpg" n="2"/>that Chicago understood its work and has taken its first step toward this goal. Last week there was an enthusiastic gathering in Chicago. At this gathering there were many sincere members of different organizations who in a few minutes declared that the sum in their possession for establishing such a publishing company was over $2,500 cash.</p>
   <p>At this meeting a temporary committee was elected, consisting of nine members, all of whom are prominent persons and people of ambition.</p>
   <p>The committee is prudently aware that to have wide circulation such a paper must possess the moral support of the Polish National Alliance.</p>
   <p>Our organization cannot aid financially this project of a national daily. The task of establishing this publishing company is not a local matter, but rather a task for all Polish organizations in the country.</p>
   <p>That is why every member, regardless of where he resides should favor whole-heartedly this affair of the national daily and support it as sincerely as it is in his power to do so.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_0527.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Shares will be sold for $2 each, mostly among members. The majority of you, brothers, should at least try to purchase one of these shares. We shall thus create a capital, create a mighty press whose great duty will be unfolding and displaying our characteristics and weakening those that hinder us and keep us out of the limelight.</p>
   <p>To work, then, brothers! Today or never! If we don't possess such a daily now, it will then be a long time before we can undertake another dare of this sort.</p>
  </body>
