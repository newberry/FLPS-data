   <p>To our article of Saturday entitled "In Defense of the Parochial Schools" the Kuryer Polski (Polish Courier, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin), the organ of Mr. Michael Kruszka, replies, as usual, in a senatorial manner.</p>
   <p>Instead of answering the arguments quoted in the article specifically, it attacks persons who have no connection whatever with the case discussed and attacks them for private reasons. We will not comment on the absurdity of the attacks. But we wish to explain to this senatorial Kuryer once and for all that when a person points out the good or bad of any public action and consequently is forced either to praise or to condemn certain persons connected with it, in that case it is not permissible (of course, if the paper wishes to be considered respectable) to answer with personal insulting accusations. A respectable paper is not permitted, when something is proved in a quiet <pb facs="5423968_6_0566.jpg" n="2"/>and decisive fashion, that black is black, and white is white, to answer thus:</p>
   <p>"But the aunt of the editor of your paper had a wart on her nose!" or, "Why did the editor of your paper eat perch last Friday instead of pickerel?"</p>
   <p>Whoever answers in this fashion is a newspaper trickster and nothing more. And that is exactly the sense and the meaning of the answer given by the Kuryer, which unfortunatley keeps approaching closer to the gangster type of newspaper.</p>
