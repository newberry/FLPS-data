   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>One of the liveliest meetings of the main committee in charge of arranging the Kosciusko Festival was held last night.</p>
   <p>At this meeting, the Saint Stephen Martyr Society expressed its desire to participate in the festival. The Thaddeus Kosciusko Fraternal Benefit Society of South Chicago sent a letter to the committee stating that it would not take part in the festival because it had already arranged a picnic of its own, but that the profit of this picnic would be turned over to the Kosciusko movement fund.</p>
   <p>To deliver the speeches for the opening of the festival the following speakers were chosen: Mr. Hesing, postmaster general of Chicago; Judge J. LaBuy, and Mr. [F. H.] Jablonski, editor of Zgoda.</p>
   <p>A committee was appointed to make arrangements with the streetcar company for <pb facs="5423968_6_1316.jpg" n="2"/>a sufficient number of streetcars.</p>
   <p>The committee to purchase the cigars reported they had been ordered from different Polish cigar-makers. Wines and whiskies were ordered from Paul Giersz, Polish wholesale liquor dealer.</p>
   <p>The soda water will be supplied by Lomax at a discount of ten dollars for each one hundred cases.</p>
   <p>The restaurant concessions have been leased to Mr. Olszewski and Mr. Czochanski.</p>
   <p>The program committee then submitted the following plan of march:</p>
   <p>1. Police.</p>
   <p>2. Chief marshall, Mr. Peter Kiolbassa and his lieutenants--A. Lisztewnik and S. Schultz.</p>
   <p>3. Music.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1317.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>4. Directors of the Monument Fund, officers of the Polish Roman Catholic Union and the Polish National Alliance, with banners bearing a picture of Kosciusko.</p>
   <p>5. Cavalry.</p>
   <p>6. Military societies.</p>
   <p>7. Turners.</p>
   <p>8. Cyclists. (They promised to have Uncle Sam along with them).</p>
   <p>9. Kosciusko Society.</p>
   <p>10. Societies from Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish.</p>
   <p>11. Societies from the South Side and other parts of Chicago.</p>

   <p>13. Societies from Saint John Cantius Parish.</p>
   <p>14. Societies from Saint Hedwig Parish.</p>
   <p>15. Carriages.</p>
   <p>All societies taking part in the parade are requested to assemble in a body, on July 4th, at 8:30 A.M., at the following places:</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_6_1318.jpg" n="4"/>

   <p>6) The Polish Cyclist Club is to assemble on Blackhawk Street, between Noble Street and the tracks.</p>

   <p>All the marshals will receive badges for their members at their places of assembly a half hour before the start of the parade.</p>
   <p>The program in the park will be very interesting, including speeches, singing by choirs, military drills, fireworks, live tableau, etc.</p>
   <p>A detailed description of the numbers on the program will be published later.</p>
   <p>The treasurer's office will be open after the societies enter the park.</p>
