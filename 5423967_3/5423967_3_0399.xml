   <p>Mr. A. Zmagar, teacher of the South Side School, communicates to us what follows:</p>
   <p>"In this new school year the South Side School has already 84 pupils. This number will increase during the next few weeks. There was an apprehension that, owing to the fact that many Russians had migrated from the South Side to other localities, the number of pupils would decrease in this year. But this apprehension was unfounded.</p>
   <p>At the present time there are three teachers in the school, and a fourth teacher will be invited. At the last meeting of the School Society it was also resolved to invite a teacher who could train the chorus; a special committee was elected for this purpose. The South Side School intends also to resume the lessons of dancing. The registering of pupils of all the four forms is still going on."</p>
