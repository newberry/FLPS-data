   <p>Information has come to us that new elections have taken place in the Union of Russian Intellectuals and that a new committee has been elected.</p>
   <p>It is to be desired that the new committee of the union would not repeat the mistakes made by the old one.</p>
   <p>The new committee should remember that the Union of Intelletuals will develop and flourish if its activities will be in line with the needs and demands of the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>In order that this would be so, it is necessary to attract into the union all the best intellectual forces of the Russian colony. It is necessary that all the most active intellectuals of the colony would join the union - such men as know the needs of the colony, are willing to serve it and are trustworthy.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0927.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The colony needs intellectual workers; a great need is felt in lecturers, teachers, artists, public men.</p>
   <p>Having blended its activities with the life of the colony, the union would soon feel the blessing of such fusion. It would not be a lifeless group, segregated from the colony, having no vital connection with it, such as it has been heretofore.</p>
