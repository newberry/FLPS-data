   <p>On Sunday, August 27, there was organized in Cicero Illinois, the twenty-first branch of the R. I. M. A. S. (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society). The branch was organized by eleven members, who elected a temporary committee of three members; Mr. Alexander Dobrohotoff was chosen as chairman, Mr. A. Kireuko as treasurer, and Mr. A. Mazur as secretary.</p>
   <p>The branch will be known as the St. Peter and Paul Fraternity.</p>
   <p>According to the organizers of the branch, in Cicero there are many Russians who are not organized. The new branch will offer an opportunity for all Russians in Cicero and vicinity to participate in our social activities and thus increase the ranks of our Independent Society.</p>
   <p>The branch also intends to start educational and cultural activity among its <pb facs="5423967_3_1467.jpg" n="2"/>members, to organize Russian schools for children, to undertake from time to time various social enterprises, etc.</p>
   <p>We greet the Independent pioneers of the town of Cicero, and wish them success in their work for the welfare of our Russian colony and our Society--work which will aid our fellow men.</p>
   <p>Russian people living in other cities--Kenosha, Racine, Milwaukee, Maywood, Melrose Park, Joliet, Peoria, South Bend, Mishawaka--should follow the example of our Cicero pioneers. They should consider the value of combining all Russians into one family, and should organize the branches of the R. I. M. A. S. (the only Russian national organization in the Middle West which guards the interests of the working people).</p>
   <p>The time has already come! The Russian people should awaken from their long hibernation. We should no longer live by the ukase of rogues and adventurers....Recent events in the Pittsburgh Russian National Mutual Aid Society, which existed and conducted its affairs not by its own mind and its own will, should <pb facs="5423967_3_1468.jpg" n="3"/>serve as a good lesson to all Russians; they should point the right way of action, and should at long last make us understand that the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society is the real guardian of all Russian people. Like a good, careful mother, who looks after her children, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society looks after the welfare of all members of the Russian colony. Naturally, the colony responds to our call.</p>
   <p>Brothers, go to work, start organizing branches of the R. I. M. A. S. wherever there are Russians. Anyone who will organize a branch of the R. I. M. A. S. where he lives, will earn the gratitude, not only of the directors of the R.I. M. A. S., but also of future members of the Society, and of the entire Russian colony in America. This is because sooner or later, after the present bitter experiences of our colony--after the humiliation it has received for the last twenty years at the hands of non-Russian politicians--the colony will have to seek shelter from its own native organization, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
   <p>Only from this organization will you be able to obtain real spiritual rest <pb facs="5423967_3_1469.jpg" n="4"/>and satisfaction, such as you might receive from your own family. Only in the R. I. M. A. S. can a Russian be certain that his hard-earned pennies won't find their way into the pockets of sundry international orders and other "guardians" of our national welfare.</p>
   <p>Speak with your neighbors about starting a new branch of the R. I. M. A. S. in your neighborhood. Take it up with the management of the R. I. M. A. S. and they will send you immediately all necessary information, and will delegate a special assistant to help you organize your branch.</p>
   <p>Let us start now the work of swelling the ranks of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
