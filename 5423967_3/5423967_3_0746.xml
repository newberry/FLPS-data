   <p>It is rumored that members of the Russian People's Mutual Aid Society, Roov, are very doubtful of Deviatkin's ability [Translator's note: Deviatkin is the leader of the Russian communists in Chicago] to defend the communist position successfully at the debate scheduled for April 14. Members of the Branch #35 of Roov want to substitute Mr. Olgin, the editor of a Yiddish Bolshevik newspaper in New York City, in Deviatkin's place. The members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, Rnzov, reply that the substitution will have no effect upon the outcome of the debate, even if Roov puts Stalin himself in Deviatkin's place.</p>
   <p>It is said that the whole Russian colony is interested in the outcome of the verbal fight, and the attendance at the debate will be large. A renewed interest in politics has been noticed in connection with the approaching contest between the two warring factions--between those who support Bolshevism and those who oppose it. The latter faction has, of course, always been <pb facs="5423967_3_0747.jpg" n="2"/>numerically stronger than the former.</p>
   <p>The general opinion is that there will be no disorder at the debate, a circumstance which is rare when these political enemies clash in deadly physical or verbal struggle. Both sides, it is understood, have agreed to use every possible means to maintain order during the debate. This is good news for many prospective listeners because it will thus be possible to listen and appraise both sides.</p>
