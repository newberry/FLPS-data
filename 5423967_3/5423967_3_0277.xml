   <p>At all the meetings of both our large and small organizations, enthusiastic speeches are delivered on the necessity of conducting cultural and educational work, of opening public schools, even a high school, but the whole matter is still at a standstill. The most that is done is that the decision is made, properly recorded, notices to this effect are sent to the newspapers, and that is all.</p>
   <p>Why, then, aren't these splendid ambitions realized? The reason is simple enough--lack of money. In order to carry on cultural and educational work successfully, it is necessary to have money, and enough of it.Guided by this consideration, the school committee of the society Rnzov decided to try to collect a sum of money for this purpose. The committee is firmly convinced that the large Russian colony in Chicago will support this plan, and that people will be found to achieve this goal. The committee decided to open a <pb facs="5423967_3_0278.jpg" n="2"/>co-operative store, the profits from which will go toward cultural and educational work among the Russians in Chicago. We do not doubt the success of such an undertaking, because we have seen many similar enterprises. The school committee solicits the co-operation of the Russian colony in order to make possible the achievement of this goal. All those interested in this matter are requested to inquire of Mr. Bernoff, 1048 North Mozart Street.</p>
