   <p>Our first school conference was opened on August 12 in the South Side School, 1231 S. Morgan Street.</p>
   <p>In the work of this conference, which continued from the 12th up to and including the 19th of August, 1922 (two Saturdays and one Sunday), eighteen delegates from school organizations and ten teachers participated.</p>
   <p>(1) From the South Side Children's School, 1231 S. Morgan Street, the delegates were Solovey, Piven, Kutniuk, Zirbo and Semenchik, and the teachers Eberhardt, Volosiuk, Romanovich, and Sholy.</p>

   <p>(6) From the children's school of the section of the Society for Technical Aid to the Soviet Union, in Gary, the delegate Kuzko, and a female teacher, Arieva.</p>
   <p>(7) From the children's school at Rockdale, the delegate was Grechko.</p>
   <p>At the first session, under the chairmanship of Eberhardt, the following platform of the conference was accepted:</p>
   <p>"This conference, as a conference on educational questions, must be absolutely non-political; but as a conference called to improve the status of the children's workers' schools, it should direct all its activities and work out all its conditions in perfect harmony with the ideals and aspirations of the struggling working class."</p>
   <p>Later reports were heard from the floor, where the situation of each school was revealed in detail.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0239.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Together with this, it was disclosed that at the time of the conference in the above enumerated seven schools, there is an estimated number of 400 students.</p>
   <p>At the end of the session a committee was set up to work out the project of the children's schools and the recommended central organ. The committee was composed of Grishuk, Eberhardt, Piven, Vorobiev, and Karpuk.</p>
   <p>At the second session, the morning of August 13th, the chairman was J. Karpuk.</p>
   <p>Comrade Eberhardt reported to the conference a recommendation worked out by the committee the previous evening.</p>
   <p>The latter was accepted point by point and a new organization came into being: the Federation of Russian Children's Schools of the city of Chicago and suburbs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0240.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Upon beginning the consideration of the programs for the Russian children's schools, the conference selected a committee composed of Stoliar, Eberhardt, Grishuk, Zam and Karpuk.</p>
   <p>After the dinner intermission the conference accepted the program of the Russian children's schools of the city of Chicago and suburbs belonging to the school federation, which program was worked out by the committee.</p>
   <p>At the last session, at 917 N. Wood Street, under the chairmanship of M. Stoliar, the two points remaining on the order of the day were discussed: (1) the financial status of the schools, the creation of a school fund; (2) the publishing of a bulletin, etc. In conclusion a secretarial board was elected composed of Grishuk, Piven, Eberhardt, Zam and Zirbo. The secretarial board was entrusted with the carrying out of all decisions of the conference and in general with the direction <pb facs="5423967_3_0241.jpg" n="6"/>of the work of the federation previous to the election of the executive committee of the federation.</p>
   <p>At the first session of the executive committee, composed of delegates of the various school organizations and teachers, it was revealed that all present at the conference here joined the federation with the exception of one, the school of the Independent Society. Regardless of all the concessions granted them, such as teaching the Bible, their system and curriculum, it did not join the federation.</p>
   <p>At this session the following officers were elected: the president of the executive committee, the recording and financial secretaries, the superintendent of the proposed bookstore of the federation, etc.</p>
   <p>The expanded executive committee, consequently, changed its name to "School Federation Soviet." Since September, 1922, and at the present time, it has regular meetings once a month, and directs the work of the entire federation, pertaining to all periodic conferences, and <pb facs="5423967_3_0242.jpg" n="7"/>also the conventions, the last of which, the thirteenth, took place in the summer of last year (1935).</p>
