<title level="a">CONCERNING PROFESSOR D. P. BODER'S LECTURES</title>
</bibl>

  <body>
   <p>As we have already communicated, professor D. P. Boder is at present a resident of our city.</p>
   <p>For five years our countryman held the post of professor of the Mexican National University and was also superintendent of the Mexican State Psychological Laboratory.</p>
   <p>At the present time the professor is making a study of the psychological aspect of the work done by telephone operators of the Bell Telephone Company, which is very much interested in his investigations. These investigations, besides their purely scientific value, can have some influence on the practical aspect of the telephone business, namely, by diminishing the number of mistakes in connecting.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0899.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Professor Boder will give in Russian a series of very interesting lectures on problems of experimental psychology. He will also demonstrate various apparatus and appliances which are being used for the investigation of the mental faculties of man.</p>
   <p>The professor intends also to organize a series of excursions with the purpose of visiting certain industrial concerns and penitentiaries (a telephone station, a penitentiary for children, etc.)</p>
   <p>The lectures will be interesting; and a series of lectures (5) on such a subject as experimental psychology - lectures of a strictly scientific character, yet easily understandable - given by a specialist, is something new for our colony. In his lectures, the professor will pay much attention to the problem of the education of the young generation. For many of us it would be useful to attend these lectures.</p>
