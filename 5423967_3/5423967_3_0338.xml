   <p>Last week the school term was completed at the Dostoyevsky Memorial School. Altogether twenty nine pupils had to pass the examinations. The examinations were very successful. The following pupils received the highest marks: H. Goroschenia, A. Zhuk, and M. Podievich.  All these were promoted to the fifth grade. The following pupils of the lower grades recited and read excellently: A. Zakharevich, Helen Kalatsky, E. Stelebuk, E. Lopashko, and A. Yakubovich. Four pupils graduated: H. Garbooz, Olga Drebenia, V. Nierovich, and N. Romashko.</p>
   <p>The following persons were in the examining committee: Dr. L. G. Pertsov, N. A. Seoyev and A. M. Uzefovich. The school and the Federation were represented by: the teacher, Mrs. P. V. Svatikov, A. Komov and Korziin. On the occasion of the completing of the school year one has to point out such a gratifying fact in the life of the Russian colony as the existence of Russian schools for children. Despite the great financial difficulties of this year, the school functioned without interruption. It should be mentioned here that the school society of the Dostoyevsky Memorial school has done very good work. All members of this society not only paid their membership fees accurately, <pb facs="5423967_3_0339.jpg" n="2"/>but they collected some extra money among their members in order that the studies would not be interrupted before the appointed term.</p>
   <p>The society is now actively preparing for the autumn. It has already planned a whole series of profitable entertainments in order to collect money before the opening of the school in September. All these Russian people have left Russia many years ago, but the remembrance of Russia lives strongly in their hearts and probably will never die. Therefore, they cannot allow their children in America to be without any knowledge of the Russian language. They want them to be able to read and write Russian. The Russian school is a constant and most real reminder for the children of the fact that, beside America, they have another fatherland and that, if sometime they will return there, they should not feel there like strangers. Russian society must feel great sympathy toward persons and organizations doing such a great cultural work. Supporting Russians schools in America is perhaps the most important and necessary activity.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. Korzoon has been chairman of the school society of the Dostoyevsky Memorial school for many years. M. Maximenia is secretary; A. Ababurko, <pb facs="5423967_3_0340.jpg" n="3"/>financial secretary; K. Nierovich, treasurer, and M. Serghenia is member of the revising committee. All these, like many other members, work hard without any remuneration. We feel it to be our duty to point out this fact. It is also necessary to point out the almost superhuman efforts which the new teacher, Mrs. P. V. Svatikov, has made in trying to raise the school to its present high level. She is a new member of our colony; nevertheless, she has become acquainted in a short time with the Chicago Russians and is now in the vanguard of our social workers. Glory to her. We should have more such workers in our colony, who give all their leisure to the school work.</p>
