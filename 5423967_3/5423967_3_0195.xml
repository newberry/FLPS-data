   <p>Last Sunday, in Pullman, Illinois, an entertainment was given by Branch Number Twenty-Six of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society (R.I.M.A.S.) and by the Lomonosov Children's School. The evening was an unusual success. The stage play was under the direction of Mr. P. Mizevich, who greeted the guests and said a few words concerning the important role which the Russian children's schools are playing in the life of the Russian colony and the importance of R.I.M.A.S. in the life of Russians in Pullman.</p>
   <p>[Mme.] P. V. Svatikova in the name of the central administration of R.I.M.A.S. spoke on the necessity of all us Russians' uniting in a strange country. She also said a few words about Lomonosov, the Russian pioneer scientist, and his accomplishments. S. Volodkin and I. Osipik spoke on the Russian children's schools and on the peculiar psychology of the Russian colonists. They also greeted the guests in the name of Branch Number Eighteen of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society (R.I.M.A.S.).</p>

   <p>The children of the Lomonosov School performed very ably in the concert program and vivaciously recited verses from the works of Russian poets among those present one noticed many familiar faces from Chicago. Many members of the Chicago branches of R.I.M.A.S. attended, particularly members of Branch Number One and Branch Number Eighteen.</p>
   <p>A beautiful performance of a series of Russian folk dances was given by the students [of dancing] of the Krylov School. The guests were particularly pleased with the humorous recital by A. Lafarenko, whose appearance on the stage alone evoked a great deal of laughter. The buffet lunch was served with the help of the ladies who are members of the parents' school committee.</p>
