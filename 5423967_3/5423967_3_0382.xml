   <p>The school has more than ninety pupils. The funds at the disposal of the school amounted to $700. Over ten of the pupils were receiving free education. The Parents' Society and the teachers were working harmoniously since the Parents' Society had eliminated the persons who had joined it not for the purpose of furthering the cultural work of the school, but with the aim of introducing party politics.</p>
   <p>The following Russian schools that were in existence in Chicago in 1926 are mentioned: F. D. Dostoyevsky Memorial School, Fullerton Street; the Douglas Park School; the Mikhailovskaya School, on the South Side; the schools on Wood and Leavitt streets.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0383.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The school twice joined the Federation of Russian Children's Schools of the city of Chicago and twice left it. The reason was that this Federation was entirely in the hands of the Communists who wanted to use the Russian schools for political propaganda. The administration and the Parents' Society of the South Side School favored the formation of a new society unifying all the Russian schools in Chicago on non-partisan lines.</p>
