   <p>Dear brothers, I warn you to be careful and not sign any forms which will be offered to you in regard to the unification of our brotherhood, of our organization with the United Russian Orthodox Brotherhood of America located in Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>It is known that they have changed their bylaws concerning the death benefit and when the inquiry, "Why were the bylaws changed without a convention being held?" was made, they answered, "We have the authority to change the bylaws without holding a convention." In the records of our Holy Trinity Brotherhood, it is stated that we have decided not to go to Pennsylvania for any money. This resolution conforms with the records of the St. Wladimir organization.</p>
   <p>I beg every member of the Holy Trinity Brotherhood to hold to this resolution which is in their own records of the Brotherhood. In addition, at the annual meeting of the above-mentioned Brotherhood, held on January 8, it was unanimously resolved, "not one step from Chicago." Therefore, once more, I <pb facs="5423967_3_1567.jpg" n="2"/>appeal to you not to sign any forms.</p>
   <p>Member of the Holy Trinity Brotherhood.</p>
  </body>
