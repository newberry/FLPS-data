   <p>In a letter from a comrade in Flint, Michigan, addressed to the editorial office of the Roov, the question was raised as to what developments have occurred in relation to the consolidation of the Roov, Russkoe Ob'edinennoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (The Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society) with Rnzov, Russkoe Nezavisimoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society). The answer is brief: no one knows. But such an answer does not explain anything and does not satisfy anyone. And because of this, it is necessary to recall to our minds some of the facts concerning the matter and then to draw certain conclusions.</p>
   <p>The question of the merger of the said organizations into one arose after the fifth convention of the Roov. Between the fifth and sixth conventions of the Roov, there was an exchange of letters between the administrations of both organizations. The administration of the Independent Mutual Aid Society proposed certain changes in the name, structure and the central office <pb facs="5423967_3_1552.jpg" n="2"/>[of the consolidated organization]. They declared that if, after the merger, the organization should select the name of the Roov, then the main office would be transferred from New York to Chicago, but if the Roov agreed to change its name and adopt that of the Rnzov, then the headquarters would remain in New York. The Chicagoans did not reject these proposals and the sixth convention of the Roov actually accepted them. The convention of the Independent Mutual Aid Society also approved them. Both conventions in principle expressed themselves in favor of consolidation. The conventions of both organizations instructed the Central Committee to complete the merger. The conventions even outlined the following general plan: the next conventions of both organizations should be held at the same time and place; and, after ratification of the plan for consolidation, steps should be taken to elect a new executive body and to create a new Central Committee. A little later the Central Committee of the Roov submitted a draft of the proposed agreement to the Central Committee of the Rnzov for the purpose of forwarding it to the State Insurance Department of the State of Illinois for the preliminary examination. The agreement accepted by the <pb facs="5423967_3_1553.jpg" n="3"/>convention held in Philadelphia in 1926, establishing Roov, was taken as the basis for the merger.</p>
   <p>Since that time, or, in other words, since the agreement was sent to Chicago, nothing has been heard of it. The administration of the Rnzov did not trouble itself even to advise the Roov of the receipt of the document. And there the whole matter of the merger rests officially and factually.</p>
   <p>There are two types of facts: one of official character and one of unofficial character. In the case of the potential failure of the merger of the two great mutual aid organizations into an even greater and stronger one, the unofficial facts and other "rumors" are playing the roles of most importance. Of what nature are these unofficial facts and "rumors"? Of what do they consist and what is their significance?</p>
   <p>There are several such "facts". First, the general ignorance, inertness, and cultural tardiness of the Russian colonist, results of which are the <pb facs="5423967_3_1554.jpg" n="4"/>fear of any kind of innovation, and consequently of any new unity whose character and principles are hard for him to understand.</p>
   <p>Second, the position of the political and semi-political groups and parties, which are selfishly interested in breaking the colony into small pieces. Every party or semi-political group is interested in controlling the workers' organizations and societies because they will then direct their force and activity into certain channels, and will also have a source of revenue. Because it would be impossible to control nonpartisan masses if they were united into a big organization, the position and tactics of political parties and groups is to split the colony into small organizations, insignificant units.</p>
   <p>Third, the newspapers. Their existence depends upon the reader. For this reason, their desire to exist at whatever cost becomes a disorganizing influence in the colony; and their tactic of whitewashing everything in the world becomes a necessity. But, because it is impossible to do this <pb facs="5423967_3_1555.jpg" n="5"/>with impunity, controversies and quarrels among the Russian workers arise, and their purpose is attained.</p>
   <p>Fourth, the ambition of small, insignificant persons. Every organization in America, every unit, every branch of the Roov, Rnzov, and Rpov, Russkoe Pravoslavnoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (The Russian Orthodox Catholic Mutual Aid Society) possesses its own small generals. Their knowledge, their mental faculties, their experience in cultural work are very small. But their ambitions are large. They want to be generals. And they know that they can be generals only in the small organizations. They need small armies. In an organization of ninety or one hundred members, they may be presidents, secretaries, members of committees, etc., but in an organization of five or seven hundred, or one thousand people, they are insignificant. To save their own posts as "generals", "managers", or "leaders" they will sacrifice any good cause, any unification of the working groups within the colony. They will never say a word to you about such sacrifices. They will offer you explanations of various types, they will discuss scientific things, but <pb facs="5423967_3_1556.jpg" n="6"/>behind their words is masked the fact that they want to be generals.</p>
   <p>These four facts appear to be the causes of the failure in the consolidation of Rnzov and Roov.</p>
