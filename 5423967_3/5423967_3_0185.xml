   <p>There are eight Russian schools in Chicago besides those that are conducted by the Russian churches. The Russian schools not connected with the churches are located in various Chicago districts. All schools, excluding church schools, are under the jurisdiction of the Federation of Russian Children's Schools. The federation is composed of parents and members of various schools. It has a yearly conference in which the election of officers takes place. All officers are elected for a term of one year. The Russian Federation of Children's Schools meets the first Sunday of each month to transact the business of the schools. The federation hires the teachers, who are paid by the schools.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0186.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Teachers must be natives of Russia and have a good Russian education. The president and secretary of the Federation of Russian Children's School are Mr. Myron Miklov and Mr. Klimkov, respectively.</p>
   <p>The Federation of Russian Children's Schools constantly adds new branches to the present number. Its purpose is to educate children of Russian parentage (also those of other nationalities) in the Russian language. The fees the children are required to pay depend largely upon their ability to pay. In cases where children are totally unable to pay they are not deprived of the opportunity of a Russian education. The non-paying pupils are on the same level as those who pay tuition. Some parents whose financial status improves repay their debt to the school gladly; some are never able to do so.</p>
   <p>Children who graduate from elementary schools have an opportunity of continuing their Russian education in a higher school. In this school <pb facs="5423967_3_0187.jpg" n="3"/>adults are also taught. The adult students are of various nationalities, all who are interested to learn the Russian language. The educational, cultural and social value of the Russian schools to the communities is notable. Through these schools the Russian children are able to master a foreign language and learn the history of the Russian people. During the school year the schools sponsor various social affairs.</p>
