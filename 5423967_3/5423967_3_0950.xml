   <p>The Society "Enlightenment," (Prosvyeshcheniye), arranges in this season the first bi-weekly excursion to one of the largest astronomical observatories of the world.</p>
   <p>The group of excursionists who have already expressed the desire to go to the Yerkes Observatory must meet on July 12, not later than 3:30 P. M., at the House of Enlightenment, 1080 W. 14th Street. And these who want to join this group must give notice about this beforehand to Mr. S. Prokopov, at the House of Enlightenment, in order that he should know for how many persons he must provide quarters for the night.</p>
   <p>The Observatory has made special arrangements so that the excursionists will have access to the newest achievements of astronomical technique and can inspect the newest apparatus used for the observation of the celestial bodies (the planets, the stars). The well known Russian astronomer, Dr. O. Struve, will put his knowledge at the disposal of the excursionists.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0951.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He who has had the pleasure of having listened to the lecture given by Dr. Struve at the House of Enlightenment must not miss this opportunity of seeing all that has been so beautifully described in this lecture.</p>
   <p>The journey to the Observatory (at Williams Bay) and back, if a whole group undertakes it, will cost only about $3.30 per person; but for a single person it would cost $3 only to get there.</p>
   <p>Art. Veselovsky.</p>
