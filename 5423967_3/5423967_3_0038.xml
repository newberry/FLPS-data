   <p>Six years ago a group of Russian workers and peasants undertook the publishing of the paper Svobodnaya Rossiya. This event was important for the Russian colony of Chicago and other cities. Before that time unsuccessful attempts were made to publish a weekly paper, but as for the publishing of a daily paper this was the first time in the history of the Russian colony that it was started by the above mentioned group. The necessity of a daily paper was enormous. Chicago alone has more than 25,000 Russians, many more thousands of them are living in the suburbs of Chicago and in the nearby towns. There was an urgent need of a newspaper which would throw light on the needs and life of these people, but there was no such paper in Chicago. And one had to read the Russian newspapers from New York. In consequence of this the publishing of the paper Svobodnaya Rossiya was a great event for the Russian colony. A lot of work and money was <pb facs="5423967_3_0039.jpg" n="2"/>spent by the workers and publishers for the soundness, strengthening, distribution and the obtaining of all that is necessary for the effective publishing of the paper. A lot of work and care was expended by some of the collaborators of the paper and by the workers who are true to this idea. The publishers of the paper sometimes through ignorance made mistakes by inviting collaborators who were not competent in throwing light on the needs, interests, life and morals of the colony. But these mistakes were corrected and the paper has found more experienced collaborators. Looking over the six-year existence of the paper, it is necessary to say that in general it was striving hard to protect the interests of the Russian colony and the working people in particular. Commercially the paper was set up very poorly. And on account of that the paper could not afford to employ the necessary number of collaborators, and the only thing for which it could be blamed was that the contents of the paper were often poor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0040.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At the present time some mistakes of the past have been corrected. The administrative and editorial offices have been given new powers and the paper will be able to become richer, more varied and lively in content. Support your only Chicago daily paper Russkii Viestnik (sic). Take all measures to help its distribution, strengthening and success. The Russian colony of Chicago, its suburbs, and other towns are in need of a daily newspaper, which serves their interests. We firmly believe that by united cooperation in the Russian colony we shall be able to create an organ of the press deserving of the Russian colony.</p>
