  <body>
   <p>Last Sunday a lecture was given by Mme. I. N. Khrabrov. The lecture was illustrated by numerous slides. Despite the cold weather the lecture attracted a good many people. Both the speaker and the audience were somewhat different from our usual gatherings of this sort. The lecture, or rather the report, was simply a gathering of Russian people to share the impressions of one who had just returned from a visit to Russia.</p>
   <p>The lecturer spoke simply and intimately in beautiful Russian. Every word that she uttered reflected a deep love for Russia and unshakeable faith in its future. The concentrated attention paid to every word that was spoken by the lecturer was also an evidence of the deep concern felt by every one present for the future of Russia. And this love for the motherland and this deep faith in the future greatness of Russia invisibly united in one <pb facs="5423967_3_0717.jpg" n="2"/>family the lecturer and the audience.</p>
   <p>It remains for us only to desire that in the future, just as in the past, the Russian-American Civic League shall freely accord the use of its premises for lectures organized without any motives of personal gain or selfish ends and in the spirit of tolerance for free thought and expression.</p>
   <p>As always in every cultural undertaking, Mr. I. F. Erin was the initiator, and he made all the necessary arrangements for the success of the lecture.</p>
