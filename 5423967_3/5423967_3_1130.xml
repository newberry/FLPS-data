   <p>For several weeks an advertisement has appeared on our page inviting Russian house owners who are in need of ready cash to come and borrow money. The call is issued by N. Kozak, general secretary of R.I.M.A.S. We deeply sympathize with Mr. Kozak in his worries in connection with the need of investing the accumulated idle capital of R.I.M.A.S. We are glad that the Society has plenty of cash to spare and to distribute among Russian house owners. We are also glad that this announcement belies all the Bolshevik propaganda and falsehoods spread among our credulous people in Chicago to the effect that R.I.M.A.S. is on the verge of bankruptcy and is about ready to close its doors.</p>
   <p>For years Stalin's agents have been feeding our colony with all kinds of fairy tales about our organization and its imminent collapse, and yet all of a sudden it is revealed to everybody that R.I.M.A.S. has on hand thousands of dollars which it wants to lend to anybody who has residential property. Such a shock to Mr. Deviatkin [Translator's note: Mr. Deviatkin is a leader of the Bolshevik <pb facs="5423967_3_1131.jpg" n="2"/>element in Chicago] and his crowd! However, we are not sorry that Mr. Deviatkin was caught lying. We are only sorry for those of our compatriots who through ignorance and backwardness were caught by Deviatkin in his net and blindly follow this enemy of all Russian people. We should like to see such people get rid of the Bolshevik virus that ruins them both physically and mentally and leaves them helpless creatures.</p>
   <p>United around R.I.M.A.S. and in common, friendly effort with others, such people would grow strong and independent of Bolshevik snares and would become Russians again not only in name but also in fact.</p>
