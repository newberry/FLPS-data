   <p>Dr. R. Krasnow is a pioneer in popularization of medical science among the members of the Russian colony in America.</p>
   <p>(1) He was first to give popular lectures to the Russian organization;</p>
   <p>(2) first to write articles on popular medicine for the Russian press, and, finally, (3) he is the initiator of the magazine Domashni Vrach, the anniversary number of which was just published. The first anniversary! A year of publishing! In order to judge the work which has to be done at the beginning of the publishing of a Russian magazine in America, one must at least have tried to do it himself. We know the hard labor of the initiator of the magazine and we greet the successful results of his work. We congratulate him on the anniversary of the founding of the magazine; we give our Russian thanks to the editors of the Domashni Vrach, and <pb facs="5423967_3_0131.jpg" n="2"/>especially to Dr. Krasnow, for the irreproachable work done by this lone medical light which serves the Russian colony in America. It is our special pleasure to note in our paper the merits of Dr. Krasnow for the benefit of the Russian colony, because he has been so kind as to become our collaborator, beginning with the next number of our paper. From the next number on, in the pages of the paper Russkaya Pochta will be printed a medical section under the guidance of our honorable Dr. A. Krasnow.</p>
