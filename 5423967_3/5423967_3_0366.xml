   <p>On Saturday, June 30, 1928, examinations were held at the A. S. Pushkin Memorial School at Kensington. The examiners were General A. M. Yuzefovich, Mr. J. J. Voronko and the chairman of the Parents' Committee, Mr. Yakubenya. Out of eight pupils of the fourth grade five (three of them were girls) passed to the fifth grade; one was passed conditionally, having been given some work to be done during vacation, and two postponed the examinations till the autumn. There were three examinations: in the Russian language (both oral and in writing), on Russian history, and on Russian geography. Three members of the school committee were present at this examination.</p>
