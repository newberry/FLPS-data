The main office of the society is at 917 N. Wood St., Chicago, Ill. The society was founded in 1912, the first president was Mikhail Pasuk, the secretary, Semion Fedorovsky. The president at the present time is George Wallace, the secretary, Nicholas Kozak. The society has about 2,095 members. The capital of the society is about $125,000. Since the organization of the society, $370,000 has been paid out for death and sick benefits. The Chicago branches of the RIMAS arrange every year eight picnics and several dances and plays.

   <p>The RIMAS founded the Russian daily newspaper in Chicago, Svobodnaya Rossiya (Free Russia), which was published for eight years. The society is a non-partisan and non-political organization and adverse to the ideas of the Bolsheviks and to all political organizations, which are trying to foist their ideas on the society.</p>
   <p>The society is especially opposed to the local Bolsheviks because they have been trying continually to disorganize the society. The society periodically issues jubilee almanacs and papers. The society RIMAS will celebrate its 25th anniversary during the autumn of 1937. The RIMAS has three clubs for young people, which specialize in various American sports. The youth is interested in the cultural work of their parents, which is going on among the Russian organizations.</p>
