   <p>Almost in every district where many Russians are residing there are being opened so-called "courses for women" - in other words, Russian evening schools for women.</p>
   <p>In this respect there is at present an enviable competition going on between the various districts. As soon as a school of this type has been organized in some district, another similar school is started in some other district.</p>
   <p>The utmost poverty reigns in these schools; there is a lack of everything: there are few students, and teachers are also very scarce; the schools are very poorly supplied with text books, maps, etc.</p>
   <p>Still such schools are being organized. And, what is most important, <pb facs="5423967_3_0393.jpg" n="2"/>the women of our colony are eager to attend the classes. They desert the kitchen, they renounce the comfortable rest which they could enjoy in the evening at home, and sometimes they desert their children. And they go to these schools to learn grammar or arithmetic.</p>
   <p>Some of these women students show signs of advancing age.</p>
   <p>It has to be acknowledged that in our colony there can be observed a real enthusiasm for acquiring school education.</p>
