   <p>On Saturday, February 2, there was a great celebration, arranged by the Independents [Translator's note: members of the Independent Mutual Aid Society] on Wood Street. So many people came to celebrate the event that the new auditorium could not accommodate all of them.</p>
   <p>Usually only the Easter service attracts so many people. But on February 2, the Russians came to find out whether the Independents had really built their new auditorium. Even though the building was not yet finished, one could still find shelter from cold or rain. Every person in the audience was smiling. They looked at the ceiling, at the walls, and at the floor. One heard only pleasant comments. They saw that what the Independents had talked so much about, was true. One more blow was dealt by RNzOV (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society) to those enemies of the Russian colony who spread rumors about RNzOV harboring White Guard elements who seek to destroy the Society. Our <pb facs="5423967_3_1396.jpg" n="2"/>enemies have thrown a great deal of dirt at us. All their efforts and all their lies, however, have been of no avail.</p>
   <p>In spite of the distressing conditions prevailing among the Russians in Chicago, despite the depression and the unemployment, the building of the new auditorium did not stop even for a day, and this was because the members were solidly united in their purpose. Let the success of this project serve as a [clarion] call for those who still hesitate to join our well-organized ranks. Let everyone join us without hesitation, let everyone become a true son of the Russian people and a friend of Russian culture. Let every Russian pride himself on being called an "Independent." You may not cross yourselves, you may not pray, you may not go to church, but you can still join our Society. We do not reject any one. Our purpose is mutual aid. We do not recognize "shock workers". With us everybody is equal. Everyone enjoys the same rights. The Society calls upon all of you to join its ranks, to work, to create, for your personal good and for the good of your family.</p>
   <p>Do not be ashamed of the fact that once you were a Bolshevik, or that that name was tagged on you, Become Independents, who have their own center, a <pb facs="5423967_3_1397.jpg" n="3"/>beautiful hall, a school, a very large auditorium for their needs, and a church for believers. Although the building has not yet been completed, on the inside and outside, it is to be hoped that the building committee will carry through the minor details since it successfully finished the major part of the construction.</p>
   <p>I would recommend to the committee, provided it is not against the law, that the priest be authorized to go out to solicit donations not among the poor families, but among the rich companies and merchants. As far as we are concerned, we have always helped and we will continue to help with our pennies.</p>
