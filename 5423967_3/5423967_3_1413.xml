   <p>Peace has never reigned in the Women's Progressive Society, and it does not exist now. The latest squabble was started by the woman communist, Cziibulia, who, for several years, has performed the duties of the financial secretary of this organization. Mrs. Klimkova had been elected to serve for the duration of the semi-annual period, which has just closed. However, in spite of the fact that Klimkova was elected by a majority of the votes cast, Mrs. Cziibulia considered herself the legal secretary and refused to surrender the financial records to Klimkova. After six months of squabbling, Mrs. Cziibulia agreed to surrender the books to the committee. When the ledger was opened,everybody was amazed and dumbfounded. The pages of the book were so soiled and spotted with ink that they looked as if fifty chickens with very dirty feet had tracked over them.</p>
   <p>When the auditing committee asked Cziibulia to help audit the book, she <pb facs="5423967_3_1414.jpg" n="2"/>replied: "I am an illiterate woman. I myself do not know anything about what is written in the book."</p>
   <p>This statement astonished every one, and evoked a storm at the last meeting of the organization, which was attended by Mr. Trushinsky and by the "state's attorney" himself, Mr. Deviatkin [Translator's note: Both men are communist leaders]. When Deviatkin attenpted to take the floor, the women cried, indignantly, "Get out of here. We do not need lawyers here. We were cheated enough during the election." During the election for the position of financial secretary, Klimkova and Trushinskaya were nominated. Klimkova was elected by a majority of the votes.</p>
   <p>Deviatkin was obviously dissatisfied with the results, and pressing a pencil against his nose, indicated to the chairman, Mrs. Cziibulia, his desire that a second vote be taken. Results of the second ballot again showed that Trushinskaya was defeated, and Klimkova, for the second time, received a <pb facs="5423967_3_1415.jpg" n="3"/>majority. Again Deviatkin pressed his pencil against his nose, and again the same woman received a majority. At last Mr. Trushinsky jumped to his feet and asked that he be given the opportunity to count the ballots. Klimkova protested, claiming that a husband could not be impartial to his wife.</p>
   <p>Trushinsky conceded the point. Six ballots were taken, and still Klimkova remained the victor. This is the kind of justice which prevails in the Women's Progressive Society where Mr. Deviatkin holds sway.</p>
