   <p>Before the Russian revolution there were no Russian schools for children in Chicago. The Russian revolution gave an impulse to the foundation of such schools and aroused in the Russian colony in America a widespread interest for educational work among the masses. In 1918 appeared the first Russian school for children in the district of 14th and Halsted Streets. At that time there were more than two hundred pupils in that school. Later there was started another school at 917 N. Wood Street, and still later a third in the district of Douglas Park. All these schools were founded by the Russian Orthodox Independent Parish which is located at present at 917 N. Wood Street. Over three hundred children were being taught in these three schools. Conditions were favorable for the development of Russian schools for children, <pb facs="5423967_3_0180.jpg" n="2"/>and they grew and flourished. The Russian language, Russian geography, Russian history, etc., were taught in these schools.</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviki, seeing how well these Russian schools for children were progressing, began to join the school committees. This was done both by parents of children and by single persons with the aim of gaining control of the schools. The result was that the Russian schools were ultimately split up into two types: independent schools and Bolshevist schools.</p>
   <p>The Bolsheviki desired and continually insisted that the children should be taught bolshevist politics in the schools. Whereas the other party, among the parents, consisting of persons with independent convictions, opposed these demands of the Bolsheviki. This led to a split between the Bolsheviki and those who were opposed to their ideas; and this <pb facs="5423967_3_0181.jpg" n="3"/>antagonism still exists in the schools at the present time (1937). In 1933, when Mr. Anton Bernov became a member of the school council as a representative of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, there were in existence six schools: (1) at 917 N. Wood Street; (2) in Argo, Ill.; (3) in Hanson Park; (4) in Pullman, Ill.; (5) in Cicero, Ill., and (6) in the district of Humboldt Park, with a total number of 150 pupils.</p>
   <p>In 1936-1937 we find only three schools of non-Bolshevist character with sixty-five pupils.</p>
   <p>Note: This information about Russian schools was given to me by Mr. Anton Bernov, who for a number of years has been chairman of the school council of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, and who is therefore very well informed about everything concerning the <pb facs="5423967_3_0182.jpg" n="4"/>Russian schools in Chicago. Besides, Mr. A. Bernov is an old resident of Chicago and knows perfectly well all that pertains to the public life and work of the Russian colony of Chicago. N. K.</p>
