   <p>Those who live in Chicago and follow the actions of the pseudo-Communists undoubtedly see that they prepare the ground for the robbery of the Russian colony and the realization of their aims. Having achieved their purpose concerning the Russian evening schools for adults, they now concentrate all their fighting powers on the children's schools. As it is known, their tactics are as follows: in order to secure success in their undertakings they crowd the schools with their adherents, and that is why so many principals of the schools are Communists. Their intentions are not to help the success of the schools, but (in some cases) to live on the expenses of the schools and (in other cases) to destroy everything which is useful to the colony. Their pretense is to unify all the schools in school societies. What is meant is to unify not for the improvement of the schools, but for a more profitable <pb facs="5423967_3_0457.jpg" n="2"/>reason: they know that with the aid of all the schools it would be easier for them to draw the necessary sum of money from the colony for their aims. They do not try to create a federation of the schools, but a society, the aim of which would be to support materially those who hold certain views. At the head of the Communist vanguard is Mr. Eberhardt, the same Eberhardt who yesterday said that he would not work together with the Communists, and who, having lost the good income which he received from the Russian colony, became a Communist and correspondent of the Communist paper. If the parents of the pupils and the conscious members of the colony will not arise to protect the children's schools, they will be destroyed by the Communists, in the same manner as they destroyed the schools for adults. The unification of the schools is necessary and should take place. You, yourselves, should gather and consider what is useful and what is harmful for your children; you should not let some sharper decide the fate of your children by trying to suggest to them that they should ignore their parents.</p>
