   <p>Ardent discussions among Chicago Russian immigrants regarding unification of Russian groups, finally have led to favourable results. On Wednesday, Apr. 15, 1931, in the office of A. J. Pickiel, a Russian lawyer, an agreement was reached between two large Russian organizations: The Russian Independent Society, and the Znanie Society. Thereafter, these two organizations will act together as one in the work of mutual aid, and in cultural-educational fields. Following this, on Friday, April 17, 1931, in the Russian-American Club Hall, an official agreement was reached by representatives of two large cultural-educational organizations, to merge The Russian-American Club and the Russian-American Citizens' Society into one organization. Moreover all four above mentioned organizations will staunchly cooperate in public work. Thus at the present time they constitute a powerful organization, and in establishing solidarity among the majority of active Russian immigrants, it will further the development of economical and cultural-educational activities in our colony.</p>

   <p>The unification of kindred organizations is becoming a fact, and the trend towards such amalgamation can be observed also in other Russian Societies.</p>
