   <p>Members of Russian organizations often speak of the magnificence and beauty of Russian culture and art. However, they do very little to glorify this art and to reveal its greatness and beauty to those Russians who do not understand it. Quite frequently the leaders of Russian organizations point out that the best representatives of Russian art do not mingle with the Russian colony, and appear only before Americans and in places where the uneducated members of the Russian colony are afraid to enter.</p>
   <p>But I do not think that all the representatives of Russian art are such people. I think that many of them would appear before the Russian colony, but the trouble is that they are not invited by the Russian organizations.</p>
   <p>For example, at the present time, the Russian singer, Maria Kurenko, is living in America. She is well known in all the Countries of Europe as well as in the United States and South American countries. However, she is better known among <pb facs="5423967_3_1360.jpg" n="2"/>Americans and people of other nationalities than among Russians. Most of the Russians in Chicago and other large cities know of her successful appearances only from the newspaper accounts. Rassviet has printed several articles about her, and only recently the newspaper printed her picture with a few lines of poetry written by the talented singer herself.</p>
   <p>I am certain that if Madame Kurenko is willing to sing for the people of other nationalities, she will sing with the greatest of pleasure, for the Russian people, but the trouble is that other nationalities invite her and we do not. Consequently, it would be a very good thing if the Russian organizations in Chicago and Detroit arranged a few concerts for this Russian singer. Then in deeds, instead of words, they would show their appreciation of the great Russian art and of those who can best express it.</p>
   <p>One single organization cannot, of itself, undertake such a task. It is necessary that all the Russian organizations in each city should unite their efforts for this purpose. It would not be at all difficult to arrange the <pb facs="5423967_3_1361.jpg" n="3"/>concerts and to assure them of a brilliant success. They would represent triumphant exhibitions of genuine Russian art and would be participated in by all the Russians for a modest admission price.</p>
   <p>It would be very desirable if the leaders of the Russian organizations in Chicago and Detroit would consider this suggestion before Madame Kurenko leaves for Europe. If the organizations do not do so, we shall have to agree with one of the readers of this newspaper who once said that we ourselves are to blame for our backwardness, and no one else.</p>
