</bibl>

   <p>We have been told that a few days ago several American pedagogues, headed by Mr. Thompson, a well-known worker in the field of pedagogics, have visited the South Side School.</p>
   <p>The Americans had become interested in this modest Russian school and asked many questions about its program and the methods of teaching used in it.</p>
   <p>They were very interested in the fact that Russian history and the geography of Russia are being taught in this school.</p>
   <p>Evidently, the Russian schools begin to arouse some interest among the Americans.</p>
   <p>Probably this small cultured nook of the Russian colony has made a <pb facs="5423967_3_0391.jpg" n="2"/>favorable impression on the visitors: it is agreeable to see that in very modest surroundings children are assiduously studying the language of their fathers' native country and are learning all about that country.</p>
