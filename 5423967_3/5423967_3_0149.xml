   <p>Our beginning, the publishing of the first Chicago Russian National Almanac, has not been welcomed by that caliber of people who could have taken an active participation in the compilation of our almanac.</p>
   <p>The published editions of the various types always belong to a group, to a collective of specialists in the various fields of knowledge.</p>
   <p>In the forming of our almanac this type of collective has not been found.</p>
   <p>Our colony in Chicago differs so greatly in its convictions - especially that part of it which has been called national conscience - the intellectuals, from whom we hoped to derive water of life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0150.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The national conscience for various reasons has not come to the rescue of the national deed: the living and working among us people of education and promoters of culture, with very few exceptions (of which we shall speak below), have turned away from this noble obligation to serve the humbler brother.</p>
   <p>In such circumstances the work of composing the Russian National Almanac has been far from pleasant.</p>
   <p>To establish normal connections with the immigrant circles in Europe there was no time; the editorial board, after familiarizing itself with the character of work awaiting them, has decreased from seven people, elected by the 17th Convention of the Russian National Orthodox Society, to four.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0151.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But.... the Russian National Almanac has seen the light of day. In your hands, reader, is the fruit of strenuous labor. It is difficult for us to judge how successful this edition is. It is therefore desirable that the reader, upon careful inspection of this book, note all the shortcomings of this almanac and inform us about it. For the publishers of the Russian National Almanac such information would be of great benefit. Through them (those making suggestions. Project editor), it would be possible to judge the demands of the reading masses of our colony. Previous to the voicing of opinion of our readers, we deem it necessary to remark that we visualized our edition as a type of encyclopedia for self-education. Our endeavor to bring this plan into reality has been a partial success.</p>
   <p>At the same time, having in mind that among our readers there will be people with greater requirements, we have not failed to answer their questions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0152.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We have mentioned above that people of culture in our colony have reacted very indifferently toward our publication.</p>
   <p>We consider it our duty to record that comparatively new members of our colony, such as the poetess T. E. Ostroumova, Dr. A. E. Nedzielnitzky, A. M. Usefowich, artist Gregory Orlov, have cheerfully offered their names to the national publication.</p>
   <p>Many thanks to our co-workers and all who assisted in the birth of our publication.</p>
   <p>The Publishers.</p>
