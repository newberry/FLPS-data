   <p>Moskva</p>
   <p>appearing in Chicago in the beginning of every month.</p>
   <p>The magazine Moskva is entirely non-political, and in an equally kindly and impartial way opens its pages to everything that is truly artistic and enlightening whether it happens to arise in Russia or beyond its boundaries. Special attention will be paid to throwing light on the life of Russians in America.</p>
   <p>The magazine Moskva is the only monthly magazine being published in the United States and in Canada in the Russian language.</p>
   <p>The readers of Moskva will find on its pages stories, novelettes, poetry and articles from the pens of the best and most eminent writers among the Russian- <pb facs="5423967_3_0113.jpg" n="2"/>Americans, and also interesting material concerning problems of history, science, technical subjects, etc. The magazine Moskva has already contacted the greatest Russian centres, not only abroad but also in the U.S.S.R., from which it will very soon begin to receive material which will appear in its pages in due time. The magazine Moskva is not a private publication and is not the publication of any narrowly partisan group.</p>
   <p>The magazine Moskva will appear on all stands and in all magazine stores at the first of each month. Its format will be 32 to 48 pages.</p>
   <p>Subscription: one year $1.75; half year, $1.00.</p>
   <p>Price per copy, 15 cents.</p>
   <p>Address all correspondence and subscriptions to</p>
   <p>Moscow, Russian Magazine.</p>
   <p>2001 West Division St., Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>Editor L.G. Pertsov (ed. note: or Perry)</p>
   <p>Published by "Russian Centre of Chicago".</p>
