   <p>In all organizations it is customary to mark the anniversaries of their existence by arranging public entertainments. With this in view Branch Number Eighteen is arranging for an entertainment at Old Points Hall, 5105 Grand Avenue, on February 23.</p>
   <p>Time slips by very rapidly. It seems as if only three months, not three years, had passed since four active members of R.I.M.A.S. came to pay a visit to the author of these lines and sign him up in the Branch which was about to be organized.</p>
   <p>"We have already signed up five members, "they told me. "We need two more in order to qualify your Branch for a charter.</p>
   <p>This happened three years ago at the height of the depression. It was not an easy matter to find new members in hard times when many people were out of work, <pb facs="5423967_3_1154.jpg" n="2"/>and there was much misery among the working people.</p>
   <p>However, the need of forming a branch in the northwest part of the city was more than obvious, and the initiators, overcoming all obstacles in their way, continued to work as one man and finally succeeded in organizing a new Branch of R.I.M.A.S., Number Eighteen in the series. Since the organizers of this Branch were also the active members of the Krylov Russian children's school, the new Branch received the same name and was called the Krylov Society of R.I.M.A.S., Branch Number Eighteen.</p>
   <p>In these three years the society has grown considerably, and instead of the original five members we now have more than fifty. The Branch throughout this time has been in close and friendly relations with the school. In difficult periods the Branch helps it both morally and financially. In co-operation with the school the Branch quite frequently gives entertainments, the proceeds of which are used for the benefit of the school.</p>
