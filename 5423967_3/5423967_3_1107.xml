   <p>The concert and ball given by St. George's Brotherhood (Branch Number One of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society) last Sunday was a satisfactory affair. There were many more people at the entertainment than at the Pushkin literary evening but not so many as might have been expected, for the Brotherhood is the largest single Russian organization in Chicago in point of members. Perhaps the frequency of the entertainments staged by Russian organizations or lack of interest in the concert program previously presented by the Brotherhood explains the failure of many members and of the outside public to attend the latest entertainment in large numbers. Our people apparently are beginning to prefer to stay at home or to go to other places rather than to attend their own organizations' affairs.</p>
   <p>Those who arrange entertainments in the future should pay more attention to this particular circumstance and concentrate all their efforts on making the <pb facs="5423967_3_1108.jpg" n="2"/>concert programs more attractive. Sale of tickets in advance, the participation of well-known artists in the musical programs and in the plays, and more generous advertising of the affairs undoubtedly will bring the public and will help to make every entertainment an outstanding success from the financial point of view.</p>
   <p>Now, a few words about the program itself. The play "Father Is Resting," is a very humorous Ukrainian comedy and was well performed by G. Volos, S. Bakalets, and E. White. S. Bakalets recited very well in Ukrainian, but his interpretation of "Sakkiya Muni" by Merezhkovsky in Russian was not very successful. Good singing was provided by Miss Katsello, the young daughter of one of the members of R.I.M.A.S. Trepak, the Russian popular dance, was brilliantly done by young Miss Grinchuk.</p>
   <p>Words of greeting were spoken by the Reverend P. Nirvana and by G. Pasiuk, chairman of the board of directors of R.I.M.A.S. Mr. P. Ushko, secretary of the Brotherhood, acted as master of ceremonies.</p>
