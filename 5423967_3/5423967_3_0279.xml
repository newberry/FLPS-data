   <p>The Krylov Russian School for children will have its own youth club for boys and girls attending the school. Members of the Krylov Society, which is a branch of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, decided at their meeting of November 30 to establish a youth club and to enlarge the curriculum of the Krylov School by adding classes in music, singing, and dancing. The Krylov School Youth Club will have its own chorus, its own string orchestra, and its own dramatic circle. Hitherto, the Krylov school children have taken music and dancing lessons from private teachers; now they will receive this instruction in their Russian school. The school is located in its new and larger quarters, and is well prepared to serve as a center of attraction for all Russian children from the Hanson Park district. Mr. V. V. Shumkov, an instructor in the Krylov School, will be the singing instructor, and will have charge of the choir which will be organized. Music <pb facs="5423967_3_0280.jpg" n="2"/>and dancing will be taught by special instructors. Classes will be open as soon as a well-qualified person is found to take charge of this department.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that the Krylov School Youth Club has been established primarily to perform a real and useful service to the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, and not to suit the personal convenience of the members of the school committee and of the Krylov Society, the fees charged for the instruction will be exceedingly small. This will be possible because the school committee intends to find additional sources of income to keep the finances of the Society in good shape.</p>
   <p>This approach to the solution of the problem of our youth will no doubt prove to be feasible and practical. It is true that this activity cannot be regarded as a substitute for a Russian high school, which is so necessary for our racial and national survival in America, but it may be looked upon as preparatory <pb facs="5423967_3_0281.jpg" n="3"/>work for broader action in the future. In our opinion we of the older generation should select that avenue of approach and that course of action which can best be understood and which will be willingly followed by our sons and daughters. Young people like to sing and dance. By learning to sing Russian songs, they will learn the Russian language, and by dancing Russian dances they will become acquainted with Russian culture and customs. Slowly,and by degrees, the Russian-American youth will begin to like the organizations of their fathers; they will become accustomed to them, and, later, will gladly lend a hand in developing their fathers organizations and in leading them to a better and more secure future.</p>
   <p>The Krylov School and the Krylov Society undertake this important work in order to strengthen and fortify the Russian cause in America and to add more glory to the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. For this reason, the Krylov Society hopes that all members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society <pb facs="5423967_3_0282.jpg" n="4"/>and all members of the Russian colony in Chicago will give their full support to this undertaking. Those Russians who have older children may send them to the Krylov School, where they may join the orchestra or the dramatic circle.</p>
   <p>All further news regarding the activities of the Russian Youth Club and the Krylov School will be reported promptly in the Russian Independent Mutual Society's page in Rassviet.</p>
   <p>Further information on the requirements demanded of candidates for instructorships, instructors' salaries, etc. will be published in future issues of Rassviet.</p>
