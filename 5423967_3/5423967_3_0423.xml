   <p>The members of the committee visited the schools belonging to the Federation, chiefly in order to see what kind of teaching the pupils of these schools were getting. Briefly, the results of the investigations made by the committee were as follows:</p>
   <p>The South Side School:</p>
   <p>This is the only school having different teachers for every form. It would seem that the teaching in this school should be better than that given in the other schools, but in reality this did not prove to be so. True, the committee visited the school at a the which was not especially favorable - two or three weeks after new teachers had been substituted for those who had been teaching before in the second and third forms.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0424.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This would partly account for the fact that discipline was comparatively poor. The knowledge acquired by the pupils of all forms was found to be satisfactory, and in the third form the pupils demonstrated a good knowledge of Russian grammar. Reading and pronunciation were not as good in the South Side School as they were in other schools. In everyone of the three forms, the members of the committee noticed the presence of a pretty long ruler. A great defect in this school is that the two first groups are studying at the same time in the same room. For some reason the teachers did not work out any satisfactory schedule of lessons, so that reading, for instance, is being taught simultaneously to pupils of two forms, which makes teaching and studying very uncomfortable to everybody, and renders the work of the teachers unproductive.</p>
   <p>The Douglas Park School:</p>
   <p>At the present time the school is functioning in two shifts, 11/2 hours for each. In the first shift there are two groups, in the second, three. In this year five pupils will graduate.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0425.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The knowledge of the subjects taught is good in all forms. The discipline is quite satisfactory.</p>
   <p>The North Side School:</p>
   <p>The teaching is done in two shifts, of 1 1/2 hours each. There will be no graduation this year, the school is still too young. The knowledge acquired by the pupils and the discipline are very good, and it must be pointed out that the friendly relations between the teacher and the children prove that there is no necessity of using the ruler under the pretext that the children must be "subdued."</p>
   <p>The Brighton Park School:</p>
   <p>This last remark applies also to the Brighton Park School, where the <pb facs="5423967_3_0426.jpg" n="4"/>teaching is exemplary. It is done in two shifts. The pupils who are going to graduate be (there are nine of them) help the teacher to give instruction to the pupils of the junior group. No disorder was noticed anywhere. The children are 1 arming not under the threat of punishment, but willingly, with interest.</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
