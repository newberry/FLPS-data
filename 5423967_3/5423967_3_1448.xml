   <p>Members of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society in Chicago and vicinity should not forget the fears and concerns about our future as expressed by the leaders of our organization during the 23rd convention.</p>
   <p>We should not be afraid of the truth. And the truth is contained in the following statement: "If we fail to bring young people into our organization, then, sooner or later, our organization will lose its independence and will be forced to join some large American fraternal organization." And then the Russian organization will no longer be Russian, and the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society will be no more.</p>
   <p>We do not have to look far for examples. We know that last year the St. Vladimir Society ceased to exist. We know that the Russian National Mutual Aid Society was absorbed by some international order. Now there are only two well-entrenched, responsible Russian independent fraternal <pb facs="5423967_3_1449.jpg" n="2"/>organizations, the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society in Chicago and the Russian United Mutual Aid Society in New York. These two societies some day will merge into one, and perhaps the merger will take place soon, although it has many enemies. There are some who oppose the union out of stupidity, others because it conflicts with their own personal interests. But these handicaps will be removed, and the union will be accomplished, as it is absolutely necessary for the welfare of both organizations.</p>
   <p>However, this will be only the first step toward stability and a brighter future for both societies. The second step, the organizing of our youth, will be much more difficult, and will require more time for its successful realization. Without full participation of our younger generation in our work no Russian organization can survive; this conclusion was unanimously arrived at during the last convention.</p>
   <p>There is only one way in which we can interest our youth in our activities, and that is through awakening their national consciousness. Our young men <pb facs="5423967_3_1450.jpg" n="3"/>and young women should have a knowledge of Russia; they should like the Russian people, their culture and their customs. They should be well acquainted with the works of our great men. They should be inspired to think and dream of Russia.</p>
   <p>Not long ago one noted American said: "I should be happy to belong to the nation which gave to the world such men as Tolstoy and Dostoyeosky." When the Russian-American youth is inspired with similar feelings, it will fill up, by its own will, all Russian schools, and also the ranks of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. Our young people will bring with them a new life and new faith into the ranks of our organization, to supplement their fathers' faith and energy, which are much depleted by their daily struggles for existence.</p>
   <p>It is not remarkable that during the convention the expressions of cheer and hope for the future came from our young people? "We, young members of the Independent Society, look into the future without fear or doubt, and we are strongly convinced that our organization will soon enter upon the <pb facs="5423967_3_1451.jpg" n="4"/>road to great success." So spoke one of the young women of the organization. Another member, a young man, added: "We promise to continue your noble work, so that the Russian name may stand on high in America, and so that we may be proud of our Russian ancestry."</p>
   <p>Let such words of our older children fall as seeds into the hearts of our younger children, and they will become golden seeds, which will bring plentiful harvests in due time. Then remember to sow the seeds of Russian consciousness.</p>
   <p>In this way, when the time comes, you will depart for another world with a clear conscience of a well-paid debt to posterity. And young, strong hands, the hands of your children, will grasp the work where you left off, and will carry on, holding high the banner of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society.</p>
