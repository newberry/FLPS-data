   <p>In the beginning of 1916, in a small town Argo, Illinois, Branch No. 5 of R.I.M.A.S. [Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society], was organized. Thus, in January of this year, twenty years will have passed since Branch No. 5 came into existence. Our brothers in Argo are making arrangements to celebrate their twentieth anniversary on January 19.</p>
   <p>For an organization with as firm a foundation as that of R.I.M.A.S., twenty years of existence is not a long period, it would seem; but for our brothers in Argo these twenty years have a great significance. Branch No. 5 of R.I.M.A.S. was born at the time of the great human tragedy, at the time when the entire world was enveloped in war, when human blood was flowing in streams on our native soil, all over Western Europe, and in Asia.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_1177.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>At that time a great majority of the Russian people were fired with patriotism, held firmly in the grasp of war hysteria and not by humanitarian ideals and brotherly love. The word "independent," from the point of view of bellicose patriots, was regarded as something implying rebellion, but our friends in Argo were not afraid of such sentiments and carried on the preachings of brotherly love and mutual aid.</p>
   <p>Great changes have occurred in the Russian colony during the past twenty years. Those who had called our brothers in Argo, the pioneers of our organization in that little town, rebels and dissenters, after a time donned the cloak of revolutionaries and began to call our active men counterrevolutionaries, but our brothers in Argo did not pay attention to the people temporarily in disguise, but continued to carry on their work along the path chosen by them in 1916.</p>
   <p>"The slower you ride the farther you go," says an old Russian proverb, and our brothers from Argo firmly held to this precept. Their social work among Russians in Argo they carried on in a peaceful way, avoiding falsehood, pretense, <pb facs="5423967_3_1178.jpg" n="3"/>and destructive action. Not for a moment would they surrender their position to liars and impostors.</p>
   <p>One should definitely state that Branch No. 5 of R.I.M.A.S., from the very first day of its existence, barred the way to those who would destroy our society of mutual aid. None of our branches was ever subjected to such furious attacks from our enemies as our Branch No. 5 in Argo. For Chicago branches, Branch No. 5 played the role of outlying defenses, protecting all other branches. The fall of this fortress would act unfavorably on all other branches and retard their development. There were moments when our brothers in Argo, in their struggle against disrupters of our organization, suffered heavy losses, had many casualties in killed, wounded, and unaccounted for. Those whom our members in Argo regard as killed are the ones who, due to their nearsightedness or cowardice, deserted us and went to the enemies' camp in order to fight against their former brothers and comrades. The wounded ones are those who, after listening to gossip and falsehood, began to doubt the financial stability of the Society and the righteousness of the course it had been pursuing. The unaccounted for are <pb facs="5423967_3_1179.jpg" n="4"/>the ones who, in time of attacks on our organization, became confused, went astray, and ceased to work in the Russian organizations entirely. However, our branch in Argo succeeded in holding its position, and now, on January 19, it is arranging a festival, the largest one in its history--the twentieth anniversary of its existence.</p>
   <p>This solemn jubilee of Branch No. 5 is dear to the hearts not only of our brothers in Argo for our members in Chicago also take a lively interest in the occasion. The General Executive Board of R.I.M.A.S. has taken notice of it and at its last meeting decided to take an active part in the jubilee celebration. However, this is not sufficient. It is necessary that all Chicago branches of R.I.M.A.S. follow the example of their Executive Board and organize proper representation at the festivities. It is particularly important that branches Nos. 1, 3, 18, and 2, take active part in the jubilee.</p>
   <p>Mass attendance by Chicago members of R.I.M.A.S. will undoubtedly raise the spirits of our brothers in Argo, and, perhaps, will cure those Russians who <pb facs="5423967_3_1180.jpg" n="5"/>received injuries in the fight against the people inimical to our glorious society. This mass participation will put on the right track those of our compatriots who had lost their way and have deserted social effort in [our] common cause.</p>
