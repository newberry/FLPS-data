<title level="a">[NEW AUDITORIUM AT] 1917 WOOD STREET</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last Saturday, a new public auditorium was opened on Wood Street, the building of which required a great deal of money and effort. The dance hall, contrary to my expectations, is very airy and is well ventilated; it is able to accommodate several hundred persons. When the hall is completely finished, it will be a beautiful place for entertainments of every type, and, particularly, for lectures, scientific debates, and classes.</p>
   <p>For the elaborate entertainments of RNzOV, this hall is not sufficiently large. It proved to be too small last Saturday, when the housewarming took place. The dance hall was jammed with people. The old basement, which is connected to the new hall by an underground passage, was also crowded. All the old members of the Society--the founders--came to enjoy the new beautiful premises adjoining the old nest which they had built with much effort and worry, thirty years ago. For some reason or other, members of the Society from the outlying branches in Argo, Pullman, and other towns did not attend the ceremony. The reason probably was that they were told too late of the impending event.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_1408.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There was a gala spirit present during the evening of entertainment. Many speeches were delivered in which joy and anxiety were commingled; the speakers were worried as to whether or not the Society would be able to finish the building as planned, to decorate the bare walls, etc. Nearly all the speakers emphasized the meritorious services of Mr. Vasiliev, the building contractor, who has done a great deal for the Society. When Mr. Vasiliev appeared on the stage, he was greeted with thunderous applause.</p>
   <p>The erection of its own building is an important event in the life of an organization and it is even more important for the Russian colony. But this is not all. The erection of the building is only the beginning, only half of the work.</p>
   <p>The main task is to make out of the place a center, where the whole Russian colony can gather; we must make 1917 Wood Street into a home of Russian culture--into a hall where the resonant Russian language, singing, and laughter will constantly be heard. For this purpose the Society should keep its doors wide open to every cultural enterprise of the Russian colony: lectures, literary <pb facs="5423967_3_1409.jpg" n="3"/>evenings, dramatic clubs, youth meetings, rehearsals, etc. From now on, all such events should take place in this hall and its address should be remembered by all.</p>
   <p>First of all, we should open the school which was closed when the building was being reconstructed; secondly, we should organize a high school for the young people whose parents belong to the Society. Many of them even now take an active part in the affairs of the Society. We also must have in view the growing generation which is reaching the age when it will be a great help in continuing the work begun by the parents.</p>
   <p>The building should be occupied day and night, and should serve the cultural and educational needs of the Russian colonists and their children. The youth should be informed of the achievements of the country of their fathers in the arts, in science, etc.</p>
   <p>Let this hall spread the light of knowledge and of truth over the entire Russian colony; only then will we be able to say truthfully that this building was not <pb facs="5423967_3_1410.jpg" n="4"/>erected in vain, that hard-earned dollars were not wasted, that the Russian colony receives a great deal of benefit from the building.</p>
   <p>Nothing that is good and pure is wasted in this world. This noble effort of the Society on Wood Street will not be wasted, nor will its unselfish attempts to serve the cause of Russian people abroad, [be forgotten]. The Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society will gather around itself the new, young Russian- Americans. The ranks of RNzOV will receive [new recruits] with fresh energy, who will lift the Society's banner higher and will hold it firmer.</p>
   <p>We are deeply convinced that this will be so.</p>
