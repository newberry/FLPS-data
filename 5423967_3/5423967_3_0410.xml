  <body>
   <p>The third session of the third School Convention took place at the quarters of the Workmen's House, at 11 a. m.</p>
   <p>The same delegates who attended the second session were present; also the delegate Tureyko of the Cicero School. As to the pedagogic side of the schools, it was found that during the current school year almost all the teachers managed their work well and were really good instructors. This was ascertained during this session of the Convention.</p>
   <p>The tactics of some of the teachers were discussed. All introduction of politics into the schools was condemned.</p>
   <p>After that the school discipline and the report of the Enlightenment Committee were discussed.</p>
   <p>After some discussion the report was approved. It was mentioned that in this school year discipline was tolerably good in all schools, <pb facs="5423967_3_0411.jpg" n="2"/>especially in the schools where the teachers Mornel and Voronko have been teaching. As to discipline the same recommendation was adopted which had been uttered at the previous Convention.</p>
   <p>Item 12: Concerning the courses for general education and for teachers planned by the Federation. It was unanimously resolved to commit the opening of these courses to the care of the next School Council. The Convention finds that these courses are very necessary in view of the fact that this year about 25 pupils have graduated from the schools.</p>
   <p>As to the founding of a Pan-American Federation of Russian Schools for children, the Convention resolved unanimously (two persons abstained from voting) to issue an appeal to all Russian schools for children in America, committing to the care of a special committee the putting into execution this resolution. The technical part of this work of unification should be entrusted to the next School Council.</p>
   <p>Item 12: Various questions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0412.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>1) About control stamps and membership booklets, the Convention finds them to be necessary and commits to the care of the School Council the working out of the details of these matters,</p>
   <p>2) About the chorus of the Federation: Such a chorus is necessary, and in the fall the preparatory work should be resumed in those schools which desire it. All the questions were discussed. The chairman made a short farewell speech, and the third School Convention adjourns.</p>
