   <p>Russkoe Obedinennoe Obshchestvo Vzaimopomoshchi (The Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society) is the mass organization of the working elements within the colony, because members who do not work and live on incomes derived from hired labor, number no more than two or three per cent of the membership. For this reason this organization is called rational. In regard to its financial stability, ROOV stands 113 1/2 per cent level (sic), in other words, fifteen per cent higher than any private insurance company that possesses millions. In regard to the payment of sick benefits to its members, ROOV stands deservedly high. All of these facts prove that the foundation of the Mutual Aid and its insurance obligations are based on solid principles.</p>
   <p>Any large Mutual Aid Society, ROOV included, has many problems. And no matter whether they are large or small, difficult or easy to solve--still they can be solved. But there is one thing that ROOV desires more of, although it exists at present in sufficient quantity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_1563.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>What is it?</p>
   <p>Unity.</p>
   <p>Why, are we not united?</p>
   <p>Yes, and no.</p>
   <p>We are united because we are one organization, and not united because all the active elements within the organization are broken into individual and small groups--the branches. The financial stability and the mutual aid activities are the assets of the ROOV. The numerous branches in the same districts are the liabilities of the organization. As long as the liabilities are not converted into assets, in other words, until the small groups, branches, do not merge into large units--district branches--the urgent problems cannot be solved in the measure that is required.</p>
   <p>It is understood, we know, that a majority, particularly the branches of the organization in New York, have existed for years as independent, individual units. They have their own history and "traditions". In general they lived independently, as individual branches. We also know that they sometimes fought against each other. That is true, but from another point of <pb facs="5423967_3_1564.jpg" n="3"/>view, we know that neither in program, politics, social work nor principles did they have any dissension.</p>
   <p>At present, all of them are individual units of a large integral group with one program, one aim, and one thought. Why should they be divided? What and who would force them to live separately from each other, and break their power into pieces? There are three things, three reasons: a misunderstanding of the advantages of unity; the apathy of some persons and the vile intrigues of other individuals. In almost every branch of the ROOV, as well as in any Russian organization, there are always such vile persons, whose social "activities" interfere with unity.</p>
   <p>If any consolidation of the labor elements of the colony, any merging of the small groups into a large unit are positive factors, then any destruction of our social power into small, weak groups would be negative. In our branches there are many persons who in their social life are detrimental to society.</p>
   <p>The three above-mentioned elements caused dissension in one of the New York branches. Because of this the proposed unification with the other branches <pb facs="5423967_3_1565.jpg" n="4"/>failed. Because of the vileness of these malicious persons many of the branches are exerting their efforts in order to have weak clubs, when it is possible to have strong ones.</p>
   <p>The problems standing before the ROOV are the everyday interests of all the members of the society; life itself urgently dictates that we should come to a decision, Instead of ignoring the situation. Otherwise we will not succeed, we will not be able, as we should, to solve the problems standing before us.</p>
   <p>The ROOV should stand on heights beyond reach of its enemies.</p>
