   <p>On last Wednesday, February 5, in connection with Branch Number Twenty-six of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, otherwise called Lomonosov's Branch, a school for the instruction of children in the Russian language was opened. The classes are held every Wednesday from 4 to 7 o'clock in the evening at 11001 Indiana Avenue, in the building of the city public library.</p>
   <p>The R.I. M. A. S. should sincerely congratulate its active members on their work in organizing the school and on the cultural and educational work which they have carried on among the Russian youth in Pullman.</p>
   <p>Our young people have a good knowledge of the Russian language and are being brought up in the Russian spirit. They will be able to take over and carry on <pb facs="5423967_3_0252.jpg" n="2"/>the work of their parents.</p>
   <p>Free quarters for the school were found by S. Levkovich in the building of the city library. This energetic and remarkable woman has put a great deal of effort into organizing the school.</p>
   <p>The school is named after M. V. Lomonosov, the Russian pioneer scientist. Mme. P. Svatikova has been engaged to do the teaching.</p>
   <p>The school committee requests all Russian parents in Pullman to send their children to this school.</p>
