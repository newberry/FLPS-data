   <p>Professor Shchedrin points to the great service rendered by the American Government to Russians and other immigrants by opening night schools. He also calls attention to the fact that the YMCA gives much attention to the education of immigrants and spends considerable sums on it.</p>
   <p>Doctor Krasnow's Paper. Dr. Krasnow reads a report on the necessity to include in the public grade school curriculum sanitary and hygienic information, and shows that owing to the absence of the most elementary survey on these subjects, the Russian masses are subjected to many privations. They live unhygienically and seek medical assistance only <pb facs="5423967_3_0603.jpg" n="2"/>in extreme cases, and so on. The children of Russian immigrants suffer most from an unhygienic environment. The lecturer cites overwhelming statistical facts of mortality among Russian and Polish children in Chicago, which exceeds the mortality of children from groups of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>The Problem of Regional People's Universities. Delegate Azotov makes a motion that the convention vote on the questions which were discussed in several papers, that is, the question of the necessity to establish regional people's universities or schools, their type to be worked out by a specially appointed committee. This question is put to a vote and is unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>The convention decides to use the funds available at present for courses in farming, established in the regional schools and universities.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0604.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is further resolved to consider the motion for the establishment of technical courses, but to leave it open for the present.</p>
   <p>The convention adopts a resolution for obligatory courses on subjects of general education in the regional people's universities. Also one in favor of lectures on hygiene, sanitation, anatomy and physiology being introduced.</p>
   <p>Obligatory instruction in English in these schools and universities and in a popular course of American history and other related subjects is unanimously favored.</p>
   <p>The convention approves the motion to have staffs of traveling lecturers at the regional people's universities.</p>
   <p>Because of lack of means and other reasons the question of establishing correspondence courses for Russians who live far away from central points is left open.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0605.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The convention further recommends that, along with the opening of schools for adults, Sunday schools for children of school age should be established to teach the Russian language.</p>
   <p>The paper by M. Vilchur on the necessity for research work concerning the past and present of Russian immigration is to be submitted to the People's University Committee (Soviet) as useful material for developing this question.</p>
   <p>Owing to the late hour and the fact that in the evening the Chicago People's University is giving a concert and ball for the delegates and the audience, it was decided to close the session, leaving the task of working out the remaining questions to the following morning session.</p>
