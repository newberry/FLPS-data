   <p>When I think about our social work, about our work in cultural and spiritual fields, and about our colonial life in America, the question somehow arises: Well, and what have we done that is good in the quarter of a century of our residence outside our native land? What have we accomplished in a cultural and a spiritual way which at once attracts our notice, and on which we might pride ourselves before other nationalities? And there is no doubt that there are certain things in our lives which we can be proud of.</p>
   <p>Obviously our only misfortune is that we do not understand and do not even try to appraise the true value of what we have done in all these years. Our spiritual and cultural possessions quite often are taken advantage of by other nationalities, such as Poles, Czechs, and even Americans. Our Russian <pb facs="5423967_3_0202.jpg" n="2"/>songs and music are heard everywhere, and our literature is translated into all the languages of the world. Immortal works of Russian geniuses are played on all foreign stages. Only we, while living here, remain passive and indifferent to all that should be great and dear to us, that should as far as we are concerned have the greatest value in the world. For some reason or other we do not attach much significance to all this. Why it is so I cannot understand at all.</p>
   <p>It is true that we have been able to organize here a few societies for mutual aid, but what is this in comparison with the number of us Russians here in America? Their entire membership is only a drop in the bucket, for in Chicago alone we on the basis of our members could gather a membership several times larger than that of all the [Russian] Mutual-aid societies in America put together. I am not speaking at all of such cities as New York. If every Russian man in America and Canada would only realize his duty to his own people, we should have a mighty united family. But before we can make others realize their duty, we ourselves must acquire a sense of duty. We must think through <pb facs="5423967_3_0203.jpg" n="3"/>this problem and shake off our passivity and indifference.</p>
   <p>Well, then, what shall we do to advance culturally? First of all we must make an attempt to move away from the dead point. By all means we should get rid of the dead weight of the past and take up living creative work. But what is this work? I think that it is up to the advanced and most active elements in the Russian organizations, whether they be mutual-aid societies, children's schools, or clubs, to cultivate among the members the spirit of national unity. Many of us have more than once made attempts to do this and to carry on such work. Many among us have already given up the task, for as far as we could see, all our efforts were in vain.</p>
   <p>Whose fault is this? Part of the blame, undoubtedly, can be laid at the door of those whom our people believed in, and who betrayed them. Part of the fault is our own, for quite often even the most active and advanced men cannot agree even among themselves.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_0204.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Let us, for instance, take such good work as the children's schools of R. I. M. A. S.. It should seem that there is no ground for disagreements or even for quarrels in such a matter. But to our regret even so important a matter as this is being neglected because there is a lack of common effort, and there is friction among the members of our school boards. School benefit entertainments are not properly attended and do not yield the financial results which are expected, and which are necessary for the maintenance of the schools.</p>
   <p>On April 26 (Sunday) the Krylov School of Russian speech and dancing intends to give an entertainment, the proceeds of which will go toward covering the expense involved in maintaining the dancing classes through the summer months so that the children may be well trained for the active winter period. And I want to believe that both the members of R. I. M. A. S. and the rest of the Russian colony will attend this entertainment en masse. My words will not be without foundation of proof if I say that the Krylov School has always been responsible when called upon to help other organizations in arranging their <pb facs="5423967_3_0205.jpg" n="5"/>concert programs. Our young Russian artists, sometimes in cold and in rain, have gone from one end of the city to the other to take part in concert performances without any remuneration. On many occasions they have even gone outside Chicago just to help those who requested their assistance.</p>
   <p>For these efforts freely exerted, without a penny received in return, the Russian colony in Chicago should reward the growing Russian talent of the Krylov School of dancing with mass attendance. Let us show that we Russians can appreciate our own Russian art. By attending their entertainment we shall help them not only financially. We shall render them moral encouragement for future development and active work among the Russian organizations of Chicago.</p>
