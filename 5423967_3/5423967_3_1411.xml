   <p>In the newspaper Rassviet, on January 12, I read the account of how the elections in the Women's Progressive Society were conducted. It is a shame, however, that the story was so brief. It did not contain even a hundredth part of what really took place at the meeting. The controversy at the meeting was caused entirely by Mr. Deviatkin's presence[Translator's Note: Mr. Deviatkin is a Communist leader], and by the conduct of his supporters, who interrupted our meeting in a most insolent fashion. It is actually true that they exchanged secret signs with Mrs. Cziibulia, our chairman, in order to express approval or disapproval of the decisions made. I am indignant about it, and I ask Mr. Deviatkin what right had he to exchange signs, by means of a pencil, with Mrs. Cziibulia, our chairman? What right had he, in spite of our protests, to interrupt our meeting, when the meetings of his own organization are held behind locked doors?</p>
   <p>I repeat that Mr. Deviatkin's interference in the affairs of our society is <pb facs="5423967_3_1412.jpg" n="2"/>a highly abominable and disgusting act. Our organization has no need for guardians like Mr. Deviatkin.</p>
