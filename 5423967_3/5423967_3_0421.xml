   <p>Saturday, June 27, was the last day of the current school year at the South Side People's School. The studies were finished in all the four forms, and the results of the examinations were made known. Sixteen pupils of the fourth form received their graduation certificates.....</p>
   <p>All these pupils had been examined on June 25-27 by the Examining Committee, consisting of A. M. Yusefovich, I. R. Khomko, M. I. Volkov, Dr. A. I. Nedzelnitzky, Dr. N. V. Popov and the teacher A. Zmagar.</p>
   <p>In the evening there was a banquet at the South Side School in honor of the new graduates. Speeches were made and certificates were given to the graduates. The banquet had a solemn character. The following persons made speeches: M. I. Volkov, J. Y. Voronko, A. M. Yusefovich, N. G. Kaluzkin (Dr. Pertsov), and I. M. Romanovich. All the orators advised the parents to let their children continue their studies in the future <pb facs="5423967_3_0422.jpg" n="2"/>as they would not get in any other country such opportunities to improve their education as they are having in America.</p>
   <p>A. M. Yusefovich, an old pedagogue who had been a professor of military schools, praised highly the achievements of the graduates, and said he was astonished that such good results could have been achieved with our children who live surrounded by people of various nationalities and speaking different languages.</p>
