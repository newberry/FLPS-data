   <p>The Pushkin Memorial Russian School at Pullman (a Chicago suburb) had existed five years when, on July 24, 1927, for the first time thirteen of its oldest pupils who had completed the five-year course were graduated and received their certificates. All pupils, their parents and many guests were present. The teacher of the school Mr. I. J. Voronko made a short speech, explaining the importance of the existence of Russian schools for the children of Russian immigrants, and exhorting those who had been graduated not to give up their studies but to try to improve their education in the future. After this speech some of the pupils recited Russian poetry and a string orchestra composed of pupils and conducted by the teacher played several musical selections. Then the sounds of the harmonica were heard and dancing began and lasted till late in the night. Everybody was happy, as the graduation showed that the school had proved to be a real success.</p>
