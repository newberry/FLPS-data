   <p>On Tuesday, October 3, at five o'clock in the afternoon, lessons began in the I. A. Kryloff Russian School, located in its old quarters at 2550 North Lotus Avenue.</p>
   <p>We remind every Russian living in the district of Cragin-Kanson Park who has children of school age to think of the future of his children. Every mother and father having love and affection for their children should help them learn the Russian language, culture and arts. There is no excuse for those parents who treat lightly the Russian school work, and look upon it with indifference.</p>
   <p>Russian schools unite the children with the great Russian culture and broaden their mental outlook. "Schools are the lamps of the nation." Do not make your children mental cripples. With the opening of the Russian schools remove your children from the streets and send them to schools. Knowledge is power.</p>
