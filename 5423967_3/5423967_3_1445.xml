<title level="a">THE KRYLOV BRANCH HOLDS A MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Krylov Society of Hanson Park, Chicago, Branch 18 of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, held a meeting September 20. The discussions were limited to one topic--the new membership campaign. Throughout all the speeches ran a note of disappointment and dissatisfaction over the results achieved thus far. The speakers blamed the depression and the unemployment situation for their failure to bring in new members. One of them reported that he had visited ten Russian families living in the neighborhood and was unable to induce a single one to join the organization.</p>
   <p>Another speaker said that he had made it a point to visit those Russian families of the neighborhood that are better off economically and more advanced intellectually. He summed up in the following words the reactions of the better-to-do Russians when it was proposed that they join the Krylov Society: "What shall we do in your organization? Merely to take out insurance against sickness or death is not enough for us; we need spiritual food, which you cannot offer.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_3_1446.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>What do you provide for the minds of your members? Where is the intellectual food--the books and magazines, the drama and the theater, the music and singing--which is such an indispensable part of our intellectual life?"</p>
   <p>After hearing the reports of the men engaged in the membership drive and after a long discussion, the Society decided to continue the campaign until its membership is increased to at least one hundred. Everyone present agreed that this goal must be achieved before the second anniversary of the Society. It was also decided immediately to begin educational work among members of this branch and among other Russians living in Cragin, Hanson Park, and Elmwood, in order to stamp out illiteracy among the Russian people of these three districts. The Society also resolved to establish appropriate, well-appointed quarters; to provide a library; and to attract to the organization those Russian men and women who possess a higher education, in order to develop the educational activities of the Krylov branch.</p>
   <p>To acquire the necessary funds for these activities, the Society intends to <pb facs="5423967_3_1447.jpg" n="3"/>arrange a big entertainment program, the net proceeds from which will be used to further the aims of the Krylov branch. The entertainment will take place Sunday, October 7 at Konetzki's Hall, 2041 North Laurel Avenue, near Grand Avenue. The Krylov Society, Branch Number 18 of the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society, hopes that every Russian family in Hanson Park, Cragin, and Elmwood Park, as well as Russians from other sections of Chicago and from nearby towns, will be present at this social gathering.</p>
