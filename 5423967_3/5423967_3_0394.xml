<title level="a">THE ENTERTAINMENT GIVEN BY THE OLDEST OF OUR SCHOOLS</title>

   <p>The South Side School Society, during all the long period of its existence, i. e., for eight years, has had no such successful entertainment as this last, given by that society on Sunday, January 24, at the Schoenhofen Hall.</p>
   <p>The members of the South Side School Society owe this signal success on one hand to the friendly feelings of our colony towards the oldest Russian school in Chicago, and on the other hand, to the strenuous work done by the school committee. Long before the day of the entertainment, the school committee had sold tickets to the amount of $185.</p>
   <p>According to the statement of the manager of the Schoenhofen Hall, that large hall had not seen inside its walls so many people during the last four years. The program was started with a delay of only 24 minutes. The appearance on the stage of the orchestra of the <pb facs="5423967_3_0395.jpg" n="2"/>F. M. Dastoyevsky Memorial School and its splendid musical performance made a very pleasing impression.</p>
   <p>The children-pupils of the South Side School were greeted by the public with thunderous applause... The public was delighted with the dances performed by the children of the South Side School and the Independent School.... The chorus of the Amalgamated Russian Schools, conducted by Mr. Tatarov, sang with great spirit....</p>
   <p>Miss Stephania Tsimbalista, our favorite whom we admiro so in the role of "Natalka Poltavka," conquered the hearts of all the audience by her performance of Ukrainian songs. She was the queen of the festival .... Everybody was pleased with the orchestra of the Students' Society. To sum it up, the program was rich in interesting numbers and varied. It was really the grandest concert and ball ever arranged in the Russian colony of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Though the South Side School Society was not bent on getting a big <pb facs="5423967_3_0396.jpg" n="3"/>profit, it wanted, of course, to recover the $517 spent on the arrangement of the entertainment. But there was really a net profit of about $400, if not more ....</p>
   <p>This evening entertainment proved to be an unusual financial and moral success for the South Side School which makes it rank first among all the other Russian schools of Chicago.</p>
   <p>A. Byelorussky.</p>
