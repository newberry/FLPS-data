   <p>The radio cabaret ball given last Saturday by Mr. J. Voronko, our Russian radio broadcaster, was an unusual entertainment that attracted many people. However, the young people were in the majority. The very good orchestra, the excellence of the musical part of the program, and the numerous waitresses in national costume were the main features which left good impressions with guests.</p>
   <p>Among those present one noted old and new [Russian] immigrants. There were also Poles, Jews, Lithuanians, Americans, and representatives of other nationalities who came to enjoy the evening and to pay their respects to Mr. Voronko. The guests selected Miss E. Kichkaylo as radio queen, and second place was won by Miss Olga Pavlikevich. Dr. A. I. Nedzelnitsky was master of ceremonies.</p>
