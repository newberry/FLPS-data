   <p>On April 13, on the second day of Easter Week, St. George's Church was thronged with Russian women who came to pray. The women were members of two sisterhoods affiliated with the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society. The second day of Easter Week was celebrated just as solemnly as the first one.</p>
   <p>After the services the sisters of the R.I.M.A.S. greeted one another with the words "Christ is risen". To the sisters of Branch Number Three later on came several strange young women who having seen that among the sisters real sisterly love exists expressed their desire to join the sisterhood. They asked for all the information about the organization. The sisters could not give all the information on the spot, and we therefore give it now on our page in this newspaper [the R.I.M.A.S. page of Rassviet].</p>
   <p>All the sisters in our organization are insured in the Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society (R.I.M.A.S.), and our sisterhood constitutes a part of the <pb facs="5423967_3_1111.jpg" n="2"/>Society. When a member becomes ill, other sisters pay regular visits to the sick sister and help her around the house. When a member dies, our organization [R.I.M.A.S.] pays out to the husband or her children the sum of money for which the member was insured, and the sisterhood for its part pays out fifty dollars. To the dead sister the sisterhood sends four sisters to hold the wake around the body and assigns six sisters to act as pallbearers at the funeral services. The sisterhood also buys flowers for the grave. All this is done at the sisterhood's expense, and nothing whatever is deducted from the insurance money.</p>
   <p>The sisterhood takes particular care of its young members. When one is married, the sisterhood arranges banquets for the newly wedded sister and gives a valuable present to the young wife.</p>
