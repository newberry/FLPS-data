   <p>We have often treated, in these columns, the question of the great services that the Greeks of America render to Greece. We have expressed our regret regarding the Greek State, which does not, as yet, realize the great power of the Greeks of America and as not shown any prudence in benefiting from it.</p>
   <p>Today, we again take up the question account of the financial report of the society of Kosmites which indicates how much this organization has accomplished from the time of its launching up to date, towards rendering service to Greece. To this report we call the attention of our readers, because from it we may see that this organization for twenty four consecutive years did not cease acting and put forth all efforts in order to prove itself useful to Greece.</p>
   <p>In money their contributions amounted to more $50,000. If we examine their contributions in kind, we will see that in patriotic sentiment the fellow-nationals from Kosma of Kynouria, living in Chicago and other towns of America, excell.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0293.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The contributions of Kosmites were not limited to money sent to Greece for public works in their township. Money was also sent for general purposes concerning the whole nation. The Chicago Kosmites never failed to contribute to any worthy project when their mother country called on them.</p>
   <p>They contributed to the Greek Navy, the Ecumenical Patriarchate, the earthquake victims of Ilia, the fund of S. Matsouka, the expedition of reserves during the wars of 1912-1913, the war victims, and to the relief of Asia Minor refugees. These nationals did not forget that they were Greeks as well as Kosmites with obligations to the whole Greek nation of which they were worthy children.</p>
   <p>But even their contribution for local purposes, in the main, serves not local needs simply, for example, as repairing and decorating their church, St. Anargyroi, for whose benefit they initiated their society, but serve national needs of general scope as, for example, the erection and maintenance of the School, and Construction of the highway connecting the towns of Plaka, Leonidion, Kosma, Brontama, Sparta.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0294.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Did they limit themselves to the above? The reader, through a perusal of their report, will see that they decided to have a whole chain or projects executed, that would change the small and insignificant township of Kosma to a summer resort equalling the Swiss centers of recreation. Such is the ambition of the Kosmites.</p>
   <p>And now we come back to our subject and ask the Greek government and its representatives if they ever rendered the least of Moral Support to these patriots as well as to other organizations that accomplish similar objectives? Did they even take their existence into consideration, or the fact that they are accomplishing such tasks?</p>
   <p>Much more could be done if we had a national representative in America, and if the Greek state became aware of the national power of the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>We perform our duty by presenting in these few lines the work of the Kosmites in America, not with the purpose of advertising but ardently congratulating the Kosmites and telling the Greek government that it is about time that it should pay attention to the Greeks of America.</p>
   <p>S. Kotakis</p>
