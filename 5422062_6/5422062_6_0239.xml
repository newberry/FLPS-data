   <p>The Olympic Games began in Greece 2,500 years ago, and the first one took place in the Stadium of Athens. They were revived in 1896 in the same Stadium, which was renewed by the late celebrated patriot Averof.</p>
   <p>The old Stadium was on the plain, and those who were not invited to occupy seats took their places on the near-by hills and watched the various contests.</p>
   <p>The Games were held every four years and were exclusively Greek, for only Greek contestants took part.</p>
   <p>The winners were crowned with olive branches taken from the sacred grove. After the Games the victors departed for their native towns, where their fellow-citizens received them with honors and festivities.</p>
   <p>Since ancient Greek cities were walled, part of the wall was torn down to receive the Olympic victors with pomp.</p>

   <p>After the rise of Rome, Roman athletes came to compete with the Greeks. In these games only the noteworthy athletes of the two nations took part. For a good many Olympiads harmony and peace prevailed, but by and by jealousies and disputes arose.</p>
   <p>The Greeks accused the Romans as commercializers of the Games. The Roman Victors visited various Greek cities and received cash and other things of value for their exhibitions. In later years the Greeks refused to accept such commercial athletes from Rome. The result of this was fist-fights between Greek and Roman athletes and the burning down of the Athenian building which sheltered the athletes.</p>
   <p>Greece and Rome severed relations on amount of this, and the Olympic Games were discontinued for 1,500 years.</p>
   <p>When the Games were revived in the renavated Stadium, only the athletes of large countries took part. Since them other nations have participated, and in the forthcoming Olympic fifty-two countries will be represented.</p>
