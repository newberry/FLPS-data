   <p>The Chicago men who had served or were serving in the United States Army called a meeting last Sunday in order to send a message to President Wilson, asking that the rights of the unredeemed Greeks of Thrace, Macedonia....be defended and that they be aided in their struggle to become reunited with the mother country, Greece.</p>
   <p>Lieutenant C. Pasalis was chairman of the meeting, and the prayer and benediction were offered by Rev. Hatzidimitriou, who with great emotion called upon the Almighty to free his believers from the tyranny they have tolerated for centuries, and to reunite them with their fatherland.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pasalis spoke about the purpose of the meeting, and then introduced John Haramaran who, as a soldier talking to soldiers, said that thousands of Greek soldiers had shed their blood for freedom and for mankind, hoping that by doing so, their enslaved brothers would also regain their freedom.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0630.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. A. Lazarides, president of the Chicago Committee of Unredeemed Greeks, then spoke.... The young and well-known dramatist and journalist, Mr. N. Lamoropoulos, was acclaimed when he arose to speak. He said, "I come to give to you a few sparks from the flame in my heart, in order that the flame in your hearts might burn brighter for our unredeemed brothers in Europe. I appeal to you, who wear so proudly the uniform of the American Army.</p>
   <p>"Today's gathering is not a usual one. It is a rare one, and is to be ranked with the most patriotic fete. It is a meeting of Greek men wearing the noble uniform of the United States Army, who have come here to petition for the freedom of a people who have been subjugated for five hundred years.</p>
   <p>"Soldier! It is one of the finest words ever formed by human lips. It will be no exaggeration if I say that the Greek is born a soldier. He was never taught by a Hindenburg or by a military school. He was never taught to sink hospital ships filled with wounded men, or to kill innocent women and children, or to destroy Churches, or to fight with poison gases. The Greek soldier was taught by his history, by the Battles of 1821, by his mother and his conscience, and finally by his enslaved brothers, to be what Ne is.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0631.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"So, when the signal for advance is given, the Greek soldier rushes forward urged on by that inner voice which he hears coming from unredeemed Greece.....</p>
   <p>"When I gaze upon the undimmed splendor of the American Flag, I feel just as the Magi must have felt upon finding the Saviour in the stable.</p>
   <p>"Brave soldiers, you have every right to ask through your vote the freedom of Thrace and Macedonia from the representatives of peace. Ask for their freedom, not as a gift, but because it is necessary for the justice of the world. If this is refused it would be better that Free Greece should die along with the unredeemed Greece; and the bones of the French, English, Greeks, Belgians, and Serbs, who fought for her liberation, should be the holy relics left to mark the struggle for liberty. Upon the grave this inscription should be written. 'Greece, who held the torch of civilization and liberty to light the world, died in the twentieth century.' "</p>
