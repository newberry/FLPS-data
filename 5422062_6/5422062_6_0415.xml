   <p>p. 8-In the recent celebration of Byron's centennial the only element of Greek society which was not officially invited and represented at the affairs was the Greek press, which was founded by Byron!</p>
   <p>The Greek Chronicle was the first regular Greek newspaper. It was published in Mesolongi by a group of fighters with Lord Byron, who furnished the money to found it. But even though Lord Byron founded the Chronicle, it was long before he consented to the birth of the publication, for he thought that the fighting Greeks were in need of ammunition and supplies rather than of newspapers to stir up among them ill feelings and controversies.</p>
   <p>Some of these little things should not be forgotten, since they are Greek and Byronian history. It is worth while to know how Byron was finally persuaded to support an enterprise for which he had a profound contempt. For a long time he tried to save Mesolongi from the evil influences of a newspaper, but later he paid Neofytos Vamvas liberally for his articles.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0416.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Committee of Philhellenes in London held different views than Byron and bombarded him with quantities of material for education, with type, and with presses.</p>
   <p>Byron, who had already suffered by the attacks of newspaper critics, and had no use for yellow journals, thus describes his correspondence with the Committee, which continued to send typographical and educational material to the fighting Greeks.</p>
   <p>"The Committee sends me maps of the world," wrote Byron. "Do they think that I came to Greece to teach geography? The Greeks need swords, and they send them type! I don't understand the purpose of sending printing-presses to a fighting people which does not know how to read and write. The secretary of the Committee writes to me long letters about the classical land of liberty, the cradle of the arts, the fountain of genius, the home of the gods, and thousands of other irrelevant matters.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0417.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"I wrote back to him and told him not to write any more of that stuff; we had had enough of that nonsense. Supplies, supplies are what they need! And he has not replied to me yet!"</p>
   <p>With all his contempt for newspapers Byron was unable to resist and to prevent the publication of the paper because his friend, Colonel Stanhope, an ardent newspaperman, was determined to have a newspaper. The Colonel combated Lord Byron's fears and insisted on the publication with clever arguments. Stanhope argued that free opinion was one of the blessings of liberty, and that a city under siege or a country in revolution against a tyrant needs free opinion. He insisted that the paper would not cause any misunderstandings nor inflame passions but would rather save the public from these things.</p>
   <p>The newspaper, he argued, did not load the responsibility of public opinion on one individual.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0418.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It was better that public opinion should be crystallized by individuals than that everybody should feel the fear of the unknown and the indefinite.</p>
   <p>The conflict was sharp, and it almost ended in an absolute break between the two philhellenes, but the poet was a good sport and generously let himself be defeated by the Colonel's arguments.</p>
   <p>Byron finally perceived that where there is liberty, there newspapers flourish, and that their effect depends on the ethics of those who control them. He said to his opponent and friend, "judge me not by what I say but by what I do." Thus he became the financial sponsor of the first Greek newspaper. He gave five hundred "louie" to found the Chronicle.</p>
   <p>This act of his may have been for good, or it may have been for evil, since everything in the world is relative, and the press is no exception to this rule.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0419.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Those who are in control of it make it an instrument for good or for evil according to their ethics. Society itself makes newspapers either dangerous or harmless according to its reaction to their influence on morals, on courage, and on culture.</p>
   <p>It was impossible to avoid the press in a society where men were struggling for private and public ends, and where they had a passion for criticism, an ancient peculiarity of the Greek race. These conditions were seeking an outlet in Mesolongi as Stanhope cleverly perceived, and the Greek Chronicle was the result.</p>
   <p>Fortunately the Chronicle did not justify the fears of Lord Byron. It was always a decent and serious newspaper, and the poet was pleased with it, admitting that the Colonel's views were correct, though he teased him good-humoredly for his unlimited attachment to the press and his faith in its influence on the public and for his care of the presses sent by the Committee of Philhellenes, calling him in their intimate chats the "typographical Colonel."</p>
