   <p>The Society of Stereoladitons [People from a town of that name in Greece] of Chicago gives an annual dinner in behalf of its members and their families. This years' dinner took place last Sunday in the hall at the corner of Van Buren Street and Ashland Avenue. A large number of Stereoladitons gathered in spite of the very bad weather.....</p>
   <p>The dinner had been prepared and served by the staff of the well-known Harrison Restaurant, located at the corner of Wabash and Harrison Streets. The menu was a typically Greek one and included all sorts of delicacies found only on Greek tables.....</p>
   <p>The American and Greek national anthems were played before the dinner was served. Then the Society's president, Mr. Peter Pappas, reiterated the purpose and program of the Society. He stated that it was interested in education and progress, that it provided financial aid to its members and their <pb facs="5422062_6_1049.jpg" n="2"/>families, and promoted general good will. He also said that so far the Society had fulfilled this program of purposes but that it would endeavor to do more in the future...</p>
