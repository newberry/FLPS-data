   <p>The matter of Thrace is still unsolved, due to the stand taken by the American representatives, who have become guardians of Bulgaria. Mr. Venizelos is nearly discouraged by their unreasonable attitude; and he is endeavoring to win by diplomacy what will otherwise be settled by armed forces. He has ordered the Greek army to assemble on the fields of Thrace.</p>
   <p>It is felt that these representatives are acting independently, and are ignoring the orders of President Wilson. The American government refrained from declaring war upon Bulgaria, and also retained the Bulgarian Ambassador in Washington. This was considered scandalous by the press, who believed him to be a German spy. Since America did not declare war on Bulgaria, what right has she to sign a pact with that country, and also influence the entire [peace] conference.....?</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0625.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is inhuman that America should forge chains--even heavier than those of the Turk--with which to further burden and enslave the Greeks of Thrace. Thrace is Greek, and has been for centuries. According to statistics there is [in Thrace] a population of 17,000 Greeks....</p>
   <p>The American representatives in Paris do not express either the liberty loving American spirit, or the wishes of the Senate. If America is to be the tool of Bulgarian propaganda, Jewish capitalists, and American missionaries, then the foundation of this great democracy is being undermined and destroyed.</p>
   <p>If this is true, then history will record that the Fourteen Points of Wilson's program were just fourteen soap bubbles.</p>
