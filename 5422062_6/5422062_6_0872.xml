  <body>
   <p>In accordance with the official proclamation and decree of the Royal Greek Government made public on March 22, 1907, an order was issued to register all the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Greece and all Greek citizens in foreign countries for the purpose of taking this year's census. November 9, 1907 has been set as the date of the census.</p>
   <p>Having received an adequate number of registration cards for the Greek population of Chicago, that is, both for those who reside in Chicago permanently, and for those who are in Chicago temporarily, the consulate will select a suitable number of census takers, each of whom will obtain one hundred cards.....</p>
   <p>All those who would like to be census takers and thus assist the Greek Government in getting an accurate idea of the Greek population of Chicago, are requested to meet in the hall of the Greek Orthodox Church of the Assumption this coming Sunday, immediately after the church service.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0873.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Because this is a task of national significance all the Greeks of this city are requested to co-operate and contribute to the sucess of the census.</p>
   <p>Chicago, October 23, 1907.</p>
   <p>Nicholas Salopoulos,</p>
   <p>Consul General of Greece.</p>
