  <body>
   <p>Excellency,</p>
   <p>We, the Greeks of Chicago, welcome you to this great American city.</p>
   <p>Only a few months ago when we were informed of your appointment as the new Greek Ambassador to the United States of America, all of us here collectively and individually rejoiced.</p>
   <p>We flattered ourselves, feeling that, by your appointment, the Greek people of America were officially recognized as a significant part of the Greek nation. We have never ceased being deeply conscious of our importance. It <pb facs="5422062_6_0847.jpg" n="2"/>was proven by the letters, communications, encyclicals, and appeals which we have received from bishops, patriarchs, princes, and important government officials.</p>
   <p>Many of us, not only in Chicago but in the United States generally, have been consoling ourselves with the thought that your arrival in this country would bring special privileges and certain profits to a specific group of people. A number of people amongst us hoped to exploit the occasion of your reception to satisfy the vanity and ambition of a few. You have visited us; you now know us; you are now familiar with our fantastic plans and schemes. Our dreams, our hopes, and aspirations, however, have vanished, because they could not be realized and because we did not have the strength to put them into practice.</p>
   <p>So, Excellency, you can imagine our dissillusionment; it is deep and inexpressible. It will continue to be so, thanks to the efforts and the <pb facs="5422062_6_0848.jpg" n="3"/>policies of the so-called Greek press of this and other major American cities. Because the Greek press is afraid for its popularity, because it is very careful lest it lose any of its readers, it will continue to flatter you and give you every possible support. However, your Excellency, if you ever begin to accuse the Greek press of America of being unworthy of the name, it will attack you like a venomous snake.</p>
   <p>It is true that your fame and reputation arrived in America before you did. For a short time, we thought that those were exaggerated publicity stories; for a moment we had doubts about your accomplishments and briliant record in Macedonia when you served as Greek consul-general in Saloniki. We had thought that deeds and actual accomplishments had no meaning for us anymore. We had forgotten how to do things, instead, we only talked and philosophized. You have come that we may return to the road of reality. But, this is not the only lesson which we must be taught.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0849.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It is most encouraging that men like you have denounced those renegades and deserters from Greece, especially from the Greek army, who have the audacity to pose as patriotic leaders of our communities. In addition, considerable work has been done in hunting down those pseudo-intellectuals and false teachers who speak eloquently and continually about our ancestral glories. Many of us who have had a little schooling take it upon ourselves to instruct and inspire us with high-sounding phrases.</p>
   <p>In the past we have heard of a few ex-convicts who boast that they are reputable citizens when they send a few dollars to some politician, bishop, or church leader who in turn sends them a letter of thanks and appreciation. Lately, throughout America, but particularly in Chicago, any blustering idiot, any ambitious but ignorant and incompetent member of our communities has succeeded in being elected to some church or community office without being able to come up to expectations in the performance of his duties as a leader. Mr. Koromilas, we warn you that the Greek communities are <pb facs="5422062_6_0850.jpg" n="5"/>full of ignorant, stubborn, ambitious, and evil characters. Our churches, our schools, our organizations, our communities in general need good leadership and a thorough reorganization. Let us hope that you will act immediately to correct all existing evils among our present leaders and institutions.</p>
  </body>
