   <p>p. 1 -- The publisher of Loxias, Mr. Dem. Eutaxias, is criticized and accused of unfairness and selfishness by the National Herald, a Greek daily of New York, This paper claims to be pro-Venizelist. Whether it follows Venizelos's policies because of patriotism or through self-interest we shall see later on, and you shall be the judges to decide. Loxias's judgment is that this daily of New York advocates Venizelos's policies only for its own interest and not out of patriotism, and we dare them to challenge us for proof.</p>
   <p>We, the staff of Loxias, consider ourselves, and facts prove it, representatives of the highest type of journalistic decency, integrity, justice, and patriotism. And above all we have one face and not two. Our record for the last twenty years proves beyond any doubt the veracity of our statement. The interest of the community and of the people comes first and is above everything else. That is our conception of journalism.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0695.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Loxias, which recently exposed Solon Vlastos, publisher of Atlantis, a New York Greek daily, as the general commander of the Greco-German propaganda and its $600,000 activities, has been on the lookout for further Satanic actions to be perpetrated by this clique against the interest and welfare of the Greeks in America.</p>
   <p>Our vigilant waiting was crowned with success. Three weeks ago Loxias trapped the double-faced propaganda of the so-called Loyalists' League and immediately delivered this evidence to the authorities of the United States Government, after taking photostatic copies, which we published. The original letter and the telegram intended to be sent to the Secretary of State are still in the hands of the Government. The New York Greek National Herald asked us to let it have the cuts so that they might publish the activities of this Loyalists' League. Loxias at once forwarded the photostatic copies and cuts to its sister newspaper in New York. These people did not publish the exposure for ten days, on the ground that they wanted the original letter and telegram, which were in the hands of the authorities. And in return we were criticized and accused <pb facs="5422062_6_0696.jpg" n="3"/>of being unpatriotic and of not extending courtesies to a sister newspaper and of selfishness, and other unfounded charges were made against us.</p>
   <p>And when at last they published the exposure, they did not, as they should have done, mention that Loxias was the first Greek newspaper in the United States to expose the unpatriotic propaganda of the Loyalists, but they said that the cuts were procured through the courtesies of Mr. Triantaphilos, etc.</p>
   <p>Is that decency, integrity, and justice? We overlook it all because our aim in journalism is to serve the interest of the whole. Patriotism, according to the standards of Loxias, is above personal interest. Loxias has maintained for the last twenty years that our country comes first, and individuals second. The individual who is prepared to sacrifice everything for his country is a patriot.</p>
   <p>Loxias, therefore, as an independent newspaper, follows the wishes of the country; it follows Venizelos and his government because they are for Greece and not against Greece.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0697.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The two Greek dailies of New York follow the slogan, "Divide and rule." They have divided the Greeks in America into Venizelists and Royalists for their own interest, not through patriotism. If Atlantis was pro-Venizelis, the National Herald would be pro-Royalist and vice versa. "Divide the ignorant and rule" must be the principle of patriotism for that type of publisher, leader, demagogue, etc., which thinks of its own interest first. Patriots, eh? Fortunately, Greece has very few of that kind of patriot; otherwise there would not have been a Greece to-day.</p>
   <p>We stand ready to prove all that we have said above if we are challenged by those who feel hurt. But we know that no challenge will be made.</p>
