   <p>Matsoukas appeared last Sunday at the Second Regiment Armory and captured the hearts of the Chicago Greeks. 2,300 people were present, many more were outside, unable to get in. Long before 2 o'clock the 1,800 available seats were taken and 700 more people were lined against the walls filling every possible space.</p>
   <p>At 3 o'clock Matsoukas made his appearance. Words cannot describe him. One must hear and see him in order to appreciate his talent and genius. The audience would not let him stop. They kept clamoring for more and Matsoukas kept giving it to them.</p>
   <p>Then came the time for the contributions - the contributions which Matsoukas never touches. Donations were as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0798.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>- Young Men's Club - Donated $315 and awarded Matsoukas a silver belt.</p>
   <p>- Greek Restaurant Association - Donated $300.</p>
   <p>- Stereoladitan "Athanasios Diakos" Club - $100.</p>
   <p>- "Phoenix" Club - $100.</p>
   <p>- Paleohoritan "Omonia" Club - $50.</p>
   <p>- J. Venizelos (Mangel the Florest) - $100.</p>
   <p>- Greek-American Bank - (Giocaris and Stamatidas) - $200.</p>
   <p>- N. Koursoumis - $100.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0799.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The crowd became wild! One man, J. Lambropoulos, emptied his purse of $80 in the collection plate. Matsoukas asked him not to put all of it in but he replied "Come to my store tomorrow and I'll give you more."</p>
   <p>At 6 o'clock the collections had reached $3,500. At 11 o'clock the total was $4,000.88. This money was placed immediately in the vaults of the Masonic Temple. After the reception Mr. Geocaris, the banker, gave the honored guests a banquet at the Savoy.</p>
