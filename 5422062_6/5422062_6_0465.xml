  <body>
   <p>The General Consulate of Greece in Chicago hereby notifies our countrymen that in accordance with the instructions given by the Treasury Department all possessors of temporary titles to the compulsory loan of 1,600 million drachmas must deposit them with the Greek General Consulate, from which they will receive temporary receipts for their deposits.</p>
   <p>As the next step in the procedure the General Consulate will send these temporary titles to the Greek embassy in Washington, D. C., and from there they will go to the National Bank of Greece in Athens to be exchanged for permanent titles.</p>
   <p>According to the laws of the United States the loan above mentioned is prohibited in the United States; therefore the titles to bonds of this loan will remain deposited in the treasury of the Bank of Greece to the credit of the owners thereof, who may dispose of their bonds and of the income therefrom derived as they see fit. The National Bank of Greece will send receipts to <pb facs="5422062_6_0466.jpg" n="2"/>all depositors of bonds for the protection of their titles.</p>
   <p>The General Consulate of Greece in Chicago invites all Greek students subject to military service and now in attendance at any university within the district served by the Consulate to communicate as soon as possible with the General Consulate if they intend to return to Greece at the end of the academic year and have not received permission to postpone their enlistment until that time.</p>
   <p>May 22, 1923.</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>P. Trinketas,</p>
   <p>Consul in charge.</p>
