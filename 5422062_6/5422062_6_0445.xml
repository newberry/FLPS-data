  <body>
   <p>Democracy in Greece banished from her homeland, is homesick to return to the classical grounds, where she was born, lived and was honored as a goddess.</p>
   <p>The Democracy of Greece produced the Golden Age of Pericles and Aspasia, which shall remain the overflowing spring of humanity, as long as Apollo sends forth his rays of sunshine to the planet Earth.</p>
   <p>Greek democracy returning to its classical home will drive out once and for all a strange, treacherous and murderous family, so as to purify the city of Pallas from the cursings of the Glicksburgs.</p>
   <p>Democracy shall dissolve the low passions and fratricidal hatred always cultivated by Monarchy.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0446.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The greatest law of a country, according to the Ancient Greeks, was the salvation and safety of the homeland. Democracy to-day is the deity, that is able to save our endangered country.</p>
   <p>The monarchy of the Glicksburgs brought so much destruction to Greece, that a legion of devils did they wish to wipe out the country could not bring such disastrous results.</p>
   <p>The Glicksburg dynasty has always considered the Greeks, as a herd of cattle. Queen Olga considered them peasants while Queen Sophia called them pigs in one of her telegrams. It is rather noteworthy that when Olga and Sophia met in Paris, the meeting ended up in a brawl.</p>
   <p>At the time of this dispute they openly discussed the property that belonged to the descendants of Pericles; they both ended up with an exchange of sharp <pb facs="5422062_6_0447.jpg" n="3"/>and vulgar insults and we admit that at this moment these noblewomen spoke the truth.</p>
   <p>The Royalist movement under the leadership of King George and that cowardly assassin Metaxas was repressed with amazing speed and the band of monarchists was defeated by the soldiers of democracy.</p>
   <p>The arrested leaders of this movement were condemned to death, but their leader remains king within the royal stables.</p>
   <p>Monarchy was conquered through fraticidal war, but King George still remains in Athens preparing new devilish plots. While General Pangalos points out to him, that the wind of Democracy is too strong and that within a short while it will become a typhoon that will sweep away the royal stables, he still insists on remaining upon a tottering throne, awaiting the results of an energetic monarchical propaganda.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0448.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>He and his friends have asked for assistance fro all the kings of Europe for his restoration to the throne. Several years ago the premiers of England and France declared, that the return of a king to Greece would bring great national disaster; to-day these same premiers are declaring the opposite.</p>
   <p>The history of civilization does not contain an example of such political depravity, impudence and hypocrisy. On the other hand the servile cabal of the royal stables are pitting their efforts against a liberal vote by the people. General Pangalos has requested this liberal vote, but monarchic propaganda is trying to transfer the privilege of the people to a national convention, so as to forge what the will of the people will never assent to.</p>
   <p>The thing that causes our astonishment is the attitude of Mr. Venizelos, who after allowing so many tragical royal experiments upon the Greek people <pb facs="5422062_6_0449.jpg" n="5"/>has assused the responsibility of becoming the Hercules of the royal stables. Although Mr. Venizelos declared that he is our of politics for the time being he keeps on sending telegrams.</p>
