   <p>p. 1- The Greek community of Chicago, nicknamed "Little Greece of Chicago," is host to the Greek boys who have come here to participate in the Olympic Games.</p>
   <p>The joy of welcome is apparent everywhere. No one can succeed single-handed in reaching the Greek athletes to hug them and shake their hands, for they are always surrounded by a mob of admirers. History is repeating itself. The happy days of ancient Greece are revived in America. The delight, the rejoicing, the emotions of the bygone days of the Olympiads are in full sway again. The Olympic boys are here in America, in "Little Greece of Chicago."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0944.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>They come to participate in the revival of the ancient games, the games that glorified the bodies of ancient Greek youths; and they will endeavor to carry back to Greece the glorious branches of olive and of laurel, thus compelling the modern Greeks to tear down part of the city wall to receive them.</p>
   <p>We wish more power to them. They will undoubtedly capture a wreath or two, but the glory of the past will be captured by American youth. The youth of America to-day, step by step, is approaching the glorious heights of the ancients, and in years to come America will be the heir of all the glory that was Greece. Body and mind are so rapidly developing in America that the grandeur of the past will be outshone, and new heights will be attained.</p>
   <p>O sons of Mother-Greece! Your presence here in America, our adopted country, is a great joy to us all, and with open arms and warm hearts we extend to you a glorious welcome.</p>
