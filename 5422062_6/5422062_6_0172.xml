   <p>p. 1.. We have repeatedly expressed our unfavorable opinion of the Greek. Consulate in Chicago under the management of its Consul General, Mr. George Depasta. We shall continue to bring before the public facts concerning the corrupt practices of our consulate in an effort to rid the Greek community of Chicago of its tyrannical chief. We repeat that Mr. George Depasta, as head of the consulate, has utterly failed to afford the slightest benefit to the Greek population of Chicago or to perform the duties assigned to his office. The Greek Government continues foolishly to expend more than a thousand dollars a month for the maintenance of this consulate.</p>
   <p>We defy any citizen of Chicago to prove to us that Mr. Depasta, as consul general of Greece, has shown the least sign of efficiency in his administration; we promise to publish any such proofs in these columns in the largest type available. Of course we do not invite proof from those who think that the duties of the consul general are confined to authorizing the issue of passports and certificates of title.</p>
   <p>If these clerical formalities are the only duties of the Greek consul general, then the Greek Government need not be put to such expense for the <pb facs="5422062_6_0173.jpg" n="2"/>execution of trivial office work.</p>
   <p>From the date of the establishment of the Greek Consulate in Chicago up to the year 1914, a long period of years, Dr. Salopoulos, who was consul during this time, did not receive one cent from the Greek Government for his consular services; he even paid the salary of his secretary and the rental of his consular office out of his own pocket! The consulate had an income amounting to thousands of dollars, which the Greek Government obtained without incurring any expense !</p>
   <p>But the work of Mr. Salopoulos, as the entire Greed community of Chicago may well recall, was not limited to the usual routine of issuing visas, trustdeeds, and titles and of drawing up contracts; he took part in every movement of the community which was Greek, whether it was religious, patriotic, or national, and he was the initiator of many such movements.</p>
   <p>If we are guilty of the slightest exaggeration in these statements concerning Mr. Salopoulos, we invite any one to contradict them.</p>
   <p>The year 1914 was the first year in which the office of consul-general became a salaried office. The first consul to assume office under this new arrangement <pb facs="5422062_6_0174.jpg" n="3"/>was Mr. Pezas, who was indefatigable in the performance of his duties. He was followed by Mr. K. Xanthopoulos, who took a prominent part in every patriotic movement of our community, and whose activities are still remembered by many Greeks of our city. Mr. Xanthopoulos was succeeded by Mr. Armeriotes, Mr. Matles, and Mr. Mamonas, who were all influential in the affairs of our Greek colony. Mr. Mamonas converted the consulate into a Greek social center. He did not hesitate to welcome social visitors as well as those who came on business.</p>
   <p>We put the question to the entire Greek community of Chicago: Is there the slightest similarity between Mr. Depasta and his predecessors?</p>
   <p>Has Mr. Depasta as consul-general of Greece in this large Greek community done anything outstanding in his entire term of office, anything which has left the faintest impression on the minds of the citizens of Chicago? His only accomplishment, has been so to sequester the Greek consulate from the Greek community of Chicago that the Greeks of Chicago are not even aware that a Greek consulate exists in this city.</p>
   <p>He has played a scandalous part in the dissension in our church, taking sides with the leaders of the dissenting movement. He has scorned the parishes of <pb facs="5422062_6_0175.jpg" n="4"/>the Greek church in our community and has termed "unpatriotic" those persons who recognize the authority of the Holy Synod of Greece instead of submitting to Bishop Philaretos, to whom he blindly adheres.</p>
   <p>He continues to submit false reports and information to the Greek Government concerning the church problem and strives to perpetuate the chaotic condition of our church.</p>
   <p>This in brief is a summary of the achievements of which Mr. Depasta can boast and of the record which he can present to the Greek Community of Chicago! This is the sad state of the Greek Consulate in our city, an admirable record indeed!</p>
   <p>We wonder how long the Greek consulate in Chicago can continue to exist in so deplorable and chaotic a state in our large and flourishing Greek community.</p>
