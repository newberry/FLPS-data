   <p>p. 3 - About a hundred Greeks, armed with guns and clubs and surrounded by a group of bondsmen have stood guard at the fruit store of Pan. Liskas at South Park Avenue and Sixty-third Street since last Wednesday morning, awaiting the arrival of Ant. Tjovanis and his armed braves. Tjovanis has leased the fruit store for $50 a month. It is now occupied by Liskas, who pays only $25 a month. Tjovanis has sent word to Liskas that he is coming to take possession of the place by force if Liskas does not give it up willingly. Liskas, who knows that possession is nine points of the law, has organized his group of a hundred and armed them well and with a score of surety-men ready at hand to secure their release in case of arrests has sent word to Tjovanis to "come and get it."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_1071.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Captain Brown of the Woodlawn station, upon receiving information that the neighborhood had occupied every point of vantage to witness the anticipated Greek battle royal, since he knew by experience that blood will be shed when Greek battle royal, since he knew by experience that blood will be shed when Greek meets Greek, rushed to the scene of operation with twenty picked men and encamped behind the fruit store. The residents of the White City district, in their eagerness to witness an honest to goodness when-Greek-meets-Greek battle, crowded the streets and sidewalks in such numbers that reenforcements were called to maintain order.</p>
   <p>Liskas maintains that his lease does not expire until July 1, while Tjovanis asserts that it expired on May 15.</p>
   <p>Most of the city press in colorful articles has commented with gust on the dispute. The Inter-Ocean says, "Relations between Liskas and Tjovanis are severed. Ultimatums have been served, and the meeting of their opposing armies is imminent. The camps are four parasangs apart. Xenophon should <pb facs="5422062_6_1072.jpg" n="3"/>have been alive today to describe this modern anabasis of the Chicago Greeks.</p>
   <p>The Daily News, which has sent reporters and photographers to the scene of conflict to follow from strategic points the movements of the embattled armies, prints the following:</p>
   <p>"As soon as the defenders of Liskas' fortress were informed by one of their mounted vanguard that the coming enemy was about four parasangs away, they lined up in full panoply to meet them. The opposing Greek armies may meet for a final show-down at any location in Englewood at a time when the officers of the law are offtheir guard. The real strength of the two forces cannot be estimated, without the help of Xenophon.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_1073.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Tjovanis' army, either for strategical reasons or on account of the presence of the blue-coats, has not appeared as yet, but Liskas' warriors, being Greeks and knowing Greeks, are patiently and vigilantly holding the disputed ground. The neighborhood waits eagerly to see the battle of Greek with Greek."</p>
   <p>Editor's note: Fellow Greeks, the colorful and humorous publicity which you and and all of us have obtained by our stupid actions does not reflect to our credit in the eyes of good people. The two disputing Greeks should have been taken their differences before a court of equity and not have resorted to battle and bloodshed. Our community in Chicago, in general, is not benefited by unwise actions of this kind.</p>
   <p>Let us respect ourselves in order to command the respect of others. Our adopted country does not approve of a modern Xenophon's anabasis in Chicago. Let us be wise.</p>
