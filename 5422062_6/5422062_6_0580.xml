   <p>Last Sunday evening the celebration of the victories of the Greek army and the liberation of the enslaved Greeks took place in the Coliseum Annex. The hall was decorated with the large flags of the Allies. At eight P. M. the hall was filled to overflowing.</p>
   <p>After a fine introduction by Mr. Xanthopoulos, Mr. Theodore said a few words about the fatherland and then introduced the orators of the evening.</p>
   <p>The first to speak was Bishop Alexander of St. Rodostolou, who praised the deeds of Venizelos. The Greek towns received their freedom due to Venizelos.</p>
   <p>Mr. Anderson, Bishop of the Episcopalian Church, who had lately visited <pb facs="5422062_6_0581.jpg" n="2"/>Athens, was the second speaker. He praised the hospitality of the Greeks, and expressed the hope that Saint Sofia would be the Metropolis of Orthodoxy. Mr. Barthelemy, Consul of France, spoke next and pointed out the continual and lasting friendship of Greece and France. The Polish Consul voiced the admiration of his country for the Greek spirit and patriotism. Archmandrite [Ambrosia] Mandilaris followed, and reviewed at length the struggles for freedom in which the Greeks had taken part in the past. He said Greece had two bulwarks, the army and Venizelos. Doctor Nap, editor of the Journal in Chicago spoke, saying that Constantinople would be the future Greek capital.</p>
   <p>A dance followed the speeches.</p>
