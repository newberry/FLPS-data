   <p>p. 2.- The Union of Editors in collaboration with the centenary committee has organized in the new Pension Building on Stadium Street an exhibition which presents the evolution of the Greek Press from its origin up to the present time. Almost all the papers which have appeared are exhibited, and it is hoped that this will form the nucleus for the foundation of a permanent museum.</p>
   <p>This exhibition was thought indispensable in connection with the celebrations of the War of Independence, considering that it was the Greek papers that were the medium of awakening a national conscience and stimulating and keeping aglow the love of freedom and liberty.</p>
   <p>The exhibition compromises five sections: Athenian papers, since the days of independence; papers published in Greece, in foreign languages; provincial papers; papers published abroad and papers published before the War of Independence.</p>
   <p>In part from the Christian Science Monitor.</p>
