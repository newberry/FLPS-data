   <p>Demetrios G. Michalopoulos, Supreme Vice-President.- Future generations of Ahepa will look back at Ahepa History from 1928 to 1937 and read of the valuable services rendered to us by Bro. Michalopoulos for the preservation of our great Order and for Hellenism in general. Born in Kipoula, Laconias, Greece, he came to the United States in September, 1909 and after many years of hard work and study was admitted to the Bar at Kansas City, Mo., on July 12, 1920. Joined the Order in 1928 becoming a member of Hellenic Center Chapter No. 202 and the following year was elected President being reelected again in 1930. In the winter of 1931 he transferred to North Shore Chapter No. 94 and in 1932 was elected Chairman of the National Convention of the Order held in Baltimore, Maryland. At the 12th National Convention held at Chicago in 1935 he was elected Supreme Councelor and at St. Paul, Minn. Convention held in 1936 was elected Supreme Vice President for 1936-1937.</p>
   <p>Bro. Michalopoulos is forty-seven years old, married, has one son and resides at 1443 Morse Ave (Rogers Park) in Chicago. He also maintains Law offices at 11 South La Salle Street.</p>
