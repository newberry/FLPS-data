   <p>Mr. John Agriostathis and his lovely wife arrived in Chicago last week and were enthusiastically received by their numerous friends.</p>
   <p>Mr. Agriostathis' sincere patriotism and distinguished services to the Greek people of Chicago are well known. Before he volunteered to go to Greece and fight in the Balkan Wars, two years ago, he took the initiative in organizing an excellent volunteer brigade, which was composed of Greek youths of Chicago. This brigade fought with valour and distinction in the ferrific battles of our fatherland against Turkey and Bulgaria. The outstanding bravery of our young men, with Mr. Agriostathis as commander, received an official army citation. We are proud to say that the young Greek manhood of Chicago has added to the glory of our beloved fatherland.</p>
   <p>No Greek will ever forget what the Chicago Greek Volunteer Brigade did to prove <pb facs="5422062_6_0764.jpg" n="2"/>that the people of Chicago are holding fast to country and faith.</p>
   <p>We are happy to welcome Mr. Agriostathis, the soul and driving force of the brigade, to Chicago and wish him the best of luck.</p>
