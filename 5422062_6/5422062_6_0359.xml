   <p>The Republic of the United States, the country in which we, the Greeks, live, took birth on July 4, 1776. This nation threw off the British King, with all of the nonsense, foolishness and expense that his grafting system of government represented. The intelligent men of that period had too much good, hard, common sense, to maintain and pay for the ridiculous right of keeping up and feeding a worthless monarchy. The United States of America has grown and prospered since the day these courageous pioneers of America wrote the immortal and famous doctrine known all over the earth as the "Declaration of Independence." This story is familiar to every enlightened school boy the world over.</p>
   <p>Yet in the face of this fact, in the fact of the tremendous success of this government, there appears in this city, in open newspapers, a statement coming from a young inexprienced man, boldly saying that he is only temporarily separated from his divine right. The divine and absolute right and privilege to rule the Greeks. He even said, that the right belongs exclusively to his family.</p>
   <p>God in heaven, do we, in this enlightened and intelligent great country, <pb facs="5422062_6_0360.jpg" n="2"/>have to submit to such brazen affrontery? Doesn't this stupid visitor and his advisers, if he has any, know that this is very dangerous; doesn't he know that he is trespassing upon our hospitality, when he gives vent to his stupid and mischievious utterances? Doesn't he realize he is a visitor in a Republic? That the American people who made this country free for all to live in are unalterably opposed to self seeking, and self styled princes and kings? Is it because of blood relationship that this man resembles in attitude his crazy and fanatical relative, the insane Kaiser, that monstrous murderer? How can this little fool come to Chicago and install himself in a hotel, posing like a clown with a monocle? Ye Gods! How can he have the nerve to beguile and fool his trusting Greek supporters, the poor misguided and gullible Greeks? Thanks to God that the biggest part of our community doesn't fall for such silly nonsense!</p>
   <p>Oh, Greeks, don't you know yet, that you live in the Republic of America? I don't doubt that in the crowd that calls on this boy, at the Blackstone Hotel, there are follow Greeks who have taken out their naturalization papers, throwing off their allegiance to Kings, potentates, and princes. For God's sake, do they want their American friends and the rest of the Greeks to know that they don't mean what they swore to, when they took their oath, to follow only the Republican <pb facs="5422062_6_0361.jpg" n="3"/>Constitution of these United States? Do these few Greeks think they can live in America, and foster, and encourage a Monarchical system of government for another country?</p>
   <p>Shame on you fellow Greeks, shame. You, the Greeks of Chicago, to stand around, and bow down, and worship and follow, an inexperienced boy, impudently shouting that he and his family have the exclusive right to rule Greece. Don't you know that the Republic of Greece is now a living, breathing thing, commanding the confidence and respect of the civilized world? Don't you know that the outraged people of Greece rose up in their majesty and drove this royal grafting crowd out of our country forever?</p>
   <p>The day of Kings is doomed. Intelligence rules now in the world. Oh! brother Greeks of Chicago, be wise. Solon was one of us, Pericles another; open your books and read about them. You can't fool the Americans, they are intelligent. For the sake of common sense, don't attempt to build up propaganda here, as the government at Washington might take notice of you.</p>
   <p>The Republic of Greece is on friendly terms with the American government, <pb facs="5422062_6_0362.jpg" n="4"/>don't rock the boat of that friendship. Tell this boy to go and get a job and become a useful man; tell him that you are under the mighty flag of freedom and liberty; tell him that hard work and American ideas will help him to cure the psychological disease that he is troubled with; the psychological disease of the divine rights of his family, to own the Greeks.</p>
   <p>My dear Greeks of Chicago, stand up and be real honest men. Down with Royalty, down with all the miseries and troubles, that these self-seeking fakers are trying to put over on you. Show that you are American Greeks; America doesn't stand for any silly thing called Royalty. Brother Greeks, do not tolerate any more of this bold brazen and audacious utterance of this youngster, who is so self assured of his divine right to rule, that he doesn't respect the rights of mere common humanity, but like a giant leech, he attempts to fasten himself upon the backs of some of our admiring and trusting Greeks. He takes advantage of that confidence, abuses every privilege, dishonors every trust, violates all the laws of God and man and cooly and calmly tells us that I have the divine right to rule the Greeks. Oh! American Greeks, come to yourselves and follow and bow to your American flag, the symbol of liberty and everything that is good in the world, instead of bowing to this son of decayed Royalty.</p>
