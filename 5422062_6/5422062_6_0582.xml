<title level="a">THE POSITION OF THE GREEKS IN THE ELECTION BATTLES OF AMERICA</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The coming elections touch upon and will influence the internal condition of the country--the business world, wages and hours, cost of living, and most important to us, the attitude of America to Greece. At some other time we will discuss the influence of the elections upon the internal condition of the country. Now we are chiefly interested in determining which choice [of candidates] will result in the most benefit for the Greeks in general.</p>
   <p>It is necessary that we examine the past actions of the candidates in order to discover their attitudes in the Bulgarian-Turkish-Albanian situation. We must know if those who have opposed us are still opposing us. We know the instigators of the antipathy toward the Greeks. They are the missionaries and professors of the American schools in the East. Despite all efforts, they <pb facs="5422062_6_0583.jpg" n="2"/>remain our enemies and fight us at every opportunity. They are responsible for the change of heart of the American representative in Paris, who changed from a philhellene to a "Bulgarophil" or even a "Turkophil" [Editor's note: "Turkophil" and "Bulgarophil" are improvised words meaning friend of the Turks or Bulgars.] It is known that our enemies in the White House are Cleveland Dodge, treasurer of the Robertiou school, and Charles Crane, treasurer of the American school at Korutsa.</p>
   <p>The President, religious and impressionable, believed everything told him by the missionaries who were Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Methodists, and believed the Greek information to be false. The President, by believing these enemies of the Greeks, did more to damage our struggle than anything else.</p>
   <p>Let us see which candidate, because of his religious beliefs, will hurt us if elected. Harding is a Baptist, and Cox is an Episcopalian. The Baptists <pb facs="5422062_6_0584.jpg" n="3"/>believe, as do the friends of the President, the Presbyterians, and they are looking out for the interests of the schools and the missions in the Near East; they work hand in glove with Crane. We must not give them the opportunity of fighting us from within the White House.</p>
   <p>Cox, as an Episcopalian, is not so influenced by religious pressure. We have proof that the Episcopalian Church respects our Orthodox Church. During the entire War the highest officials of the Episcopalian Church fought unceasingly for Greek rights, and protested against the Turks being allowed to enter Constantinople. They signed, by the thousands, petitions demanding that Thrace, Ipiros, and Mikrasia be given back to Greece.</p>
   <p>Our bitterest enemy will be unable to harm us through his efforts in the White House if we elect Cox as president. Instead of enemies, we shall have the friendly Episcopalian Church defending our interests in the White House.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0585.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Soon, we all feel, there will be trouble between Greece and Italy. Which of the two candidates will protect Greece? Harding will, of course, wish to protect Greece, but he will not wish to incur the wrath of the missionaries in whom he and the present President have faith. However, even if he has the courage to incur the wrath of the missionaries, will he have the courage to displease the Italo-American citizens, who are ardent Republicans and are much more numerous than we? They are politically and socially better organized than the Greeks .....</p>
   <p>These things are of major importance and should be seriously considered by all the Greek voters. Don't forget that all the Italians will go to the polls with the purpose in mind of overthrowing the Democratic party. They believe that the Republican party will help Italy hold Rodos.</p>
   <p>What should we do about it? Each Greek patriot should think things over and then decide.</p>
