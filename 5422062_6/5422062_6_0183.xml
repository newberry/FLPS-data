<title level="a">THE LATEST SCANDALOUS EFFORTS OF MR. G. DEPASTA.</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

   <p>p. 1-In spite of the warnings which the consul general of Greece, Mr. G. Depasta, has received to cease to intermeddle in our church affairs and to take the side of one faction against another, he persists in his scandalous tactics and has made the Greek consulate the center of propaganda in support of Bishop Philaretos and his Rhodostolic Church.</p>
   <p>Mr. Depasta has made desperate efforts to persuade the North Side parish of our city to break away from the United Parish Union of Chicago and to recognize Philaretos as its leader; he has gone so far as to employ fraudulent methods to achieve his purpose and has brought before the public a forged telegraphic communication from the premier of Greece, Mr. Venixelos, which supposedly was a reply to Mr. Depasta, and in which the premier expressed his approval of the aim of the consul. This supposed cable was proved to be false, however, because it originated in Athens when Mr. Venizelos happened to be in Rome.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0184.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr.Depasta succeeded by these fraudulent tactics in persuading the administrative body of the North Side Parish to recognize Philaretos as its leader. This victory was short-lived, however, for after the fraud had been discovered, a large meeting of members of the parish was called, which uproariously repudiated Mr. Depasta's scheme. In spite of this failure to accomplish his designs on the North Side parish Mr. Depasta is continuing his scandalous tactics by attempting to persuade another parish of our community to join his cause and recognize the authority of his bishop. He has forgotten that he is the consul general of Greece in Chicago, and that it is not his business to meddle with the church affairs of our community and to attempt to disunite our parishes by taking the side of one faction against another.</p>
   <p>We believe that it is time for Greece to recall from our city the man who is the sole reason why the Greeks of Chicago have lost all interest in the consulate of Greece, and who has terminated all intercourse and every relationship which existed between our large Greek community and the Greek nation.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0185.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We have repeatedly published in our columns the exploits of Mr. Depasta and his scandalous intermeddling in our ecclesiastical affairs, and we have endeavored to guide our consul in the proper direction, but unfortunately all our efforts have been in vain. We firmly believe that it is now the duty of the Greek community of Chicago to employ means to remove him from office and to put in his place a man who fully understands the duties of a consul general and will perform them.</p>
