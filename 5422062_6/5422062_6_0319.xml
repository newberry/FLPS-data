   <p>Life and attitude of the ancients, compared with the moderns.</p>
   <p>In the VI century B. C., Heilon, the Spartan, was the most conspicuous among the seven illustrious philosophers of Greece. He was distinguished for the brevity of his philosophic mind. He lived the life of the philosophy he advocated. Many philosophers, although they speak wisdom live a life of ignorance. The wise counsels of this philosopher are masterpieces, and for twenty five centuries, like shining stars, they have guided the human race on the road of Virtue and culture.</p>
   <p>"Know thyself". If every one of us strives to know himself, humanity today shall have a high level of civilization. If we are able to know and conquer the diseases of the soul, through virtue and culture, we shall have happiness.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0320.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Mithen Agan". Man, should be moderate all his life, excess and abuse leads to tragedy and ridicule.</p>
   <p>The ancient Greeks during the "Golden Ages" applied the "Mithen Agan" not only in their living, but in good acts. Thus, in music they had rhythm, in architecture and sculpture they had analogy. Humanity today, goes to extremes, especially in the United States.</p>
   <p>"Utter not an evil word against your neighbors". Very few of us follow this wise counsel of heilon. "Run more quickly to your friend's misfortune, than to his happiness." However today, we do the opposite. Many go quickly to the prosperous, and flatterers are at the head of this line. Those in distress are usually forgotten.</p>
   <p>"Threaten no one". To threaten is feminine, is what Heilon means here.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0321.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Respect and honor old age". The ancient Spartans honored and respected the old men. Today, we see youth having utter disregard for the old ones and very frequently ignoring their parents.</p>
   <p>"Do not let the tongue go before the thought". Many of us, speak without thinking, we prate and become silly.</p>
   <p>"Wish not the impossible". Many people desire and wish impossible things, seek shadows and become unhappy.</p>
   <p>"Speaking, move not the hand, such gestures belong to maniacs". When you speak don't move the hand as its a characteristic of lunacy. Some of us not only move the hands, when speaking, but feet also.</p>
   <p>"Hate not the Oracles" The ancient Greeks believed in oracles, and worshiped Apollo as the patron god of oracles. The Delphic Oracle, was Panhellenic, and its priests (Mantis) were highly esteemed Kalhas and Tiresias were the most illustrious in history.</p>
