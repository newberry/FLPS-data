   <p>Truly, we cannot understand how it is possible for people to exist who, in good faith, follow the betrayers of their country, against their country's benefactor, Venizelos.</p>
   <p>Any action taken against Venizelos at this crucial time is a knife thrust into the Fatherland. The slightest opposition is unforgivable treason--not to Venizelos, but to Greece. Who, then, would be a criminal and lift his hand against his mother country?</p>
   <p>Let us put things in their proper places. Let us examine the situation without prejudice. Be patient and follow our outline of past and present events in a sincere manner.</p>
   <p>When the World War was declared, Greece found herself at the crossroads.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0600.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>One led to Venizelos and the other to King Constantine. Which was the better? Perhaps at that time there was reason for the existence of doubt and strong dissension. Surely it is impossible that now, in the face of the numerous patriotic labors and sacrifices of Venizelos, there should exist people so blind as to refuse to see that his policies were the only ones for the Greek nation. What would Greece have gotten if she had followed King Constantine? That is the question we ask of those who lament the fact that Greece did not get Trapezounta, Odessa or Petroupolis. What would we have received if Greece had not entered the war on the side of the Allies?</p>
   <p>They tell us that Constantine tried to fool the Entente by entering the war at the last minute. But it is hard to believe that a babe-in-arms could outsmart two clever foxes like Lloyd George and Clemenceau. The Entente wanted us for our aid, and not for the purpose of our assistance in dividing the spoils of the War.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0601.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If you Greeks in America wish to become known as patriots, you must perform one duty--enlighten your neighbors, here and in Greece; emphasize the fact that it is their duty to uphold and support Venizelos..... You, that are far enough from your homeland to have a good perspective of the situation over there are the best critics of the program of Venizelos--and your voices cannot but be heard. Venizelos is only one man. He cannot do everything by himself. No matter how great a general may be, he can win no battles unless he has an army. You must become his soldiers, the soldiers of your fatherland!</p>
