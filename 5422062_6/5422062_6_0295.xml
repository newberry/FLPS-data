   <p>The wonder of the refugees' restoration in Greece, was not known to brother-Greeks in America, who, day and night were praying for the salvation of their beloved ones of Asia Minor.</p>
   <p>The restoration work of Greece, is a cosmo-historical event depicting the vitality and mutual assistance of the Greek race. For the benefit and enlightenment of the Greeks of America we publish excerpts of the Bulletin of the Bank of Athens.</p>
   <p>Four years ago one million and five hundred thousand refugees were brought to the shores of Greece. The misery and suffering of those myriads of refugees can not be fully written. The aspect was heart-breaking.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0296.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>They were human shadows. The unforgetable picture of horror cannot be dramatized. The eye and tongue could not portray the holocaust of Asia Minor. The Greek race, in time, to come will avenge the atrocity.</p>
   <p>The whole world could not believe that this number of human wrecks could be saved from certain death, and that poor and small Greece could bear the burden of restoration. Indeed, it was unbelievable.</p>
   <p>The whole world was in error; because the colossal wealth of the Greek soul was not known; the oceans of Greek will; and the demon-like spirit of the Greek race. The humanly impossible, was shown to be possible by small but immortal Greece.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0297.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The mother country lovingly opened her arms and embraced her dispersed sons with "Oh, my sons and orphans." The mother country in spite of being physically and economically exhausted, exposed bosom and fed her dying sons, victims of the infidel Turk. She gave them all she had and borrowed anything she did not have. The population of Greece divided with the refugees their shelter, their stale bread, and with a cheering word and song made them feel that they were the sons of one family.</p>
   <p>The committee of restoration appointed by the League of Nations, for the negotiation of a loan for the refugees (which we pay today without a groan), contributed very much in assisting Greece to nurse back to life the skeleton-like fugitives. The superhuman vitality of Greece began to flourish in every part of the land. Houses were built, villages and towns were established, land was distributed to the refugees, cultivation and production began and the strength of the Greek blood was apparent everywhere. So Greece surprised the whole world with the metamorphosis of the refugees. Indeed it was a miracle.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0298.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Today, the 1,500,000 refugees are established citizens of Greece, and a great productive factor in the welfare of the land. Among the many communities, which have sprung up during the work of restoration, is the New Ionia. A city of 16,00 inhabitants and 3,000 homes. A real city, with wide streets, small plazas, beautiful market place, seventy-five stores, schools, churches, drug stores, clinics, a restaurant with bar and dancing, police station and thirteen factories, eight of them making rugs and tapestries.</p>
   <p>The mother country and the mother of civilization, not only took care of Greek refugees, but also of thousand of Armenians who were taken away from the holocaust of Asia Minor. The restored refugees with the Greek population sing with pathos "Who can doubt the courage and vitality of the Greeks, in years to come, that which was Greek will become Greek again."</p>
   <p>Indeed the super-human work of restoring the refugees, was a wonder to the world. Greece did it.</p>
