<title level="a">ATHENS' CITY HALL RECEIVES "GAPANS" UNITED STATES MINISTER DELIVERS SPEECH</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Owing to the friendly relations between the United States and Greece, and the furtherance we are compelled to write this article depicting the sentiments of the populace of Greece and of the Greek authorities, towards Greek-Americans and Americans in general.</p>
   <p>The city hall of Athens bedecked with the banners of the two countries and surrounded by a cordon of picturesque guards was prepared for the coming of the Gapans. The Mayor of Athens Mr. Merkoures, heading the civil authorities of the capital, gladly received the visiting Gapans and delivered a eulogistic speech emphasizing the love of the Greek-Americans towards their mother Greece, and the perpetuation of Greek traditions by Greeks irrespective of their habitation in other countries.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0132.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Mayor in very sincere phraseology expressed the gratitude of the Greek people to the United States, and in a very emotional tone brought out the many instances of American generosity, and philanthropy towards Greece. The thousands of people who stormed the City Hall for the occasion cheered so enthusiastically that the presentation of the next distinguished speaker was delayed for many minutes before Mr. Merkoures presented the Hon. Skinner, United States Minister of Greece. The enthused Greeks honoring and appreciating the presence of the American diplomat, became as attentive and quiet as if they were in a church.</p>
   <p>The distinguished American said, "My friends, it was with great pleasure that I accepted the kind invitation of the Mayor to participate in the ceremony of your reception to the Gapans. I assured him that your presence here as soldiers of this great Order is not so militaristic as it appears, because you came from a very peaceful land, which land right now endeavors to do anything humanly possible to induce the world to disarm. The only war-like object you have in mind is to capture the hearts of charming girls and carry them to America as your brides. To that extent you have my approval and cooperation.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0133.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"I also reiterate that which I have often said that the American people are rejoicing in the thought, that the Greek Americans love their mother country, and the more they love Greece, the more useful and better American citizens they become. Who does not love Greece? The American political structure is, to a great extent, of a Greek origin.</p>
   <p>"You came in time to participate in the celebration of the centennial of Greek independence. You have the right to observe the past century with pride and satisfaction. For who can dispute the greatness of this accomplishment? No other country, under the same circumstances, would have made as much progress as Greece.</p>
   <p>"When you go back to America tell our people there that Greece is blooming and forging her way to greater progress and achievements. Tell the whole American people to turn their eyes towards Greece, for soon she will shine as a morning star on the horizon of mankind.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0134.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"You, the soldiers of this Order, are congratulated for initiating excursions of this kind, which tend to maintain the friendly relations between the people of the two countries."</p>
   <p>The speaker thanked the Mayor for the invitation, and for the good and sincere words he had said pertaining to the United States of America.</p>
   <p>The crowd, not knowing English but knowing that the speaker was the American Minister, raised a frenzied acclamation and for several minutes thundering hurrahs for America reverberated. The sentiment of the people was unmistakably expressed. If there is a country that really loves America, that country is Greece.</p>
   <p>Long live Greece, and long live America.</p>
