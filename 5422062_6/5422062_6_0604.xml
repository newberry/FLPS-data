   <p>A Chicago evening paper had printed in some past issue the following paragraph:</p>
   <p>"The mountains look on Marathon and Marathon looks on the sea, And musing there an hour alone I dreamt that Greece might still be free."</p>
   <p>With these words did Lord Byron express his heart's feelings for the struggle of Greece for freedom. And he spoke with prophetic words....for Greece is Free!</p>
   <p>The spirit of Thermopylae has triumphed. It was not possible to keep it buried forever, under the deceit, treachery and degeneration of the politicians. Greece, again lifts her Banner of Glory through the smoke of the gunfire. The <pb facs="5422062_6_0605.jpg" n="2"/>top of Mount Olympus again sees the dawn of a new day.</p>
   <p>Those, who are familiar with the history of Greece, were not surprised at the bravery of her sons, nor startled by their unceasing fight for freedom.</p>
   <p>The consciousless German Dynasty, with its close connection with the throne of Greece, made every effort to keep her in subjugation. They promised, and then refuted their promises. They used their money to spread their propaganda in our country. They poisoned the wells of truth. They spread dissent and misery among her people.</p>
   <p>They used the woman at the side of our king, to urge and influence him, against the rights and privileges of the people. She influenced him to forget his glorious heritage and follow the path of tyranny and hate.</p>
   <p>He, then, forgot his royal prestige, and became an organ of Kaiserism. He <pb facs="5422062_6_0606.jpg" n="3"/>broke the promises he had made to the Allies, and he trod upon his country's policies.</p>
   <p>But, throughout the world and chiefly here in the United States, there existed Greeks who had not forgotten the glorious history of their country, and who had remained faithful to the ideology of freedom and truth, which are synonomous with the Golden Age of Greece.</p>
   <p>The American Greeks are proud to have served in the American army, and 7,500 from Chicago alone, served their adopted country.</p>
   <p>And the brave men fighting in Greece for their country's freedom, appealed to the Allied armies for help.</p>
   <p>"Let the head that is shackled, nod, and we come--we come to free its bonds."</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0607.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>These words of Byron were brought to life. The chained and bowed head existed. Venizelos, steeped in the spirit of freedom, and loving his country, above all other things, brilliant, big-hearted, strong spirited, proclaimed that, "the hour had come."</p>
   <p>If the voice of this fiery patriot had been heard, instead of that of the king, there would have not existed such a period of doubt, distrust, and Teutonic tyranny. Greece would have emerged from the War a calm and happy state.</p>
   <p>However, the opponents of Venizelos were powerful. He was not able to conquer them, but he did not lose his courage; his enemies discovered he was a man, who could not be bought, or bribed to desist.</p>
   <p>He appealed to the people, and their answer was a great majority in his behalf. The king was against the people, and prevented Venizelos from carrying out the <pb facs="5422062_6_0608.jpg" n="5"/>will of the people.</p>
   <p>There was no other choice for Venizelos. Braving the wrath of a monarch and the power of Germany, he raised the flag of revolt and called the people to follow him.</p>
   <p>Despite the barriers set in his path, despite the fear and doubt of others, Venizelos gathered 60,000 soldiers to his standard and made headquarters in Salonika.</p>
   <p>No one can imagine the sacrifices these men made for freedom. They renounced their homes, relations, and careers; they underwent hardships for the privilege of fighting and dying for Greece and freedom.</p>
   <p>Honor To Them! Let us inscribe the names of these 60,000 men in the annals of the world. Names of men who did not sell their honor, who could not be <pb facs="5422062_6_0609.jpg" n="6"/>traitors to justice, men who valued these above life itself.</p>
   <p>The torch of truth was kept lit in Salonika, in the midst of the darkness of that period; but the effort seemed to be in vain.</p>
   <p>Then came the Russian Revolution. The Tsar was dethroned. The only Power in the Allies' Council which had fought against the support of Venizelos was dissolved in one night. And, at last, help came to the 60,000 soldiers. King Constantine was exiled; with him went his wife.</p>
   <p>It was a great day for Greece.....Venizelos, a native of Crete, and a true Greek, returned to Athens to lead not the 60,000--but the entire country.</p>
   <p>In Athens, he discovered a pitiful situation. The enemies and foreigners had left naught but destruction. The neglected army and the looting of the valuables of Greece, would have discouraged a smaller man than he.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0610.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>With herculean spirit he undertook a task worthy of a Hercules. He reorganized the army and restored order.</p>
   <p>America made generous loans to him because she had faith in the Greek honor.</p>
   <p>The 60,000 were increased to 300,000 fortified with the spirit of liberation.</p>
   <p>In the records of the Great War there is evidence of the bravery of this army. "The glory which was Greece, has become the Glory which is Greece."</p>
   <p>It fought the Bulgarians valiantly and made them retreat to the mountains.</p>
   <p>This caused the Teutonic Colossus to kneel. All hope of conquering the Allies vanished when the news became known.</p>
   <p>Is it possible for America to forget Greece? No!--as long as books exist which <pb facs="5422062_6_0611.jpg" n="8"/>recount the victories of the Greeks, within and outside of her borders.</p>
   <p>Nor can the girls and children, who suffered such atrocities at the hands of the Turks, be forgotten. The thousands of Greeks who were sold as slaves by the Turks and Albanians; the thousands that were exiled, they can not be forgotten.</p>
   <p>All these things were suffered by the Greeks, because they were fighting for the same purpose as that of America. America will not forget.</p>
   <p>If there exists any justice, the Crescent over Constantinople must be replaced by the Cross. The glory of democracy must reign supreme. The name of Venizelos should be placed in the Roll of Heroes, and command the respect of the World.</p>
