   <p>p. 1.-- In view of the dethronement of King Constantine and the establishment of the Liberal National Government in Greece, Loxias, as the voice of the right-thinking Greeks of America, appeals to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece to revoke the decoration of the Golden Cross of the Savior, which was bestowed upon Solon Vlastos, publisher of Atlantis, by the court-serving Government of Greece, dominated by the dethroned king.</p>
   <p>To the Minister of Foreign Affairs,</p>
   <p>Athens, Greece.</p>
   <p>Honorable Sir: Loxias, representing the opinion of the right-thinking Greeks in America, takes the liberty of informing you that the counterfeit of a man, unfortunately a Greek, named Solon Vlastos, living a life of failure and sin in New York, succeeded, under the regime of his fellow-countryman Skouloudis, in obtaining the decoration of the Golden Cross of the Savior for unpatriotic services which he rendered to that equally counterfeit Government of Skouloudis's, which was the tool of the dethroned king.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0693.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We, the Greeks of America, knowing that politics forced Mother-Greece to bestow such an honor on this undeserving Solon Vlastos, and that the present Government of Greece represents the true policy of state and has for its basic purpose to undo the wrongs wrought by the previous Constantinian Government and to redeem and purify Greece of such creatures and their doings, appeal to you to revoke this honor bestowed upon the aforesaid Solon Vlastos. And in corroboration of our appeal we herewith enclose a copy of certain court proceedings of New York, which shows by its contents the real character of the aforesaid Solon Vlastos.</p>
   <p>Hoping, for the sake of our Mother-Greece's dignity, that our appeal will be heeded, we respectfully and gratefully are</p>
   <p>Loxias of Chicago.</p>
  </body>
