   <p>Had it been possible for the Greeks of America to realize the effectiveness of mass-meetings and protest against the crimes committed by Turkish barbarity, there is no doubt whatever that all Greek communities would have transformed themselves into heralds of the Turkish atrocities before the American public.</p>
   <p>It appears, however, that the great effectiveness of this form of expression has not yet been realized by us, Greek-Americans. We have not so far seen fit to do what ought long ago to have been done spontaneously and without urging.</p>
   <p>The press, whose duty it is to show the necessity of such action, does nothing else, day in and day out, but sow the seeds of discord, endeavoring by its sinister activity to distort facts and truth for the sake of its partisan and personal interests.</p>
   <p>Our suspicious attitude and our lack of even the slightest confidence in one another have gone so far as to make understanding and co-operation impossible. The <pb facs="5422062_6_0546.jpg" n="2"/>situation is becoming tragic and is paralyzing all our powers.</p>
   <p>And just at the moment when our help is needed, and the course is wide open for a great national work, we are found unfit not only to take any common action, but even to think of rendering our services to our country in its hour of greatest need.</p>
   <p>Our mental vision has become so obscure that it is impossible for us any longer to believe that we are able to do anything ourselves or to render any service to our country. And yet it is necessary at this very moment for all sound elements among us to concentrate all their force and by a violent effort shake off the lethargy into which we have sunk, showing what we can do, and what services we can render.</p>
   <p>We firmly believe in the vitality of the Greek people and expect this move on its part, and we have no doubt that they realize and feel what they must do. Hence we always appeal to the Greek people of America, and especially today do we appeal to their patriotic sentiments for the success of the grand mass-meeting which is to <pb facs="5422062_6_0547.jpg" n="3"/>be held next Sunday. By the success of this gathering we shall greatly benefit our nation in the struggle which it is carrying on today.</p>
   <p>The various committees and sub-committees are merely tools for the preparation of this meeting. It is the people,who by their numbers, will make the impression and bring about the expected result.</p>
   <p>Appealing again to the Greek people of Chicago, we say that no mass-meeting of all those so far organized has been of greater value and importance than that which will take place next Sunday.</p>
   <p>If this object is realized, and the Coliseum overflows with 10,000 Greeks next Sunday, the Greek population of Chicago will deserve the warmest congratulations and the heartiest applause, and it ought rightly to be proud of the accomplishments which will naturally ensue.</p>
