   <p>Yesterday I had the doubtful honor of talking with a fanatical royalist of our Greek community. For some reason or other these royalists seem to think that they are unknown. They do not dare to step in premises that are known to be Venizelic....The man I spoke to is a proprietor of a shoe-shining and hat-cleaning establishment. He is of the type who derives a great deal of pleasure from the cultivation of his large, twisted mustache which he protects as if it were a sacred relic.</p>
   <p>I do not know what sort of a sickness fate holds in store for me, but God preserve me from being cursed with raising thick mustachios in a country like America; for surely a man must have something wrong with him in order to do so. Because everyone else was busy the proprietor came to wait upon me himself. I seated myself in the chair, and as I did so my eyes fell upon a small button <pb facs="5422062_6_0613.jpg" n="2"/>pinned on the proprietor's waistcoat, which bore a picture of Constantine. I confess that I pitied him, for despite the fact that he lived in America, he continued to be a slave. A slave of rusted and antiquated customs, and a mental slave!</p>
   <p>I am not going to write about the social drawbacks of this man; I am going to point out the logic of the royalists, who struggle to....save Greece. Mr. "Mustachio" looked me over before he began his task and said:</p>
   <p>"It's cold today, Mister."</p>
   <p>"Yes", I answered in Greek, "It is very cold."</p>
   <p>"What," said he, "You are a Greek?"</p>
   <p>"You looked closely enough at me to discover that," I answered.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0614.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Well," he said, "I did not see you wearing a button and so I did not recognize you."</p>
   <p>"What button are you referring to?"</p>
   <p>"This button," and he pointed to his waistcoat, "of the king." And without realizing it he blackened the face of the king with his soiled finger, making the picture resemble the king's face all the more.</p>
   <p>"I had a button," I said, "but I have misplaced it."</p>
   <p>"You lost it," he answered, in a horror-stricken voice. "Are you not ashamed for having done so? Do you not blush at having lost the picture of our poor martyred king? Look here," he continued, and unbuttoned his waistcoat to display another button attached to his shirt.</p>
   <p>"I am sorry for losing the button," I replied, "but I am going to get another <pb facs="5422062_6_0615.jpg" n="4"/>I am told that they have become more expensive; since they now sell for a nickel a piece, while previously they were three for five cents."</p>
   <p>"Patriotism is expensive," he answered, "but it is worth it."</p>
   <p>"Undoubtedly", I said, "It is worth spending a nickel to buy a king."</p>
   <p>When he had finished shining my shoes, this man, who was starved for royalist conversation, ascended the seat next to me and asked: "From where are you, patriot?"</p>
   <p>"From Polis [Constantinople]," I answered.</p>
   <p>"From Polis? Poor Polis that we have lost along with our king," said my royalist friend with a sigh.</p>
   <p>"Did we lose Polis alone? We have also lost Smyrna, Thrace, Macedonia, and <pb facs="5422062_6_0616.jpg" n="5"/>Crete."</p>
   <p>"You must be mistaken", he said, "because Theotokis took Crete."</p>
   <p>"You are right", I answered, "oh, but that he had not taken her; because Venizelos would have been a Turk, and would not have chased away our king and made him a martyr."</p>
   <p>I had so impressed my mustachioed royalist, that if I had had the inclination, he would have sold me his whole store for thirty-five cents.</p>
   <p>"The king should have stayed in Athens a month longer, and then we would have gotten back the Eptanisa and Crete," he replied.</p>
   <p>"It is better that he did not," I retorted, "for if he had done so,he would not be a martyr!"</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0617.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>"I hear him called a martyr, and so I call him one. Can you tell me why the king is so called?" asked my friend.</p>
   <p>I had to make an end to this conversation, which made me doubt the intelligence of this type of royalist, and so I said:</p>
   <p>"They call him a martyr, because he will be a witness at the trial of Gounaris, Theotoki, Streit...." [Translator's note: The Greek word for martyr may also mean witness.]</p>
   <p>"Who are you," yelled the man in anger, "that you criticize the king?"</p>
   <p>But before he could even twirl his mustache, I had leaped into a passing street-car, and from there I called to him and said, "I am a patriot."</p>
