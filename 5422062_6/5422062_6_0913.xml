   <p>P.3--As the Star predicted, and the organizers anticipated, the national meeting of Greeks of Chicago and the surrounding territory was a brilliant success. Greek sentiment and patriotic enthusiasm were fully revealed by the throngs who responded to the call of Mother-Greece. The object of the meeting was to gather the people together and announce the call of Mother-Greece and also to authorize committees to solicit contributions for the national defense.</p>
   <p>The Hon. Dr. N. Salopoulos, Chicago Consul General of Greece, opened the meeting with a patriotic speech that electrified the crowd. The veteran diplomat in his usual mellifluous phrases said:</p>
   <p>"The eyes of our beloved Greece are hopefully turned toward the Greeks of America not only for material assistance but for moral fortification as well. The word "Greek-American" is little by little becoming a national hope, and I, as a representative of Greece, came to this meeting to make you hear the sweet imploring voice of our beloved native land. Who will <pb facs="5422062_6_0914.jpg" n="2"/>turn a deaf ear to the mother of civilization? America in the past, when Greece was struggling for independence, proved her sympathy and affection. And the Greeks of America to-day are revealing their sentiment, their patriotic enthusiasm, and their filial love for Greece. The crowd in this meeting, which represents every station of life, is evidence that her sons will never turn a deaf ear to their mother-country."</p>
   <p>Other speakers in the meeting were the Reverend Mr. Pegeas, Dr. K. Kalliondjis, R. N. Karalopoulos, and P. S. Lambros, publisher of the Star, whose addresses we print on other pages.</p>
   <p>The organizers of the meeting were Dr. N. Salopoulos, Dr. A. J. Sanitsas, Dr. Ch. Petrulas, Dr. K. Kalliondjis, and Mr. K. Karalopoulos. They worked hard to accomplish the meeting's magnificent success.</p>
   <p>Committees were appointed which will solicit contributions from Greeks in Chicago and the suburbs.</p>
