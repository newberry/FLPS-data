   <p>On August 15, the day that the annual celebration of the Assumption of the Holy Virgin was held, a small sum was contributed toward the building of a National Greek fleet. This sum was collected at the picnic which was held on the same day in Jackson Park, at 67th Street and Stony Island Avenue. A huge number of Greeks attended this picnic after attending elaborate and magnificent religious ceremonies at our Greek cathedral church.</p>
   <p>In comparison to the greatness of the Greek Community of Chicago, the sum of only one hundred dollars, which was realized for such a great cause, was insignificant.</p>
   <p>The reason why we mention this is to remind ourselves that three years ago we succeeded in gathering the considerable amount of $3,000 which was <pb facs="5422062_6_0876.jpg" n="2"/>sent to Greece in behalf of the Greek Navy. Let us compare our interest and efforts then with those of today. We can name many other much smaller Greek communities in Illinois and in the United States which have contributed much more than we have.</p>
   <p>It is not hard to understand why our national sentiment has become dull. Are not disunion and strife within our community and in our church affairs responsible for this lag and cooling down of our enthusiasm and zeal to do our very best to support great national causes?</p>
   <p>Let us take the Greeks of Pensacola, Florida for comparison. In a very short time, after a lecture and social affair, these people contributed the sum of $400 in the drive to build new warships for the Greek fleet. We admire and praise the spontaneous, patriotic, and generous response of the Greeks of Pensocola. Mr. Spiro A. Kotakis, who is the well known <pb facs="5422062_6_0877.jpg" n="3"/>traveling agent and correspondent of The Star throughout the United States, addressed the Greeks of Pensacola in the social gathering which was held, inspiring them with his eloquent and patriotic appeal to give as much as possible for the glory of Greece. Now, why is it that the Greeks of a small community have more strongly developed patriotic sentiments and ideals? Cannot the huge numbers of our Chicago Greeks do as well? We are sure they can.</p>
