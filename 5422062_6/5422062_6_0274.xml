   <p>p.2-The Chicago Greek Star in its issue of June 24 published an article by its publisher and editor, Mr.Lambros, with the caption "Advice to the Laconian Deputy,Mr. D. Petrakakos." Mr. Lambros, as is known, get his information from the telegrams sent by the Greek Assembly to the five Chicago parishes, and he discusses Mr.Petrakakos's speech in the Assembly in which the deputy made a scathing attack on the Greek consul general in Chicago, Mr.Depasta.This attack on Mr.Depasta, Mr. Lambros says, is considered scandalous by the Chicago parishes and detrimental to the unity of our populous Greek community.</p>
   <p>On the whole, Mr.Lambros in his article deprecates the attack made against the Mr.Bepasta's lamentable record by Deputy Petrakakos, who is also a university professor, on the floor of the Greek Assembly. Mr.Lambros tries to disprove the accusation which was leveled against the consul general and then declares that his opinion concurs with that of the Lacedaemonians.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0275.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The members of the League of Lecedaemonians in Chicago, having read the article published in the Greek Star, held a general meeting at which it was unanimously decided to make an official statement; for they have never made public their opinions, which, do not at all conform to the ideas of Mr. Lambros. Indeed, they approve of the patriotic stand made by Mr. Petrakakos in the Assembly and congratulate him on it.</p>
   <p>Therefore the members of the League of Lacedaemonians await with impatience the explanation which is certainly due to them.</p>
   <p>From the office of the League</p>
   <p>of Lacedaemonians in Chicago.</p>
