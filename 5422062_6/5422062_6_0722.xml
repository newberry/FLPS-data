   <p>p. 4 -- Over twelve thousand Chicago Greek Liberals last Sunday, in a grand mass-meeting at the Coliseum, approved of and recognized the new National Venizelist Government in Salonica, in a resolution as follows:</p>
   <p>We acknowledge and support with all our souls the National Government in Salonica, headed by Eleutherios Venizelos, as the only representative of national thoughts and wishes.</p>
   <p>We denounce with aversion the unconstitutional courtier government of Athens for following a policy contrary to national interests and for surrendering Greek territory, Greek population, and forts to our bitter enemies, the Bulgars.</p>
   <p>We express our sympathy and appreciation to the Allies and wish for their victory, that nations may be liberated.</p>
   <p>We respectfully inform His Excellency the President of the United States that we, as part of this our adopted country, are ready to be honored with <pb facs="5422062_6_0723.jpg" n="2"/>service to the Stars and Stripes on the first line when need be.</p>
   <p>We further respectfully request the President of the United States to recognize the Venizelist Government of Salonica, taking into consideration the fact that three fourths of the Greek population are pro-Venizelists. Since the National Venizelist Government will not recognize any consular action performed by the agents of the Athens Government in this country, our request for the recognition of the Salonica Government is in harmony with the wishes and interests of the Greeks in the United States.</p>
   <p>We further resolve to inform the Greek and American press of this country of our acknowledgment and support of the Venizelist Government in Salonica.</p>
   <p>Chicago, Feb. 18, 1917.</p>
   <p>THE COMMITTEE OF ONE HUNDRED</p>
   <p>of the twelve thousand indorsers</p>
   <p>of the resolution.</p>
