   <p>The Athenian press has been discussing the important problem of the military obligations of those Greek citizens who are living in foreign countries. The Greek state is justified in wanting to have some authority over the lives and welfare of all its citizens regardless of where they are. There has been repeated and lengthy discussions among our people in Chicago concerning the immigrant's liability to service in the Greek armed forces. Because most of us would like to be enlightened on this subject and because all the Greek immigrants in America are vitally interested in political, military, and economic developments in our homeland, it is most appropriate to express the views of experts on questions dealing with military service, immigration, minority rights, and jurisdiction of foreign governments over alien citizens.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0822.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>According to reports from Athens the Greek Secretary of War, in an interview with reporters and in recent speeches in the Greek House of Representatives, stated that, in the future, all Greek citizens residing in foreign countries will be liable to military service. There can be no other opinion on this subject. If political conditions in Greece and in the Greek communities were better the recruiting and registration of Greek manhood in America would have been enforced a long time ago. This, after all, is what takes place in other countries. The advantages to be derived from such recruiting are so obvious that there is not much more to be said.</p>
   <p>Suffice it to mention this: There are hundreds of thousands of Greeks who are living in foreign countries permanently. And, though they are called Greeks, know nothing or very little about their original country, Mother Hellas. When all these sons of Greece have completed their military service in the homeland it is not hard to see that they will return to the foreign countries whence they immigrated as better and more loyal Greeks in their hearts and souls. Undoubtedly, they will be more devoted to the ideals of <pb facs="5422062_6_0823.jpg" n="3"/>their real country.</p>
   <p>Now, we do not know if the Greek War Department has thought of ways and means of putting the honorable secretary's ideas into effect. It is understood that first Greek citizens who are residents of foreign countries must be registered in the books of villages and counties in Greece where they were born. To the uninformed it may seem strange that these can be Greek citizens who are registered in the books of the counties or provinces where they were born. But it is true. This is evidence of the general confusion prevailing in our community. Greek citizenship in foreign countries is transmitted from father to son and from him to the grandchildren, and so on, though such Greek citizens may have never seen the particular part of Greece from which their national origin is traced. This is one of the reasons why the question of Greek minorities in Turkey has not been solved yet. So, quite often the Turkish authorities have taken advantage of the uncertain status of the Greek minorities, and have thus forced the male population to serve in the Turkish army or renounce certain rights and privileges.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0824.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>As we know, a few years ago it was decided to register the children of the Greeks in Bulgaria with the Greek Bureau of Registration. Accordingly, the Greek consulates of Bulgaria were ordered to register all Greeks who desired to do so.</p>
   <p>However, because such registration was left to the discretion of the parents, the attempt failed. No matter how much loyalty and love one has for his country he would not decide to register himself or his children because he knows well that such action would force the registrant to serve in the armed forces of his native land, especially on a general mobilization order or a declaration of war. This would be very harmful to our people who reside in foreign lands because they would be forced to leave their work or business.</p>
   <p>If the Greek government really should decide to pass a law calling all the Greek citizens residing in foreign countries to military service, according to the Greek Star's opinion, there is only one happy solution to this question:</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0825.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The Greek consulates must be ordered to send to either the Department of War in Greece or to the local administrative authorities directly, lists of Greek citizens under their jurisdiction. The same consulates must have the names, addresses, and occupations of all Greeks in their districts so that they can supply the Greek government with all the necessary information concerning the number, the interests, and state of mind of the Greek nationals.</p>
   <p>Severe legislative measures must be taken to insure that the children of Greek citizens that are born in foreign countries be registered immediately with the nearest Greek consulate, which in turn will send the registration lists to the Greek Bureau of Registration. Heavy fines must be imposed on those parents who neglect to comply with these rules and regulations. The children of such parents will not be recognized as Greek citizens on coming of age.</p>
   <p>Let us not presume that by such strict penalties we will run the risk of losing our Greek citizens who are living in other countries. On the contrary, we will strengthen their loyalty to the homeland.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0826.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>We, here in America, can become American citizens, but that does not mean that we are prevented from serving in the Greek army as volunteers. We are reasonably sure that our children that are born in this country will not be called by the Greek government to serve in the army when they come of age; first, because they are automatically American citizens, having been born in this country; second, because the Greek government does not need the active services of the Greek immigrant except his moral and economic support--especially, in national crises and emergencies. Greece has enough men at the present time. What she really needs is military materials and equipment. And we, the Greeks of Chicago, the Greeks of America, are in a position to do our duty to our homeland by supplying them.</p>
   <p>As far as the Greeks in Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania are concerned they will be forced to serve either in the countries of their residence or to return to Greece and serve there. And, by the eternal, if they do the former they will prove that they are not genuine Greeks.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0827.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Only the procedure which we and expert authorities suggested, that is, empowering the consulates to register all Greeks and their children, will the idea of the Greek Secretary of War be realized. Then those patriotic Greeks who are scattered all over the world will be called to serve their country and their flag.</p>
