   <p>p. 1- Right now Hellenism in America has reached its highest level. Its total population is securely established at more than five hundred thousand, and its national characteristics still persist unaltered. Its numerous communities, exuberant with life and movement, preserve intact their sincere attachment to all that is Greek. The picture of Greece remains distinct in the fancies of the members of its communities, and a longing to return to her lives in their hearts.</p>
   <p>There are Greek churches, schools, and clubs, Greek holidays, celebrations, and dances, Greek newspapers, magazines, and books, Greek theaters, Greek lectures, and Greek spiritual circles. All testify that the Greek people who immigrated to this country remain genuinely Greek both in manners and in thought. Briefly, the Hellenism in America is a living piece of Greece, maintaining on its altars the flame of patriotism and able, if properly utilized, to render incalculable services to the fatherland.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0263.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>However, though at this moment Hellenism in America is found at the culminating point of its national life, a careful observer will note the beginning of a very slight movement downward, a movement which, with the passing of years, will be discernible to all eyes because it will gain in velocity and develop into veritable ruin. We speak of it as ruin, real disaster, because though there is no alternative for a sun that has reached its zenith, and it naturally must begin its downward trend, the trend should be very, very slow and gentle, - a gradual setting which ends in twilight, the reflection of which continues to illuminate the horizon for a long time. Such a slow disappearance of Hellenism in America would be a perfectly natural development, an inevitable consequence of the removal of people from their paternal soil.</p>
   <p>But most unfortunately such a slow decline is not presaged. With the comparative abolition of immigration the Hellenism of America finds its contacts with the center of Hellenism suddenly severed, - finds itself without those ties which bound it, and in addition to this the center, the Greek State, displays not the slightest concern at this isolation of <pb facs="5422062_6_0264.jpg" n="3"/>the American community. The representatives of Greece in America are strangers now, uninterested for the most part and strictly formal in their attitude; their utmost service rendered is the certification of deeds by notary public. Consequently we have a populous Hellenism exuberant with life and vigor, full of great love and enthusiasm for its mother-country, a Hellenism which has risen to the highest point of national glorification, - but in danger of being precipitated from these heights because its fatherland is completely indifferent to the fact that it has been cut adrift. Thus the fatherland ignores those things which ought most to be safeguarded so as to retain the vast benefits which a large Greek population in America offers to Greece. It is indeed tragic that there is not a Greek government resourceful enough to recognize the value of America's Hellenism.</p>
