   <p>(Article published in Patris of Athens, Greece, by S. Kotakis, publisher and manager of the Chicago Greek Daily, in his sojourn there.)</p>
   <p>Since the settlement of the Greeks of Asia Minor in Greece, the largest group, indisputably, of Greek people outside Greece is that which lives in America.</p>
   <p>This portion of the Greek people numbers about 500,000 and as a whole composes a lively part of Hellenism, which, despite the great distance that separates it from Greece and the absorbing environment in which it finds itself, manifests its vitality in various ways and persistently maintains its paternal customs and habits and traditions.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0097.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The number of Greek churches in America is 250, and there are as many schools. There are 1,000 Greek societies and 30,000 Greek business establishments, and as to the value of their property, it amounts to millions of dollars. Most important of all, the Greek population is considered now a factor in civilization and economics by the Americans.</p>
   <p>In addition, the Greek population of America has attained that position in the United States in a very short span of time because the years of their immigration are only forty, in contradistinction to other races who settled there a century ago. This desired position is due exclusively to their active and industrious qualities, to their labor, and to the ingenuity of the race.</p>
   <p>The Greeks of America have this also to their credit, that all this progress has been achieved by them themselves and not by any prudence or protection whatever of the Greek government, because Greece more than any other <pb facs="5422062_6_0098.jpg" n="3"/>state has taken no interest as yet in her immigrants in America, while all the rest have special agencies there and watch the activities of their former citizens and countrymen.</p>
   <p>However, if it be realized what a great economic factor the Greek population in America always was to the Greek state, and how many hopes depend on it for the monetary stability of Greece, it is surprising indeed how the Greek state expects so much from American Greeks without the least effort toward them and for them.</p>
   <p>..... It is known to the economic circles of Greece that the Greek population of America is an economic factor of the greatest importance, and for that reason, we repeat, the carelessness is inexcusable which the Greek state has shown and still continues to show for the great and invaluable monetary source which it has in America. We must not, therefore, <pb facs="5422062_6_0099.jpg" n="4"/>be surprised if that source begins to get sterile, and it does not take much imaginative effort to foresee that it actually will become completely sterile in the near future.</p>
   <p>However, we think that there is still time for the state to do what it has failed to do in the past and by systematic activity to organize this great power and make it again a source of wealth for Greece. This conviction of ours we base on the fact that the Greek people are still in America, much stronger than in the past, and, most important of all, that Greece today offers them a great field of economic enterprise, and what is required is organized and systematic action from here (Greece) to make them turn their attention toward Greece and appreciate the great opportunities for enterprises offered by it. But before we go any further on this point ..... we must assure ourselves of the soundness of our grounds..... because it must be realized that we cannot wait fatuously for things to come. Systematic organization is requisite for success.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0100.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The Greek immigrant in America, during the first years after his arrival there, worked hard as laborer and peddler, and sent his savings to Greece for the needs and obligations of his family. He had, first of all, to pay up the debts on his father's property, to take care of the settlement (marriage) of his sister, and to support his old parents and for those reasons the inflow from America in those years amounted to great sums. These obligations, however, little by little have been fulfilled, and the immediate consequence is the evident drop of that influx of money. It will not be long before it will stop completely because the causes are continually vanishing.</p>
   <p>Now, the Greek immigrant to America settled down permanently there, became a business man, raised a family, and invested his money in his businesses in America, in spite of the fact that he still continued to cherish a strong patriotic sentiment and desired to have his native ties with Greece unbroken.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0101.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>..... There are important circumstances, nevertheless, which, if studied by those in Greece, will make it possible again to find in the Greeks of America a source of wealth for Greece. But to succeed in this, it will be necessary to show some interest in the Greeks of America and to come in closer contact with them.</p>
   <p>..... That which I wish to emphasize here is that the Greek populace in America possess large capital which could by systematic endeavor be conveyed to Greece. Just let the government turn its attention toward it and by systematic and vigorous effort attract this capital hither.</p>
