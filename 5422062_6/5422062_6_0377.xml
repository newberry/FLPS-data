   <p>Peter S. Lambros, publisher of the Greek Star, a weekly newspaper printed both in English and in Greek, said: "I am talking to you as a Greek by birth and an American by adoption.</p>
   <p>"I can testify that diplomatic relations between the United States and Greece, as well as business relations, have always been most cordial. Greece is the only country in the world that had to go through a civil war at the time of the World War in order to cast its lot with the Allies.</p>
   <p>"The sentiment of the Greek-American had a good deal to do with that, first because our adopted country had joined the Allies, secondly it was a war against militarism and autocracy, and thirdly because the great Greek statesman Venizelos had cabled the Greek-Americans to stand by the principles of liberty as symbolized by the Star Spangled Banner.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0378.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"I recall that the American consul in Greece, Mr. Dulber, who represented the principles of Woodrow Wilson, made a call upon the Venizelos Government to declare that the rights of Greece would be protected in every respect, and that Greece would be economically supported by the United States.</p>
   <p>"On the same day George Roussos, formerly Greek ambassador to the United States and ex-Minister of Foreign Affairs of Greece, made a statement to that effect at a public meeting here at which I had the honor to preside.</p>
   <p>"The United States Government is more secure in making a loan to Greece at this time than it was at the time of the war. Greece is now in better shape than any other Balkan state from a business standpoint, but Greece is handicapped by millions of refugees who have immigrated to Greece and have been incorporated in it.</p>

   <p>They will remain Greek. Greece needs money for the development of farms and of navigation.</p>
