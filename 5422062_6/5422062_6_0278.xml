   <p>p. 1 - "Mother" left Chicago last Friday and went to St. Louis to continue her tour of the Greek communities in America. On another page we publish her farewell address to the Chicago Greek community, in which she voices her appreciation of the support accorded to her work in this city.</p>
   <p>Although Mrs. Papadopoulou's undertaking has received the most enthusiastic support throughout the Hellenistic world, we must not conceal the fact that lack of unity has impaired the success of her work, that is, our lack of unity; for political feeling has not been entirely extinguished within us and only awaits an opportunity to be fanned into flame again. Indeed, as far as the Hellenism of America is concerned, not only has partisan animosity not been extinguished, but it shows every indication of bursting out more furiously than ever.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0279.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On all occasions Greek Chicago showed to Mother all its inherent goodness in its willingness to support her work. Unfortunately its good intentions were paralyzed not only by church disunity but also by lack of organization. Without organization nothing can be done; without organization no aim can be achieved. And lack of organization seems to have become a common characteristic of Greek enterprise, for not only are the Greeks of Chicago unorganized, but all those who come from Greece for some definite purpose show the same defect.</p>
   <p>They come thoroughly unprepared to work for that purpose, and in consequence their efforts are completely paralyzed, a disaster which most unfortunately, poor Mother was not able to avoid.</p>
   <p>The general state of affairs here appears to our visitors to be so chaotic that they cannot be straightened out. Consequently they are hampered by great less of time caused by postponements and delays in carrying out plans decided upon.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0280.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>To be sure, between eight thousand and nine thousand dollars has so far been collected, and the total will undoubtedly reach ten thousand dollars, since the committee will continue its collections and many desire to contribute regularly to this work.</p>
   <p>In spite of all this, and regardless of the amount collected, the arrival of Mother's visit to America has somehow moved us, has somehow quickened the patriotic blood in our veins. It was the patriotism of the old days, a patriotism which had been severely chilled during these last years by lack of harmony.</p>
   <p>Most delightful of all was the extense patriotic enthusiasm manifested by the younger generation. Many young men and women showed great interest in Mother's work and voiced sincere hope for its success. In this respect we believe that Mother's visit to America brought results. We believe that our compatriots in Greece would do well to take underimmediate consideration a plan to send some one over here from time to time to tone up and intensify <pb facs="5422062_6_0281.jpg" n="4"/>the patriotic feeling of the Greeks in America. That some one must be a real apostle, either an official or a popular character like Mother.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Papadopoulou's visit to Chicago left in our hearts a beautiful, lively image of her. She went away accompanied by the blessings of us all for her fearless undertaking of a great and philanthropic work.</p>
