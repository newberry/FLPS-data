   <p>What do you think of this deed, and whom do you hold responsible? Terrible and unpatriotic. I say this because it is a crime unsurpassed by any other in the history of nations. It is true that there have been other blemishes upon the history of our country--such as the sentence of Socrates; the exile of Aristides; the murder of Kapodistrias; the fate of our national heroes, Kolokotronis and Plapoutas--but this deed is worse than any other.</p>
   <p>To do such a thing to the Savior of our country at a time when it is in such a difficult situation is unbelievable. We know that traitors are shot, but since when are Liberators and uplifters of mankind subjected to the same fate.</p>
   <p>Kings and famous men have been assassinated before, but usually those <pb facs="5422062_6_0588.jpg" n="2"/>who did the deed did so in order to liberate a downtrodden, subjugated people. In those cases it was the kings and the famous men, and not the assassins, who were the criminals. In this instance it is quite the opposite. Now a benefactor, a liberator, a man who scorned glory in order to help his country, a man who defied a monarch, has been nearly killed by an agent of the group that opposes freedom and progress for Greece.</p>
   <p>If Venizelos had been killed, Greece would have suffered a general collapse of which advantage would have been taken by the other powers.....We must remember the words of our great forefathers who said, "External enemies cannot be conquered, as long as internal enemies are allowed to thrive....." This attempted murder is evidence of the presence of internal enemies of Greece. They must be found and done away with immediately.</p>
