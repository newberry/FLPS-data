  <body>
   <p>Due to the Greek tradition in honoring the celebration of one's name day, by paying him a visit in his home, I visited the home of an old friend on the North Side of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Owing to my desire to prolong the visit with a discussion, I paid my visit on the eve of his name day. Right after dinner, which I enjoyed very much, the discussion began. To my surprise, the grand-daughter of my friend removed everything from reach of the old grand-dad, including flower vases and even ash trays, in short, every breakable object. Forgetting my etiquette in amazement, I asked, "Why all this?" The young lady with a whimsical smile said, "You know, my grand-dad, when he speaks, makes such gesticulations that everything breakable must be removed, or else."</p>
   <p>Sitting opposite my friend, the discussion reached its height, when, to my astonishment, the young lady came and took my ash tray away. This habit of gesticulations is not a monopoly, but a general characteristic with all the Greeks.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_1061.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Greek cannot and will not talk without gesticulating. Gesture, it seems, is a national characteristic. The Greek talks with his hands, describes with his hands, and narrates with his hands. When you see, far away, two hands. working back and forth, up and down, rest assured that there is a Greek behind them, unless it is a Jew or Italian, talking. In Greek oratory, Greek acting, and Greek discussion, Gesticulation plays the biggest role. Only one man in Greece was distinguished for non-gesticulating. He was Harilaos Tricoupis, former Prime Minister, who while talking for hours in the Greek Parliament, held his hands locked behind his back. A Greek culprit, with his hands shackled, was unable to answer questions asked by the guard. He finally said, "How can I tell you about my rights while my hands are shackled?"</p>
   <p>Indeed, the poor Greek, how could he talk with his hands tied! The officer of the law, by shackling the cultprit's hands, automatically sealed the colprit's tongue. Freedom of speech could not be attained in Greece without the freeing of the hands.</p>
   <p>A Greek becomes excitable and irritable according to the velocity of gesticulation.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_1062.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>While the discussion is done with words only, he is quiet but when the flame of debate reaches a climax, the one not aflame, as yet, will say to the excited speaker, "Put your hands down". The reply will be, "How can I? Aren't we talking?" "Talk all you want to, but put your hands down."The gesticulating man loses his speech and goes, conjuring Zeus and Athena, for stopping his freedom of speech!</p>
   <p>The better type of Greeks, who are classed in the category non-gesticulators, are those who have but one arm, especially the left; those who have the right hand in a sling due to a surgical operation; and the waiters of the coffee houses, when they are holding a tray.</p>
   <p>A Greek peasant standing before the Praxitelian Hermes said to a passerby, "You imagine that he is alive and lacking only in speech, for how could the unfortunate youth talk while he has no hands!"</p>
