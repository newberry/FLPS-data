   <p>P.4--Disregarding regionalism, which for some time past has created profound antipathies among the Greeks of Chicago, the Society of Kastrites, like the first star that shines forth in the evening sky, has come out before all the rest to show us the way to our duty, thus preparing the ground for national unity. Whether we come from Sparta, Kastri, Athens, Macedonia, or Crete or from any other part of Greece, we are all Greeks, sons of Mother-Greece.</p>
   <p>Our native country, being in financial difficulties, has appealed to her sons in America to come to her assistance for national defense. The response of Chicago Greeks has not been so ardent as it should be. Regionalism is the cause of this half-hearted reaction to our country's call for help.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Society of Kastrites, which has proved to be one of the outstanding <pb facs="5422062_6_0919.jpg" n="2"/>patriotic and fraternal organizations in our community, has ignored the pettiness of regionalism and has come whole-heartedly to the assistance of Greece the beautiful and of their native town. At their last meeting, which was called for that purpose, $2,860.35 was collected in the twinkling of an eye. $860.35 was sent to Greece for national defense, and $2,000 to their native Kastri to be added to the fund provided for the erection of St. George's new church.</p>
   <p>This praiseworthy action of theirs stands out like a blazing star to guide other Greek societies on the road to duty. Bravo, Kastrites!</p>
   <p>Names and amounts of contributions are printed on page 5.</p>
