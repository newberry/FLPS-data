   <p>Undoubtedly the Greeks of America, in general, and the natives of Aigina, in particular, will rejoice in the selection of Miss Rodis to wear the crown of beauty for 1931 in Greece.</p>
   <p>The chosen queen, is a real Grecian beauty bejeweled with all the Greek characteristics that comprise beauty and the crown belongs to her. However, Miss Rodis, who first was chosen, "Miss Aigina," was in dangerous competition, with another beauty from the island of Corfu. The competition became a national affair, and the Greeks were so perplexed that it became necessary to invoke the guidance of the deity of beauty, Aphrodite, in order to choose rightly. Venus, being an Athenian, turned the scale towards the side of her neighbor, Aigina.</p>
   <p>The defeated beauty of Carfu, true to the tradition of Aphrodite, that beauty attracts beauty accepted her defeat calmly and stoically, by greeting the crowned queen with "Your Majesty of beauty and luck." with the emphasis on the word luck.</p>

   <p>"Miss Greece" appearing on the appointed throne, and encircled by a galaxy of beauties, accepted the crown with much enthusiasm.</p>
