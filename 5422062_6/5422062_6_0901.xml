   <p>p.-3-...............Systematic efforts are being made to raise funds for the National Navy of Greece. Contribution-boxes have been placed in all Greek business establishments so that people may drop in whatever amounts they wish without feeling embrassed because their contribution are not so large as those of others.</p>
   <p>This system was inaugurated by the Proodos (Progress) Greek Club of Chicago. Every newspaper of the amount of money collected and of the sums sent to the central committee in Athens, Greece.</p>
   <p>Every fellow-Greek of ours is requested to make a habit of it and to drop into the box whatever amount his financial condition will permit. Nickels and dimes dropped in day by day will amount to dollars by the end of the month.</p>
   <p>Nobody can refuse assistance to Mother-Greece. Nobody can pass by the collection-box without feeling his obligation to the beloved land of his origin. Give all you can. It is for Greece.</p>
   <p>The Office.</p>
