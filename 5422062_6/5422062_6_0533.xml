   <p>The members of the Greek Post of the American Legion discussed various matters pertaining to legion affairs during a meeting which was held last Thursday. After hasty action on the Post's business the members proceeded with the main topic of the agenda, which was the deplorable state of affairs in our father--land resulting from the great disaster in Asia Minor. Important decisions were made regarding these critical conditions.</p>
   <p>Commander Nichols spoke briefly of these sad and disheartening events. He suggested that the members should appeal to the American government, through the American Legion.</p>
   <p>Mr. Mitchell spoke next, pointing out that besides its moral support, the Legion should contribute financially to the homeland in order to bring relief to the suffering millions. The proposals of Messrs. Nichols and Mitchell were enthusiastically adopted.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0534.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A large amount of money was then collected, which gave an indication of the patriotism and devotion of the members of their homeland, as well as to America.</p>
