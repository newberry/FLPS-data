   <p>The historical cathedral of Tegea, which was built by Dioclitianos, 1200 years ago, is undoubtly a masterpiece of Byzantine art. This church for centuries was the center of religious and political activities. It kept the fire of liberty always burning and was an imspiration to the Armatolous and Kleftas, for the liberation of the race.</p>
   <p>The "Athens Society" of Tegeatas, which since 1880 has turned its activities towards the perpetuation of this historical Cathedral, appeals to its native sons in Chicago and elsewhere to raise money in order to build an adjacent building for educational purposes. For many years in the past, this Diocese, in order to produce good mothers and housewives, gave lectures to young girls of Tegla and vicinity. Now the membership of these classes; is over two hundred, and the facilities for its proper functioning are rather inadequate.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0323.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Upon the suggestion of the Diocese, the Society of Tegeatas, decided to build a really systematic industrial school under the auspices of the Bishopic Committee.</p>
   <p>And, as always is the case when short of money, the eyes of the Committee are turned towards the Greeks of America, and especially to those of Chicago owing to their preponderance in numbers, and a requested has been sent them to "chip" in for the erection of the anticipated industrial school.</p>
   <p>The activity must begin at once, the money must be raised, and the erection of the building must take place as quickly as possible, hence, as a native of Tegea, I appeal to all Tegeatas to attend a meeting and generously subscribe to the above cause.</p>
