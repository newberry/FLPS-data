   <p>p. 3-Three dark-skinned Greeks, supposedly educated, selected as the site for their debate the northeast corner of State and Lake streets and there and then poured out their profound knowledge of literature. Pindar, a lyric poet of Greece, was the subject of the dispute.</p>
   <p>Two of them knew positively that Pindar lived in the year 1821, while the third Greek insisted that Pindar lived in the year 1407 A.D. An Homeric battle would have taken place if, by Athena's will, a fourth Greek had not appeared and informed them that Pindar lived in the year 1700 B.C., in the time of Cadmus. The dispute ended with hand-shakes, and the crowd which had gathered to witness a Greek battle scattered in disappointment.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_1077.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The whole thing could have been avoided if these Greeks who were evidently interested in the literature of ancient and modern Greece, had attended the meetings of our societies here, where lectures on this subject are given at every meeting.</p>
