   <p>[Saloniki editor's note: We are pleased to publish the following report of the Greek Embassy on the food situation in Greece in order to enlighten the public and in answer to malicious publications.]</p>
   <p>To the Editors of Saloniki,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>In order to calm Greek public opinion which is being misled and confused by publications, the intentions of which can be judged by the public, I make the request that you kindly publish:</p>
   <p>That, as in all Allied countries, for some time now, there functions an international Allied committee which regulates the varieties, the amounts, and the closest sources of production in various countries from which our country's necessary supplies are being continually imported. This committee is functioning thanks to the instance of the United States, <pb facs="5422062_6_0686.jpg" n="2"/>which, until the arrival of a special emissary, has appointed as special representative, their consul at Piraeus, so that the work will not be retarded.</p>
   <p>That for the provisioning of our country, which is being energetically pursued, ships flying the flag of all Allied countries are being used. All these ships are being protected by the same means as all other ships sailing in any other Allied port.</p>
   <p>That in Greece today, although all necessities are not plentiful, hunger, which has been bequeathed to us by the former government, has ceased existing, thanks to the prompt measures taken by the national government in co-operation with the Allies. So our country is being continually supplied, overcoming all our wants. In order to further facilitate exports, British measures of inspection have been removed, permitting Greece to enjoy the same rights as any other Allied power.</p>
   <p>George Roufos, Ambassador.</p>
