  <body>
   <p>At the twelfth of this present month all the Democratic and Liberal clubs of America and Canada will convene here. The success of this convention is assured since the majority of the clubs have already declared that they will send delegates.</p>
   <p>The problems to be studied are of vital importance and are connected with present day affairs. The following questions will be discussed.</p>
   <p>(1) How can the clubs of the Democratic Liberals of the United States and Canada, as political organizations, conveniently cooperate in the coming elections so that Democratic leaders will be elected?</p>
   <p>(2) How can the Democratic Liberal clubs efficiently combat the propaganda distributed by the supporters of the depraved system which has heaped so many woes on our unfortunate country?</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0468.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>(3) How can these clubs distributed throughout America and Canada successfully counteract the Turkish propaganda which for some time has been entering the United States.</p>
