   <p>The ever-diminishing circle of the Chicago Greek Loyalists last week held a meeting and resolved to disband because Constantine, their leader and their idol, has gone to oblivion and disgrace.</p>
   <p>This event will be remembered as important in the annals of the Greek community in Chicago. The group at this meeting consisted of seven would-be title-holders, who for their own aggrandizement and vanity did so much harm to the peace and unity of our race in Chicago. Each of these so-called bosses was promised a title or a life-job in the royal palace.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately for them the boiling-pot turned over and trapped them like rats. Now they want to be Venizelists. Can they be trusted? Time will tell. Let us hope that they have learned their lesson. And peace and unity will then prevail After all, they are our compatriots, and an opportunity should be given to them to prove that they are really fellow-Greeks.</p>
