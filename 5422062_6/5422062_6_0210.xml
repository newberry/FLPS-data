   <p>It is very encouraging to note that the Greeks of Chicago are leading the way when national cooperation is necessary. It is folly now to say that the Greek race does not cooperate when nationalism is concerned.</p>
   <p>Five Chicago organizations united their forces and activities and organized a dance to be given Sept. 17th, at the Trianon Ballroom for the fund of Athens College. The Nea Genea, the Philomusical Society, the Greek Youth, the Sons of Pericles, and the students fraternity Plato, are the organizations that give the initiative of racial cooperation. Instead of having five dances, as was done in the past, one will be held to raise money for the fund of the American College in Athens. Bravo! a united front is more desirable and more beneficial.</p>
   <p>The example of the above organizations, which are composed of our young generation, must be followed by others of the old stock and forever eliminate the idea of individual activity for preponderance when national affairs are concerned.</p>
   <pb facs="5422062_6_0211.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Undoubtedly the Greek community of Chicago, which very much approves and appreciates the activities of the new generation, will attend the dance and make it a grand success.</p>
