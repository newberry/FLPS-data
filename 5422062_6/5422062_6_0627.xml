   <p>It will seem improbable that there exist bees who do not have wings. It is true, however, just as there are devils who do not have tails.</p>
   <p>These wingless bees, luckily for us, are right in our midst. Yes, don't be surprised. Do you want to know who they are?</p>
   <p>I present the esteemed ladies of Chicago. Just as the bees go from flower to flower and collect nectar which they will bring to their hive and convert into honey, so do the ladies go from store to store selling tickets to their dance which is to be given for the benefit of the refugees of our race.</p>
   <p>Is there a flower in existence that will not give up its nectar to a bee? Impossible. How can a flower refuse to give when it is aware of the wonderful transmutation its nectar will undergo.</p>

   <p>Therefore, we cannot believe that anyone refused to add his dollar to the fund, knowing its holy purpose.</p>
   <p>The lovely wife of the consul, Mrs. Xanthopoulos, is the president of the Greek Ladies Society. Their dance will be given February 27, at the Sherman Hotel. It is the patriotic duty of every Greek to attend.</p>
