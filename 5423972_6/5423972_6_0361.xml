   <p>Yiddish Lectures.</p>
   <p>For some time, it has been hoped that besides having a systematic course of lectures given in English, Wednesday evenings, that a similar course be arranged in Yiddish on some other evening. After considerable effort, the following lecture program has been arranged to be given in Yiddish, every second Sunday evening during the winter months: 1. November 12, 1916, Dr. J. M. Menkin, "Jews in England" (Their present religious and political status) - 2. November 26, 1916, Judge Philip L. Bregstone, "J. L. Perets and Sholom Aleichem" (What we have gained by their life, and what we lost in their death) - 3. December 10, 1916, Mr. Leon Zolotkoff, "Jewish Problems of the Present Time" - 4. December 24, 1916, Mr. I. Aberson, "Our Cultural Obligations in America" - 5. January 14, 1917, S. Golub, "Jewish Music, Religious and Secular" (accompanied by piano) - 6. January 28, 1917, Dr. A. B. Yudelson, "Hygiene in the Laws of Moses" (illustrated by stereopticon slides) - 7. February 11, 1917, Mr. Max Shulman, "In the Days of Rabbi Yehudah Halevy" - 8. February 25, 1917, Rabbi Saul Silber, "The First Encounter of Judaism <pb facs="5423972_6_0362.jpg" n="2"/>with European Civilization" - 9. March 11, 1917, Dr. A. Levinson, "Hygiene in the Talmud" (illustrated by stereopticon slides) - 10. March 25, 1917, Mr. M. A. Levin, "Jewish Education in Ancient Times."</p>
   <p>This is the first systematically arranged course of Yiddish lectures in the form of a forum, ever given in the city of Chicago. We hope that the attendance at these lectures will warrant the continuation of these talks year after year. Should the attendance be larger than we expect, it may be possible to arrange for a Yiddish Lecture Association, and through such an association, invite lecturers of note from other parts of this country to talk before the members of the association.</p>
   <p>There is no reason why a course of this character should not attract hundreds of people who do not understand English and yet are earnest enough to desire the intellectual pastime that the attendance at lectures of this character naturally affords. This series of ten lectures concerning Jewish problems will be given every second and fourth Sunday in the month, 8 P. M.</p>
