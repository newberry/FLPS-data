   <p>The Associated Jewish Charities held its annual meeting yesterday in the Auditorium Hotel where more than one hundred welfare workers were present to listen to the report of President Julius Rosenwald and an inspiring talk by Dr. Stolz.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald termed this meeting the Bar Mitzvah because the Associated Jewish Charities was thirteen years old yesterday. In his report he stated that $450,000 had been collected last year and $290,000 had been distributed. The cost of collecting the money amounted to one and one-half cents on each dollar. The following received the money which was distributed:</p>
   <p>Jewish Aid Society $130,000.</p>
   <p>Michael Reese Hospital $110,000.</p>
   <p>Home Finding Society $50,000.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0784.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The president also announced that the subscriptions were increased by fifty per cent due to the fact that there are fewer subscribers enrolling. More money is needed now because the construction of a new children's hospital for Michael Reese is being planned.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rosenwald said that when he learned of the tremendous work accomplished by the Orthodox Jewish Charities in such a short time he was overwhelmed with joy and he declared that the directors are worthy of the greatest praise for raising 4,750 subscribers and a sum of $100,000 in such a short period.</p>
   <p>"I hope," said the philanthropist, "that this charitable bodies will unite and work together on the noble field of charity, but at the same time I would advise members of the Associated Charities to contribute and subscribe to the Federated Orthodox Jewish Charities."</p>
   <p>The guest of the evening was Mr. Weil of Pittsburgh, who delivered an interesting lecture on city government.</p>
