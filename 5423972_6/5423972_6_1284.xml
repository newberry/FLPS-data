   <p>A ladies auxiliary to help those suffering from tuberculosis was founded a few days ago. This society appeals to all who want to aid the victims of the white plague. The secretary of this auxiliary is Mrs. Mary Harris. Meetings will be held every Tuesday evening in the hall of the Shochrai Sfath Eber (Hebrew-Speaking Club), 810 Ashland Boulevard.</p>
   <p>A Home Settlement League was founded this week. Its purpose is to build a settlement of homes around Chicago with one and one-half acres of land for each. The work will begin as soon as the league has one hundred and fifty members. The secretary of the League is the engineer, Herbst, 1528 South Sawyer Avenue. All those who are interested in such an opportunity are requested to attend a meeting this Sunday at 11:00 A.M., at the above-mentioned address, where they can obtain the necessary information about the newly organized League.</p>
