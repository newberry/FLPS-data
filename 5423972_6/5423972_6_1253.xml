   <p>Now is the time to prepare for the immediate future. We do not mean preparation for war. For the war is already going on at full blast and with great momentum. Besides, the conduct of the war is a matter for the government and not for an individual group.</p>
   <p>What we wish to talk about here, are some of the results of the war that will of necessity effect in the near future the lives of the various nationalities, groups, and families in our country. We mean, specifically, the hospitals and homes for the wounded soldiers who will be returning from the battlefield and will be dependent upon our aid.</p>
   <p>Last week, Secretary of the Interior Lane presented a memorandum to congress on the burning question of what to do with our soldiers when they return from France. In this memorandum, he states that the government of the United States must soon begin to formulate definite plane as to ways and means of settling <pb facs="5423972_6_1254.jpg" n="2"/>the returning soldiers on farms of their own at government expense, thus giving them the opportunity of becoming rehabilitated.</p>
   <p>This was stated, however, only in regards to perfectly healthy soldiers. There will be a certain number of them, however, who will be unproductive for a long time, or forever. These are the wounded and the disabled. Not farms but hospitals will be needed for these brave fighters; institutions where they will be received and kept in honor and taken care of in every possible way.</p>
   <p>There are some people going about planning to place such soldiers in private homes where they will be considered members of the family. This however except in a few cases, is both impractical and unsatisfactory.</p>
   <p>We can easily imagine the strong sentiment in favor of the heroic unfortunates shortly after the war. It will be an honor for a family to consider one of these heroes as one of them. There will come a time, however, when this sentiment will cool somewhat. Many families will begin to look upon this soldier as <pb facs="5423972_6_1255.jpg" n="3"/>a burden upon them, and will not conduct themselves with the same warmth and consideration toward the disabled hero. This will have an injurious effect upon the ex-soldier; it will hurt his pride. When we carefully examine the psychology of the matter, we can readily see that this will hurt the disabled soldier more than being wounded on the battlefield. Ailing or crippled people are naturally very sensitive. It will always seem to them that people are looking at them askance, that they are considered an unwanted burden, and they will feel wronged and hurt.</p>
   <p>It is necessary, therefore, to build institutions in the near future for these sick and crippled, where they will feel at home. The government will undoubtedly carry out this project, and plans are most likely already prepared in the Department of the Interior.</p>
   <p>But in the eyes of the government all soldiers are alike. They do not recognize any national or religious differences. Least of all do they consider traditions, customs, and tastes. The government institutions will therefore be free to the soldiers of the various nationalities, with special privileges for none.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1256.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Let us consider now how a Jewish soldier would feel there--a Jew who had been reared in an entirely different environment with entirely different habits and different tastes from those of the others. During the period of his military service, when he had to fulfill his duty to his country, he was compelled to subdue his peculiarities and specific inclinations. He could not demand any special consideration. At such a time his own ego was submerged within the soul of the nation, and a spirit was instilled in him by that ideal which impells people to fight for their fellow men. But when the sword is sheathed in its scabbard, when the roar of the cannon is silenced, and peace is established, then his former inclinations return to him instinctively, and he will feel a nostalgia for his former civilian life, and for that environment from which he came.</p>
   <p>The disabled Jewish soldier will certainly not be able to adapt himself during peace time to a strange environment. He will always long for his Jewish brethren; Jewish food will taste much better to him; and many will want to appease their religious hunger.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1257.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>It therefore becomes imperative now that the Jewish civic leaders of our city shall consider what to do in this matter. Our Jewish civic leaders have already succeeded in erecting many useful institutions here in our city, such as an old people's home, an orphans' home, and many others. They should begin to formulate plans for a new institution--the Jewish soldiers' home.</p>
   <p>Such an institution should be built in a nice Jewish neighborhood, and arranged and furnished in the most modern fashion. It should be finished as soon as possible so as to be able to accommodate, as permanent residents, all the Jewish veterans who will be in need of such a place immediately after the war.</p>
   <p>To build such an institution, a mass movement, and not a party movement, is needed. The leaders of all Jewish organizations should become interested in it, be they liberal or conservative, labor unions or congregations. And if we begin this work with our united effort, then we will be successful.</p>
   <p>Now is the time to work, to show concern for the future. And all, without <pb facs="5423972_6_1258.jpg" n="6"/>regard for affiliations or inclinations, are duty-bound to aid in erecting this building, which will be an honor to Chicago Jews and a home for those who are no longer physically able to become rehabilitated.</p>
   <p>Do it now and don't put it off until later! If our country is ruled with understanding, then we should be ashamed of ourselves for not having annihilated poverty and need; if our country, however, is not ruled with understanding, then we should surely be ashamed of our riches and injustice.</p>
