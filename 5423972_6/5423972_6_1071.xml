   <p>From the Superintendent's report (of the United Hebrew Relief Association for the year 1877--1878) it appears that "in the past year $5,946.80 were expended" by the Society, of which $1,153.60 were spent on salaries, visiting expenses, postage, etc. and $4,792.20 distributed among the poor, in money and kinds, to the relief of 1,316 resident persons, besides some occasional applicants, and "over 150-tons of coal, all paid up", yet in reserve. In addition to this, the Ladies' Sewing Society supplied 121 poor families with clothes, and distributed 4,757 yards of goods, and 23 blankets.</p>
   <p>The Ladies' Sewing Society of the West Side contributed 192 articles, and that of the North Side 43 articles.</p>
   <p>The West Side Ladies' Sewing Society gave besides, clothes, etc. to 12 families.</p>
   <p>The North Side Ladies' Sewing Society also supplied a number of families with clothes; but we have no report.</p>
   <p>The K.S.B. Lodges of the city, viz., Chicago Lodge and Teutonia Lodge, gave notice of their withdrawal from the Association.</p>
   <p>The balance on hand is $854.58 and an additional $701.40; total $1,555.90. The hospital fund amounts to $2,186.92.</p>
