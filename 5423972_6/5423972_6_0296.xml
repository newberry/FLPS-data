<title level="a">"KU KLUX KLAN AND HENRY FORD ARE DANGEROUS TO AMERICA," SAYS ZANGWILL</title></bibl>

   <p>The large gymnasium hall of the Hebrew Institute was crowded last night. The most representative Jews of Chicago came to say good-by to the great Jewish thinker and writer, Israel Zangwill. They also wanted to hear his first and last speech in Chicago. Hundreds of people went away disappointed because there was no room inside the hall. Many remained outside in the cold in order to catch a glimpse of the great writer.</p>
   <p>At the very beginning of his speech, Mr. Zangwill came out strongly against Henry Ford and the Ku Klux Klan. "They are dangerous to America," he declared.</p>
   <p>Zangwill read the telegram that had been printed in the Courier about the anti-Semitic newspaper in Montreal, which demanded that Canada expel its Jews. This paper gets all its information about Jews from Ford's weekly. Mr. Zangwill's <pb facs="5423972_6_0297.jpg" n="2"/>comment was that with the aid of Ford's money, pogroms are being fomented and Jews are being driven from their homes.</p>
   <p>"Anti-Semitism has spread from the Volga to the Rhine," said Mr. Zangwill, "and is approaching the English channel because the Gentiles envy us, not because they are afraid of us. The Gentiles envy us because we know their bluffs, we know their deceit, and, therefore, they will always hate us.</p>
   <p>"America should be ashamed of the fact that a man who is hiding from a man who is hiding from a court summons, is a [potential] candidate for the presidency. The Jews should organize themselves to prevent the candidacy of Ford."</p>
   <p>Louis Marshall was again bitterly attacked by Zangwill because Marshall is opposed to Jewish political activity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0298.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Zangwill also criticized France severely for persecuting Dr. Nordau, who has sacrificed his life for France. Nordau's fortune was confiscated by the French government which feared that Nordau was a spy.</p>
   <p>"England is still the freest country in the world," said Mr. Zangwill. "The three Jewish governors of England's biggest colonies are bitterly disliked by the anti-Semites.</p>
   <p>"The Gentiles treat us as if we were Shylocks, and they have the insolence to call us Shylocks and capitalists. Henry Ford is the greatest danger in the world, if capitalism is a danger, because he is the richest man in the world. The Jews must organize against Ford because with his tiny brains and giant capital, he is potentially very dangerous. His money is paying for the slander and libel being spread against the Jews; his money is paying for the weapons to be used in pogroms against the Jews. Because we are Jews, we must fight Ford."</p>
   <p>In his speech, Mr. Zangwill also told about what the Bavarian and Hungarian <pb facs="5423972_6_0299.jpg" n="4"/>pogromists do with Ford's money.</p>
   <p>The newly rich Jews who push themselves where they are not wanted, were strongly censured by Mr. Zangwill. Nor was he sparing in his criticism of those Jews who always stay in Gentile hotels because they dislike being among Jews.</p>
   <p>He appealed for unity among Jews and came out strongly in favor of the Jews voting as Jews in the American elections, in order to be united against the "modern Hamans".</p>
   <p>There was a death-like stillness in the hall when Mr. Zangwill concluded his speech by reading one of his poems, an elegy [in memory] of the Jewish pogrom martyrs in the Ukraine.</p>
   <p>Last night's lecture will remain an historical event in the lives of the Jews <pb facs="5423972_6_0300.jpg" n="5"/>of Chicago because the "good Zangwill" honored them with a speech which will remain forever in their hearts.</p>
   <p>The whole program was very well organized, thanks to the efforts of Philip Seman, director of the Institute and his assistant, Edward Cohen, who had arranged everything carefully.</p>
   <p>Harry A. Lipsky, chairman of the Middle Western Zionist district, introduced Mr. Zangwill to the public as a "child and dreamer of the ghetto, who will now speak to his brothers of the ghetto".</p>
   <p>Mr. Zangwill entered the hall with Mr. N. Loebner of the Courier and a group of friends with whom Zangwill had spent the whole day, visiting Jewish institutions.</p>
