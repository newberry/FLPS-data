   <p>Quotations from an article by U. S. Schwartz, Chairman of the 1936 campaign for contributions"The Jewish Welfare Fund" represents the means through which the Jewish public can express its sense of responsibility for participation in the financial support of work on behalf of Jews outside of Chicago. It helps the community organize itself to do its duty particularly on behelf of those Jews resident abroad who require financial or other material aid.</p>
   <p>It was essential at the time that the first fund was raised that sufficient monies be found to do Chicago's full share in the financing relief on behalf of the Jewish populations in Germany, Poland and other European countries as well as to finance activities in Palestine. It was deemed also important that the civic organizations dealing with the problem of anti-semitism receive sufficient funds so that they might carry on their work.</p>
   <p>In 1934-35 the community raised $535,000 in the United Jewish appeal out of which funds, contributions were made to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, United Palestine Appeal. There was a note-worthy United Drive in 1925 which was a <pb facs="5423972_6_0530.jpg" n="2"/>campaign for $4,000,000. The principal funds were used for the purpose of building the new Mount Sinai Hospital, the Nurses Training School at the Michael Reese Hospital and the new building of the J. P. J.</p>
   <p>The campaign of 1936 set as its goal the raising of $750,000. In the prospectus it was indicated that 85% or $643.500 would be for foreign relief in Germany and Poland, for work in Palestine and for relief and immigration organizations dealing with the problem of resettlement of Jews throughout the world, 7 % or $50,000 was set aside for civis and protective organizations, 5% or $35,000 to the Board of Jewish Education and 3 % or $22,500 for other local needs as they might arise and for a reserve fund. At this writing the campaign has succeeded in raising $780,738 from 7502 subscribers."</p>
