   <p>We are informed that there are about ten thousand contributors to the Denver Sanatorium of the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society. Up to now, only a few of those contributors have taken an active interest in the organization. The other members have sent in their checks and that was the end of it. Now the J. C. R. S. [Jewish Consumptive Relief Society] wants more than money. It wants fresh blood--men and women who will contribute their brains and hearts in behalf of the interests of the institution, which for the past eighteen years has treated more than thirty-eight hundred Jewish men, women, and children sufferers from the dreaded "white plague", tuberculosis.</p>
   <p>Mr. Louis Resnik, publicity director of the J. C. R. S., has announced that <pb facs="5423972_6_1199.jpg" n="2"/>during the next few days an invitation will be extended to the Chicago directors of the organization to attend a conference which will take place in the Red Room of the La Salle Hotel, on Sunday evening, April 23. The purpose of this conference is to organize district number six of the J. C. S. R. (five such districts, each one embracing four states, have already been organized in the southern and western parts of the United States). It is hoped that all those called to the conference will attend, and that the old board of directors, appointed by the field secretary, will resign, so that a new board of directors, made up of local contributors, can be elected.</p>
   <p>Dr. Haim Spiwak, general secretary of the J. C. R. S. writes to us from the headquarters of the Society in Denver: "The aim of this organization is to give the contributors and the contributing organizations a voice in the management of the Denver institution, the world's greatest free sanatorium for Jewish tubercular patients."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1200.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Besides electing new directors, the conference will also elect one or two trustees. The local contributors and the directors will, through those trustees, participate in regulating the affairs of the Jewish Consumptive Relief Society. Dr. Spiwak will come here from Denver a few days before the conference, to assist in the organizing of the local district. Local speakers will also address the gathering. We are assured that no appeals for funds will be made at the conference.</p>
   <p>There should be a big crowd present at the conference in the La Salle Hotel next Sunday evening.</p>
