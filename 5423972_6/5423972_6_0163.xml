   <p>It would be very interesting to know how many Jews in Chicago know that there are eight Sabbath schools for Jewish children in different parts of the city which have a school population of over twelve hundred and which are doing wonderful work. The parents of the children and their close kin know, of course, all about the Sabbath schools, but the Jewish public at large does not know about these activities.</p>
   <p>How many Jews here in Chicago know that fourteen excellent Hebrew and Sabbath school teachers are engaged in Sabbath school work and are receiving pay for their good work? How many know the individuals who contribute to this worthy cause and are engaged in this work? Up to a few years ago, the Zionist Sabbath schools were the only ones in Chicago. Then the Council of Jewish Women became interested in Sabbath school work. The men followed. Now all the Sabbath schools are maintained by the donations of Mr. Julius Rosenwald, Mr. Joseph Harris, and others.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0164.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The committee of the Sabbath schools consists of Mr. J. S. Hartman; Dr. Zepin; Mr. Isler; Mr. Koven, the former superintendent of the Zionist Sabbath schools; and Mr. Pollock, the supintendent of the Sabbath school.</p>
   <p>Aside from these Sabbath schools there is one Sabbath school which is supported by an independent congregation under the supervision of Miss Bloom, Mr. Shulman, Mr. Levinson, and others.</p>
   <p>The Sabbath school work is being conducted in a slow and quiet manner; yet every Saturday and Sunday twelve hundred Jewish children are instructed in Hebrew and Jewish history.</p>
