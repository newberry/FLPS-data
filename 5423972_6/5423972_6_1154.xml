   <p>When a poor Jew comes to a Jewish hospital and begs to be saved from death because he is poisoned, and when, instead of saving him from a certain death, he, a poisoned man, is let to sit in the lobby for hours long and then he is told to go home, and the poor Jew dies--then such a Jewish hospital is a Sodom institution and its representatives should be indicted for murder in the first degree.</p>
   <p>A poor Jewish peddler, suffering from blood poisoning, came last Wednesday to the Mount Sinai Hospital, our kosher hospital, to which the United Charities gives every year about a quarter of a million dollars, and begged to be examined at once because his life was in danger. Nobody listened to him and, after hours of waiting, he was told to go home and that he would be called when needed. The Jew was brought to the County Hospital. The doctor <pb facs="5423972_6_1155.jpg" n="2"/>at the County Hospital said that if he had been brought two hours sooner his life could have been saved. So he came too late to the County Hospital, which, by the way, admitted him at once.</p>
   <p>The Jew died--a victim of the mismanagement, brutality, and cynicism of our Jewish kosher hospital.</p>
   <p>I do not know whether the poor Jew left a wife and children or not, but if he did leave a wife and children, they should sue the Mount Sinai Hospital for criminal negligence and damages. Had such a thing happened at a Gentile hospital, what a hue and cry would have been raised: Anti-Semitism! Klan business ! Ford business! and so on. Where is justice?</p>
   <p>Four years ago, I was brought half dead to the Mount Sinai Hospital. They let me wait in the lobby for a few hours before they paid any attention to me, although I had a "pull". They found a place for me, after three hours of waiting, in a small dark room. I lay in bed for three hours, from <pb facs="5423972_6_1156.jpg" n="3"/>nine till twelve, and did not see a doctor or a nurse. When I regained consciousness and began to ring the bell, I received a glass of milk after begging strenuously for it. An old Italian Gentile woman came in late at night and said she was the nurse. All night long the sound of her heavy shoes trampling over the room did not let me sleep even for a minute. As soon as dawn came, I dressed hastily and ran away. Next day I received a bill from the hospital for eighteen dollars. I paid the bill but henceforth I knew that the Mount Sinai Hospital is managed in a mean, conscienceless spirit.</p>
   <p>Four years have passed since then. I thought that during this time the Mount Sinai Hospital became better, but, as you see, it has become much worse. I have now a faint understanding of how poor people are treated at the Mount Sinai Hospital. If a newspaper man is being let to sit in the lobby for three hours without anybody paying any attention to him, what happens to poor Jews whom nobody knows?</p>
