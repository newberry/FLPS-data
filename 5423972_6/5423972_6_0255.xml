   <p>The Beth Hamedrash Hagodol Theological Seminary B'nai Jacob, 138 Pacific Avenue, have just completed a comfortable school house and dwelling two doors south of their synagogue. The school recently organized by Rabbi Lesser......has already seventy children, divided into four classes, where they are taught Hebrew and the Jewish religion. Aside from the Rabbi, there are three teachers.</p>
   <p>The school hours are from 7:30 A. M., till 12 noon. And from 2 P. M., until 8 P. M. with the usual recesses. The first class, which is the elementary department and who do not attend yet the public schools, remain nearly all day in that school. But such as attend the public schools, receive instruction before 9 A. M., and after 3:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>The instruction consists only of acquiring the reading, grammar and translation of the Pentateuch, and the intonation peculiar to the reading of the Chumesh (Bible) and prayers. Whatever instructions given are necessarily in the Russo-Polish jargon (Yiddish)......For the present, the expenses are defrayed by private subscriptions and exhibits among the denizens of that <pb facs="5423972_6_0256.jpg" n="2"/>not very salubrious locality a creditable effort to improve themselves and their districts. The regime is yet of the most ancient mediaeval Jewish orthodox stripe.</p>
