   <p>This organization was established in 1859. The members of the Ramah Lodge, the oldest Lodge of the famous order B'nai B'rith, in this city, were the first instigators of this charitable association. Right here, I will touch upon the sad fact, that there are here certain persons who are making it their special business to injure the name and character of this well managed institution, and by its last report it seems as though these persons have succeeded to injure it among the general public, which is withdrawing its support from the R. A. in a very distressing manner. How thinking, reasonable, and otherwise just and kind-hearted people, can doubt for a moment the integrity and honesty of an institution with which men like Hart, Greensfelder, Gerstley, Rosenberg, Eisendrath, Julius Rosenthal, Snydacker, Simons, Kozminsky, and many other prominent Israelites, were and are still connected, is a perfect mystery, and what is still more remarkable is the fact, that <pb facs="5423972_6_1070.jpg" n="2"/>among the Kesher fraternity of this Association, and that our brethren from Russia and Poland, who furnish the most applicants for relief, entirely neglect to support the Society.</p>
   <p>As far as I know, they have no reason to complain, and no charges to substantiate against the Relief. Never before was this institution managed on such a sound business basis as during the last few years, since it is under the management of the very efficient and conscientious superintendent, Mr. F. Kish.</p>
