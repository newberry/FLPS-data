   <p>The Young Men's Hebrew Charity Association was hard at work to make this year's charity ball, the nineteenth since the establishment of the organization, the grandest in the way of entertainment as well as the greatest financial success. This expectation was fulfilled in every way to the great satisfaction of the Association. At this early hour no correct figures can be given, but it was estimated that the net proceeds would exceed $40,000 inclusive of the $10,000 auction sale of theatre boxes. The Association has announced, that 10% of this amount would be turned over to Mayor Harrison for distribution among the needy of the city and the rest will be distributed as usual among twenty-two charitable societies with Michael Reese hospital as the special beneficiary.</p>
   <p>.....As mentioned before, the auction of theatre boxes yielded a profit of $10,000 with the Standard Club as the highest bidder, paying $1,250.00 for the box and then, graciously refrained from the use of same. The Standard Club's example was followed by the Lakeside Club, Victor F. Lawson, the Chicago Tribune, and Oscar Foreman, who also returned the acquired boxes for a re-sale......</p>
