   <p>News now reaching us from many cities of the United States, informs us that certain philanthropists are organizing loan banks where workers and small business shall be able to procure small loans at easy payments and low interest rates. This moved American newspapers to devote their front and editorial pages to this activity.</p>
   <p>In the non-Jewish world, these loan banks are a novelty, a gigantic enterprise and a great reform. Whenever the non-Jewish worker and small business man happen to get in a tight spot due to hard times or illness, they have but two ways out, either to humiliate themselves and become public charges or fall into the clutches of a usurer, who charges such a high interest rate as to render it impossible for them to regain their former status.</p>
   <p>Therefore, the establishment of such bank is of great benefit to this class <pb facs="5423972_6_0739.jpg" n="2"/>of people, and newspapers are lauding these philanthropists, who have found a source, which hitherto has not existed, that will benefit society.</p>
   <p>This sort of news is a novelty in the non-Jewish world, but it is a very old custom in Jewish life, where for many centuries there have been in the Jewish communities charitable institutions where small loans are granted free of interest charges to anyone in need of them. The expenses to carry on such loans are defrayed by the Jewish community.</p>
   <p>Even to this very day many loans of this type are being made in Chicago. Practically every synagogue and every Verein has its loan bank, which grants certain sums to members and outsiders. And whoever borrows money repay the sum by small weekly payments and in most cases without any interest. It is most desirable that the non-Jewish world now learns about this altruistic Jewish work. We were asked to find out about all charitable loans in the Jewish districts and report our findings to people who want to honor and glorify the Jews.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0740.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We know that there are so many that it is impossible to render an exact account without falling into error. We therefore wish that all secretaries of these charitable loan banks would send us the names and addresses of their respective institutions, accompanied with a report of the amount of money they loan out annually and any other available information.</p>
   <p>Secretaries and Presidents of loan organizations should do this for the sake of Jewish glory.</p>
