   <p>Amass meeting of Jewish young men was held on March 13, 1892, at Kimball Hall. This mass meeting, composed of five-hundred young men of the city of Chicago, deeming prompt action better than slow relief, does now and hereby constitute itself a society to be known hereafter as "The Young Men's Russian Relief Association."</p>
   <p>The object of this organization is to cooperate with the executive committee of the Russian Aid Society, for the purpose of placing as speedily as possible the Jewish exiles driven from Russia, their native land, in such surroundings and positions as will make them self-supporting, with due and careful regard to the physical and moral requirements of the newcomers and the best interest of all classes of the general population of our country.</p>
   <p>The government of this association is to be vested in a board of directors, consisting of fifteen members, to be elected by this body, and the qualifications for which shall be that these are young men, and the board of directors are hereby fully vested with power to make all further rules and regulations <pb facs="5423972_6_0983.jpg" n="2"/>and qualifications for membership of this organization as may seem to them just and proper.</p>
   <p>The following gentlemen were them selected as the executive committee: Oscar G. Foreman, Moses Solomon, Milton J. Foreman, August Gatzert, Julius E. Weil, Leo A. Loeb, Harry Pflaum, David Eichberg, Israel Cowen, Leon Hornstein, M. H. Mandelbaum, Ed. A. Rosenthal, Hilton A. Strauss, Leopold Oesterreicher and Sol D. Lee.</p>
   <p>The chair appointed a committee on collections, selecting one member from each if the organizations of our city wherein young men are represented, as follows: Phoenix Club, M. J. Spiegel; Ideal Club, S. J. Marks; Chicago Lodge, H. W. Hahn; West Chicago Club, Maurice Rothschild; Standard Club, Edwin F. Meyer; Herder Lodge, Max Guthman; Zion Literary Society, J. Ringer; North-West Chicago Club, Leo Taussig; Montefiore Council, Sam Rosenthal; Myrtle Council, Moritz Hirsch; Cremieux Society, Leon V. Becker; Concordia, Ralph Leopold; Lakeside Club, Maurice L. Ash; Lessing Club, Max Pam.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0984.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On Tuesday night, the newly elected executive committee met and organized by electing the following officers: President, Milton J. Foreman; First Vice-President, Julius E. Weil; Second Vice-President, Leon Hornstein; Recording Secretary, M. H. Mandelbaum; Financial Secretary, Harry Pflaum; Treasurer, Oscar G. Foreman.</p>
   <p>The committee on collections are already actively at work, and the result of their labor is seen in the contributions that are being obtained. The work is being pushed systematically, and many thousands of dollars will be raised among the young men.</p>
