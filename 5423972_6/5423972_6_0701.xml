   <p>From the first day that The Daily World began to unveil the action of the "Ladies Aid Society," where Misses Low and Schulman are the leaders and are in authority, hundreds of people have overwhelmed us with questions. The questions can be classified into two types. One is: What should be done now, whereby those who are impoverished can attain a degree of independence so that they will not have to turn to charity; and what should be done to insure that they will be treated humanely and not be sent to any insane asylum?</p>
   <p>The second type embodies the question: What can be done to enable the poor through their, own methods and efforts, to avoid charity societies, even under the present system?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0702.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first question can be answered only when the people, those who do not accept charity become interested in the fate of the poor, the unfortunate, and the weak, and through public opinion, influence the City Council and State Legislature to make a thorough investigation as to why Miss Low and Miss Shulman can admit anyone they please to Dunning!</p>
   <p>All cases that they have transacted should be investigated, and the doors of Dunning must be opened so as to reveal the reasons why persons were sent there by the "Ladies Aid Society."</p>
   <p>Only such a thorough investigation will give us a true picture of those, who become victims of present condition, and, at the same time, victims of the actions of two women, who become dangerous to the welfare of those who were forced to apply for charity.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0703.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Hundreds of men and women turn to the "Ladies Aid Society." These two investigators determine their fate, with heartless and ice-cold accounts, and by treating them, not as human beings, but as pieces of wood on iron. If the investigated would refuse to tolerate their methods, they are thrown, by force, into an insane asylum and many pine away, there, because the entire reign had been given over to a few people, who had become an annex to the corrupted political machine of Chicago's government, which has such a "good name" throughout the entire country!</p>
   <p>All those who are in sympathy with the unfortunate victims of the present system, and who they would help prevent such acts in the future, we urge the City Council and, if possible, the State Legislature, to elect an Investigation Committee that should make a thorough investigation of Dunning, Elgin State Hospital, and the Kankakee Insane Asylum, to find out how many Jewish men and women were sent there by the "Ladies Aid Society."</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0704.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>After such an investigation, Miss Low and Miss Shulman will have to seriously consider whether they should send sane people to an insane asylum.</p>
   <p>The second type of the question is answered in the report of the records of the "Ladies Aid Society," itself. According to the figures that Comrade Uretz obtained from the Society, it can be seen thet 815 cases, which Miss Shulman investigated when the applicants came for relief, they found 15 members of the unions. There were 8 bakers, of the 15, who got tuberculosis, while working at their trades.</p>
   <p>What do these figures mean? What do we learn from this fact? We learn that those who apply to the charity societies remained out of the ranks of a union and out of the ranks of a mutual aid organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0705.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Had these people belonged to a union, or to an organization, such as the Workmen's Circle, they would not have had to apply to any charity.</p>
   <p>First of all, the union men are always in a better economic condition. Through the protection that the union gives the worker against the exploitation of the employers, a thorough investigation must be demanded by every clear thinking and good-hearted person.</p>
