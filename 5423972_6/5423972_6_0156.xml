  <body>
   <p>We wish to announce to our worthy public that, having seen the necessity of establishing a Hebrew school in the district west of Center Street, we have opened a school at 414 South Paulina Street. We have engaged two teachers who are experienced in modern pedagogy and Hebrew teaching.</p>
   <p>We are daily approached by poor parents who are unable to pay tuition for their children. At present we have no accommodations for them. At a meeting of the members of the Congregation B'nai Moshe, however, it was decided to erect a building to house our rapidly growing school. In order to make the new school a community institution we decided to name it in honor of the memory of the learned Rabbi Abraham Samuel Brody, may he rest in peace. We have set aside a fund of $500.</p>
   <p>We beg our worthy Jewish public, therefore, to visit our synagogue and participate in the plans to raise sufficient funds to erect the building.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0157.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Many contributions have already been received. We wish to thank the donors, and hope that many more Chicago Jews will answer the appeal. The names of the contributors will be listed regularly in the Daily Jewish Courier.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>Isaiah Ginsburg, president,</p>
   <p>Wolf Bookey, secretary.</p>
