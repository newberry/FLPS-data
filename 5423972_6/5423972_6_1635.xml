   <p>The Daily Jewish Courier has published several articles in reference to the outstanding Jewish institutions in Chicago. In this article, we will write of the Marks Nathan Orphans Home. The founder is the prominent charitable gentleman, Mr. Marcus Nathan. It is located on N. Wood street, and was founded in 1906. At the beginning the Home had only nineteen children. Two of these nineteen were taken out of a Catholic asylum in which they had been taught the Christian religion. If they had not been removed from the asylum, they certainly would have remained Christians. As a matter of fact, one of the two children was already so far advanced in Christianity that it took several months to reconvert her to the Jewish religion. She is now again a Jewish daughter who is proud to be one of us. This example will convince the Jews of Chicago how important it is to have an orphan home for Jewish children. It is not right to take innocent Jewish orphans and turn them over to a Christian asylum. We should care for our own unfortunate orphans. Most of all they need the proper training in Judaism according to the wishes of their parents who passed on before their time.</p>

   <p>The Training.</p>
   <p>Children between the ages of four and twelve are eligible for the Jewish Orphan Home. They get a real Jewish training. They are taught everything Jewish as any pious Jewish family teaches their own children. However, it is not the Jewish religion alone that is being taught. Competent teachers instruct the children in morality and honesty in order to make of them upright American citizens. Their training and studies are divided into two parts. In the morning the children are sent to public schools and kindergarten. After school hours they are instructed in the Hebrew language and the Jewish religion, the institution has two separate schools with four teachers. Mr. Saul Druker is the superintendent of these schools and an educational committee looks after their management. An hour and a half is devoted to art and craft training. The older girls are given instructions in piano, violin, sewing, knitting, short-hand and typing. The purpose is to provide them with a profession after they leave the institution. The older boys are also instructed in music. No child in the institution is compelled to take up music or any kind of a trade. It is left entirely to their own desires. In other words, voluntarily, and usually, eagerly do they acquire a trade which they intend to follow when they are grown and ready to leave the Orphans Home.</p>
