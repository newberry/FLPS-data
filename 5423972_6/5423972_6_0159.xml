   <p>A Worthy Institution.</p>
   <p>The necessity for an institution that will unite the social and cultural forces of the North West Side Jewish community has long been felt. We have long needed an institution where our youth and their parents could meet on their own levels and help bring on a better understanding between them. We have also felt the need for an educational institution to bring to our youth their cultural ancestry and an understanding of Jewish life and Jewish history.</p>
   <p>Evening classes for men and women have been organized in the English language, American History and the basic law of the land. Lectures on Jewish History and Literature in English and Yiddish are given by well known lecturers.</p>
   <p>We have a reading room for old and young where periodicals in Hebrew and Russian may be had. Classes in Art, Elocution, Dramatic Art, Housekeeping, <pb facs="5423972_6_0160.jpg" n="2"/>Adding-machine Operating and Photography are offered.</p>
   <p>A daily Hebrew School is being opened where Jewish children may receive a Hebrew education. Playrooms and club rooms are open to everyone. Many social groups meet regularly in our rooms.</p>
   <p>Jews of the North West Side are invited to inspect the institution and take advantage of its opportunities. We hope to make this the center of Jewish life of the North West Side Jewish community. The address is 15-17 Marion Place.</p>
   <p>Respectfully</p>
   <p>Abraham S. Sofar.</p>
