  <body>
   <p>One of the most useful things for the Chicago Jewry is to own a Jewish hospital. This necessity is felt every day and it is a shame that our Orthodox Jewish Community takes so little interest in it.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that the building of the Maimonides Hospital is now dark and void, testifying to the disgrace of our inactiveness.</p>
   <p>With such a vast number of orthodox Jews in Chicago, why should we not have at least one hospital? It is true that there are many hospitals where infirm Jews are accepted, but this is no reason why we shouldn't have a private infirmary.</p>
   <p>Why should our brethren turn to others for medical aid? It is no secret that <pb facs="5423972_6_1279.jpg" n="2"/>several hospitals, already overfilled with Jewish patients, are not very satisfied with our kind. When we first came to Chicago, we did not build up a new district, but we pushed out the inhabitants who lived in it. Now we are filling up their hospitals and driving out their sick. They look upon us as thieves, as people who are not builders but grabbers of what others have built. Why do we rely upon institutions built by other people?</p>
   <p>A community wanting to earn the respect of its neighbors must do its own useful work instead of depending upon others. A person who does not work but merely lives off the fruit of others, is considered a parasite-yielding nothing and taking all. The same holds true with a community. A community gets the cooperation of its neighbors when it builds institutions from which they can derive use.</p>
   <p>If our community would not have its own orphanage, entrusting destitute children to unallied hands, it would be the greatest infamy to everyone of us.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1280.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If we would not possess our own home for the aged, it would humiliate every Jew. And the same goes for a hospital.</p>
   <p>A hospital is recognized by all as one of the most important institutions in a community. Our German-Jewish brethren have realized this full well, and they built one of the largest hospitals in the country. The Michael Reese Hospital cannot, however, accommodate the hundreds and thousands of our non-German Jews. Therefore, we must have a large Jewish hospital on the West Side.</p>
   <p>As a large group in this community, we must build and create in order to show what we can achieve. Why should our children who study medicine resort to foreign hospitals for practice? Don't you know that they have their own children, for whom they must worry? Why should our daughters who wish to become nurses turn to foreign hospitals? Why should our sick ones, in the hundreds and thousands, be scattered and dispersed in hospitals of other nationalities? Don't you know that our orthodox Jews cannot feel comfortable <pb facs="5423972_6_1281.jpg" n="4"/>in such hospitals, where everything is exotic, where the food is not served according to their taste?</p>
   <p>How honorable would it be for us Jews if we would build a hospital of which both God and man would be pleased! How much honor would it throw upon our community if the Jewish Orthodox Hospital of Chicago, the Maimonides Hospital, now standing like a mourner lamenting, a laughing stock to everyone passing by, would revive and again occupy a respectable place among the local infirmaries, a hospital where the Jewish sick ones will not feel out of place, where the Jewish doctors will be able to develop their abilities for the good of the patients, and where our sons and daughters can progress in their studies without any interference or interruption!</p>
   <p>Let us not lose courage on account of the Maimonides Hospital's not being a success from its inception. We are a young community. A child does not lose courage on account of its many falls before walking properly. We should learn how to run a hospital, and it costs money to learn. Let us prove that <pb facs="5423972_6_1282.jpg" n="5"/>the money is not wasted; that we have learned how to run a Jewish Orthodox Hospital in the city.</p>
   <p>We have a population of more than one hundred thousand in our district. If each of us should contribute one dollar a year, we would have an annual fund of more than one hundred thousand dollars. With it, we could support one of the best hospitals in the country. You should also bear in mind that there are many wealthy Jews who are willing to assist us, morally and financially, as soon as we justify the need of such an institution.</p>
   <p>Had it not been for one of our West Side brothers, Morris Kordon, a true Jewish nobleman, the Maimonides Hospital would have been already sold under the hammer. Mr. Kordon purchased the bonds from most of the creditors, thus stopping the sale. In order to redeem this hospital, ten thousand dollars is immediately needed. Of this, six thousand has already been raised. This is the first step toward the revival of our hospital. Further plans concerning the rules and reorganization must be carried through by an organization under the leadership <pb facs="5423972_6_1283.jpg" n="6"/>of Mr. Kordon, and a committee of prominent Jews, in which we must all participate.</p>
   <p>It would be plausible if each congregation and each organization would elect a committee to be brought into relationship with Mr. Kordon and the hospital committee, so that they may work systematically together for the success of the Jewish hospital.</p>
