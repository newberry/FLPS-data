   <p>These figures show that during the first ten years of the Association's work, the receipts kept steady pace with the wants of our poor, and the healthy growth of our city. This pleasing prospect was rudely disturbed by the Great Fire of 1871.</p>
   <p>The following year our collections were very meager, but our co-religionists from abroad, with more than royal generosity, came to our relief.</p>
   <p>In 1873, the Association seemed to recover its wanted vigor and usefulness, but the July fire in 1874, arrested its progress, and compelled the Board to borrow, for immediate wants, from the Hospital Fund.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1074.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In 1874-5, our friends responded nobly in answer to our call and rolled up the receipts to the handsome sum of twelve thousand dollars. From that hour contributions began to lessen. Today, they are wholly insufficient to support our sick, our crippled, our diseased, and our honest poor, without considering the horde of professional beggars.</p>
   <p>Upon their application and statement that their fortunes would be bettered thereby, 19 families were sent during the past year to different parts of this country, and two to Europe. Of the 80 sent away during the past three years, 8 returned.</p>
