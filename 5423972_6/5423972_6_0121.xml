   <p>Graduation exercises of the Jewish Training School: A picnic of the Northwest Side Ladies' Auxiliary of the Old People's Home. Fine concert by a young Jewish Boy at the Hull House. An Informal Dinner of the Institute Club of the Chicago Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ben Reitman and Miss Emma Goldman.</p>
   <p>The Twentieth Annual Graduation Exercises of the Jewish Training School will take place Sunday, June 19, at 3 o'clock, in the afternoon, at the school auditorium, Clinton and Judge Streets. Entrance by ticket only. Tickets can be obtained at the school upon request.</p>
   <p>Dr. Gonzales, President of Armour Institute will be the Speaker of the evening. Mr. H.F. Frank, President of the Board of Education of the Jewish Training School, will distribute the diplomas. The Jewish Training School Alumni will give a Supper at the Hull House on Saturday Evening. All graduates of the school are invited to be present.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0122.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Tickets are reasonably priced, at 35 cents,</p>
   <p>The Chicago Health Department has issued a bulletin saying that people should spend more time in the open air, with the coming of the Spring weather. Therefore, the Ladies Auxiliary of the Old Peoples Home, has arranged its first picnic of the year for this coming Sunday, at Kolze's Electric Park.</p>
   <p>The Milwaukee Avenue car, transfer to Irving Park Boulevard, will take you there, for one-nickel. Admission to the Park is twenty-five cents. Bring your families and enjoy the open air.</p>
   <p>Abe Greenfield, son of the well-known Jewish writer, will give a violin concert at the Hull House on Saturday evening.</p>
   <p>Abe Greenfield is 15 years old, and has for some time shown a very fine talent for the violin. He has spellbound his audiences at many a concert. Some <pb facs="5423972_6_0123.jpg" n="3"/>time ago Mischa Elman, after hearing the young Greenfield play, persuaded him to go to New York and pursue his musical studies there. He now plays better than ever before.</p>
   <p>The Institute Club of the Chicago Hebrew Institute will have an informal dinner, Sunday evening, in their clubrooms on the top floor of Chicago Hebrew Institute Annex. The guest of the evening will be Mr. Isaac Silberstein, former Club Director of the Hebrew Institute and former Superintendent of the Deborah Boys' Club.</p>
   <p>The"Milwaukee Victory" will be the theme of Mr. Ben Reitman's talk at the West Side Auditorium, where Miss Emma Goldman will also talk on "Crime and Criminals". Miss Goldman seems to have changed her name and now lectures in a quiet tone, treating her subjects scientifically. Neither of these speakers need any introduction to Chicagoans.</p>
