   <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>
   <p>In 1859 the United Hebrew Relief Association, the predecessor of the United Hebrew Charities, was organized.</p>
   <p>During the past year we have received for the Relief Department over $26,500, and have expended nearly $28,500, the exact deficit being $1,678.63. We are indebted to the Executive Committee in aid of the Russian Refugees that the deficit did not exceed $5,000. They averted this by turning over to us $3,700 in cash and a $500 note, the balance of their funds. More interesting, however, are the items of expenditure. Nearly $7,300 was the cost of administration, repayment of loans, investment in relief building, and other expenditures not given directly for relief. Of the $21,000 expended directly in the work the regular recipients, over 40 in number, received more than $4,500; $2,400 was expended for transportation; $250 for free burials; and $13,500 for general relief work; in supplying food, clothing, medical aid and habitation to the poor and the sick. The total number of cases assisted was 3,134, consisting of 13,000 persons, an increase over last year of 31 per cent. Transportation expenditures increased over 53 per cent. To transients was given nearly $1,400, an increase over last year of more than <pb facs="5423972_6_0969.jpg" n="2"/>135 per cent; ten thousand articles of wearing apparel, and nearly 1,500 pairs of shoes were distributed; and 800 school boys were clothed. No child attending the public schools or the Jewish Training School need be in want of clothing or shoes. The only requirement is inability of the parents to provide them and the certificate of the teacher that the child is attending school. Old clothes of all kinds in good condition can always be used and will be thankfully received at the Relief Office.</p>
