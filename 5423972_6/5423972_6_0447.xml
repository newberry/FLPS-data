   <p>The famous Jewish Soccer football team, Hakoah, which will play against the local Sparta team Sunday, May 9, in Comiskey Park, arrived, yesterday in Chicago.</p>
   <p>They were greeted at the La Salle Station by a group of sport fans, and prominent social leaders. The delegation that received them consisted of the Judge Friend, Judge Barelli, and Fred Bunstein, ex-president of the Covenant Club.</p>
   <p>The noted Jewish athletes were directed to the City Hall where they were officially greeted in the name of the city by Mayor Dever.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0448.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The renouned Austrian lawyer, Dr. W. Rosenfield, is the trainer and manager of Hakoah. Dr. Rosenfield stated that Hakoah, which consists of a group of Jewish athletes plays the soccer game without liking it. Many members of Hakoah are professional people. Some are lawyers, doctors, engineers.</p>
   <p>In Austria they play important roles in social life. They have devoted themselves to this game because they want to demonstrate to the world that Jews possess in addition to spiritual power, also physical, and that they do not take a back seat in the sport world.</p>
