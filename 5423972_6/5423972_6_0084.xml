   <p>The civics and naturalization bureau of all the important departments of the Institute: The bureau of civics and naturalization has taken its place with a few others in the foremost rank. This activity inaugurated over a year ago, has become one of the popular classes maintained here. Its purpose is two-fold: To help Americanize the immigrant, by acquainting him with the various departments of our Government, their object and the methods by which we are governed; and, secondly, to prepare him for his citizenship papers, by explaining the provisions of our Constitution, and making him familiar with the history of our country. This activity started with a very small registration, but in a short time its fame spread throughout the West Side. So that in a year's time there have been over six-hundred persons who have availed themselves of the opportunities of the class. Out of this number, about a score have been prepared for citizenship, of which number only one failed.</p>
