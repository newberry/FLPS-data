<title level="a">ZANGWILL VISITS THE WEST SIDE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Israel Zangwill lectured yesterday afternoon at the Blackstone Theater on the subject of "Drama and Life," and then took an automobile ride through the West Side, accompanied by J. Loebner and Leo Silberman of the Courier. He also visited the editorial office of the Courier. He repeated to Harry A. Lipsky, chairman of the Middle West Zionist organization, the promise he had made to Dr. Chaim Weizmann in New York, that he would be willing to deliver a lecture for the benefit of the Keren Hayesod ["exchequer" of World Zionist Organization]. Mr. Zangwill is of the opinion that Palestine cannot be built by philanthropy alone. He also thinks that the Keren Hayesod is not quite the proper way to raise money, but money is needed to build Palestine and he is ready to help raise it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zangwill also paid a visit to a cousin of his, Mr. A. Alperin, secretary of the Congregation Anshe Kneseth Israel, at his residence on Fifteenth Street, <pb facs="5423972_6_0305.jpg" n="2"/>where Mr. Zangwill had lunch. Sitting at the table, the honored guest recalled that Mr. Alperin had often given him theater tickets in London, when he, Zangwill, was a boy and could not afford to buy them. Mr. Zangwill then remarked, humorously, that now Mr. Alperin and his entire family can go to the Blackstone Theater every evening to see a good show, without worrying about tickets, because Zangwill's latest play, "We Moderns," a satirical comedy, is being presented.</p>
   <p>Tonight, Mr. Zangwill will visit the Palace Theater where Mr. Honigman is staging Ansky's "Dibbuk".</p>
