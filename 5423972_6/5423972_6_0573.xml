   <p>A drive is started in Chicago for five thousand new members to the United Hebrew Charities, which supports twenty-one various Jewish institutions, which have in the course of years been built by both reform and orthodox Jews.</p>
   <p>The number of subscribers in the Jewish Charities is very small in comparison with the Jewish population of Chicago. It appears that only a handful of Jews keep up the charity, and it is possible that, that is the reason that the democratic spirit which we would like, does not exist there.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0574.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is also remarkable that just that small group that has kept up the charities has introduced the campaign for a large membership, not because they want to dispose of the burden of maintaining the charities, but just want to have more Jews shoulder the responsibility of social work, so that when their time comes, and they must cease their work, there will be others to take their places.</p>
   <p>This is their view of the matter. Our position on charity is entirely different.</p>
   <p>As long as the present system of inequality of exploitation will exist, tens of thousands of people will eventually be forced to come to the charities. It is a fact that the same philanthropist who gives so much money for charity is often one of the greatest exploiters.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0575.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We are not speaking on the point of charity, now. We are speaking now of the raising of funds to keep up the charity institutions, and we say that it is the duty of every person who can afford to pay a minimum of twenty five dollars a year, to belong to the charities. This will offer a double advantage. First, the great majority of Jews will have the right to voice their opinion in the charities, and will be able to bring in their democratic ideas and principles, second, the entire character of charity will be changed, because then we will not give the orphan, the widow, the distressed, the unemployed nor the sick, what is now called charity, but we will give them brotherly help.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0576.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The more subscribers of the democratic element that will join the charities, the better it will be for the victims of our society, who are forced to come for help to the charities.</p>
   <p>It is therefore the duty of Chicago's broad social opinion to help in the present drive for subscribers to the Jewish charities.</p>
