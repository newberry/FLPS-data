<title level="a">HOSPITAL REORGANIZATION COMMITTEE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Hospital Reorganization Committee, which consists of nine members, is already organized, it was disclosed today. To judge by the reputation enjoyed by the members of the Committee, it is but an easy guess that the public will have the utmost confidence in it and will patiently wait to see the Maimoedes Hospital on a basis becoming a Jewish hospital.</p>
   <p>The Committee consists of Chicago's most competent Jewish civic leaders, as well as business and professional people, who have been successful in private and social undertakings. The chairman, Mr. James Davis, and the members, Mr. Samuel Phillipson, B. J. <pb facs="5423972_6_1308.jpg" n="2"/>Schiff, and Judge Harry M. Fisher have already exhibited their ability in the reorganization of the Marks Nathan Orphanage, which they organized on such a basis as to leave no room for dissatisfaction. The other members of the Committee, August Turner, M. Mover, I. Lurie, S. J. Rosenblatt, and Max Shullman, are not new in Jewish welfare work.</p>
   <p>The Committee, together with the new superintendent, Dr. Moss, who comes directly from Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York to take over the management of the Maimonedes Hospital, is a guarantee to the Jewish public that everything will be established along correct lines.</p>
   <p>It is no more than right that the Reorganization Committee should go on with its work unhampered by outside pressure. The hospital <pb facs="5423972_6_1309.jpg" n="3"/>question should be entirely dropped from the agenda until the work is completed. The members of the Committee are well qualified and quite responsible to plan everything that is to be carried out. Whatever reforms may be necessary, should come from and for the hospital, and not to satisfy certain persons to whom the ambition to act as advisors stands higher than the benefits of a public institution.</p>
   <p>It should be borne in mind that the reorganization of a hospital is more difficult than the reorganizing of other charitable institutions. A charitable organization, like the Marks Nathan, is strictly business, but this hospital is half charity and half business. And when it is a question of charity, individual interests are fatal. We can, therefore, expect those who have up to now been assailing the hospital on account of the business end, to continue their campaign of slinging mud at the <pb facs="5423972_6_1310.jpg" n="4"/>hospital or at any person connected with the Reorganization Committee.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, the Committee is made up of such a recognized personnel as even the most critical faultfinders will, in order to camouflage their reputation as chronic faultfinders, become conservative in their mud-slinging. Should they attempt to impede the committee in its work, they will not gain the support of right thinking people.</p>
