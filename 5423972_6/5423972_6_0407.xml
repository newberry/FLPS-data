   <p>Gregory Maxim in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Yesterday, a reporter of the Daily Jewish Courier was privileged to interview Gregory Maxim, well known Russian revolutionist and opponent of the Jewish faction of the Duma, the Russian Parliamentary Body. Mr. Maxim is now in Chicago and will speak at the West Side Auditorium tonight. The name Maxim is an assumed name and he would not reveal his true Jewish name. Mr. Maxim has come to the United States in the interests of the Russian Revolution. His purpose is to inform the American public, and particularly the Jewish public of conditions in Russia.</p>
   <p>Here is what he has to say: "The Jews in Russia can expect nothing from the Duma. Equal rights for minority groups have not even been discussed." "The Jews have twelve delegates in the Duma, five of whom are political Zionists and the others, liberals. At the opening of the Duma, when answers should have been given to the 'Throne Speech' these delegates proved that they were thoroughly incapable of properly representing those people who <pb facs="5423972_6_0408.jpg" n="2"/>had elected them to office. They said not one word on behalf of the Jewish masses; they said not one word in the interest of equal legal rights for Jews; they remained quiet merely hoping for the best and fearing the worst. These representatives promised their electorate to do great things for them, but, like all other politicians, have forgotten their promises. We the Bundist did not take part in the elections for we knew that the Duma was only a sham."</p>
   <p>"Jewish youth is very close to the Bundist or Socialist Revolutionary movements. Political Zionists are not numerous, but there are many Zionist Territorialists and Zionist Socialists who are close to the revolutionary movement."</p>
   <p>Maxim will remain in Chicago five days and will address a number of meetings.</p>
