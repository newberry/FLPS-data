  <body>
   <p>If you have any children in the Workmen's Circle schools and you are interested in sending them to the children's colony (Yehupetz), which was opened by the Circle, in Tri-River, Michigan, you must register them not later than June 25.</p>
   <p>The children in Yehupetz will be supplied with strictly fresh food, will be out in the fresh country air, will be under the constant supervision of the teachers and will be away from city noise and filth. The colony is near Cooper's well known Summer resort, and also near a small lake, with fields forests and gardens all around it.</p>
   <p>The first group of children will leave July 1, and it takes a few days to make preparations. All necessary information can be obtained at the schools, any day.</p>
