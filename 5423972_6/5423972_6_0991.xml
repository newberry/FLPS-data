   <p>From Dr. A. R. Levy's report as superintendent of the new organization to aid the Russian refugees that come to this city.</p>
   <p>"During the first half of the present month, our board listened to 58 applications, 38 of these were families with children comprising in all 187 souls. The balance of 20 applications were either of families without children or individuals making an aggregate of 212 persons; 23 families were assisted with one month's rent for their respective homes and some provided with furniture. Work has been found for nearly all of the heads of families."</p>
   <p>Each day of the week, two or three members of the Advisory Board are at the office, 493 S. Jefferson Street, from 9 - 12 o'clock to listen to the applications taken by the superintendent. The Zion Personal Service Society is represented daily by two ladies. The Advisory Board meets every Monday afternoon at 4 o'clock and the Executive Committee the same night at 8 o'clock. The Sheltering Society meets once a week and is presided over by Mr. J. Lewis.</p>
