   <p>More than 500 men and women, from Chicago, were present at the dedication and all returned home highly pleased with the great achievement of the Chicago Consumptive Aid Society.</p>
   <p>The Sanitarium is conveniently situated high above sea level. It cost $77,000.</p>
   <p>Beautiful and impressive ceremonies were carried through on the grounds of the Sanitarium at the official opening. In the cource of the speeches that were held, more tribute was paid to Mrs. Hirshberg, president of the Chicago Consumptive Aid, than any one else.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1140.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mrs. Hirshberg is the founder of the Society which now counts about 2,500 members. A large sum of money was gathered at the dedication. London and Zimmerman paid $1000 for the golden key. London and Zimmerman are considered as the most devoted workers for the Sanitarium. They donated paint with which the building was painted by the Jewish Painters Local without any charges.</p>
