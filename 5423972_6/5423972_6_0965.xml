   <p>Reports, setting forth the great work accomplished by the Society in Aid of Russian Refugees, were read at the general meeting of the organization. The reports covered a period of one and one-half years.</p>
   <p>The total amount of subscriptions in Chicago was $23,637. To this sum were added collections from various sources and also $7,670 from the N.Y. Committee, making a grand total of $34,911. Of the $23,637 collected in this city, the largest donations were made by (1) the Young Men's R.R. Auxiliary Society, $8,000, (2) Standard Club, $1,000, (3) Chicago Sinai Congregation, $500,(4) Young Men's Hebrew Charity Association, $750. Individual collections totalled $11,967.</p>
   <p>The disbursements amounted to $30,655, leaving the organization a total asset of several thousand dollars. Glancing at these figures, we have reason to be proud of our Chicago Jewry who responded so magnificently to our call.</p>

   <p>The president, Adolph Loeb, spoke of a matter under consideration for some time, the advisability of dissolving the society and turning its affairs over to the United Hebrew Charities. Mr. Loeb stated that the main object of the society was to take charge of the new arrivals and to distribute them throughout the West as scattered as possible. However in view of the fact, that immigration has virtually stopped and new arrivals are but few and isolated, the Society, during the past months, had done little else than assist the resident poor. This work could be done as well by the U. H. C., and thussave on the Society. The Executive Committee, therefore, recommended that the society be dissolved, with the stipulation that, if, in the near future, circumstances warranted it, they could once again organize.</p>
