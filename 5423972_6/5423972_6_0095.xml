   <p>Rabbi Saul Silber, in his weekly lecture last Saturday at the Ohavey Sholom Synagogue, explained to the audience that many people who came to hear him speak on the Talmud Torah question, because a few directors had resigned, will be surprised. "I will not speak on that subject," said Rabbi Silber, "because the Talmud Torah is in a rather weak state. Its condition is such that it is useless to speak on the question. The only thing to do in such a case is to wait for the 'deathblow', and then get busy and decide on the plans for the future.</p>
   <p>The Courier's reply to Rabbi Silber's statement is as follows: Although we have the utmost respect for Rabbi Silber, and know him mainly because of his knowledge and ability as a great leader and authority on Talmud Torah questions, we cannot, under any circumstances, agree with him that the Talmud Torah will perish. We are all aware of the fact that the Talmud Torah was never in any danger of perishing. A few, however, are willing to believe that it is in a very precarious condition financially and is due to perish.</p>

   <p>The resignation of a few directors was a very hard blow for the Talmud Torah at this time. These directors thought by having their names on the list of directors they guaranteed the success of the Talmud Torah. They were under the impression that their influence would bring thousands of dollars into the treasuries of all the Chicago Talmud Torahs. They spent the money of the Talmud Torah as if it were an institution of wealth. Rabbi Silber is very much in error if he thinks that on account of a few measly dollars our Talmud Torah stands a chance of perishing. Quite to the contrary, the Jewish Talmud Torah will no doubt exist as long as there is a Jewish nation.</p>
