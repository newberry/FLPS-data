   <p>In a letter to the Board of Directors, Adolph Copeland asked for an increased budget for the Chicago branch of the Hebrew Sheltering and Immigrant Aid Society. He outlined the enormous amount of work done by the Society,stating that they were appealed to for help on all sides, and no cry for help went unheeded. He mentioned the Shelter maintained by the Society, describing it as modern and well-equipped where transient and immigrant poor are fed and lodged under thoroughly sanitary conditions. He described the manifold services rendered by the Society, meeting immigrants at the depots and directing them to their destinations, transmitting money abroad without charge to needy relatives. Mr. Copeland stated that during the past year the Society had forwarded over a million dollars, saving the Jews of Chicago $100,000 because the Society provided for payment in American dollars, thus saving losses due to exchange fluctuations. Among other services rendered by the Society was the preparation and forwarding of affidavits to Ellis Island whenever necessary in the cases of detained immigrants or those who may be deported, personally handling <pb facs="5423972_6_0695.jpg" n="2"/>such cases with Ellis Island and Washington officials by wire or long-distance telephone. Last year 1300 of such affidavits were prepared by the office. The Society also received inquiries from abroad regarding lost relations in this country and made efforts to locate them by direct communications where addresses were given or by publishing lists in the newspapers. Information and instructions regarding naturalization were given to all desiring to become citizens. Mr. Copeland concluded his letter with an appeal asking the F. O. J. C. to take up with the A. J. C. the matter of setting aside for the work of the Society the sum of $35,000. He asked the board to remember that although the actual immigration is less than it used to be and at present (1919) smaller than it ever has been in the history of the country, still the immigration problem is more serious than in ever has been and the Society is the only body that is coping with the tremendous problem.</p>
