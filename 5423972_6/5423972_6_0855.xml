   <p>Representatives of various organizations gave their report which showed much energetic activity. This was the first meeting at which representatives of various synagogues brought in their collections and contributions.</p>
   <p>The representative of the "B'nai Moshe" Synagogue brought in $300, the Anshe Kneses Israel, $200; OHave Sholom Synagogue, $200; and the Kovner Synagogue. $75.</p>
   <p>The following, were individual donations, David Shapiro, 400 bottles of wine, and Victor Pollahoff, 2,500 pounds of Matzah.</p>
   <p>It was decided, that there should be a committee present every evening at the Waller St. Talmud Torah, whcih should accept donations and give receipts for them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0856.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There will be another meeting next Tuesday at the Waller St. Talmud Torah, at which time, all persons having receipt books should come and turn in whatever money they have collected.</p>
   <p>The time is drawing close and the committee would like all who care to participate in this fund raising activity to present themselves any evening at the Waller St. Talmud Torah and get receipt books so that they will be qualified to accept contributions for this noble task.</p>
