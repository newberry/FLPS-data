   <p>Professor Joseph Lloyd Bach, principal of the Jewish Training School, will speak at the Hebrew Institute, this evening. The subject of his address will be "The Value and Importance of Hand-Work in the Jewish Elementary Schools." Tomorrow night the Institute will have their regular dance to which the public is invited.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Saul Silber of Ohave Sholom Synagogue will speak again tonight. His subject this time will be "Chanukah as an International Holiday." Rabbi Silber was very successful last year with his addresses every Friday evening. He succeeded in drawing the Jewish youth closer and closer to our Jewish modern ways. He anticipates still greater success this year, and hopes that the parents will be proud of their children.</p>
   <p>In discussing the different activities of Ohave Sholom Synagogue, we wish <pb facs="5423972_6_0382.jpg" n="2"/>to announce that the Ladies Auxiliary of the Synagogue is having their annual ball, Saturday evening, Jan., 6, at the Douglas Park Auditorium. The proceeds of this ball will be used for the sole purpose of building an annex to the Synagogue, in which the Ladies Auxiliary will inaugurate a modern Sabbath School and meeting halls for the Jewish children of the neighborhood.</p>
   <p>There is no doubt in any one's mind of the necessity for this useful project and we hope that this auxiliary will receive its full support and corporation of every Jew in all parts of the city.</p>
