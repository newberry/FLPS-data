   <p>Today opens the campaign of the Daughters of Zion Day Nursery to raise a fund for the infant home that is being built. The building will cost about a quarter of a million dollars. Two floors of that building have already been completed. Now they want to raise sufficient funds to enable them to finish the building. The leaders of the institution have called a mass meeting today at the Sabin School, where the campaign to raise additional funds will begin. Our friend and sympathizer, Mr. S. B. Komaiko, who has devoted himself to community work, will be the chairman of the meeting. The speakers will consider the question of a Jewish infant home in Chicago from various angles.</p>
   <p>The leaders of the institution also have a plan to raise the [necessary] money. They plan to sell "brick certificates" at ten dollars a certificate.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1512.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It would be easy to sell several thousand certificates in a well-organized campaign. Then, after the masses have done their duty, it would be easy to approach the well-to-do people and demand not ten- but one-hundred or one-thousand-dollar donations. The well-to-do will have to do their duty, if the masses lead the way.</p>
   <p>The success of the campaign depends upon today's meeting at the Sabin School. If a great many Northwest Side Jews, who are particularly interested in this institution, attend the meeting and do their duty, then Chicago will soon have a Jewish infant home of which the community can be proud.</p>
