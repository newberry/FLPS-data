   <p>Conditions in the Maimonides Hospital were very much improved recently. Doctor Mass, the young energetic superintendent, in an interview with a reporter of the Jewish Courier related the details of the improvements being made in the hospital and of his plans for the good of the institution in the future.</p>
   <p>Examinations of internes were held last week. Those who failed on their examinations were let out. A number of new doctors who will start on June 1st, were selected.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1297.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The examinations were conducted and supervised by a committee of the medical board composed of Doctors Dzekiv, Levinson, and Rubin. A few of the doctors found out that their services were to terminate on June 1st, and they immediately tendered their resignations. The officers of the hospital, without any delay, secured a new staff of doctors who will start to work at once. Doctors Rosenfeld and Kafler, are two of those selected for the staff. Improvements on the nurses' staff were also made in accordance with modern methods etc. The board found that the food in this Jewish hospital did not come up to standard. An improvement in this department was also ordered. The food now is prescribed scientifically and is strictly kosher.</p>
   <p>A new maternity department is being installed and the hospital will be in position to take in maternity cases.</p>
