   <p>From the monthly report of Dr. A. R. Levy, superintendent of the Russian Refugees Aid Society. - - During the month of November, 64 new applications were written, 49 had their railway tickets to Chicago on their arrival at their repsective ports, while the balance of 15 were forwarded to Chicago by refugees' committee of other cities.</p>
   <p>Of the 49 applicants who had tickets direct to this city, 37 came over to this country by their own means, purchasing their tickets for the voyage across the ocean and also for the fare to Chicago. The balance of the 12 applicants were sent to us by committees of various European cities.</p>
   <p>Over 32% of the November applicants have been sent to other cities.</p>
