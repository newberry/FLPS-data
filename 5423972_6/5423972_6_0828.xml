   <p>A conference was held at the office of Jas. Davis, for the purpose of formulating plans to unite the Orthodox Jewish Charities on the Northwest Side. Those who were present were interested in the idea of organizing into one united organization. They have held many discussions and have organized themselves into a committee with Mr. Phillip Clafter as chairman; Jas. Davis, vice-chairman; A. S. Roe, secretary, and an executive committee consisting of the following gentlemen: A. Margolis, T. S. Arkin, I. Ferguson, and L. Tifler.</p>
   <p>A call meeting will be held of some prominent Jewish citizens of the Northwest Side on Wednesday of this week at Shoenhoffer's Hall, Milwaukee and Ashland Avenue, to discuss plans for the organizing of the Orthodox Jewish Charities on the Northwest Side of Chicago. Twenty-four new subscribers were turned over to the new movement and the total sum collected is $1,675. A subscription list is already out for next Wednesday June 26, showing donations collected for United Orthodox Jewish Charities. There is a movement on foot to organize the down-town Jewish business men in the near future.</p>
