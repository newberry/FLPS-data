   <p>The board of directors held its first regular meeting, Wednesday evening at 8 P. M., in Sinai vestry rooms.</p>
   <p>The committee who was to confer with the Sinai Congregation Board, reported that the latter had gratuitously granted the use of the building adjoining the temple for an indefinite period, or until the premises might be needed as an addition to the temple.</p>
   <p>The committee was empowered to make such changes and alterations and employ such persons as janitors, teachers, and assistants, as in their judgement were required. On motion the building committee was authorized to look up a suitable site for the school, to be somewhere between Halsted and Canal Streets, and between 12th and 18th Streets. The latter suggestion brought out an interesting debate as to the feasability of the location, but the general sense of the board decided that the provision was the most approved and aim essential, if the design (was) to educate the poor and indigent children.</p>
