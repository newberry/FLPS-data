   <p>In plain business fashion, without any turmoil or ceremonies, the Federation of Orthodox Jewish Institutions of Chicago was transferred to the rich Jews of the South Side. The Federation, and the institutions that are bound to it, went into the hands of a Charity Trust, which is governed by an autocratic power, without authority. The residents of the West Side, who built the institution with so much effort were lowered to the degree of beggars by the South Side. The political clique of the West Side, with their official organ, mentioned nothing about it. They had good reasons to keep it quiet.</p>
   <p>The Jewish workers of Chicago, who have also helped in erecting the institution, cannot remain indifferent. They are entitled to be informed as to what is transpiring. This article endeavors to clarify what is happening behind the scenes of the Jewish Charity Trust.</p>
   <p>First of all, it is necessary to review the past history of the Federation, to the circumstances under which it was founded and its purposes. The Federation was organized about five years ago. At that time, a group of cheap <pb facs="5423972_6_0710.jpg" n="2"/>Jewish politicians belonging to the so-called H. H. machine (the machine of the former Mayor Carter Harrison, then the political boss of the city), held the highest degree of power on the West Side. They controlled the institutions, the synagogues, and the rabbis, and woe was unto the one who dared to oppose them. He was persecuted without mercy. Nothing was too disgraceful or vulgar to suppress the rebel. The corrupt political machine of the City Hall maintained a branch on the West Side, surpassing the City Hall in vileness.</p>
   <p>The H. H. machine contrived a plan to establish a federation of all institutions. The idea was that it would be much easier for the clique to control all institutions in one united body, than each one separately. It is much easier to control one board of directors than twelve various boards. The machine had also a second motive: A kosher hospital was built which was entirely in the hands of the clique and thousands of dollars disappeared as soon as they entered. This and "other beautiful acts" began to arouse the sleepy public and the clique sought haven in the Federation which would cover their "beautiful acts" and place their kosher hospital on the level with other institutions.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0711.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>All their activities were naturally covered with the clean robe of "good to humanity." They informed the public that the Federation would strengthen all institutions, eliminate various administrative expenses and also avoid cost for collections. This outline seemed to be discreet and the Federation was born. However, several institutions opposed the plan and were unwilling to unite into the new Federation. But the machine found methods to blackmail and terrorize the leaders and they surrendered. That clique with its organ, triumphed. The first directors of the new Federation were naturally from the clique and its organ. The Jewish Courier started to praise the Federation. Entire pages were daily plastered with news of the Federation. Anyone who dared to doubt the uprightness of the organization's business, was condemned as a conspirator and an outcast. The result was, however, contrary to the expectations of the clique. The kosher hospital by seeking to free itself from assessments, revealed the situation to the public, which stopped contributing money. Now the Courier was powerless. It was easy to blackmail the directors of an institution in order to compel it to join the Federation. It was quite a different thing to force the public to contribute money to directors in whom they had no confidence. The Federation did not take in enough money to support the institutions. Contributions decreased in comparison with the old system. The institutions fell deeply in debt, from which <pb facs="5423972_6_0712.jpg" n="4"/>they have not redeemed themselves to this very day. A year had thus passed and the Federation could no longer exist in such manner. The political clique then shamefully deserted the Federation, which was transferred into the hands of noe leaders. (On the contrary, they again started to bore within the reorganized Federation and it is axiomatic that it is easier to do harm than to do good)?</p>
