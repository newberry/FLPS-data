   <p>The new training school for nurses, which was built as an addition to the Michael Reese Hospital, was opened this week. It contains accommodations for forty nurses and six patients, besides having a lecture room and reception room. The present staff consists of a superintendent, an assistant, twenty-four nurses and two orderlies.</p>
   <p>There are still accommodations for sixteen ladies, who may wish to become nurses. The Directors are especially desirous of obtaining applications from Jewish young ladies, as the schooling afforded would be of great benefit to them. The rules require applicants to be between the ages of twenty-one and thirty-five. The allowance for the first year is $8.00 per month and $12.00 for the second year. Board and lodging is furnished free.</p>
