   <p>On Saturday afternoon, March 28th, took place the second in the series of the Mother's Meetings to be held at the Jewish Training School. Promptly at 2:30, the members of Class V. with their teacher, Miss Emily Block, filed in the large assembly hall where many mothers, fathers and friends of the teacher and the children were assembled. The fifty-five children in attendance appeared well dressed and clean, and by their deportment showed the careful, and conscientious daily work on the part of their teacher. A program, consisting of songs and well chosen recitations were given by the children. America was sung by these embryo citizens in a way to inspire patriotism in the hearts of all hearers.</p>
   <p>After this, the mothers were addressed by Miss Bloch, on the necessity for regular and prompt attendance of their children at school. After the mothers had been led to see the advantages gained by the children always being neat and clean, all went away with a feeling that the meeting was a success and that much good would result from this coming together of parents, teacher and children.</p>
