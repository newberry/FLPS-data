   <p>At the meeting of the Board, Charles Rubens reported for the Research Bureau that the sub-committee which had been authorized to purchase land adjoining Winfield Sanitarium in contemplation of the building of a first unit of a community convalescent program, had acquired 1151/2 acres at a very favorable price. Mr. Rubens then announced it was his great pleasure to present this tract of land to the J. C. on behalf of Mrs. Rubens and himself in the memory of their parents, Louis and Caroline Rubens and Isaac and Kate Meyer. He felt that this tract was large enough to provide facilities which would in the future be required for the care of chronics, incurables and cardiacs and for the extension of the convalescent home unit. The announcement of the gift was received with unanimous thanks and applause. Mr. Rubens then stated that the committee wished to make a suggestion that Dr. Brush, the recognized authority on convalescent care in this country, be invited to come to Chicago in the fall.</p>
