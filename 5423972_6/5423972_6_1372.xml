   <p>Maimonides Kosher Hospital - Beth Michsa Le Yasomin (Orphan Home) - The Ladies Society of the Beth Michsa, Le-Yasomim - The Hebrew Institute.</p>
   <p>The Talmud Dorah - Dance and Lecture.</p>
   <p>by Kadimah Gate.</p>
   <p>At the last meeting of the Directors of the Maimonides Kosher Hospital, the report was made that the mortgage on the land amounting to three thousand dollars has been redeemed and that there remains a balance of three thousand dollars in the treasury. With this money plans are being made to build a new Kosher Hospital.</p>
   <p>Although the sum of three thousand dollars is small when one thinks of building a truly modern hospital, the board of directors feel that when the final plans for the hospital are made and approved enough donors will be found to make the hospital a reality.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1373.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Just how much sympathy our community has for the Beth Michsa Orphan Home may be seen by the popular response given to the Ball sponsored by the Ladies Society of the Home for the raising of funds for the building of a new home and an annex hall to the Hebrew Institute. Not only was the hall filled to capacity, but hundreds upon hundreds were denied entrance. Many were willing to pay almost any price for tickets to be admitted and take part in the affair.</p>
   <p>This overwhelming support shows clearly just how close to the heart of the Jewish people, the orphan home is.</p>
   <p>The directors of the home should take their support as a sign of the times and as a sign of the whole hearted interest of the community. They should exploit this interest and support of our Jewish community to enlist their aid in building the purposed new large home.</p>
   <p>And the Hebrew Institute is still a dilapidated mess. The dirty walls remain untouched. Whenever a person walks by his heart rebels and asks, cannot a hundred thousand Jews build a real Hebrew Institute?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1374.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Talmud Torah is in a bad state and the worse part of it is that there are no plans or hope for ameliorating the condition. The winter season is shortly coming to a close and the Talmud Torah finds itself with more outstanding debts than at any time since its existence. Under such circumstances just what can be hoped for in the summer season.</p>
   <p>It would be no more than right that the officers of the Talmud Torah should hold a conference with important civic leaders and find a way out. The Talmud Torah needs something more than finances. It must take unto itself a new spirit, a modern spirit. The idea of collecting nickels and giving learning worth a farthing should cease. We must collect hundred of dollars and give learning worth thousands. The world does not stand in one place. We are making progress in other ways, yet conducting a Talmud Torah as in a small Russian town of a hundred years ago. We know the directors have given <pb facs="5423972_6_1375.jpg" n="4"/>their best, but we feel that we live in a new world and we must keep abreast of the times to be successful.</p>
   <p>The monthly dance and lecture of the Kadimah and Clara De Hirsch Gates, Order Knights of Zion will take place next Sunday evening in the annex of the Hebrew Institute. Dr. A. B. Udelson will be the speaker of the evening.</p>
