   <p>Mr. A. J. Pflaum, Secretary of Michael Reese Hospital, has sent us the monthly report of the hospital, which reveals that most of the patients have attended gratis. There were 567 patients attended to in 6,069 days, which means an average of 101/2 days per patient; of these 356, or 63%, were free patients, who were at the hospital 3,479 days or 62% of the days. Of private-ward patients who pay up to $10.00 a week, there were 90; they were at the hospital 1,067 days; and of private-room patients, there were 121, they were confined for a period of 1,644 days. The report shows that Michael Reese Hospital receives 63% free patients, 21% of rich patients, and only 16% of middle class patients.</p>
   <p>Why the Jewish middle class patients do not avail themselves of the facilities of Michael Reese Hospital when they are in need of it, we do not understand.</p>
