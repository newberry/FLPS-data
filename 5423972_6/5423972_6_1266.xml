<title level="a">THREE HUNDRED DELEGATES AT CONVENTION OF CONSUMPTIVES RELIEF SOCIETY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In the presence of more than three hundred delegates and several hundred guests, the fourteenth annual convention of the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society of Denver was opened yesterday evening with a mass meeting at the Sherman Hotel, which was followed by a reception for the delegates and officers of the Denver Sanatorium, given by the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society of Chicago under the chairmanship of Mrs. Jacob Malkes. The convention will continue all day today from 9 A. M., and will close with a kosher banquet at six o'clock in the evening.</p>
   <p>Mr. A. S. Roe, chairman of the convention committee, opened the convention by presenting Rabbi Samuel Cohn who delivered the invocation, and then the chairman of the evening, Dr. Philip Hilkowitz, president of the Denver Sanatorium. In a few words, the chairman described the growth of the Denver institution and its progress during the fourteen years of its existence.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1267.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Then [Editor's note.--Fourteen years ago] we had several small houses and only a few patients, and it seemed to many that we would never be able to establish a great institution," the chairman said, "yet we have accomplished what to many had seemed impossible. We now have one of the finest and biggest sanatoriums in America.</p>
   <p>"We have at the Sanatorium now 160 patients, and the number of applicants is very large. It is therefore necessary that greater efforts be made among the Jewish masses for the benefit of the Sanatorium." He also expressed deep regret that the rich Jews do so little for the institution, which is being supported wholly by the poorer, working classes.</p>
   <p>Beautiful and impressive speeches were made by I. B. Lipson, Kabbi Saul Silber and Dr. W. A. Evans. A fine musical program was also presented by the famous violinist, Mr. Isadore Berger; the famous opera singer, Miss Marie Fruson; and the well-known pianist, Mr. Abe Sheineman.</p>
   <p>Of the three hundred delegates, two hundred and fifty are from Chicago, <pb facs="5423972_6_1268.jpg" n="3"/>representing synagogues, lodges, Workmen's Circle branches, National Workers' Alliance branches, etc.</p>
   <p>Today's Program</p>
   <p>9 A. M.: Mr. Isadore Cohn, chairman. The president and other officers of the Sanatorium will give their annual reports, with discussions and election of trustees to follow.</p>
   <p>2 P. M.: Mr. Samuel Macon, chairman. Reports of the examining doctors, reports of the Jewish Consumptives Relief Society of Chicago and of the Chicago-Winfield Sanitarium; reports of organizations supporting the Sanatorium.</p>
   <p>6 P. M.: Banquet, Judge Henry Horner, toastmaster; speeches by Judge Hugo Pam and Leon Zolotokoff; violin solo by Evelyn Vita Levin.</p>
   <p>All sessions and the banquet as well will be held at the Sherman Hotel.</p>
