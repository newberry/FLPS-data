   <p>At the meeting of the Board, in the report of the Executive Director, Mr. Goldsmith spoke on the possible effects of inflation.</p>
   <p>He stated that a week ago he called a meeting of the Executives of the institutions when it appeared that President Roosevelt was embarked on a policy to force at least a moderate amount of inflation. He wanted to discuss with the executives certain definite problems that inflation would create.</p>
   <p>If inflation is forced, the Charities will face first a rising price level, second a static wage level and third the general problem of financing because income will be certain to lag behind rising prices and hence expenditures.</p>
   <p>At the meeting a week ago it was decided to recommend to the institutions that they contract ahead for the purchase of commodities and the executives agreed to buy ahead and arrange with dealers for protection against increasing prices.</p>

   <p>In the Jewish Social Service Bureau, the J. C. have revised the budgets of families and are now putting as much of the food allowance as possible into rations of staples which are purchased wholesale through Steele, Wedeles and Co. at an estimated saving of 15 to 20%. The recent reduction in the J. S. S. B. of food budgets of 5% is the fourth in 15 months. Relief now is a little lower than the ideal, but it will give the Bureau a lower level from which to start raising the amount when better conditions return.</p>
