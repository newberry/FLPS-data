  <body>
   <p>Mr. President and Directors of the Board of the Beth Moshav Z'Klinim:</p>
   <p>In our report for the year 1926 we were rather hesitant in the choice of words, that would adequately describe the conditions prevailing in the Home and the achievements of the administration and management for that year. We were afraid to paint too rosy a picture as we didn't wish to appear boastful of our own success, or flattering to the president and vice president and the other members of the Board for their splendid achievements.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1680.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Now, however, that Mrs. Dickman and I have gotten a firmer grasp of matters pertaining to the Home, we feel that it is plainly our duty properly to inform all who take an interest in our sacred institution, of the things that are being done for our old people, and of the deeds of self-sacrifice and generosity on the part of the noble-hearted men and women, who, with their practical idealism and humanitarianism, have made of the Home the paradise for old people that it is today.</p>
   <p>Let the actions of these public-spirited benefactors serve as an example and incentive to others of ourfellow Jews, who have the ability and the means, but not the will to do something for their less fortunate brethren.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1681.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>ADMISSION COMMITTEE.</p>
   <p>Practically no committee demands so much self-sacrifice and devotion than does the Admission Committee. Day and night, in good and bad weather, its members are called upon to visit the poorest of homes, located in all parts of the city, and investigate the applicants and their relations. Though more than a dozen applications are disposed of at every meeting, the flow of new applications never ceases. On the contrary, it seems to be ever on the increase.</p>
   <p>Surely, the way the chairman, Herman Elenbogen, performs his most arduous task in behalf of our Home is nothing short of a miracle. There is no doubt that he devotes more time to the Home than any one else on the Board.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1682.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Twenty applicants were admitted to the Home last year, and we now have one hundred and forty-one residents.</p>
   <p>HOUSE COMMITTEE.</p>
   <p>In order to manage successfully an institution of this size and of this peculiar character, it is primarily necessary to have a strong House Committee whose members are staunch supporters of the cause, and, who possess a combination of keen observation and mature judgment on the economics of the Home, as well as an unquestioned loyalty and love for its aged inmates.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1683.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>This is exactly the kind of committee we have, and added zest to its many sided activities was surely given by that patron of our Home, Barnett Farroll, by his chairmanship during the past year.</p>
   <p>BUILDING GROUNDS.</p>
   <p>Though we have spent on our building this year $1,600. less than last year, and much less than in previous years, the physical condition of the Home has been splendidly looked after. Nothing pertaining to the building ever escapes the expert and watchful eye of the chairman of the Building Committee, Joseph Bayer.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1684.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>As a physician looks after his patients, so does he look after the building. If the Home is in the good condition that it is, we have much for which to thank Mr. Bayer. Also S. B. Komaiko gave us valuable aid by having a good deal of our garden work done for us gratis.</p>
   <p>SYNAGOGUE.</p>
   <p>Though financially our synagogue may be said to be on a downward course, due to the changed character of the neighborhood, spiritually it is probably more powerful than ever. Under the benign chairmanship of S. P. Platt, and the fatherly guidance of our venerable Rabbi Budzinsky, our synagogue is serving its purpose in a very marked degree.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1685.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Besides the soul-stirring as well as comforting lectures that the good rabbi is giving our old folks every week, they are also often given the pleasure of leaving well known cantors "daliven" for them.</p>
   <p>HEALTH</p>
   <p>To attempt to preserve the health and the lives of the aged broken-down men and women, who have passed through a life of poverty and misery, requires nothing less than heroic service. And that kind of service is being liberally lavished on our old people by our excellent physician, Dr. I. Singer, by the exceptionally fine nurses, who shirk no duty, no matter how unpleasant, by our dentist, Dr. Berman, and the specialists, Dr. Schoolman, Dr. Kaplan and Dr. Gordon. As to Dr. Lebensohn, mere words cannot give you even an approximate idea of the wonderful work he is doing among our suffering aged inmates.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1686.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>But also our sister institutions, the Michael Reese and the Mt. Sinai hospitals deserve our most sincere thanks for the very gratifying way in which they have cooperated with us in the care of the more acute cases, that required special treatment, especially major operations performed in these two wonderful hospitals. The result of all these combined efforts in behalf of our old people shows up well in our mortality list.</p>
   <p>As to our plans for the future we will endeavor, as in the past, to attain our ideal of making this a real home for our old people, and at the same time manage it as economically as possible without impairment to the welfare of our old folks, to have the loyalty of our employees, the respect and the love of the aged inmates, and the friendship and confidence of the members of our Board of Directors.</p>
   <p>Respectfully submitted,</p>
   <p>Adolph Dickman, superintendent.</p>
