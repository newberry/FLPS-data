   <p>The new structure of the Chicago Home for Jewish Orphans will consist of three stories, basement and attic. In addition to the main building, there will be a small hospital annex. In the basement, in addition to the usual kitchen, laundry and accessory rooms, there will be a gymnasium and playrooms, also a natatorium. Rooms are provided in the basement for instruction in manual training for the boys, and an industrial kitchen for the girls.</p>
   <p>On the first story are the administration rooms, including the director's room parlors, physicians' office and superintendent's office. On the main floor is also located a large library and study-room, and a room for instruction in sewing, etc., for girls. On this floor is the main dining room. The second and third stories are devoted to large and well-lighted dormitories, the necessary toilet rooms, clothes, linen, mending rooms, etc.</p>
   <p>The hospital annex consists of two stories in the rear of the main building.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1665.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The lower story contains wards for the ordinary sick, and the upper story, wards for contagious diseases only. The hospital annex is equipped with the necessary nurses' rooms, physicians' office and dispensary, diet kitchen and other essential accessories, including a separate small laundry for hospital use only.</p>
   <p>One of the important features in connection with the proposed building is the division of the dormitory rooms in such a manner that no room shall contain more than twelve children. Another feature is the fact that all rooms, corridors and other spaces, however unimportant, are provided with direct windows, affording abundant outside light and air.</p>
