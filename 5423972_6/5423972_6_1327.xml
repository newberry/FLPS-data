   <p>Mr. David Fine, former superintendent of the Maimonedes Hospital, claims that the news of his resignation, published last Monday in the Courier, is not true.</p>
   <p>In a letter to the Courier, Mr. Fine states that he did not resign, but was ousted against his will by the House Committee.</p>
   <p>"I did not want to resign under any circumstances," states Mr. Fine in his letter, "because whatever conditions evolved in the Maimonedes Hospital, they could not be charged against the superintendent, and I did not feel responsible.</p>
   <p>"In the near future the Jewish public will probably know the truth about the conditions that have existed in the Maimonedes Hospital.</p>

   <p>"I did not resign, but was forcefully ousted by the House Committee."</p>
   <p>The chairman of the House Committee of the Maimonedes Hospital is Mr. Samuel J. Rosenblatt. He is now in New York, with Judge Harry M. Fisher, chairman of the Medical Committee, and Mr. I. Lurie, president of the hospital, to complete negotiations for a new superintendent. The Board of Directors at its last meeting gave authority to the House Committee to demand the resignation of all employees of the hospital, from the superintendent down to the clerks.</p>
