   <p>The Million Dollar Campaign in Chicago for War Sufferers is developing very fast. It looks now as though the quota will be over-subscribed.</p>
   <p>Last Sunday, at the Sinai Temple, the sum of over $700,000 was collected for the drive. Groups of canvassers under the energetic leadership of a few captains, are visiting the rich Jews of the city and report great success.</p>
   <p>The People's Relief Committee, which is also a part of the campaign, began to look up all workers, women as well as men, to help the great cause, by contributing one day's wages.</p>
   <p>All Jewish workers and organizations were called on in person, and by letter to help along with the drive. All pledges must reach us by the 18th of January. On January 18th, there will be a banquet for all the organizations, at which time they will bring in all pledges.</p>
