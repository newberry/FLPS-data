   <p>He made it very clear for the audience how to develop cooporative colonies for the Jews in Palestine. The audience which came to the Hebrew Institute to hear the great Jewish economist, Franz Oppenheimer, was not very large but it was a very intelligent audience. He clearly stated and outlined his views on the matter of establishing cooporative colonies for the Jewish workers in Palestine......</p>
   <p>Mr. Nathan D. Kaplan was the chairman of the meeting and in a few words explained to the audience the object of Professor Oppenheimer's visit to Chicago. Judge Hugo Pam was one of the speakers and in his rather lengthy speech, he told the audience that the Jews everywhere have made great strides in agriculture. A nation without agriculture cannot exist and nothing can be developed when the land is not cultivated.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0374.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Professor Oppenheimer in his address first spoke in English and completed his speech in his mother tongue and concluded by saying, "My Jewish brethren, we have waited over two thousand years, so surely we can wait just a few more years to return to the promised land of our ancestors. We expect to get financial aid from all parts of the world and I am sure that the Jews of Chicago will do their share in helping to build our promised land."</p>
