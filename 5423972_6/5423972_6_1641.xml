   <p>Ladies Society of the Orphan's Home.</p>
   <p>This is in the form of a letter in the Daily Jewish Courier to the members of the Ladies Society of the Orphan's Home.</p>
   <p>Honored Sisters:</p>
   <p>We herewith publish the report of our Society which is as follows:</p>
   <p>We are getting along in excellent fashion. Our collections are fine. We have taken in quite a lot of money. We handed over $300.00 to the Orphan's Home, January 24.</p>
   <p>We can inform you that the orphans are in excellent health, thank God, and are treated with kindness and are well taken care of. From March 5 to January 24, of last year, we have turned over $2,500 in cash to the Orphan's Home, and besides that amount we furnished everything, and clothed the <pb facs="5423972_6_1642.jpg" n="2"/>children with necessary clothing. The extra cash which was made at a new Torah celebration, by Mr. Hirsch and his wife, Annie Hirsch, was donated to the Society for the sole purpose of buying new clothing for the orphans for the Passover holidays.</p>
   <p>Leah Lodgin, Pres., Necha Adelshon, Vice-Pres., Rebecca Epstein, Treas., Sarah Sheresewsky, First Trustee, Jennie Fisher, Sec'y., other Trustees: Mrs. Cohen, Mrs. Nathan, and Mrs. Greenberg.</p>
