   <p>To the ample charitable donors of Chicago's Orthodox community was added another, Mr. Varachmeal Rosenberg.</p>
   <p>The Society for Jewish Incurables in Oak Forest received a thousand dollars from him that will help to erect a synagogue and a social center in the infirmary. This is not the first thousand dollars Mr. Rosenberg has donated to charity nor will it be the last. Mr. Rosenberg does not forbear to do a good deed when the opportunity presents itself. Nor does he at any time desert the oppressed and the needy. The hungry and the naked have never left his house shamefaced.</p>
   <p>With God's aid, now that he has become a rich man, he has increased his donations. His son, Michael Rosenberg, also contributes generously.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1227.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When either is approached for this purpose he does not hesitate to give.</p>
   <p>If this could only be said of many Jews on the West Side who are in the same line of business and are perhaps richer than the Rosenbergs, but who hold on tightly to their dollars! They cannot take these dollars with them to their graves. Foolish people!</p>
