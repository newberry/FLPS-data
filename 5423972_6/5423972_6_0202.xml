   <p>The annual meeting of the members of the Jewish Training School was held at Sinai. The following information was given in the Director's Report:</p>
   <p>The Sinking Fund was increased by donations of $14,500 making the total amount $31,600. There were 700 children under the care of the school during the year. The organization has prepared an elaborate exhibit for the World's Fair, which will clearly illustrate the methods applied in the institution from the Kindergarten to the highest grade. The Fair Committee on Education have been generous in their allotment of space.</p>
   <p>At a meeting held on Nov. 14th, 1892, the school's constitution was amended so as to enable it to conduct a night class for persons over 14 years of age. In accordance therewith, Johannah Lodge appropriated $1,400 into the J. T. S. treasury and a night school for women was conducted under the supervision of Prof. Bamberger. The average attendance was about 100 and these foreign born women were given the opportunity to learn English, dressmaking and sewing.</p>
   <p>The report of the Financial Secretary showed that the school received into its treasury during the year, about $34,500.</p>
