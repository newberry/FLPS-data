   <p>(This Order is one of a group of sick benefit and insurance lodges throughout the country. Trans.)</p>
   <p>The Brith Avraham (Brotherhood of Abraham) opened its 45th annual convention at Atlantic City yesterday. Three hundred delegates from all parts of the country attended.</p>
   <p>The speakers, Councilman Harry Kassman, Mr. Joseph Hagerlain, president of Pride of Atlanta Lodge No. 520, and Mr. H. Harrison, of New York dwelt on various topics lauding Jewish patriotism in America, welcoming delegates to the conference, presenting the Grand Master, Mr. Samuel Dorf with the key to the city and a diamond fob for his 27 years as Grand Master of the Order and presenting Grand Secretary, Mr. J. Lazerman with a Silver Service, all in the name of the Atlantic City Lodge. The wish was also expressed that the Peace Conference in Paris will assure Jews a home in Palestine.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1087.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Dorf thanked everyone and spoke of the conditions of the Order, financially and otherwise, stressing the necessity for increasing membership rates and installing a new system of paying according to age rates. He also tendered his resignation.</p>
   <p>Much discussing regarding the choice of a committee and a temporary chairman ensued, but this question was finally settled. The next meeting was set for Monday morning at 10 A.M.</p>
   <p>Many important questions and resolutions are to be presented by the delegates at this convention. One requesting the Order to favor Zionism is sure to be accepted because of the favorable attitude of Mr. Dorf and most of the delegates.</p>
   <p>The Grand Secretary's report shows that the Order counted on the first of January, 32,297 members in 261 lodges. The larges number, 16,912 members are between 50 and 60 years old; 6,514, between 45 and 49; 4,347, between 40-44; the rest being under 40 years of age.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1088.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In 1916 there were 904 deaths in the Order, making 14 deaths per 1,000 members. In 1917 there were 895 deaths or 18 per 1,000; in 1918, 810 deaths, or 25 per 1,000.</p>
   <p>From Jan. 1, 1917 to April 1, 1919, there were 1941 deaths, for which the sum of $ 971,102 was paid as death benefits.</p>
   <p>On January 1, 1917, the Order had 60 lodges, and 24 more were added since then. In the two years previous to 1919, 91 lodges were lost, 32 united, a total of 123 lodges, so that on January of this year, there were only 261 lodges.</p>
   <p>The funds of the Brith Avraham, as of the first of January are as follows:</p>
