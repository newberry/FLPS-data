   <p>Mr. James Waterman Wise, who is at the present time the Executive Secretary of the Avukah, the American Student Zionist Federation, and a lecturer at the Columbia University, will speak at the Institute Forum, next Wednesday evening, December 11, on the subject of - Facing the Jewish Future.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wise has been a constant contributor to the periodicals. He has written a number of books, one on The Future of Israel, and another which has made a very great impression, on Jews Are Like That, under the pseudonym of Analyticus. His talk should be very interesting to all our people because he will review the whole problem of the Jewish future from the point of view of the youth of today. Although he is a mature thinker, himself, he is sufficiently young to be able to sense the spirit of Jewish youth during the present age and to give it voice. He should have a large audience from the student body of Chicago. Those of us who are older will find it very much worth while to feel the pulse of the new generation as he will give it expression.</p>
