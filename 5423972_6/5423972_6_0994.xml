   <p>The Jews of Chicago do not desire praise, but simply a recognition of the position to which facts point.</p>
   <p>Mark that other monument to Chicago's Jewish spirit - "The United Hebrew Charities." Are the Russian Jews not cared for by this institution? Consult the Record, and you will find that nine-tenths of the relief expended is for and in the service of the poor Russian Jew. Go to the Employment Bureau in the office of this noble institution, and you will find a large proportion of the time spent by its Superintendent is devoted to placing the unfortunate Russian in a position where he might assert manhood and prove to the world his right to live, though banished from his native land.</p>
   <p>It was false to say that the Jews of Chicago would not have any more of exiled Russians. The fact is that the Jews of Chicago have demonstrated beyond a doubt, that ample and wise provisions have been designed and perfected <pb facs="5423972_6_0995.jpg" n="2"/>to accomodate the very class of unfortunates that now are broadcast upon the world's hospitality. The Jews of Chicago stand erect and invite scrutiny, a scrutiny bringing the eye of Justice. They fear not the scales, and the facts must establish the truth.</p>
