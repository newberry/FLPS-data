<title level="a">ANNUAL REPORT OF SECRETARY OF B. M. Z., SUBMITTED BY DR. M. L. AREN, JANUARY 15, 1922</title>.
<title level="a" type="sub">(In English)</title></bibl>

  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Ladies and Gentlemen:-</p>
   <p>Two years ago the men and women long tried in and devoted to the interests of the B. M. Z. chose to retire from executive offices and you placed at the head a new set of officers and several directors.</p>
   <p>In my last annual report I ventured the assertion that we have cause to congratulate ourselves upon the spirit of complete Harmony and co-operation displayed by all officers, chairmen of various committees and other departamental executives.</p>
   <p>The present administration has been on trial before you now for a sufficient length of time and your verdict as to its fitness and degree of accomplishment <pb facs="5423972_6_1705.jpg" n="2"/>will be rendered within the coming ten days when you will be asked to elect new officers to succed those whose term of offices expire.</p>
   <p>It was my privilege, during these past two years, to be present at many meetings of the House and Admission Committes; I observed and analyzed the methods, the intense interest, the keen perception of every member of these committees in the process of handling the difficult often very intricate problems and the conclusion I reached is: that the interests of the Home and inmates could not by any stretch of imagination have been entrusted to better, more competent men and women than comprise these committees who are of the B. M. Z.</p>
   <p>I can not emphasize this particular point too strongly and trust it will leave with you a lasting impression.</p>
   <p>Activities For the Year 1921.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1706.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Meetings--During the year we had 17 meetings; 10 regular, 1 annual, 1 adjourned, 3 special and 2 executive.</p>
   <p>Election of Directors--At the annual meeting held January 16, 1921, Director George S. Pines, chairman of the Nominating Committee, placed in nomination the names of the following Directors to be elected to membership of the Board:</p>
   <p>For Three Years: M. L. Aren, Barnett Farell, H. Elenbogen, Rabbi M. Fisher, Mrs. L. Etahcken, Samuel Shuster, Joseph Bayer, Adolph Blonder, Nathan Fox. For Two Years: Judge Harry M. Fisher, Harry H. Blum. Election of Officers: At the special meeting held January 23, 1921, Mrs. Benjamin Davis, on behalf of the Nominating Committee, placed in nomination the names of the following Directors to be elected to office. President, Barnett Faroll; First Vice-President, Paul N. Lackritz; Second Vice-President, Mrs. H. Grossfeld; Recording Secretary, M. L. Aren; Financial Secretary, George S. Pines; Treasurer, Adolph Blonder. Trustees:</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1707.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Harris Cohn, A. Margolis, Mrs. Benjamin Davis. There having been no other nominees, the above mentioned were unanimously elected.</p>
   <p>Standing Committees--At the meeting of February 27, 1921, the regular standing committees were appointed: House Committee, Paul Lackritz, chairman; Admission Committee, Mrs. J. Ginsburg, chairman; Auditing Committee, Isidore Segal, Chairman; Building and Grounds Committee, Adolph Blonder, Chairman; Synagogue Committee, S. P. Platt, Chairman; Entertainment Committee, Mr. Benj. Davis, Chairman.</p>
   <p>Resignations. In the course of the year Director Ralph Goldberg resigned because of some misunderstanding, Director Jacob Turner resigned pleading pressure of business. In both instances they were prevailed upon to reconsider their decisions. Directors S. A. Kahn and A. J. Harris resigned owing to ill health.</p>
   <p>Later on the Nominating Committee will submit the names when it recommends <pb facs="5423972_6_1708.jpg" n="5"/>for election.</p>
   <p>B. M. Z. Women's Club. In view of the fact that the annual report will be presented by the president, Mrs. Lewis, I shall not attempt to enumerate their detailed activities. Yet I cannot refrain from mentioning at least one fact which illustrates its untiring devotion to the cause of the B. M. Z. A contribution of twenty five hundred dollars was made towards defraying the expenses of the Home. I trust Mrs. Lewis will not deem my singling out this particular item an usurpation of her perogatives.</p>
   <p>Medical Staff--At its last annual meeting the Medical Staff increased its membership from nineteen to twenty nine. As at present constituted there are twenty four attendants, four consultants and one dentist. Of the attending men, two are assigned to service each month, one regular and one alternate. The present officers are, President, Dr. Charles Newberger; Vice-President, Dr. Samuel Springwater; Secretary, Dr. E. L. Freilich. The Medical Staff, as in former years, deserves our earnest <pb facs="5423972_6_1709.jpg" n="6"/>appreciation for its unselfish and loyal aid. Our gratitude is thus heartily and readily acknowledged.</p>
   <p>Auditing Committee. At the meeting held in November, 1921, Director Isidore Segal submitted a detailed report of assets and liabilities and all accounts of the Home. With this usual precision and skill in matters of finance, as in all other services rendered, the report is explicit to the minutest figure. I quote the main items:</p>
   <table>
    <row>
     <cell>Assets</cell>
     <cell>$175,124.41</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Liabilities</cell>
     <cell>41,461.36</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Net Assets</cell>
     <cell>133,663.05</cell>
    </row>
   </table>
   <p>The Chairman and Committee deserve special recognition for their pains-taking labors which is hereby duly recorded.</p>
   <p>Finance and Administration. The reports of the Financial Secretary, <pb facs="5423972_6_1710.jpg" n="7"/>Treasurer, Trustees, Superintendent, Chairmen of Standing Committees, will be presented to you shortly. With that in view I deem it unnecessary to particularize. Useless repitition is therefore omitted.</p>
   <p>Summary of Events. A brief synopsis of events that occurred during the year may not be out of place and is hereby concisely enumerated.</p>
   <p>Directors' attendance at meetings in the majority of instances was highly satisfactory. In very few cases it fell short of normal. I have in mind the record of two members who are very irregular at Board meetings, yet their work on the admission Committee is perfect and cannot be duplicated; again there are several who, in addition to Board meetings, do not fail to perform all other duties imposed upon them. In fact, their earnestness and zeal serve as an inspiration to those of us who at times are apt to misinterpret the meaning of a membership on a charitable Board.</p>
   <p>The recommendation of the Medical Staff that a Bronze tablet be placed in <pb facs="5423972_6_1711.jpg" n="8"/>the Home in memory of its deceased members has been approved by the Board. The Committee in charge of this has completed its work and the tablet will be dedicated at the annual meeting of the Staff.</p>
   <p>The date for breaking ground for the new building, owing to unsettled conditions of finance, labor and building materials, has been postponed until such time as conditions will assume a normal aspect.</p>
   <p>The Physicians Dinner, due to the efforts of Mrs. Switton, and the Purim Dinner, due to the efforts of Vice-President Lackritz, have been very successfully carried out.</p>
   <p>President Faroll donated the sum of three hundred fifty dollars toward the deficiency in connection with the twentieth anniversary booklet.</p>
   <p>Superintendent's salary increased to five thousand dollars.</p>
   <p>Resolutions of congratulations to Dr. Emil G. Hirsh [sic] on the occasion <pb facs="5423972_6_1712.jpg" n="9"/>of his seventieth birthday anniversary were presented to him by the President on behalf of the Home.</p>
   <p>A farewell dinner was given in honor of President and Mrs. Faroll before their leaving for Europe.</p>
   <p>In connection with the campaign of the Federated for increased subscriptions, the B. M. Z. secured nearly seventeen thousand dollars. The major part of this sum was obtained by B. M. Z. Woman's Club, Judge Harry M. Fisher, and, with the valuable help of Vice-President Lackritz, a handsome sum is credited to the Directors.</p>
   <p>Thus another chapter in the history of B. M. Z. is concluded.</p>
   <p>Conclusion. Our appreciation is hereby expressed to the Jewish and English press for the many courtesies extended to us during the past year; to the Medical Staff for its prompt response to the call of charity; to the <pb facs="5423972_6_1713.jpg" n="10"/>B. M. Z. Woman's Club for its whole-hearted co-operation on behalf of the Home and inmates; to the Junior Auxiliary for its splendid spirit in following the footsteps of the parent organization; and to everyone who was instrumental in doing his or her share for the betterment of conditions in the Home and its dependents.</p>
   <p>For myself I wish to say that my work was more of a pleasure than a duty. My close association with all of you, in a social and official capacity, was, to me, a source of incalculable joy and gladness.</p>
   <p>If I have even in a small measure succeeded in the performance of my duties, it is chiefly due to the uniform courtesy, the helpful co-operation and useful suggestions of the entire Board and all associates. My sincere gratitude is hereby most earnestly rendered.</p>
   <p>May we continue in the future to bring sunshine and happiness to those who are entrusted to our care. Let us use our efforts in the coming years as in the past in perfect candor and frankness; let us avoid friction and <pb facs="5423972_6_1714.jpg" n="11"/>discord; let us give the best there is in us for the cause which is as yet so essential in our present state of civilization; the millennium is not yet in sight, for, in the final analysis, there is more happiness in giving than in receiving.</p>
