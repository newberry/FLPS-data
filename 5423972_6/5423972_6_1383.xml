   <p>Among the real estate deals that were transacted yesterday in Chicago, was the deal that bought the grounds which will be used for the erection of the Maimonaides Kosher Hospital. The deal was made through the well-known real estate firm of Max Goodman, located at 12th street and Blue Island avenue. $3,000 was paid in cash, and the balance of $3,500 will be paid by the leaders of the institution, who obligated themselves to pay within six months.</p>
   <p>The grounds, on which the Kosher Hospital will be erected, is located at California avenue near Rebecca street. It is situated in one of the most beautiful parts of Chicago. The grounds cover an area of 160 x 130 feet. It is about a hundred feet away from Ogden avenue, and is bordered by Douglas Park. People who know about real estate in that vicinity say that the grounds are a veritable bargain. Mr. Harry Fisher and Mr. I. Lurie, two of the leaders of the institution, say that the payment of the balance should be an easy matter, because the public is very much interested in the building of the hospital. Many auxiliaries are being organized to help the cause. They work in order to get the necessary sum which is still to be paid.</p>
