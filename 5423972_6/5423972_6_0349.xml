<title level="a">AN INTELLECTUAL CENTER IN CHICAGO</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Like all great Jewish centers in the world, Chicago also has a number of beautiful Jewish institutions of which it can be justly proud, but in contrast to all great Jewish centers, Chicago has not a single intellectual center, where the everyday Jew, the Jew who is still somewhat related to the Jewish book and the Jewish intelligence, can refresh or enrich his spiritual thought and absorb himself for a moment in spiritual problems.</p>
   <p>We have here in Chicago several Jewish clubs, various literary societies, a fine Hebrew Institute, and many similar institutions, but there isn't a single spiritual center in the entire Jewish Chicago. The spiritual life of Jewish Chicago is very poor--a desert--a steppe--without movement, <pb facs="5423972_6_0350.jpg" n="2"/>without life. From the standpoint of spiritual life, there is almost no Jewish maxim in Chicago. Every Jew, who still has spiritual endeavors, lives for himself, lives a life of spiritual decrees until his spirit becomes disconcerted and he loses every relationship to the book and thought. Can a Jewish community grow and flourish without a spiritual life?</p>
   <p>Who will dare to answer yes to this question?</p>
   <p>We do not even mention about the great Jewish centers in Eastern Europe, where spiritual life flourishes, although the Jewish population there is mostly extremely poor, but even in many Jewish centers in America with a smaller number of Jews than in Chicago, there is much more of a spiritual life than here. Philadelphia, for instance, has quite a number of intellectual institutions, and every Philadelphia Jew is proud of them. Even in the <pb facs="5423972_6_0351.jpg" n="3"/>third-class Jewish communities in America, like Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Boston there is, in proportion, more spiritual life than in Chicago. The spiritual poverty in the Jewish community of Chicago is so great that it makes a very poor impression on every observer--and this Jewish spiritual poverty is known throughout the world. All the Jewish personalities who visited Chicago for the last ten years agree that, while the Jews of Chicago are charitable people and possess a number of good qualities, yet spiritually they are not on a high level.</p>
   <p>Such a phonomenon is, naturally, not accidental, rather it has certain historical reasons.</p>
   <p>If the Jewish community of Chicago would date back to a day before yesterday, no one would have the right to complain about this phenomenon, because it cannot be expected of newcomers and immigrants to engage themselves in <pb facs="5423972_6_0352.jpg" n="4"/>intellectual activities. However, the Jewish community of Chicago does not date back to yesterday. The Jews have, thank God, already established themselves in Chicago, are largely citizens of the country, well acclimatized and highly Americanized, assuming many obligations of citizenship. One of these obligations is to provide for the spiritual development and for the intellectual life of the whole. It is not enough that various congregations maintain Talmud Torahs where the children are taught the prayers and confirmation. The poorest Jewish farmer in a Polish village does even that much.</p>
   <p>It will also not suffice that a few congregations have a study class, where elderly non-Americanized Jews gather to study the Talmud. Even the few literary societies and open forums do not answer the question of the intellectual life of the Chicago Jewry, because all these groups and societies and cliques serve a limited number of individuals. The efficacy <pb facs="5423972_6_0353.jpg" n="5"/>of these cliques is limited and does not have any influence upon the life of the masses, nor does it shape the spirit of the younger generation.</p>
   <p>A Jewish center like Chicago should, naturally, have its representatives, welfare workers and leaders. The present leaders and welfare workers still adhere to the old generation, and still possess a certain Jewish education, or at least Jewish traditions and memories. The younger generation has no Jewish education, and its Jewish traditions are rather weak. It is impossible to become a leader in Jewish life without a Jewish education, and especially without a general education. If Chicago does not establish any Jewish spiritual centers, it is more than probable that the next generation of Jewish leaders, representatives, and welfare workers will consist of politicans whose entire Jewish interest will be limited to the Jewish vote.</p>
   <p>Thus the lack of an intensive spiritual Jewish life in Chicago also has <pb facs="5423972_6_0354.jpg" n="6"/>its political dangers, which can drive the Chicago Jewry to the edge of an abyss.</p>
   <p>Can something be done to change the present deplorable condition? If you speak to old-timers, they will surely answer, "No". However, if the progress of the world would depend upon these wise and experienced old-timers, people would still inhabit the forests.</p>
   <p>There are still in Chicago enough idealistic and responsible young people who understand quite well the necessity of establishing intellectual centers, and of elevating the spiritual life of the Chicago Jewry.</p>
   <p>If there are in Chicago a few self-sacrificing young men, who can organize our intellectual forces in Chicago, the condition would become quite <pb facs="5423972_6_0355.jpg" n="7"/>different in a short time. Our Chicago Jews are not niggards, and they would support materially every movement whose task it is to establish a Jewish intellectual life in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Will there be found a few idealistic young men with the requisite initiative to begin organizing the spiritual life?</p>
   <p>Let us hope that in this vast spiritual desert there will still be found a few oases.</p>
