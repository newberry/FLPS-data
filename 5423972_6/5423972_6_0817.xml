   <p>In his talk, which the honored rabbi of Sinai Congregation, Dr. Emil G. Hirsch, held at the Home for the Aged, he uttered several truths which the leaders of our charity institutions should take into consideration so that they might escape future criticism.</p>
   <p>Dr. Hirsch discussed and severaly reproached the methods applied in our charity institutions. The rabbi had taken as a parable the methods of raising money for the Marks Nathan Orphanage, and with his unequalable language, depicted how the small unfortunate children of the asylum are dragged upon the pulpit and platform as an attraction, while the directors appeal for a few pennies. Dr. <pb facs="5423972_6_0818.jpg" n="2"/>Hirsch showed how they not only humiliated the children, but also injured them by developing in them a desire to beg. By this they also do not receive as much as they should, i. e. some one contributes one dollar for the sake of mercy, whereas the same person would give one hundred dollars if approached in a proper manner.</p>
   <p>The Rabbi's words fit in very well at this time. The Marks Nathan Home is now reorganizing itself and new executive officers are to be elected. The orphans will now be transferred into a new building and the expenses will be greatly increased. This building can not be paid nor kept up by petty donations.</p>
   <p>It remains, however, for the new officers of the Marks Nathan Home to meditate upon and consider the words of the honored Rabbi of the Sinai Temple.</p>
