   <p>The liberal wing of the Jewish nationalists in Chicago is in a holiday mood at the present time. The reason is that the sixth annual convention of the Jewish National Workers Alliance will open here on the twenty-seventh of this month, and important guests are coming to the convention. Among them will be the prominent Poale Zion leader, Mr. B. Zuckerman, who recently returned from a trip to Eastern Europe as an emissary of the Joint Distribution Committee. Mr. Zuckerman has much to tell of what he heard and saw among our hungry and needy Jews, and we will have an opportunity to hear of his experiences at the convention.</p>
   <p>What is the Jewish National Workers Alliance? The Jewish National Workers Alliance is a co-operative insurance organization. It issues fifteen and <pb facs="5423972_6_0674.jpg" n="2"/>twenty-year policies which offer the same privileges as those of an insurance company. The Alliance issues policies from $100 to $2,000, and pays its members, in case of illness, up to $12 a week. It also has a tuberculosis fund.</p>
   <p>To become a member of the Jewish National Workers Alliance one must be a conscientious, liberal nationalist, or one must wish to become one. Upon acceptance as a member, one must swear, "I hereby declare that I will loyally and truly guard the interests and duties of the Alliance; I will help all workers who are leading the way toward the rejuvenation of the Jewish people, as well as those other workers who are seeking to improve the condition of the proletariat."</p>
   <p>In certain activities of the Jewish people and in others of local interest, the Alliance works hand in hand with the Poale Zion. Fundamentally, it is a Poale Zion organization, but it does not use that title because it was <pb facs="5423972_6_0675.jpg" n="3"/>partly founded in opposition to the Workmen's Circle which is a socialist group and sought to draw members away from the Alliance toward the concept of internationalism, and at the same time, to furnish them with the same financial benefits that the Alliance offered.</p>
   <p>The Jewish National Workers Alliance has succeeded in enrolling about 8,000 members. And we ask: "Aren't there more than that number of Jewish liberal nationalists in America?" Of course there are, but they belong to the Workmen's Circle, or to other orders which are conservative. The Jewish National Workers Alliance has not been able to enroll all the liberal nationalists in spite of the fact that it offers such excellent inducements.</p>
   <p>We base this contention on the situation in Chicago. In Chicago there are, we may say, a few thousand liberal nationalists. Milwaukee, too, has a few thousand. The territory surrounding Chicago also has quite a few <pb facs="5423972_6_0676.jpg" n="4"/>liberal nationalists. But when we examine statistics, we find that the Alliance has only 400 members in Chicago, and 400 in Milwaukee. The whole surrounding territory has about 800 members.</p>
   <p>A good number of the Poale Zion in Chicago belong to the Workmen's Circle and this is likewise true in Milwaukee. Some of them joined the Workmen's Circle many years ago, when they were socialists. Others joined that organization recently, after they resigned from the Jewish National Workers Alliance, or they retained their membership in both organizations. But most of the Poale Zion are disgusted with the local leaders of the Jewish National Workers Alliance, as can be judged from the fact that they are leaving their beloved organization.</p>
   <p>In no other district of the Jewish National Workers Alliance do they keep a paid secretary, and yet there is one in Chicago. The individual who holds the position of secretary, Brother William Nathanson, has not only <pb facs="5423972_6_0677.jpg" n="5"/>failed to get members into the Alliance, he has even driven many of them away, it is said. We know of more than a score of Poale Zionists who won't even visit the Jewish National Workers Alliance because of this secretary. They claim that first, he is not "one of them". Second, he takes too much upon himself. Third, he accepts pay for work that others do with no thought of remuneration. These alienated Poale Zionists are expected to organize a movement against the secretary for the above-mentioned reasons, and they hope to win.</p>
   <p>Of course, Mr. Nathanson will have an opportunity to defend himself. At any rate, even if this attitude against him is unjust, the very fact that members leave the order because of him should make him resign his position--the sooner the better.</p>
   <p>The Jewish National Workers Alliance can gain many members among the Jews of Chicago, and it deserves to have them. It is the antidote against the <pb facs="5423972_6_0678.jpg" n="6"/>complete withdrawal of our Jewish workers from the struggle of their people. The Jewish National Workers Alliance has proven, as its constitution states, that it is more than a "security" organization, that it has higher aims and principles than mutual assistance; it is nationalist in scope, its members believe in and acknowledge the need for nationalism because mankind can truly progress only when all its groups are free and equal. The Jewish National Workers Alliance wishes our people to be free, and to have a strengthened position. They have confidence in the ability of the Jewish people to create a better present and a more brilliant future.</p>
   <p>Such an organization deserves a large membership. It should have not only those who already belong, but also many others who should join; on no condition should members drop out.</p>
   <p>We greet the delegates to the sixth annual convention of the Jewish National Workers Alliance, and wish them success in their fine work.</p>
