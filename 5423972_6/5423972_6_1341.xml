   <p>The Jewish populace shows great interest in the Tuberculosis Exhibition, which is being held in West Park Number 2, under the supervision of the Jewish Consumptive Society. Thousands of men and women are visiting the exhibition, where advice is given them on the prevention of the different diseases.</p>
   <p>First of all, they explain how to protect oneself from various microbes which breed in filthy places.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1342.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Plenty of air and cleanliness in the home is the antidote of the white plague, which robs so many lives daily.</p>
   <p>Everything is explained at the exhibition through lectures, and stereotype pictures showing how the horrible bacteria germs infect the human body.</p>
   <p>More than 1,500 people attended the exhibition yesterday. Ten clubs from the Maxwell Settlement House visited the exhibition yesterday, and after visiting all the rooms where these pictures can be found, they convened in the assembly hall where a discussion followed under <pb facs="5423972_6_1343.jpg" n="3"/>the direction of Miss Carrie Yankers, social worker of the Maxwell Settlement House.</p>
   <p>An innumerable amount of free literature was distributed, in which the diseases are discussed.</p>
   <p>The lectures for this evening are: Dr. L.A. Gorman, who will speak on "Tuberculosis and Throat Disease;" Mr. James Minik, superintendent of the Tuberculosis Institute, who will speak on "Cleanliness As An Antidote of Consumption;" Miss Minnie Lows, superintendent of the Bureau of Personal Service, who will speak on the "Necessity to Keep Clean."</p>
