<title level="a">$10,145 COLLECTED AT THE LAYING OF THE CORNERSTONE FOR THE SYNAGOGUE IN OAK FOREST</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>About one thousand Jewish men and women from various parts of Chicago yesterday witnessed the ceremony of the laying of the cornerstone for a synagogue and social center in Oak Forest. The Jewish inmates there were very happy--first because of the great number of guests, and second because the foundation was laid for the long-anticipated structure in which they will have a kosher kitchen, and in which they will find spiritual satisfaction.</p>
   <p>A total of $10,454 was collected in cash and pledges. This sum will enable the Society for the Incurably Sick Jews to erect the structure all the sooner.</p>
   <p>President Paul Rissman,in his short address, thanked the group for the interest they had shown toward the Jewish inmates of Oak Forest, and then turned the chair over to Mr. M. Rosenberg. Mr. Rosenberg called in turn upon Rabbi [A.] Cardon, <pb facs="5423972_6_1221.jpg" n="2"/>Rabbi [Saul] Silber, Rabbi [B.Z.] Margolin, Mr. Hindzel, and the assistant superintendent of the institution, Dr. V. Kenet. Mr. H. M. Barnett was asked to act as auctioneer, and he did a good job of it.</p>
   <p>Mr. Barnett boosted the price for the honor of laying the cornerstone to $2,200. This was sold to Mr. and Mrs. Feinberg. Mr. and Mrs. Yerahmiel Rosenberg paid $1,300 for the second stone.</p>
   <p>Then the smaller honors were sold. The Economy Rubber Tire Company gave $500; Mr. Benjamin Cohen, $300. Congregation Anshe Kneseth Israel sent $564 with its treasurer, Mr. Morris Goodman. Large and small donations were received, including $5 from a Jewish patient whose name was listed with Mr. D. P. Pollack. Thus, $10,145 was collected, and turned over to Mr. Herman Ellenbogen, vice-president of the West Side National Bank, by the treasurer, Mrs. Bernstein. Her husband, Mr. Harry Bernstein, promised to donate $5,000 to the institution. The group [who had come to witness the ceremony] remained in Oak Forest until <pb facs="5423972_6_1222.jpg" n="3"/>late. Refreshments were served to all by the women's committee, headed by Mrs. Benjamin, and assisted by Mrs. M. J. Tubin.</p>
