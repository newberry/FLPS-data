   <p>The directors of the Malmonedes hospital are carrying on quite an active campaign to save this institution from the auctioneer's hammer. Fifty-five days remain in which to raise the necessary sum, in order that the only Orthodox hospital in Chicago can be placed in position to reopen for the benefit of the Jewish sick to whose suffering is added the mental discomfort of having to be in a non-Jewish hospital, where they cannot get their food as required by Jewish dietary law.</p>
   <p>The outlook now appears very bright that the necessary sum will be raised in the time designated, and Chicago will again have its Jewish hospital. The directors are doing all in their power to save the institution, for which they carry on their work with great love and devotion. Therefore, they believe in and are assured of the success of their work. Naturally, it depends mostly on the general public which must respond to the appeal of the directors to save the hospital.</p>
   <p>So there are only fifty-five days left in which the Jews of Chicago can save the only Orthodox hospital, the only one of its kind, in our great city.</p>
