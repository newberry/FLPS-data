   <p>A large gathering of people from various parts of the city attended yesterday the dedication of the Marks Nathan Orphan Home in honor of the remodeling of the institution, thus increasing the accommodations for a larger number of orphans than are at present in the Home.</p>
   <p>The friendship for and the interest in the institution were especially manifested by the audience when the different "honors" were auctioned off. About twenty-five thousand dollars was collected.....</p>
   <p>A donation of fifty-one dollars was given by Mr. M. P. Ginsburg, publisher of the Courier, in honor of Mrs. Ginsburg, who became fifty-one years of age yesterday.</p>
   <p>The following speakers addressed the gathering: President Charles Herron, <pb facs="5423972_6_1570.jpg" n="2"/>Rabbi Nisan Budzinsky and Judge Harry M. Fisher, Mrs. Jacob Malkes donated twenty-five dollars to the Home for the safe return of Judge Fisher from his journey to Eastern Europe as a relief representative.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Budzinsky, in his address, emphasized Judge Fisher's mission and his interest in the war- and pogrom-sufferers. He offered him his blessings for a happy journey and a safe return. During the time of the blessing Judge Fisher stood with bowed head and cried softly.</p>
