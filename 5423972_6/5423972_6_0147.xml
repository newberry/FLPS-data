   <p>We wish to call the attention of all congregations, their officers, and the Chicago public to the fact that the three Hebrew schools on the West Side will not open this winter unless you begin to cooperate with them, and, thereby, assure the preservation and dissemination of the Torah. We are in need of three teachers; we have no coal as yet; and the expenses of the three Talmud Torahs have doubled, while their income is not half the amount of the original expenses. It is your duty to come to the meeting this Tuesday evening, during the intermediary days of Sukoth, not only to elect officers, but also to prevent any action which would place 1,100 poor children on the streets.</p>
   <p>The membership of the Talmud Torahs has decreased and donations have diminished; the number of poor children, however, is mounting. We have warned you about this predicament during the High Holidays. The only synagogue which has done its share is Beth Hamidrash Hagadol B'nai Jacob. Due largely to the efforts of the marvelous and dynamic speaker, Mr. Lebowitz, sixty persons have become members of the Talmud Torahs, and have contributed a total of $100 in pledges and donations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0148.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We appeal to all the secretaries to send in the lists of those who have made pledges for the Talmud Torahs. May they be blessed by the Almighty God.</p>
   <p>V. Farger, president,</p>
   <p>A. Wolfson,</p>
   <p>L. Epstein, and</p>
   <p>J. Rosenberg, vice-presidents.</p>
