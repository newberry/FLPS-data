   <p>The report of the school committee was next in order. It showed that during th past year 140 children were enrolled as pupils and distributed in five classes, and that they were instructed by five teachers, paid and voluntary. The average attendance was good; the progress made was very gratifying. Three entertainments were given during the year for the scholars. The school committee introduced a system of rewards for deserving scholars and new textbooks in the various branches of instruction. It recommended the establishment of an advanced or "post-confirmation" class in which the scholars leaving the Sabbath school might be instructed in Hebrew and continue their studies in the history and religion of our race.</p>
