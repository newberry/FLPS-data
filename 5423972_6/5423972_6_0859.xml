   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>Allow me to express my opinion regarding the proposition made by the German Yehudim (reformed Jews); to give a subsidy for our two orthodox institutions, the Home for the Aged, and the Orphan Home, if the latter will stop holding their annual affairs to raise money for the institutions.</p>
   <p>I think that such a proposition is not practicable. The institutions have been built and supported by Russian Jews, and I don't see why they should accept a grant at this time when the Homes are in no financial trouble. Why should we give up our money raising affairs which affords us all a great deal of pleasure?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0860.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Why should we give up the independence of the Homes? Why should we suffer humiliation by conceding our defeat to the reformed Jews? I can't see how such affairs, in any way, discredit us, or cause humiliation to our German Yehudim? I think their proposal is only a fad with them. It is a means to please their vanity. If they really had philanthropic intentions of helping our orthodox institutions, they would grant money without attaching any provisions or clauses.</p>
   <p>The affairs, given so far by the two Homes, have been successful in every respect. They have been attended by large crowds, who enjoyed themselves very much. The affairs were conducted in a conservative and decent manner, and I am sure that the German Yehudim have never conducted an affair with more success and decency. So why do they object to these affairs?</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_0861.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>By running these affairs, the institutions are not only benefiting financially, but they also gain the sympathy of all guest of the affairs. Moral support means a lot, and the institutions get more than just moral support; they gain in popularity. When the donation from the reform Jews are accepted, then it will mean that the Homes are being supported by the Hebrew Charities, and will drive away many of its members. Private donations coming from the poor classes will stop, and in this way, it is very probable that these fine Homes will be ruined altogether. So let's not accept!</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Louis Solomon,</p>
   <p>284 West North Avenue.</p>
