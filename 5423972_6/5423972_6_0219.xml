   <p>The words which Dr. [Emil G.] Hirsch, the chairman of the school board of the Jewish Training School, addressed to the pupils who left the institution yesterday were indeed very touching and impressive. He emphasized the fact that the pupils attending this Training School were not to be pitied, but that they were to be envied, because they had the privilege of attending one of the best schools in the city, where the genuine principles of the "new training methods" were being applied. This institution, he declared, is not a technical school, but is an institution for training in the most comprehensive sense because it aims to develop the student mentally, morally, and physically. He also praised the efficiency of the director, Mr. Bamberger, and of the teaching staff.</p>
   <p>Although the school has existed for the short time of eight months, some of the boys have accumulated considerable knowledge. Dr. Hirsch appealed to those who were being dismissed, especially to those who were Russian Jews, to go out into the world without prejudice. It is to be regretted, he said, that they [the Russian Jewish children] made a mistake in the selection of their parents. It <pb facs="5423972_6_0220.jpg" n="2"/>would have been wiser to have chosen Chicago parents, parents who perhaps live on Michigan Avenue. This situation, however, cannot be altered any more, and they would have to make the best of it, combating the prejudices by superior knowledge and correct behavior. They, as Jews, were not entitled to achieve less than others, but it should be their earnest endeavor to supersede others by their attainments and by their moral actions. Dr. Hirsch concluded his address by saying that he believed that all the pupils, as far as he knew them, would live up to his expectancy.</p>
