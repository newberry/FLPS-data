  <body>
   <p>There is no doubt that the various investigation committees, appointed from time to time by the Federation in order to investigate the different institutions, have aided in putting these institutions on a much firmer basis than previously. The investigation the Marks Nathan Orphanage underwent, according to the recommendations of the Federation's Investigating Committee, is a blessing to this institution. If one were to go into the Marks Nathan Orphanage now, he could not help but notice it is more active and better managed than before. The renovation which the Hebrew Sheltering Home underwent through the Federation's investigation, placed this institution, also known as Father Abraham's Hotel, on such a footing as to make Chicago proud.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1319.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is understood that in the investigation of an institution there are irresponsible people who want to catch fish in troubled water and take advantage of their position for selfish purposes. They try to convince the heads of institutions that the Federation's intention is to seize the institution in its grip, on the other hand they want to influence the other members of the investigating committee to the effect that they should break away from directors of institutions whose opinions do not suit their interests. But the integrity and fair-mindedness of the investigators and the devotion of the heads of these institutions, have ultimately triumphed over all these trivialities. The investigators and the officers of the institutions collaborated harmoniously, not seeking any personal gains but devoting themselves body and soul to the institution and those benefited by it.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1320.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It was only natural that whenever the investigators, as well as the officers, were confronted with a change of tactics and order in their respective institutions, each shared a different opinion, which resulted in discussions, discussions which were shaped by the character and temperament of these people. At times they were fiery, and at other times tranquil. However, regardless of how heated or moderate the discussions may have been, a plan was ultimately arrived at upon which all agreed. Those employed by the institutions applied all their influence to carry the adopted plan through, and the result of their task is such as to be an honor for the Chicago Jewish Community.</p>
   <p>The present investigation of the Maimonedes Hospital is by no means all. It is not the first nor will it be the last. As soon as this investigation <pb facs="5423972_6_1321.jpg" n="4"/>committee completes its work in the hospital, it will investigate in succession the remaining institutions. These investigations are not made with a view to finding fault in order to sling mud at our best and most faithful welfare workers, but with a view to help in the natural development of the Jewish Community of Chicago, which has grown up by leaps and bounds. We cannot run now our benevolent institutions as we did when they were supported by nickel collections.</p>
   <p>Perhaps there are many who share the opinion that the Maimonedes Hospital is still too young, - in all it is only six months old, - to undergo an investigation; others may think that the older institutions should have been investigated before, because in these institutions age has inevitably developed policies which could stand some improvement. However, circumstances <pb facs="5423972_6_1322.jpg" n="5"/>were such that fate pointed to Maimonedes Hospital, causing it to be the first institution to be investigated. It is a blessing from God, so to speak, that the Maimonedes Hospital happened to be the first institution to be investigated.</p>
   <p>Incidentally, the directors of the Maimonedes Hospital are also the central figures of the Federation. As we understand it, this year, as well as last year, the active directors of the Maimonedes Hospital were chairmen of the most important committees. A few names will suffice to confirm the truth of this.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1323.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The president of the Maimonedes Hospital, Mr. I. Lurie, was chairman of the Institution Committee last year; Judge Harry M. Fisher, was chairman of the Office Committee that directed all activities of the Federation; Max M. Korshak was chairman of the Propaganda Committee; Samuel J. Rosenblatt was an active member of every committee; Mr. Millinker, secretary of the hospital, was the chairman of the Purchasing Committee, and so it was with every committee of the Federation.</p>
   <p>This year, as far as we know, the vice-president of the Maimonedes Hospital, Mr. Samuel J. Rosenblatt, is chairman of the most important committee of the Federation, The Ways and Means Committee, whose duty it is to raise money <pb facs="5423972_6_1324.jpg" n="7"/>to finance all institutions; Mr. Max M. Korshak is chairman of the next important committee, whose task is to solicit subscribers; Judge Harry M. Fisher was elected vice president, which makes him a member of the Executive Committee of the Federation.</p>
   <p>Regardless of the age of the hospital and the experiences it had endured, the investigation introduces new responsibilities. It is just like expecting a visit from the mother-in-law; it doesn't make any difference how well the house appears, the daughter-in-law inspects everything, lest something is overlooked which may be detected by the mother-in-law. But should the daughter-in-law overlook a thing, and the mother-in-law notices it, it is not so terrible. At least, it will not cause a divorce.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1325.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>In the present investigation of the Maimonedes Hospital, the same excitement prevails as in previous investigations. The members of the group have plans and projects; they run about confused from one to another, speaking promiscuously about one and a thousand things and putting on airs as if they were great authorities. But the true workers to whom the institutions are sacred, to whom there is no difference between the Hospital, the Marks Nathan Orphanage, the Home For The Aged, and other institutions, go about their work unperturbedly. All this gossip does not even penetrate their ears. They do not permit troubled water to form; consequently, there is no place to catch fish.</p>
   <p>The investigating Committee is now preparing its report, in which credit is given the workers, i.e., the directors and founders of the hospital, for <pb facs="5423972_6_1326.jpg" n="9"/>the good work that was done. The Investigation Committee also offers many recommendations, which the officers will undoubtedly carry through. Those who sought scandals and those who due to personal objectives intended to sling mud at the Chicago Jewish welfare workers, will as usual remain with a wry face. The Maimonedes Hospital will remain as a monument through the activity and labor of the Chicago Orthodox Jewry.</p>
   <p>And so the Maimonedes Hospital is on the agenda in the Jewish Community.</p>
