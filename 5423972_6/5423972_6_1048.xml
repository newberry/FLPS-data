   <p>Of three thousand and five-hundred applicants, about one thousand and five-hundred received assistance, comprising one thousand, three-hundred and twenty seven from resident families. To some clients, we furnished tools, sewing machines, to others, we distributed shoes and clothing. We paid bills for medicine and funeral expenses, procured household furniture, provided sick persons with nurses and physicians, and found families for the nurture of orphaned babes.</p>
   <p>We have about twenty-five monthly recipients of charity, at an expense of over $200 a month. They are mostly poor, helpless widows and women with families of small children.....worthy people, doing their best to make a living, but with insufficient earnings and without assistance from relatives.</p>
   <p>Our expenses for railroad passes furnished to our home poor who changed their residence to better their situation and to strangers, in cases where it became almost our imperative duty to furnish them with transportation, were unexpectedly heavy, amounting to about $1,300.00.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1049.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Relief committees or individuals of other cities forwarded impecunious families to us expecting us to send the travelers to their places of destination, often far distant. In the case of our non-compliance, such people threatened to become heavy and permanent burdens upon our community. They were not our poor. We had to rid our community of their presence as speedily as possible. Self-protection demanded it, and the cheapest thing to do was to procure passes. Genuine or pretended Russian refugees formed the largest contingent of this migratory class.</p>
   <p>While a great many of the thousand Russian refugees who were directed to our city became self-sustaining and are of good and industrious habits, yet a larger number have become a burden upon us and must still be cared for. If it had not been for them, ourwork would have been comparatively light.</p>
