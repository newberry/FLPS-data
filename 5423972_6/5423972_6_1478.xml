   <p>Approximately four-thousand women and men marched to the new home of the Douglas Park Day and Night Nursery yesterday and celebrated the grand opening, with music, donations and greetings from many labor organizations.</p>
   <p>Thousands applauded the marching masses and trucks that conveyed the small children into their new home. The first speaker was Rabbi Budzinsky, who opened the nursery in a formal manner.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sacks, chairman of the Building Fund, and Mr. Lerner, chairman of the executives, assisted the auctioneer, Mr. Rubin, in selling the keys to the doors of the building. Mrs. Ida Fink purchased the first key for one-hundred and fifty dollars; and Mrs. Abraham, the wife of a member of the Carpenters Union Local #504, gave one-hundred and twenty five dollars for the second key. The Bakers Union Local #237 contributed twenty five dollars and Sam Nachtingal, a delegate of the Bakers Union, gave twenty five dollars.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1479.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Comrade Hanock and Weinstein, secretary and president of the United Hebrew Trades, donated twenty five dollars each. Afterwards, they sold the opening of the electric lights and Mrs. Ida Fink paid fifty dollars for this privilege. Rooms were later sold, and Mr. Dolkin gave two-hundred dollars for a room; Mrs. Breindel two-hundred and twenty five dollars; and Mr. and Mrs. Rothenberg two-hundred dollars.</p>
   <p>Mr. Socks introduced Mr. Holzman, president of the Carpenters Local #504, and Mr. Balanik, business agent of #504. Both extended greetings to the Nursery and promised, on behalf of their unions, to do everything possible for the nursery, because they recognize the necessity and importance of that institution.</p>
   <p>Rabbi Budzinsky, made a warm appeal to those present for the support of the Douglas Park Day and Night Nursery.</p>
   <p>Comrade Hanock greeted the Nursery on behalf of the United Hebrew Trades, and stated that the delegate of the United Hebrew Trades, Mrs. Erlich, of the Painters Union Local #521, did very much for the nursery.</p>
   <pb facs="5423972_6_1480.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The City Central Committee of the Workmen's Circle, was represented by Comrade Lambert extended greeting on behalf of the Workmen's Circle.</p>
   <p>Comrade Morris Sickind, extended greeting on behalf of the Forward and stated that nobody knows, what the nursery does for the Working Class children, as does the Forward, where all the unfortunate mothers turn to for adjusting the very serious matter of providing a home for the children that they cannot take care of.</p>
