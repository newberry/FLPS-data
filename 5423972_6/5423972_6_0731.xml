   <p>Buffalo, New York, August 20: The first session of the twenty-second annual convention of the Independent Western Star Order, which opened this morning, was very interesting. The convention was greeted by a personal representative of the mayor of this city and by a representative of the Chamber of Commerce. After all the greetings [were received], the convention got down to business, and the Grand Master, Nathan T. Brener, read his annual message.</p>
   <p>In his message, Mr. Brener lauded all members of the Executive Committee and upon mentioning the Grand Secretary, Mr. I. Shapiro, he paused at this reference to the well-known fire case. He also stated that in the past two years nine thousand members had been suspended, attributing this loss to the secretary. When speaking of the fire case, the Grand Master lamented the loss of $8,000 which the Order had sustained. The Supreme Court of Illinois <pb facs="5423972_6_0732.jpg" n="2"/>ruled against the Order because the leaders of the Order had been late in notifying the insurance company of their loss.</p>
   <p>The Grand Master's message profoundly impressed the convention. The delegates then demanded a new administration. A committee of delegates turned to Dr. George Sultan of Chicago requesting him to place his candidacy before the Grand Master, but the well-known doctor declined.</p>
   <p>Thus far there are four candidates for Grand Master. Three of them, Mr. Joseph Marks, Captain H. Weiss, and H. M. Barnet, are from Chicago and one, Max Levy, is from Cincinnati.</p>
