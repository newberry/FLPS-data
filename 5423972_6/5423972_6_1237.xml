<title level="a">TODAY, THE CEREMONIAL OPENING OF THE SINAI HOSPITAL</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Today, at 3 P.M., the Sinai Hospital will be opened with great ceremony, beginning in the tent just outside the building, and ending within the hospital assembly hall.</p>
   <p>The Sinai Hospital stands on the site formerly occupied by the Maimonides Hospital, which was the first Kosher hospital in Chicago, at California, near 15th Street.</p>
   <p>After the ceremonies, it will be opened to the public for inspection.</p>
   <p>The following will speak in the tent ceremonies: Benjamin Rosenthal, Dr. J. Dill Robertson, health commissioner of Chicago, Rabbi Efriam Epstein, Rabbi Ezreal Epstein, Rabbi Saul Silver, Dr. Tobias Shonfarber, Dr. Rudolph Coffee, Rabbi A. E. Kardon and Harry S. Levinson.</p>
   <p>The Sinai Hospital possesses ninety beds, of which one-third will be free, <pb facs="5423972_6_1238.jpg" n="2"/>and another third, half price.</p>
   <p>The place will be most beautiful and most modern, possessing a staff of the best doctors in Chicago, under whose supervision the most modern medical improvements have been installed, such as are almost unequalled anywhere within the city.</p>
   <p>The Sinai Hospital is the last word in medical science.</p>
   <p>The committee that undertook the responsibility of opening this kosher hospital finished its work today. It collected fifteen thousand dollars necessary to complete various sections in the hospital, and secured the interests of enough people to assure its success.</p>
   <p>But without the aid of the large Jewish community, it cannot be successful.</p>
   <p>At this opening, we find no debts. The fifty thousand dollars that Mr. Morris Kurzon invested in redeeming the hospital at the bankruptcy, he will accept <pb facs="5423972_6_1239.jpg" n="3"/>re-payment in yearly rentals without any interest charges. He is also ready to sell the building to the hospital at any time so desired.</p>
   <p>Mr. Morris Kurzon is today the true hero of the party for accomplishing what everyone thought was the impossible. His work for the last two years is today crowned with success. Thursday, at the hospital, a meeting of the Rabbis was held to settle the "kosher" question. It was decided that a committee of Rabbi Ezreal Epstein, Rabbi Ephriam Epstein, Rabbi A. E. Kurdon, Rabbi S. Shach, and Rabbi Tzivia Rosenblum, met with a committee of three doctors and three trustees. Together, they will formulate all particulars regarding "Kosher" differences at the hospital.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Pearl is the superintendent of the nurses.</p>
