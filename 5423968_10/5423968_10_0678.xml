<title level="a">PASTOR APPOINTED FOR ST. PETER AND PAUL PARISH</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The Reverend Paul Rhode has been appointed the permanent pastor of the new St. Paul and Peter Parish by the Archbishop of Chicago. This was made possible by the combined efforts of the parishioners, who insisted on a regular pastor.</p>
   <p>Initial services were celebrated by the Reverend Rhode on December 22, without the assistance of any other priests. Since then regular services have been held.</p>
   <p>At the first services a choir was made up of the Misses Helen and Agnes Tater and Messrs. Pawlowskt, Ligmanowski, and Truchalski. The choir was directed by the new organist, Mr. Daniels.</p>
   <p>The school children's choir sang at yesterday's services.</p>
   <p>Although the pastor has not taken permanent residence because of lack of rooms, <pb facs="5423968_10_0679.jpg" n="2"/>quarters are being arranged for him. In order to facilitate matters the parish committee convened last night to take up the problem of making a home for their new pastor.</p>
   <p>A school has been organized and opened.</p>
   <p>The church will not be consecrated until next year. From all outward appearances, the parish seems to be growing steadily.</p>
