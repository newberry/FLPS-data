   <p>The members of the St. Barbara Society extend sincere thanks to the following societies and groups, which participated in the flag-blessing celebration held on Sunday afternoon, December 10: The Jacob Wajer Society No. 1, under the protection of St. Francis Xavier, the St. Joseph Benevolent Society, the St. Hyacinth Society, the Polish Uhlans under the protection of Holy Mary of Czestochowa, and the Guard of the Queen of the Polish Crown. The last two groups deserve special mention for their assistance as guards of honor during this important ceremony. We thank all of these organizations with a sincere and old-fashioned God bless you.</p>
   <p>At this occasion we sincerely thank our pastor, Reverend Vincent Barzynski, for performing the ceremony of blessing the banner and for his wonderfully appropriate speech. The Reverend Pastor urged us to emulate St. Barbara and live honestly, as befits Christians. He said that we should try to improve ourselves, that we should get rid of everything that is evil in our Society. May God preserve him for the longest time for giving us such valuable advice, <pb facs="5423968_10_1054.jpg" n="2"/>and all of us join in thanking him most sincerely.</p>
   <p>In the name of St. Barbara Society:</p>
   <p>Frank Zilla, president</p>
   <p>Joseph Gojke, secretary.</p>
   <p>The St. Barbara Society received its new banner last week. The banner, which is very beautiful and was made in Chicago by Mrs. Slominska, is embroidered with silk. Mrs. Slominska deserves the greatest praise for her handiwork, and we are duty bound to recommend her to all the Polish societies here and outside of Chicago. We also wish to thank her for completing the banner on time.</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
