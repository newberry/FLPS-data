   <p>According to a cable received here from Berlin, the United States Ambassador in that city has interceded for E. Z. Brodowski before the German government, since the latter, it seems, was not given the exequatur to act as American consul in Wroclaw (Breslau). The Ambassador has informed the [German] Minister of Foreign Affairs that Brodowski will be replaced by President McKinley if this situation will lead to the disturbance of internal affairs with Germany.</p>
   <p>Not more than two weeks ago a dispatch from Europe said that the German decision relative to Brodowski was influenced by a report from the German consul in Chicago. After receipt of this information here, a number of outstanding citizens went to the German consulate to speak in favor of Brodowski. The consul greeted the callers and treated them as royal guests. However, he said <pb facs="5423968_10_1431.jpg" n="2"/>that he was sorry to inform them that he could do nothing further, since the official report demanded of him about Brodowski had already been sent out.</p>
   <p>From the words of the German consul, it can be gathered that his report does not speak in favor of Brodowski. It also must be said that the German minister will not give a reply to the American Ambassador until the report from the German consul of Chicago reaches him. The matter for the present rests, pending the reaction to the report.</p>
   <p>Whether the decision is going to be favorable or not is a question that will be answered within the near future. The reason why Mr. Brodowski was not accepted is that he is considered a "Polish agitator."</p>
   <p>It seems to us that the German government is harassed by a wind the direction of which it doesn't know.</p>
