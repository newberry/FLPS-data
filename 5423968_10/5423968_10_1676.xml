   <p>Last Friday the President of the United States received in audience the representative of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, Rev. John Sobeszczyk, professor of St. Stanislaus College, who, together with several hundred prominent persons, appeared there in order to sound a protest against the proposed bills, having as their aims the limitation and restriction of immigration.</p>
   <p>The audience lasted three hours. Among the speakers was likewise the Reverend representative of the Union, who was presented to the President by Congressman T. Gallagher, for which he should be given recognition. We must mention here that Mr. Gallagher belongs to the most determined and staunch defenders of immigrants, and is putting forth all his efforts not to allow the barring of entrance into this country to those unfortunates whose only fault is that they cannot road or write.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1677.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Besides the above mentioned who spoke against restriction of immigration laws, pretests were also made by Congressmen A. Sabath, McAndrews, Graham and others. Besides the Polish delegation from Chicago, there were also delegations from Philadelphia and Jersey City.</p>
   <p>The text of the speech by Rev. Sobieszczyk, rendered during the audience, is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Mr. President: As the representative of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union, an organization of Polish speaking citizens of this country with a membership of 80,000, permit no first to express our thanks and appreciation for the privileges of addressing you on this important question before you.</p>
   <p>"Our people under oppression suffered persecution for years. Our oppressors were depriving us of our finances, language, religion and education in order to annihilate us.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1678.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Our people came to this great and liberal country to enjoy shelter, liberty and privileges of a free and liberal government. We have proven our patriotism, loyalty and gratitude for the freedom we enjoy here. Even at present we are giving proof of the same, to this government and to this country.</p>
   <p>"While our kin in Poland are suffering most from the cruel war, under three governments, we, although broken hearted, are the strictest observers of the neutrality proclamation so wisely given to the American nation by you, Mr. President, as our Executive and Chief.</p>
   <p>"We stand strongly for this government and the prosperity of this great country. We stand and speak for the good of the laboring class.</p>
   <p>"We desire to see the American citizenship, in the interest of this our home of freedom and progress, to be strong and sound in body, mind and morals.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1679.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"We are in favor of safeguards of immigration which will prevent the landing upon our shores of persons of unsound body, of impaired mind or of vicious, criminal, anarchistic or immoral characters.</p>
   <p>"And notwithstanding all the arguments pro and contra which are known to all interested, just because we appreciate and love this country, government and everything that made the name of the United States so glorious amongst nations. Voicing the sentiments of the 80,000 members of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union whom I represent in particular and practically all the Poles of the United States in general, I protest and protest most strongly against the literary test contained in this bill, for it is unjust, unfair, unpatriotic, un-American, inhuman and it aims to destroy, in their foundation, our American ideals of liberty and liberality."</p>
