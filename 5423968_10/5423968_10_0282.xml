   <p>The people of the new Polish parish of St. Cyryl and Metedy have never seen a more beautiful gathering of priests than the one held at this parish last Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. Forty hours of devotion were performed during these three days. At the head of these devotions was the Most Rev. Father Kandyd, ably assisted by the following priests: Father Chadniewicz, Father Cosimi, C. R.; Father Filipski, C. R.; Father Kascrsyeki, C. R.; Father Pyplatz, Father Jung, Father Zwierzehowski, Father Karabas. Father Szypkowski and Fathers Rus and Rosch.</p>
   <p>A few hundred people received holy communion during this three day procession. During these three days, high mass was held at 11:30 in the morning; in the evening were held the vespers and the Blessing of the Holy Sacrament. Six gospels were preached at this three day congregation; every priest took part in each and every one of these services.</p>
   <p>The church was filled with an overflowing crowd at the evening services.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0283.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The final church procession was led by Rev. Father John Kasprzycki. The city's Most Rev. Father blessed each and every person individually at the close of the three day procession.</p>
   <p>The interior of the church and the big center altar were beautifully decorated and trimmed by the Felician Sisters.</p>
   <p>The church choir, for these three days, was composed of singers from the different Polish churches in our city.</p>
