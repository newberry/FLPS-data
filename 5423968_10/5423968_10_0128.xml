   <p>Our dear Resurrection Fathers, shamefully defeated in their opposition to the erection of a new park and field house in the 16th Ward, being afraid that their sheep will emigrate, started a new scheme of lengthening Bradley street to Ashland Ave., cutting Holt and Dickson streets, and making more room around their castle. The committee, consisting of Rev. Siatka; the alderman of the 16th Ward; Czekala, and a "boiler-doctor," Zagrzebski, obeying the orders of the Resurrection Fathers, appeared before the Board of local improvements with a demand to lengthen Bradley street to Ashland ave. A few words of explanation as to why our reverends desire that Bradley street be lenthened. Because of the founding of a new park right under their nose, they lost many of their sheep, who were compelled by the city to sell their real estate and move out to another parish. The new park is too narrow and probably will be widened in the near future, annexing part of Cleaver to Holt streets, and causing again a loss of many woolly sheep; and our "reverends" income would be decreased considerably. Therefore they want to lengthen Bradley Street to Ashland Ave., and keep the woolly sheep in their parish, blocking by this action the widening of the park.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0129.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Because of the high cost of lengthening Bradley Street, the city would be handicapped and probably would give up the idea of widening the park.</p>
   <p>It is not very important how the Resurrection Fathers choose to hold their parish intact; it is their business. But who is going to pay for the improvement?</p>
   <p>According to information obtained by us, the cost of lengthening the street must be paid by the people living in a radius of one square mile. The cost would be about $375,000, and all taxpayers living between Division street, and North Ave. and Ashland Ave. to the river, will be forced to pay the bill just for the sake of keeping a few hundred parishioners together.</p>
   <p>If our reverends desire to make such an improvement, let them pay for it.</p>
   <p>It is our duty to warn the people against this conspiracy.</p>
