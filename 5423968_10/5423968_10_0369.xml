   <p>A great deal of trouble was caused by the first bishop, Kaminski, of the independent church faction [independent of the Pope]. He split their temple into as many sections as there are preachers. Bishop-elect Kaminski did not desire to be any better than Kolaszewski, Hedur, or any of the assisting priests.</p>
   <p>This is one of the reasons why we are not surprised [to learn] that Anthony Kozlewski [the disaffected Roman Catholic priest who started the independent church movement in Chicago] does not wish to be superior to Kaminski. Consequently he proceeded to issue a statement in one of the Polish-American pelemic newspapers that Kaminski and his entire bishopric are worthless because he, Anthony Kozlowski, is the sole bishop-elect "out in the sticks" [reference to a sparsely populated section of Chicago--on Northwest Side].</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0370.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>How Kozlowski gained this title is another matter. We acknowledge that he has as much right to it as have Kaminski, Kolaszewski, and other independent preachers.</p>
   <p>Kozlowski is well acquainted with the situation, for he has severed his connection with the Pope at Rome, as well as with all Roman Catholic bishops and priests. If in this event he still considers himself a priest, then he has the right to call himself "bishop," "cardinal," and even "pope".</p>
   <p>The only concern to be felt is for the Polish people. How long are they going to permit themselves to be befuddled by fallen priests without honor and faith and listen to sermons in the independent temples, where sacrilegious services take place? [In all this] there is no logic, no healthy thought, no simple honesty.</p>
   <p>The people that crowd into the temple on Lubeck Street in St. Hedwig's parish <pb facs="5423968_10_0371.jpg" n="3"/>community realize that it is difficult for them to raise funds to support their place of worship, and that they cannot pay half the interest outstanding on the debt which is a constantly increasing burden. Under such circumstances, how is the new "bishop-elect," who was never appointed by any one, going to be supported, or his assistants who will not recognize him as a bishop? After all, each one of these preachers acts in his own way and confuses the people in his own style.</p>
   <p>The people are beginning to look upon this with clearer insight. A few people fall away from this apostate every day and return to St. Hedwig's Church, where they ask for forgiveness at the steps of the altar of a Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>These people will not be convinced by Kozlowski's severance with Kaminski, who "consecrated" his temple. He will not be able to convince his people that Kaminski is only a sectarian, but that he, Kozlowski, is not. He will not be able to prove to these people that he was appointed "bishop" by the <pb facs="5423968_10_0372.jpg" n="4"/>will of the people at some kind of independent session, for every one knows that no such meeting of independent priests took place in Chicago. They would have been arrested and jailed if they had showed their presence here.</p>
   <p>Therefore satisfaction should be expressed over the aberration of Anthony Kozlowski, who proclaimed himself "bishop-elect". His followers are now awaiting his "consecration," and when this fails to take place--since it cannot take place--the entire Polish-American schism will take him and his assistants in hand, and no trace of the independent leaders will be found.</p>
   <p>God grant that this may happen in the near future!</p>
