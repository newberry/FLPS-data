   <p>The fantastic lottery held during the week of November 4 - 11 at the Holy Trinity Hall to raise funds for a new school was a huge success. Some of the prizes raffled were mattresses, kitchen sets, etc. The lottery wheels contributed a good amount for this cause, as did the young ladies selling refreshments. Many church organizations came to this affair in groups and took part in all the different lotteries and games of chance, hoping to win a doll, ham or chicken. The bar was permitted to sell wine, beer, and liquors to all the patrons except minors. Polish and English music was furnished for the people wishing to dance, the net profits of this affair amounted to over $7,000. The committee and the pastor of the church take this opportunity to thank all the people for their good and kind hearted support.</p>
