   <p>The Poles in Chicago have acquired a new Polish cemetery. It is, strictly speaking, their first one, since the cemetery that lies not far from Jefferson is Polish-Bohemian.</p>
   <p>Three Polish parishes--two is South Chicago and one in Hammond, Indiana--obtained the permission of Archbishop Feehan to establish this cemetery for themselves in South Chicago, near Hammond. A plot of about fifty acres was purchased for $22,000. Of this, $7,500 will be paid down, while the remainder will be paid over a period of five years at the rate of $3,000 per year. The interest rate is 6 1/2 per cent.</p>
   <p>The cemetery's location is very convenient; it is located upon a hill, bordered on three sides by highways. The grounds have many old trees and a building for the caretaker.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1097.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In spring, the cemetery will be fenced in, following which it will be blessed with special ceremonies.</p>
