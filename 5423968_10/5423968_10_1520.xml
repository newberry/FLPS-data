  <body>
   <p>Last Sunday, January 20, a new youth society, called the "Polish Young Men's Patriotic Society," with a military unit named the "Volunteers of Pulaski," was organized in St. Casimir Parish.</p>
   <p>Delegates from the Young Men's Society of St. Adalbert Parish attended the meeting to help the organization, namely, Stephen J. Napieralski, F. P. Danish, F. T. Wolowski, Leon J. Schulc, and Joseph J. Belinski.</p>
   <p>Reverend Fuhrman opened the proceedings, and called upon Mr. Napieralski to act as president (sic); Mr. Danisch [also Danish] was appointed recording secretary.</p>
   <p>Mr. Napieralski pointed out the aim of organizing a youth society to the <pb facs="5423968_10_1521.jpg" n="2"/>assembled body, and urged the young men to get together.</p>
   <p>Reverend Fuhrman, pastor of St. Casimir Parish, spoke about the need of a young men's society in the parish. After his speech a discussion as to the type of society to be organized followed.</p>
   <p>Francis Napieralski was appointed temporary president and Casimir Schaefer was named secretary; the pastor was called upon to act as chaplain.</p>
   <p>It was agreed to have the society located at the parish church. The headquarters are also to be used as a reading room, and will contain a library. Reverend Fuhrman contributed one dollar to the cause of the society. Several young men joined the organization.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will be held at the parish school hall on January 27 at <pb facs="5423968_10_1522.jpg" n="3"/>2 P. M. All the young members of St. Casimir Parish are invited to attend this meeting.</p>
