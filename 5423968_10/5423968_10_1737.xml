   <p>The President of the United States</p>
   <p>White House</p>
   <p>Washington, D. C.</p>
   <p>Mr. President:</p>
   <p>Whereas, it has been clearly demonstrated by the foremost economists that immigration is the direct outcome of, and is regulated by, the demand for labor in this country, and that immigration in its turn has stimulated and made possible the remarkable industrial development of the United States; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the findings of the Immigration Commission upon whese recommendation the Congress of the United States has passed the so-called illiteracy test, are based chiefly on local conditions in come centers of immigration and not on the whole of it; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the said illiteracy test is highly diseriminating against some nationalities, and especially against those nationalities and classes of laborers, which are most needed in the United States, as is shown by <pb facs="5423968_10_1738.jpg" n="2"/>the foremost economists and official statistics; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the enactment of this law would not have any effect upon immigration as a whole, but merely would be a discriminating hardship upon the classes most needed here; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, such legislative measure is utterly inconsistent with the fundamental principles of the American law and time-honored American institutions; and</p>
   <p>Whereas, we consider such measure as inhuman and un-American.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we, the undersigned representatives of (Name of the Society), Branch number (Name of the organization), knowing your fearless stand for justice and truth; and</p>
   <p>Knowing your impartiality and adherence to a deep and a thorough study of the various social and economic problems during your administration; and</p>
   <p>Knowing your firmness, sound principles and broad-minded convictions <pb facs="5423968_10_1739.jpg" n="3"/>Do hereby most earnestly and respectfully petition you to vote the aforesaid legislative measure which provides for a literacy test, and to send it for reconsideration of our legislative body, the Congress of the United States.</p>
   <p>And, we further implore you to reopen public hearings, and allow our representatives to be heard in this matter and to have it impartially and thoroughly discussed.</p>
  </body>
