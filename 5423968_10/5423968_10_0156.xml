   <p>Yesterday the Poles living in the district of Avondale celebrated a great holiday. The ceremony of Confirmation was celebrated in St. Hyacinth's Church, with Bishop Paul Rhode officiating. The ceremony began at three o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost two hours. It was preceded by a magnificent procession of Polish societies, which gathered to welcome Bishop Rhode. In the procession, which started at Logan Square, the following societies were represented: Saint Hyacinth's, the Polish Alma Mater, the Foresters, Saint Joseph's, Saint John the Baptist's, King Wladyslaw Jagiello's, and Saint Anthony's. Next came the carriage of Bishop Rhode, accompanied by a guard of honor composed of Falcons No. 190, from Avondale and St. Hedwig's parish,....who were led by their president,John Kikulski.</p>
   <p>Following Bishop Rhodes' carriage were carriages bearing the representatives of various societies, in the following order: Polish Women's Alliance, <pb facs="5423968_10_0157.jpg" n="2"/>Polish Women of Saint Ann's,Saint Catherine's [Society], Saint Helen's, and Saint Hyacinth's. Jozef Polczynski, police lieutenant of the Shakespeare Avenue Station, led the procession in a light carriage, followed by a squad of seventeen mounted police. The procession also included two bands.</p>
   <p>Because the day was fair, the streets were crowded with people, and the colorful decorations on the buildings lent a holiday atmophere. Among the houses worthy of special mention were those of Messrs. Gralik and F. Krocker.</p>
