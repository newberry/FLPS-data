   <p>Right now, when there is misery in our country, when thousands of people are starving, when hundreds of Polish workingmen have no roofs over their heads and while their wives and children have no food, "The Black Locust" (Roman Catholic Clergy) is conducting orgies of new exploitation of the Polish working people in America, by observing a celebration of moral and material manifestation.</p>
   <p>The Polish people are beginning to open their eyes and see their misery; they are proudly raising their heads against their oppressors - the evil spirits in cassocks. The Polish people opposed them at first by organizing an independent Polish Catholic Church; later through the medium of the Polish National Alliance, which was then anti-clerical; and finally by embracing the socialist party.</p>
   <p>But the watchful eye of the "Papal Ministry" noticed immediately the approaching danger for even these humble and faithful parishioners; and began to oppose the priests, and especially the bishops, believing that the Irish bishops were responsible for it. Rome's source of income and the flock of faithful sheep were endangered; so was its political strength.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0203.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Polish Catholic clergy in America had no chance of getting good jobs, as it had no influence in the distribution of such positions, as did the Polish Roman Catholic parishes. Therefore, they tried to get a position as a bishop for their man - "our countryman". Our man will take better care of "our mangers" and hide our little sins. This countryman will be a pillar for the poor, ignorant, wretches - the Polish parishioners. In the name of this countryman, they will pour more money into the bottomless pockets of the priests.</p>
   <p>Even today, while the newly appointed "general" of the Roman Catholic Empire is taking charge of his office, thousands of dollars are being poured out by the hard working people; and they are giving it willingly for the "glory of God", as they are told by these base liars. They have the audacity to take the last penny from the poor for the "Glory of Christ", when Christ taught us to give to the poor.</p>
   <p>Even today they talk about buying an automobile, and building a palace for the bishop, our countryman. But these are merely trifles in comparison with the needs of the monster of the papal throne, his agents and their propaganda of ignorance and slavery.</p>
   <p>In the parade in honor of the new bishop, there were many slaves which were worse than the slaves of the old nobility, or those dating back to the days of Nero, the Roman emperor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0204.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Slaves of the olden days were slaves only physically, while their souls, hearts and minds vibrated with rebellion. The slave of today, however, has freedom of body, but his mentality is retarded. He is a slave of his own volition.</p>
   <p>Is it not deplorable to see people who are poorly clad and hungry, marching alongside a man who is well dressed, well fed, and riding in an automobile?</p>
   <p>Such scenes can not be witnessed even among the lowly class of Italians, because they have, and will maintain some self-respect and religious scruples.</p>
   <p>Any American looking for excitement would pay a good price for seeing it.</p>
   <p>The Polish Roman Catholic Unions should be proud of such Polish culture in America.</p>
