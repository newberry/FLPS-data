   <p>[Translator's note. The Polish National Alliance, (P. N. A.), a benevolent association of about 300,000 members, is divided for administrative purposes into twenty six commissary districts, allocated to different States of the Union. The smallest organizational units in the Polish National Alliance are the so-called groups, about 2, 630 in number at the present time. As a connecting link between the commissary districts and the groups there are in the P. N. A. the so-called Gminy, or Communes, constituting territorial representative bodies, formed of the delegates from the groups of a given territory. Gminy serve as the nearest Advisory Board for the local P. N. A. groups and display deeply reaching influences among their constituents.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1442.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>From these elucidations there may easily be noticed the reason why the author of the following article is referring his recommendations both to the groups and to the Communes, or Gminy. If the group is willing, but not strong enough, to carry through a certain plausible proposition, it appeals to its immediate organizational advisory board of the Gmina (singular of Gminy) for assistance.]</p>
   <p>From among the many ways and means with which to keep the Polish native born youth in the ranks of the Polish National Alliance the following are particularly to be recommended: the youth's clubs, the amateur theatres, and the choirs, which should be formed in connection with every P. N. A. group, and especially so with every Gmina.</p>
   <p>As the youth's clubs have already been comprehensively treated and recommended elsewhere by Mr. Cenzor, we will presently confine our attention to the remaining two - the amateur theatres and the choirs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1443.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>An amateur theatre and choir are, and justly should be, regarded as a very desirable addition to every P. N. A. group which cares to give the youth a helping hand. The Polish language is used both in the amateur theatre plays and by the choirs in their songs, and therein consists the practical value of these enterprises for our youth from the Polish national point of view. Experience shows that the youthful players and singers of both sexes are gladly attending the practices and that on such occasions, under suitable direction and guidance, they are making great strides in learning the Polish language.</p>
   <p>The choirs should be easily accessible not only to the full-grown boys and girls, but also to the youngsters, who likewise display a live interest in singing lessons. In this respect we may follow the example given us by the Polish Singers' Association, which shows a special care in keeping up and in cultivating the choirs of the youngsters. So also does the P. N. A. Gmina No. 2 in Chicago, by having under its care a choir composed of children. The Gmina helps them to learn both the Polish language and the <pb facs="5423968_10_1444.jpg" n="4"/>singing in Polish, knowing that to-day's youth will in the future fill up the gaps in our organization and will form strongly spirited ranks of new Polish pioneers in the Polish National Alliance. Organizing of amateur circles and of choirs both for youngsters and for elders in connection with groups and Gminy of the P. N. A. will be of double profit; the youth will become sooner acquainted with better usage of Polish language by scenic literature and by singing Polish, and the elders will have an opportunity to go and visit the meeting places of the youth and see what that youth is doing.</p>
   <p>A live word from the stage and from the platform is the best teacher and every opportunity should be used to let the youth profit by such inexpensive learning. Organizing and keeping of amateur circles and choirs is not in the least expensive and therefore all groups can afford to initiate and maintain such practices. If the groups in a given locality might not be prosperous enough to carry such projects through by their own means then the amateur circles and choirs should be organized in connection with Gminy.</p>
