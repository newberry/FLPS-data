   <p>The Polish press in America inserts in its columns articles of certain people concerning the affairs of organizing the Polish youth, but none of them appeal to us (as being) that (which) would uplift the youth toward a moral or economic (goal).</p>
   <p>In the National Daily some wheedler asserts that the best action this organization could take in organizing the youth, is to establish billiard halls or clubs, but he forgets that our youth who have just come from the old country are not familiar with our methods here.</p>
   <p>It is also rumored that this organization will be joined with that of the Polish National Alliance, with the aim of elevating this organization, that is, the youth.</p>
   <p>To combine these two organizations would be a very good thing to do for the Polish National Alliance, but not for our youth, because they would receive no benefit from it, because its chief concern in toward the elders.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1469.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We see also those who would care to do much good for someone but don't know where to begin.</p>
   <p>Looking at this matter, we know it must deserve a great deal of consideration, so that it may appeal to our present lives and benefit us in the future.</p>
