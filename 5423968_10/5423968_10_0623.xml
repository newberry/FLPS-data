<title level="a">APPEALS FOR THE POLISH CATHOLIC CONGRESS</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>We received the following correspondence with a request to publish it in the Dziennik Chicagoski (Polish Daily News):</p>
   <p>"The Society of the Holy (Mother) of God of Czenstochowa, in the St. Stanislaus Bishop and Martyr Parish in Erie, Pennsylvania, unamimously decided at their semiannual meeting to take part in the Polish Catholic Congress, because all the members feel that such a Congress is absolutely necessary for the good of the Poles in America and should be realized.</p>
   <p>"Signed: Jacob Malinowski,</p>
   <p>624 E. 14th Street, Erie."</p>
   <p>In addition, in the last issue of Wiara I Osczyzna (Faith and Fatherland), we find an announcement that the St. John The Baptist Society of St. Adalbert's Parish in Chicago also decided to exert all its efforts in favor of calling <pb facs="5423968_10_0624.jpg" n="2"/>such a Congress. Mr. Anthony Polenz and Mr. Frank Czerwinski were elected as delegates to this Congress.</p>
   <p>This Society urges all groups belonging to the Polish Roman Catholic Union to support this project.</p>
   <p>We quote the following beautiful paragraphs from the eloquent appeal signed by Mr. A. Polenz and Mr. J. Renklewski:</p>
   <p>"....We, dear brethren, who have the honor of belonging to such a noble and wonderful organization as the Polish Roman Catholic Union, whose motto is 'Faith and Fatherland,' can do much to hasten the call for this Polish Catholic Congress and help our spiritual directors in this cause, which is so important to all Polish Catholics.</p>
   <p>"It is only through such action that we can oppose our enemies, who are attacking <pb facs="5423968_10_0625.jpg" n="3"/>the Catholic church and us from all directions, because we are still faithful to this church; but they wish to take away this Holy Faith, this great treasure for which we should be willing to give not only a small offering, but even our lives if it were necessary.</p>
   <p>"So let us get to work, brothers for such a wonderful opportunity is presenting itself; let us take a very active interest in this matter so that the Congress will be called, because it can do a lot of good for us, especially here in America; let no true Pole neglect this matter, because it is of great importance for every faithful Polish Catholic.</p>
   <p>"Let every society that has not heretofore announced its support of the Polish Catholic Congress do so at its very next meeting; let none be left in the background, but let them follow our example, and the Polish Catholic Congress will undoubtedly be a reality."</p>
   <p>O, that this wonderful appeal may be successful--that is our fervent wish!</p>
