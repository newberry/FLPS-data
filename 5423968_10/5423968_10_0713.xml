<title level="a">SCANDALOUS MEETING HELD BY "INDEPENDENTS" AT PULASKI HALL</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>As it was announced yesterday, an agitative meeting was staged by the leaders of the Independent Church movement at Pulaski Hall last night.</p>
   <p>This was a regular show, presented by the excommunicated priests Kolaszewski and Kozlewski and their associates, for the enjoyment of their followers.</p>
   <p>It is regrettable that it must be mentioned that a few prominent Poles of St. Adalbert Parish, for some unknown reason, have joined this group. It is also unknown as why the Pulaski Hall administration permitted the usage of the assembly hall for this purpose.</p>
   <p>Those gentleman that signed up have permanently discredited their good names.</p>
   <p>The ex-priests Kolaszewski, Kozlowski and Kaminski spoke to the audience.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0714.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>From their lips came the most brutal ideas and scandalous assertions against the bishops and priests, including jeers at the Roman Catholic religion and the authorities of the Church. Such words as "thieves," "rebels," "scoundrels," etc, were plentiful.</p>
   <p>It would be too unpleasant to print all the facts of this meeting....It is best just to condemn the meeting and its leaders and followers. It is indeed fortunate that there are only a handful of adherents.</p>
