   <p>The following letter has been submitted for publication in Dziennik[Chicagoski] by Ignacy Machnikowski:</p>
   <p>"On Sunday, June 4, a solemn Corpus Christi procession was conducted in St. Michael Archangel parish in South Chicago. In spite of the threatening rain, about four thousand parishioners gathered in and around the church to participate in these ceremonies, which are so reminiscent of old-country religious customs. Four altars were erected in the schoolyard at the expense of the church societies.</p>
   <p>"After vespers, during which a short but drenching rain fell, the procession began, to the accompaniment of a brass band. The procession was headed by the Lay Brothers of the Holy Rosary and the women's Rosary Society. They were followed by the Knights of the Virgin Mary in full uniform, carrying their <pb facs="5423968_10_1080.jpg" n="2"/>colorful banners, and the members of the Society of St. Michael. Under the leadership of the Nazarene Sisters, school girls dressed in white strewed flowers before the Holy Sacrament, carried by the Reverend Nowicki, pastor of the parish. He was followed by the Knights of St. Casimir, the Society of St. Martin, the Krakus Society under the protection of St. Stanislaus Kostka, and St. Adalbert's Society. The first two Gospels were sung by the Reverend B. Pawlowski, assistant, the two following by Father Nowicki himself.</p>
   <p>"The devout people participated fervently in this uplifting ceremony which awakened respect for and involuntary homage to the Savior, represented in the humble form of bread, even in the hearts of spectators of different denominations. Toward the end of the fourth Gospel, a light rain began to fall, but the procession continued without interruption."</p>
