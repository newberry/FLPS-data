   <p>We have mentioned in the past that certain European papers, in publishing the call for the Polish Catholic Congress, have expressed great sympathy toward it and heartily recommended the idea of calling the congress as well as the program to be discussed.</p>
   <p>Our liberal papers, however, sought out the Polish European papers which criticized either the congress itself or its program.</p>
   <p>This was not so easy, but it resulted in the discovery of something that resembled criticism.</p>
   <p>It seems that the Goniec Wielkopolski, a Polish paper published in Poland, in publishing the program of the convention, expressed the following view: <pb facs="5423968_10_0455.jpg" n="2"/>"So that our readers can better understand the justice in the statement by Mr. Modest Maryanski, who felt sad that the projected Polish Catholic Congress is not imbued with the spirit of Christian brotherly love, we are today publishing the entire text of the official call as sent to us from America. We shall return to this matter later".</p>
   <p>The liberal papers were triumphant and with great relish publicized the above remarks, while impatiently they awaited the "return to this matter".</p>
   <p>Shortly after, the Goniec Wielkopolski did return to this matter. They published a second article written by Mr. Modest Maryanski, supposedly proving that this congress is not motivated with the spirit of Christian brotherly love.</p>
   <p>But the article must have irritated the editors of the liberal papers a good deal. It contained nothing to justify the actions of the Polish <pb facs="5423968_10_0456.jpg" n="3"/>National Alliance readers, submitted no proof that the Polish National Alliance was being unjustly condemned--and the entire article is written for the purpose of proving that the Polish Catholic Congress should first of all be interested in greater educational facilities in America and for this purpose it should ask the members of the Polish National Alliance and all the Poles in America to put forth a helping hand.</p>
   <p>The following article irritated them the most, however:</p>
   <p>".....Education, education, and once more education is what our people need, education of a higher sort, which will enlighten them, improve their characters and lead to more influential and important positions among the American people. Such outstanding personages as the Reverend Fathers Dabrowski, [V.] Barzynski, Gulski, Grucka, Majer, and a long list of other priests, are shining examples for us to follow. Let us follow in their footsteps and show a similar sincerity in spreading enlightenment."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0457.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The appeal to the leaders of the Polish National Alliance that they imitate the efforts of the Reverend Fathers Dabrowski, Barzynski, Gulski, Grucza, Major, and others, toward spreading greater education was not expected of Mr. Maryanski or of the Goniec Wielkopolski, and such a "return to this matter" is certainly not very welcome to the liberals.</p>
   <p>Surely, the Goniec Wielkopolski, ignorant of our conditions, cannot know, and Mr. Maryanski should know, that to invite the Alliance and liberal parties to the Catholic Congress to co-operate with the priests and with the conservative party in spreading enlightenment would be useless, out of the question, and ridiculous. The ideas of enlightenment entertained by the prominent leaders of these two factions are so different that what the one party would approve the other party would condemn.</p>
   <p>The Polish Catholic Congress will have as its chief mission the spreading of true enlightenment, and therefore must severely criticize those, who, <pb facs="5423968_10_0458.jpg" n="5"/>through newspaper articles, spread indifference to religion, the spreading of which in the final analysis, is the height of depravity in the eyes of true Catholics.</p>
