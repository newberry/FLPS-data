   <p>Mr. Tamillo, in his long articles in Nowem Zyciu (New Life) concerning the "Great Protest" held at the Polish hall at St. Stanislaus Kostki's Parish, states that he was slighted by Father V. Barzynski and the Dziennik Chicagoski. He declares that he, as an American citizen, was forbidden to speak in spite of the fact that the Constitution of the United States permits freedom of speech. It is his contention that this incident has added injury to insult; in fact, that it is contrary to everything Father Barzynski has said.</p>
   <p>We impart this information to Mr. Tamillo: The secretary of the mass meeting held January 1 at Bradley Street near Division, took down the minutes without the aid of anyone. If Mr. Tamillo refers in his articles to the words in his attempted speech that "If we would not have had Moses, then we would not have had God." We inform him that these words were stricken from the record by the secretary because they were out of order, even if uttered by Mr. Tamillo. He cannot deny that he said "Who gave us God?</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1250.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Moses gave us God!" These words were spoken by him when he was given permission to get on the speaker's stand. The entire assemblage responded to this statement with laughter and derision, not Father Vincent Barzynski alone. There were two thousand witnesses to this act and it was the duty of Father Barzynski to restore order amidst the increasing confusion. The speaker was declared out of order and ordered off the stand. It was his duty as an American citizen to put an end to this speech, the principles of which were un-American in that they denied the existence of God. They were the words of an atheist, not only blasphemous but atheistic, a denunciation of religious belief and a negation of God. This is how the stubborn and fanatic atheists will argue, including Buechner, Haeckle, e tutti quanti, because they want to prove somehow that God did not create man but that man created God through his own imagination. They not only preach this, but they also publish books on the subject, as if they were great prophets among whom Moses created God for the people, a god about whom nothing was known or believed before. Therefore, this assertion that "Moses gave us God" is n and against the foundations of Americanism.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1251.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We want to believe that Mr. Tamillo believes differently from what he said. Yet, speakers who say one thing and mean another should be taken off the speaker's stand because the audience would not understand their statements, since listeners hear what the speaker states and not what he believes, thinks and practices. The words spoken by Mr. Tamillo were far above this; they were not only blasphemous but revolting to such an extent that the audience rebelled against them, showing that they did not desire to listen further to his remarks. All were indignant because they were Catholics, citizens of the United States and because this was an insult to their intelligence.</p>
