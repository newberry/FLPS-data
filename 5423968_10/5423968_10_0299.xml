   <p>Last week, the most Rev. Father Archbishop Feehan authorized several important appointments in the archdiocese of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Rev. Frank Barry was appointed a member of the cabinet, which is composed of six members, one of whom is our most Rev. Fr. Lange, Besides being a member of this cabinet our Rev. Lange also became a "Permanent Pastor", which means that he stays with his parish until death. For no reason can he be removed or sent to another parish.</p>
   <p>The most important fact is that when the next balloting comes up for archbishop in Chicago, Father Lange's vote will be of value.</p>
   <p>It is a great honor to us, because he is the first Polish priest in the archdiocese of Chicago to receive such an honor. so a <pb facs="5423968_10_0300.jpg" n="2"/>good deal of happiness prevails among us, especially among those who know well the work and doings of Rev. Lange in the management and prosperity of his parish and community.</p>
   <p>We heartily congratulate Rev. Frank Lange, and pray to God that he may live long and we in return receive his great help.</p>
