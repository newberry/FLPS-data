   <p>On another page we are publishing a letter, inviting priests and laymen to a preparatory conference in regard to the Polish Catholic Congress, which will take place on March 19, in Detroit.</p>
   <p>The first step has been made; others will follow.</p>
   <p>At the Detroit conference, a specific plan for the convention, which will follow it, will be worked out, and the foundation of the edifice of peace and unity of the Catholic Poles in America will be laid.</p>
   <p>Such a cause, once begun, must continue.</p>
   <p>One hundred and fifty priests have endorsed the Congress. This is strength. The summons calling the conference to Detroit was signed by Reverend Pitass of Buffalo and by priests of Detroit.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0566.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>So we are getting together at last.</p>
   <p>The enemies of the Church who heretofore have been having their own way, will now find things going against them.</p>
   <p>The pitcher will carry water until the handle breaks.</p>
   <p>Already we can confidently assert that solidarity of action by the Polish priests is having its effect, not as anything idealistic, but as a plain, actual, and logical necessity for the maintenance of the Catholic faith among our people, who are thoroughly imbued with it. A pure disinterestedness is visible among all our priests. We do not wish to travel to Detroit to rehash old quarrels, so we go with a desire for peace with our fellow men and God uppermost in our hearts.</p>
   <p>This step will, in a short time, destroy the confusion existing in some of our Polish parishes. And it will help to improve many ignorant priests, who, in <pb facs="5423968_10_0567.jpg" n="3"/>spite of their good intentions, permitted themselves to be misled by people of evil minds.</p>
   <p>Jesus Christ in plain language commanded his representatives on earth to be "one". This "oneness" was not often exhibited. There were many camps, and in them the devil often reaped a harvest.</p>
   <p>So let us go ahead, brother laymen and clergymen, and in the name of Jesus Christ, let us cleanse ourselves of these "independent" tendencies and of others of similar ilk! Be faithful to the traditions of our great nation and let us become the bulwark of Christianity here in America.</p>
