<title level="a">NEW ST. JOSEPH CHURCH IN TOWN OF LAKE CONSECRATED</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Poles living in the community of Town of Lake witnessed a gala event Sunday, October 6, when the new St. Joseph Church was consecrated.</p>
   <p>A large crowd gathered before the new church on 48th and Paulina Streets. When the parade started it was estimated that twenty thousand persons were on hand. The following local societies took part in the ceremony: St. Joseph Society, Prince Augustine Kordecki Society, Sacred Heart of Jesus Society, St. Adalbert Society, Holy Name of Mary Society, St. Hedwig Society, and the Women's and Young Ladies' Sodalities.</p>
   <p>After the procession around the new church, the consecration services were started at 2 P. M. The ritual was celebrated by the Most Reverend Jaeger, superior abbot of the Benedictine Order, who was assisted by the Reverends Fulgentius and Odo, from the neighboring St. Augustine Parish, 52nd and Justine <pb facs="5423968_10_0741.jpg" n="2"/>Streets, and the Reverend Skulik.</p>
   <p>The sermon was delivered by the Reverend Paul Rhode, who urged ardent respect for the faith.</p>
   <p>The Reverend Byrgier of Bridgeport [St. Mary of Perpetual Help Parish] was also present.</p>
   <p>The services were concluded by the Most Reverend Jaeger, who blessed the entire congregation.</p>
   <p>St. Joseph Parish, founded nine years ago is under the care of Reverend M. Pyplatz. Until the present time the church has been merely a frame structure. The ever-increasing number of parishioners necessitated the building of a large church.</p>
   <p>The present church is a large brick structure, built according to the plans of <pb facs="5423968_10_0742.jpg" n="3"/>T. Lewandowski, a Polish architect, by Mr. Ratkowski, a Polish contractor. Only a part of the new church has been completed. The basement and main floor have been finished, but the upper part of the church is still in process of construction. When funds permit, the remainder of the new church will be finished.</p>
