   <p>The Zgoda has published an article with such a title, in which it states that in spite of all their efforts, in spite of moving heaven and earth to injure the Polish Catholic Congress, it will be held, and all their shouts and falsehoods are....useless.</p>
   <p>We are very happy that the Zgoda has finally come to its senses and acknowledges that lies must surrender to truth, paganism to the Holy Faith, and the devil to God.</p>
   <p>It used every means to incite the people and to make them hostile to the Congress, and even created differences among the priests, but all its diabolical efforts were powerless against the Holy Faith.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0448.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The priests raised the cross and the people are following in great crowds to the Congress, going where duty calls to the defense of our religion.</p>
   <p>And while the nonreligious papers are storming, from all parts of the world letters are arriving, even from gray-haired archbishops standing on the brink of the grave, who send their blessings to the Congress and congratulate those Poles who are fighting to make this Congress a success.</p>
   <p>Those who read the letters, with tears in their eyes, recognize where the truth leads, because they believe their arch-shepherds and understand now at what these quasi-smart pagans were aiming.</p>
   <p>The Zgoda, looking at all of this, repentently cries in its last breath, "Our efforts have been in vain!"</p>
   <p>We reaffirm this completely. The Polish Catholic Congress will be a success and our aims will be realized, while the enmity and scurrilous attacks of <pb facs="5423968_10_0449.jpg" n="3"/>the irreligious press are only useless efforts.</p>
