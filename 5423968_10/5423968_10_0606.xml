   <p>We have received a few letters signifying willingness to take part in the proposed Polish Catholic Congress. Here are some:</p>
   <p>"The Society of St. Francis Xavier, No. I, in the St. Josephat Bishop and Martyr Parish (in Lake View), Chicago, unanimously voted, at their last meeting, to support the proposed Polish Catholic Congress in America.</p>
   <p>"The delegates will be named later.</p>
   <p>"To the best of my knowledge, the St. Josephat Parish is heartily in favor of the Congress.</p>
   <p>"So, let us go to work, brothers! Let us prove to the world that nothing can snatch us away from our Holy Faith, which our forefathers have professed for hundreds of years. Let the false teachers of our people and the destroyers of our Polish parishes know that their hellish work means nothing, in <pb facs="5423968_10_0607.jpg" n="2"/>view of our faith! Let the enemies of the faith of our fathers know that, in the end, they and their adherents must perish miserably.</p>
   <p>"Father Bieszke, recording secretary."</p>
   <p>Next comes the following application: "The St. Casimir The Prince Young Men's Society of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish in Chicago, at their meeting last night, voted to participate in the proposed Polish Catholic Congress in America. It wishes, also, publicly to announce that it heartily supports the plan, proposed by the Rev. Eugene Sedlaczek, of calling an advance conference, as published in the "Dziennik Chicagoski," issue of February 14th, 1896.</p>
   <p>"Vincent J. Jozwiakowski, secretary."</p>
   <p>And, finally, the third application:</p>
   <p>"The St. Martin's Soldiers Society of the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish in</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0608.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Chicago has voted to support the proposed Polish Catholic Congress in America.</p>
   <p>"Andrew Plocinski, recording secretary,</p>
   <p>"448 Elston Avenue."</p>
