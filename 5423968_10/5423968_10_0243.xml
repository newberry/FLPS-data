   <p>For a long time the parish of Holy Trinity shall remember this day. For it was a day of triumph. Everything was prepared for this celebration, and was performed with the utmost care, aside from difficulties.</p>
   <p>The homes located in the vicinity of Noble street, Division street, Milwaukee avenue, Augusta street, etc., were splendidly decorated with Polish flags and the American and papal colors. The rectory and church were adorned - the steeples bearing the Polish and American flags.</p>
   <p>The celebration was under way at 7 A. M. Organizations began to gather before the church and on the corners of Noble and Division streets a vast number of people stood waiting to participate in this gala event. At 8:30 A.M., the streets were so crowded it was impossible for a person to pass through to their destination. The police force was out on the corner of Noble and Division streets, the cavalry from Bridgeport, Marshal M. Kolasa with his division of guards, the Polish-Lithuanian organizations, St. Stanislaus Division Director and his staff, National organization Division and St. Boniface Division.</p>
