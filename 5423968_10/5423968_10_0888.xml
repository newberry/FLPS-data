<title level="a">POLES HOLD MASS MEETING AT ST. STANISLAUS KOSTKA PARISH</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The parishioners of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish of Chicago, good Catholics and Poles, yesterday resolved to take an important step forward. Realizing that intrigue, which is making an effort to smash our unity, our peace and the fruits of our work in America, is raising high its head (sic); that unforseen hands are trying to mold our Polish parishes, which are the center of our Polish spirit and religion, into nests of disturbance and uprising; that the nefarious press is supporting this intrigue by its constant publication of lies which are primarily aimed at the Poles of Chicago, especially at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, it was decided to strike a definite blow at this disgraceful underground current of propaganda, and to reveal it to the world in its entirety.</p>
   <p>Such action was taken yesterday at a mass meeting held at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish School hall. This meeting was staged through the initiative of one of the oldest societies of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, the Holy Trinity Society. The Society evolved the idea of raising a strong mass protest <pb facs="5423968_10_0889.jpg" n="2"/>against the disgraceful and slanderous press, represented by the non-Catholic "Catholics" (sic) and the diabolical Kropidlo (Sprinkler). This idea quickly spread, and its adoption brought action. All parish societies came to its support.</p>
   <p>A committee was formed to lay plans for the meeting, and it was held yesterday. All those active in Polish life were present. Thirty-four Polish societies were represented. The large hall was filled to capacity; according to estimates over 5000 attended.</p>
   <p>The gathering was officially opened by John Kortas, who called upon John Arkuszewski to preside as chairman, and S. Zahajkiewicz to act as recording secretary.</p>
   <p>The audience was familiar with the reasons for the meeting, for it had been a witness of the constant attacks on St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish and its pastor, Reverend Vincent Barzynski, for a long time. That is why it only took a few words to explain the purpose of the assembly. A feeling of <pb facs="5423968_10_0890.jpg" n="3"/>indignation against the intriguers and slanderers immediately permeated the hall.</p>
   <p>The initial speaker was Mr. Kortas, and he was followed by Mr. Arkuszewski, who is one of the oldest parishioners, and one of the best informed on work in the parish. He reviewed the accomplishments of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, and referred to the unjustified attack on the parish. In conclusion, the speaker urged everyone to come to the support of the pastor, who was respected by the entire parish. Loud cheers and applause greeted both speakers as they left the rostrum.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zahajkiewicz, who was the third speaker, pointed out the disgraceful intrigue which aimed at complete destruction of our standing among the people of America, and also supported the influx of anarchism. He said that only the enemies of the Poles and Catholicism were capable of doing this. Realizing our growth in America, they placed mines underground (sic), because they wished to ruin our parishes and churches, since the Polish spirit and religion was being fostered in them. We should guard ourselves against such <pb facs="5423968_10_0891.jpg" n="4"/>vile assailants, he concluded.</p>
   <p>The following speakers also spoke against this intrigue and the spread of scandalous writings: J. Popek, J. Tomaszewski and Alderman Stanislaus H. Kunz. All the speakers received such generous applause that it shook the entire hall. Voices began to shout for the appearance of the pastor, Reverend Barzynski.</p>
   <p>Finally, steps were completed for adopting a resolution against the conspiracy and the malicious press. The resolution, which is found in its entirety in the adjoining column, was read to the audience by Boleslaus Klarkowski. Adopted by thousands of people, this decision is evident proof that the feeling of truth and righteousness is still in our hearts, that we know how to crush slander, and that we know how to defend ourselves against malicious assaults.</p>
   <p>It must be added that the supporters of this intrigue, the Kropidlo, which has its headquarters in Chicago, sent two or three "amateurs" to the meeting for the express purpose of creating a disturbance. But when they began to <pb facs="5423968_10_0892.jpg" n="5"/>make blatant comments, they were immediately put out. To the credit of the parishioners, it must be mentioned that, despite the commotion created, nothing was done to the intruders.</p>
