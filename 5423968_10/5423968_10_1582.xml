   <p>Almost every Chicagoan interested in politics, especially if he is a Democrat, knows of the [Cook] County Democracy Marching Club. The majority of the members belonging to this organization are young people who take a very active part in politics and attend important political meetings. Their appearance adds color to the gatherings, attracts public attention and awakens an interest in politics.</p>
   <p>The Polish people met them first when Senator Palmer came to Chicago to deliver his initial political speech at the Polish hall. They attracted every one's attention when their group escorted Senator Palmer into the hall for they were dressed elegantly and wore top hats.</p>
   <p>Although this club was organized for social purposes, it helps the young people to become acquainted with politics, initiates them into political secrets and encourages them to participate in political activities. Thus the club prepares <pb facs="5423968_10_1583.jpg" n="2"/>the membership for future [representation in the National government as well as the Democratic party.]</p>
   <p>Membership in such a club would be of great benefit to young Poles; therefore Mr. August J. Kowalski, a well-known citizen, has devised a very practical plan. He proposes that a Polish section should be formed in co-operation with the club's headquarters, and that the younger Poles should become members. The editor of this newspaper heartily endorse his plan for in our opinion such action would awaken an interest in local politics.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow night there will be a gathering at A. J. Kowalski's hall, 617 Noble Street for the purpose of organizing such a section. All and especially the younger generation who intend to join the club, are invited. We hope that a Polish section of that club will be successfully organized. The county headquarters is enthusiastic about the plan. By this action we will outdo the Germans who thus far have not organized their own section.</p>
