   <p>Alderman Frank P. Danisch of the 11th ward is energetically trying to raise a protest against bills now in Congress to place further restrictions in the immigration laws. To simplify this action he has made up a form of resolution and has sent it to different organizations, so that they could sign it and send it out as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>There is almost no doubt that this action will bring results if it is spread out on a larger scale. Well known leaders in the House of Representatives, such as Champ Clark and Oscar Underwood, have made known that they are ready to support the protest and that they are themselves opposed against further restrictions in immigration laws.</p>
   <p>Mr. Danisch should be commended for his action, and the best kind of commendation for him would be to have as many signed resolutions as possible sent to our representatives in Congress.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1752.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We give below the text of the resolution made up by Mr. Danisch; it will be useful especially to those organizations and societies who by oversight might have not received the form of resolution. It will suffice if one copies it, get the necessary signatures and send it our just as soon as possible.</p>
   <p>The text of the resolution is as follows:</p>
   <p>Resolution adopted by the............. Society, of Chicago, Illinois. Whereas, a bill introduced by Senator Dillingham is new pending before Congress the purport of which is to establish an educational test for all immigrants who came to the United States of America, and,</p>
   <p>Whereas, such law would especially prove a great hardship upon people of foreign birth who have been deprived of the privileges of obtaining and education through no fault of theirs, but rather because of the indifference of the governments under which they have lived, and,</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1753.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Whereas, such law would prevent the admission to this country of good honest, hardy, healthy men and women who seek to better their conditions of life and who by reason of their hard work and ambitions in this country become and constitute the mass of the builders of this nation, therefore, be it</p>
   <p>Resolved, that we, Polish American citizens, hereby protest against the adoption of any laws at this time for the purpose of preventing the admission of men and women into this country who would be unable to pass an educational test as contemplated by the pending bill before Congress or any similar measure which would be substituted for it but having the same purpose.</p>
