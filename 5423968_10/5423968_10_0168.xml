   <p>The papal decree that pastors are to be removed from parishes not by bishops, but by a committee composed of six priests and a bishop in every diocese, was made public on December 6, 1910, at a synod held at St. Patrick's Cathedral. It was variously accepted. This decree definitely deprives bishops of the autonomous power of removal and appointment of pastors from various parishes without a prior decision of the proper ecclesiastical commission.</p>
   <p>An order of that type naturally is not looked upon favorably and is not to the taste of many episcopal favorites. On the other hand, it will undoubtedly gladden the hearts of those who were not in great favor and were even ridiculed by their ecclesiastical superiors. Perhaps because of this, parish <pb facs="5423968_10_0169.jpg" n="2"/>conditions will change so much that there will be no more repetitions of the grave disappointments of the faithful people, who were rarely heard by a bishop if he was on good terms with their unfit and hated parish pastor. An ecclesiastical commission will be better able to investigate causes of disruptions, clear up misunderstandings, and mete out justice to the people.</p>
