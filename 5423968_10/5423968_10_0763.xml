   <p>Only slight mention was made by Dziennik Chicagoski of the meeting held in St. Hedwig Parish day before yesterday, but the Tribune published a number of lies about the meeting. In yesterday's edition of the Tribune that paper asserted that a riot took place at the meeting.</p>
   <p>We know only too well the attitude of the Chicago Tribune. Its political policies (Republican) and its attitude toward the Poles have often been severely condemned in these columns.</p>
   <p>This time we find it difficult to believe that such an important paper could write such falsehoods. The fault probably lies with its reporters, who were present at the meeting in St. Hedwig Parish Hall and permitted themselves to be <pb facs="5423968_10_0764.jpg" n="2"/>influenced and deceived by the schismatics from Kozlowski's camp.</p>
   <p>Suffice it to say that the Tribune gave accounts of this affair in its columns that made it appear that a riot had taken place. This is a lie. The Tribune wrote as if all the parishioners from the right were secretly armed with clubs. This is also a lie. The Tribune also claimed that Reverend John Piechowski, pastor of St. Hedwig Parish, presided at the meeting and that he, too, had a club secretly hidden on his person.</p>
   <p>All of these claims are lies, a hundredfold. In the first place Reverend Piechowski was not present at the meeting. He came to the hall after everyone had left. Neither did he have a club on his person, hidden or otherwise. The lie-stained article in the Tribune claimed that the pastor did not show his "concealed club." Upon what grounds did the Tribune have the right to say that Reverend J. Piechowski had a club at all?</p>
   <p>There was no rioting of any kind in the crowd that attended the meeting. From <pb facs="5423968_10_0765.jpg" n="3"/>time to time a slight disturbance was created by a group of members of the St. Joseph Society of this parish. The left wing of this society broke away and joined the schismatic faction, and it was this group that opposed the other members.</p>
   <p>What really happened was as follows:</p>
   <p>Day before yesterday the St. Joseph Society held a special meeting at the parish hall. The meeting was called by the president, W. Orzechowski, for various reasons. Part of the members of St. Joseph Society had joined the schismatic faction led by Kozlowski. This group, headed by Joseph Kostuch, Theophilus Letz and Isidore Strojk, entered charges against Mr. Orzechowski, Michael Fijalkowski and Joseph Sobieszczyk, who belong to the right wing of the St. Joseph Society, and requested that they turn over to them the charter, books and flags of the society.</p>
   <p>The last court hearing was held on September 24 before Judge Eberhardt, who <pb facs="5423968_10_0766.jpg" n="4"/>rendered a decision in favor of the St. Hedwig parishioners and ruled out the charges catered by the schismatics.</p>
   <p>The attorneys for the parishioners, Max Drzymala and C. J. Bielinski, suggested that the administration of the St. Joseph Society conform to the constitution and call a meeting. The purpose of this general meeting was to ask those that had broken away from the Society whether they still wished to remain as members and fulfill their obligations as such. Seventy of the dissenters, headed by Joseph Kostuch, John Zynda and Max Marszczynski, attended this special session.</p>
   <p>When the meeting was opened by Mr. Orzechowski, who stated the purpose of the meeting, the schismatics began to create discord, claiming that they had been expelled from membership. This was contrary to the truth. While Anthony Sobieszcsyk was clarifying the situation, Mr. Zynda began to shout, but was quieted by the marshal, Mr. Zaleski. Other schismatics also began to make noise, but they were removed by order of the police. They went to Dziewioris Hall.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0767.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>There was no riot or scuffle of any sort at the meeting.</p>
   <p>After the schismatics had left, the members from the right faction continued the meeting. They agreed to form an arbitrary court made up of twelve judges to review the matter concerning the dissenters. In this respect Isidore Strejk, Stanislaus Cymanowski, Max Marszezynski, financial secretary, and M. Rutkowski and J. Kaminski, trustees, were called upon for an explanation as to why they had not fulfilled the duties required of them by the constitution of the St. Joseph Society, and why they had not paid their monthly assessments. If they do not satisfy the summons only then will measures be taken through proper channels for their removal.</p>
   <p>These are the facts. We wish to repeat that Reverend J. Piechowski was not present at the meeting. He was at the rectory accepting contributions for the approaching parish fair. He came to the hall after the entire meeting was over.</p>
   <p>This gives one an idea as to how the facts were twisted and distorted by the <pb facs="5423968_10_0768.jpg" n="6"/>reporters of the Tribune. These reporters were probably present for the purpose of giving our sensational papers, Dziennik Polski (Polish Daily) and Nowe Zycie (New Life), an opportunity to reprint their reports from the Tribune. In this way the Tribune not only won support but had its article substantiated.</p>
   <p>Despite the fact that such a distortion of news was published and reprinted, everyone knows that those stories are pure lies.</p>
