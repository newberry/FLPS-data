   <p>Yesterday was a day of festivity at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. At 7 A. M. a number of local church societies gathered before the church in order to welcome and escort Archbishop Feehan, who was to take part in the ordination ceremonies for Deacon J. Obyrtacz, C. R.</p>
   <p>About 8 A. M. the Archbishop arrived with his escort. The parade was a sight to see.</p>
   <p>The services began at 8 A. M. Mass was celebrated by Archbishop Feehan. He was assisted by local and visiting priests, among whom was the Reverend John Kasprzycki, pastor of St. John Cantius Parish.</p>
   <p>St. Stanislaus Kostka Church was filled to capacity by the devout parishioners.</p>
   <p>The services continued for over two hours. After the conclusion of the ceremony, <pb facs="5423968_10_0692.jpg" n="2"/>Archbishop Feehan stopped a while at the parish rectory.</p>
   <p>The newly consecrated priest hails from Galicia, a Polish province occupied by Austria. The young priest came to America a few years ago. He completed his novitiate at Cracow under the tutelage of the Reverend Thomas Brzeski. He was consecrated as a deacon at Rome. The Reverend J. Obyrtacz will celebrate his initial mass at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Church on Tuesday, December 10.</p>
