   <p>Bishop Weber, a Catholic bishop, in his statement protests Bishop Kozlewski's intention to resign his Roman-Catholie standing of bishop to Join the Protestant Episcopal church, in the year 1902.</p>
   <p>As is known. Bishop Weber was one of the few who helped Bishop Koslowski be ordained a bishop; that is why Bishop Weber wrote this letter to Kezlewski.</p>
   <p>"In article 48, of the Old Roman-Catholic Testament, it states the rules and obligations of a Catholic bishop. That is why I want to call your attention to this, Bishop Kozlewski.</p>
   <p>"When I heard that you were deserting the Catholies and intending to side and work with the Protestant Church, it was very hard for me to believe.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0285.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Remember, Bishop Kozlowski, that you received your consecration as bishop from our hands, the old Roman Catholic Bishop's.</p>
   <p>"Before your consecration you signed your name under the Utrech system, on the 24th of August <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and by this act you most solemnly obligated yourself that you would not engage or be induced by any member of a  Protestant or any other religion, to join their forces without considering you and your obligation to the Catholic religion. May God forbid that I should believe this to be the truth."</p>
   <p>In the near future Bishop Weber claims to bring to the eyes of the people the absolute truth in this matter, signed personally,</p>
   <p>Theodore Weber, Rev. Bishop. "</p>
