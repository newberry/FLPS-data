<title level="a">ARCHBISHOP FEEHAN SPEAKS ABOUT THE POLISH PEOPLE</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>During yesterday's preparations in connection with the blessing of the lower church of the St. John Cantius Parish, some of the Polish priests visited the Right Reverend Archbishop Feehan, who received them most graciously and spoke with them about many matters. He spoke highly about the Poles and their steadfastness toward the Church, and mentioned the last victorious campaign of the Democratic party, a campaign which pleased him very much. He stated that the Poles had contributed to this victory, and added that the greatest possible number of Poles should endeavor to become citizens, and that they should unite into groups, so that they may work together, because in this manner they can gain political influence.</p>
   <p>The Archbishop Further explained that the Poles should not confuse politics with religion, that they should vote as Democrats, not as Catholics, as it is inadvisable to mix religious matters with civil matters. We are publishing the words of this high church dignitary in the belief that the Poles will continue to improve themselves.</p>
