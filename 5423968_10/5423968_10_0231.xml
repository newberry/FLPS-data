  <body>
   <p>A plea from Blue Island, Illinois, has reached the Poles in Chicago and its suburbs.</p>
   <p>Dear Fellow-men:</p>
   <p>I inform you of the fact that the parish of St. Isadore in Blue Island is arranging a concert for the benefit of a new church. This concert will be held February 3, at 7:30 in the Saenger Hall, at Grove street, only one block south of Western avenue. This is the first concert that we are preparing with such great care in order for it to be a success.</p>
   <p>The Rev. Father Pyterek is at the head of this project. This concert should not only benefit the elderly  Poles, but the Polish youth also will benefit from it morally.</p>
   <p>The following is the program that is to be executed:</p>
   <p>1. "Crusador," Sousa. Will be played by the orchestra under the baton of F. Kondziorski.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0232.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>2. The song "Summer," executed by the choir of St. Cecylia, under the direction of professor R. Ardziejewski.</p>
   <p>3. The song "Premow," of L. Arditti, sung by Miss A. Nering.</p>
   <p>4. Raff's vales "Impromtu," by Prof. R. Ardziejewski.</p>
   <p>5. "Monarch," by the orchestra.</p>
   <p>6. A duet "Sing me to sleep," by J. and A. Nering.</p>
   <p>7."Toward a song," by the choir of Dembinski, under the direction of Prof. R. Ardziejewski.</p>
   <p>8. "Toreador," from the opera "Carmen;' by Mr. J. Kondziorski.</p>
   <p>9. "Serenade," by the quartet consisting of W. Barwig, first tenor; A. Barwig, second tenor; F. Kondziorski, first bass; and J. Kondziorski, second bass.</p>
   <p>10. "Monologue," by Mr. J. Sikorski.</p>
   <p>11. "Soldier Chorus," from the opera "Faust," executed by the Holy Mary Choir.</p>
