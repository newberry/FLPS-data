   <p>According to our promise in a previous article, we come to a discussion of Polish parishes. We mention in advance the possibility of inaccuracy in some cases. Even though our source--Sadlier's Catholic Directory and Almanac--constitutes a practically complete offical compilation, it has certain inadequacies. We have made such corrections as we could from our personal knowledge; it is possible, however, that some inaccurate items may have been retained. Some of the figures published in the Catholic Directory might have changed completely in the course of a few months or weeks.</p>
   <p>In the [ecclesiastical] province of Chicago there are three dioceses: Chicago, Peoria, and Belleville. The largest, in respect to the number of Polish churches, is the Archdiocese of Chicago. In Chicago alone (excluding South Chicago) <pb facs="5423968_10_1092.jpg" n="2"/>there are seven Polish parishes, The Polish churches are as follows: St. Stanislaus Kostka, on Noble Street (Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor); St. Adalbert's, on South Paulina Street (Reverend Radziejewski, pastor); St. Hedwig's (Reverend J. Barzynski, pastor); St. Mary's of Perpetual Help, in Bridgeport (Reverend Nawrocki, pastor); St. Joseph's, in Town of Lake; (Reverend W. Zalewski, pastor); St. Josephat, in Lake View (Reverend Lange, pastor; and St. Casimir's, on 22nd Street (Reverend F. Kroll, pastor). Naturally, we are not counting the three or four parishes which may come into being during the course of this year. Besides the seven parishes in Chicago proper, there are two in South Chicago, namely, St. Mary's of Immaculate Conception (Reverend M. Pyplatz, pastor), and St. Michael Archangel (Reverend A. Nowicki, pastor).</p>
   <p>In general, there are thirteen Polish parishes in the Chicago Archdiocese, with thirty Polish priests, including assistants. Of these, in St. Stanislaus Kostka parish alone, there are nine. This parish is undoubtedly the largest Polish diocese in the United States.</p>
