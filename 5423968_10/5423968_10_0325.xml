   <p>Rev. Chaplains and my dear countrymen:</p>
   <p>Praised be the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
   <p>The History of civilized Christians, lasting almost nineteen centuries, is ready to begin to bring out the truth and falsehood of most of the written testimonies about the Polish Catholic Organizations and Societies.</p>
   <p>The fundamentals of Catholic morals, the Roman Catholic Religion, and their traditions are at stake, and it is up to the people to see that the systems are changed to suit them. This is the sole reason for having this Polish Catholic Congress meet, so that people, dissatisfied with the present rules and laws, can have them changed. It is easy to start something but it is very hard to keep at it. Where else can we do this if not at the meeting of this congress?</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0326.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This meeting is not an experiment but the realization of work that has been accomplished. It is the public manifestation of Catholic life, closer contact of the younger generation to the Catholic Churches, and its respect for his Highness, the Pope.</p>
   <p>History claims that after their awakening the people of Germany were strong in the support of the Catholic religion and its teachings, owing to the change of the people, and their different ideas on life.</p>
   <p>Following in their footsteps even we, the Polish people in America, have had one Congress meeting in the year 1896 in Buffalo, N. Y. To the following or in other words the second meeting to take place in Chicago on the 28th of August, 1898, we invite, from the bottom of our hearts, all Polish Catholics in the United States of America.</p>
   <p>What is the purpose of having the second meeting? It is for the purpose of having our minds broadened in respect to our own moral conduct, the national moral conduct; to set forth examples of our mistakes and to better ourselves, so as not to let them happen again. They are a blemish on our souls and can result in our people losing their hold on our <pb facs="5423968_10_0327.jpg" n="3"/>religion and nationality. This would result in the breaking away of Polish Roman Catholics who would join the Independent Catholics, which we are set against. This would stand out as the main result of people losing faith in God and His work.</p>
   <p>Who in the present era, believing in God, and the Immaculate Conception, would doubt any written statement about the saints, and still consider themselves true and good Catholics? Who would not stand up to defend the work of the Catholics against the scandalous propaganda of the press and the non-believers?</p>
   <p>In cases of this kind, it is the hope and ambition of the Catholic Congress to build up our Catholic faith, and strengthen our minds to the good of the Catholic religion. This is being done, to try to discourage the non-believers; to stop their constant attack upon the morality of the people, and upon the religion.</p>
   <p>Why do the Polish people of America stand by the Catholic religion and the Holy See? The Roman Catholic religion of our forefathers was upheld as a religious society; and the same is expected of our fathers and sons; <pb facs="5423968_10_0328.jpg" n="4"/>therefore we, the descendants of this religious society, should follow in their footsteps, and continue the tremendous task of upholding the Roman Catholic Religion.</p>
   <p>We should stand by the Holy See and believe in the Pope, because he stands as a successor or next in line to Jesus Christ in supporting the work of our Savior. Those not believing in the work of the Pope, are not considered Catholics. As St. Ambrose said, "Where Peter is, there is the Church."</p>
   <p>Sons believing in the Church, will stand by the Pope as the father of Christianity. At this congress we will try to impress upon the people, the need of belonging to Polish Catholic Parishes, and their obligations in supporting them. We will also say that the profits of belonging to these organizations are the moral benefits received from the Catholic organization.</p>
   <p>In this united organization all our strength lies in the fact, that in unity we have strength. Who among us does not know that the non-believers are trying to teach and show our people that they have a superior system, and only those with a weak mind and lack of understanding can easily be <pb facs="5423968_10_0329.jpg" n="5"/>persuaded to join their forces. Therefore, we must build a strong phalanx to overcome this great obstacle obstructing our path and our teachings of Christianity.</p>
   <p>It is the sacred duty of all mothers to teach their children from childhood the benefits of believing in the Catholic religion. We must also consider, that the parochial schools are built for our children and supported chiefly by our parents; which is also the chief reason why we have so many Roman Catholic churches; but we find that many of the Polish children born and raised here are not willing to follow in the footsteps of their forefathers, unless the parents are strict Catholics and uphold the Catholic faith.</p>
   <p>Reports are being prepared on the duty of the Catholic families in regard to God, their own lives and to their country, and their support in matters such as upkeeping the Immigration Home and the support given our institutions of learning to help produce more educated Polish people. It is a great manifestation of our Catholic strength. We ask all Polish Catholics to do their utmost to make this congress meeting a huge success.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0330.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>It is our wish that all our people consider these words spoken in their behalf, in regard to the Lord, and the Polish Catholic Congress. Please address all letters of information to Rev. Father Lange, 228 Southport Avenue, Chicago.</p>
