   <p>The Holy Name Society of St. Hyacinth's Parish was officially admitted to the Archdiocesan Union of the Holy Name Society on Sunday, November 27. Over five hundred members attended the regular meeting which was held promptly at 1 P.M. in the parish hall. Immediately after the close of the business meeting, F. J. Tomczak, president of the Society, called upon D. E. Fitzgerald, well-known executive committeeman of the Holy Name Society. Mr. Fitzgerald welcomed this group into the Archdiocesan Union with open arms. He made many complimentary remarks about this Society. J. Berck, prominent member of the Society of St. Wenceslaus' Parish, made a short speech. He remarked on the fine work accomplished by the St. Hyacinth's Society. Mr. Tomczak thanked the guest speakers in the name of his entire group and asked them to pay additional visits.</p>
   <p>At 2:30 P.M., Father Leonard Long, C.R., clerical director of the Society, led the entire assemblage of young men to the church for afternoon services. The march to the church was more like a procession than anything else. Master <pb facs="5423968_10_0036.jpg" n="2"/>of ceremonies was the pastor of the parish, Reverend John Sobieszczyk, C. R., who at first had all the Holy Name members take an oath and then delivered an impressive sermon on the activities of Polish youth. His concluding words were:</p>
   <p>"I am proud of the fact that so many of you are present on this memorable occasion. Your fine work and co-operation have moved me to such an extent that I solemnly swear that I will try my best to have every young man of our parish join."</p>
   <p>One of the most prominent members of this Society is F. J. Tomczak, its president. It was through his hard work that the membership of this group has grown steadily. Mr. Tomczak predicted that, within the near future, membership will reach the one thousand mark. He has written letters time and again to the members, asking them to interest others in joining. One of the many other things that he has done for his organization was to get all the <pb facs="5423968_10_0037.jpg" n="3"/>members to attend this meeting. It was no easy task.</p>
   <p>Because of his untiring efforts to further the progress of the St. Hyacinth's Holy Name Society--[a report of] which [efforts] has reached the office of Bishop A. J. McGavick--he was appointed a member of the executive committee of the Archdiocesan Union. Indeed a just reward for his splendid work!</p>
   <p>Another outstanding worker in this Society is Father L. Long, C. R. Although he has been an assistant of the parish for only a year, he has not only become an active supporter of the Society, but a friend to all the members. It can be truthfully said that he is a real friend of the young men. In addition to participating in the activities of the Society, he is chaplain both of the St. Hyacinth's Alumni Association and of the Union of Polish Catholic Schools, which plays an important role among the Polish people in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Members of the St. Hyacinth's Holy Name Society receive Holy Communion en masse <pb facs="5423968_10_0038.jpg" n="4"/>on the first Sunday after the First Friday of the month. Meetings are held every fourth Sunday of the month.</p>
   <p>The directors of the Society are: Reverend John Sobieszczyk, pastor, and Father Leonard Long, C. R., clerical conductor. The officers are: F. J. Tomczak, president; August Dorr, vice-president; John Lewandowski, recording secretary; W. Schultz, financial secretary; W. S. Polacheck, treasurer.</p>
