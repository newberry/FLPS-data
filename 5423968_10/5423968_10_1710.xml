<title level="a">ANTI-IMMIGRATION BILL PASSES IN SENATE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The thing which we have foreseen has now actually happened. The Dillingham-Burnett anti-immigration bill has been passed in the United States Senate. This bill, if enforced, would prohibit entrance to illiterate immigrants, that is to those unable to read and write. The vote on this measure was held on January 2, 1915, with the result that fifty Senators voted for the proposed law and only seven against it. This bill also excludes negroes from Africa; on the other hand, it permits Belgian illiterates to settle here, under this condition that they shall settle on farms and work on them.</p>
   <p>President Wilson made it known decisively that he will veto the bill if the illiteracy clause is not removed from it. The President, however, will gain nothing in the Senate, because the bill would pass there over his vote. It is doubtful whether the House of Representatives will be able to obtain a two-thirds vote against the Executive's vote. True, the anti-immigration bill <pb facs="5423968_10_1711.jpg" n="2"/>did pass previously by a majority of votes in the House of Representatives, but there might be insufficient strength to override the President's veto.</p>
