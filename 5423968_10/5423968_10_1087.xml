   <p>There are very few Polish male religious institutions in America. Of these, there is only one in Chicago--that of the Resurrection Fathers, whose superior is Father Simon Kobrzynski.</p>
   <p>Female Polish religious establishments are far more numerous. They exist beside practically every Polish parochial school, and a detailed list of them will be found below. We need but note here that the education of Polish children in Chicago is principally in the hands of the Felician, Franciscan, Nazarene, and Notre Dame Sisters.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1088.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>As to Polish Catholic educational and charitable institutions, they are as follows:</p>
   <p>The Holy Family Polish-Bohemian Orphanage, under the guidance of the Notre Dame Sisters, and the high school for Polish girls, under the guidance of the Nazarene Sisters.</p>
   <p>Here is a list of Polish parochial schools in America:</p>
   <p>[Ecclesiastical] Province of Chicago, City of Chicago:</p>
   <p>St. Stanislaus Kostaka's [parochial school], the largest Polish parochial school in America, including a high school and evening classes, with nine lay teachers and fourteen Notre Dame Sisters on its staff, attended <pb facs="5423968_10_1089.jpg" n="3"/>by 1,121 boys and 1,538 girls, a total of 2,659 pupils.</p>
   <p>St. Adalbert's [parochial] school (Nazarane Sisters), with 310 boys and 361 girls, or 671 pupils.</p>
   <p>St. Casimir's [parochial] school, 46 boys and 67 girls, or a total of 113 pupils.</p>
   <p>St. Hedwig's [parochial] school (Nazarene Sisters), 260 boys and 190 girls, or 450 pupils.</p>
   <p>St. Joseph's [parochial] school (Felician Sisters), 162 boys and 178 girls, or 340 pupils.</p>
   <p>St. Josephat's [parochial] school (Nazarene Sisters), 200 boys and 215 girls, or 415 pupils.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1090.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The [parochial] school of St. Mary of Perpetual Help (Felician Sisters and lay teachers), 218 boys and 203 girls, or 423 [sic] pupils.</p>
   <p>In South Chicago the [parochial] School of St. Mary of Immaculate Conception (Sisters and lay teachers) is attended by 250 boys and 300 girls, or 550 pupils.</p>
   <p>The new school in St. Michael Archangel parish is not yet listed, but can be counted on for at least 350 pupils.</p>
   <p>The total number of children in the Polish parochial schools in Chicago and South Chicago reaches at least 6,069.</p>
