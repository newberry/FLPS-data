   <p>When Bishop Rhode was conducting the inspection of his diocese, he stopped unexpectedly at a certain parish, where he noticed two little fat boys playing in the yard on a pile of sand.</p>
   <p>"Whose children are they?" asked the bishop, eyeing the pastor suspiciously. "They are my brother's children," replied the reverend shepherd, without even the slightest sign of stammering or embarrassment.</p>
   <p>In the meantime the news about the inspection spread all over, with the result that when the archshepherd arrived at the next parish everything was ready for him. At a certain parish, while waiting for the pastor, the bishop took a walk in the parish garden. Suddenly he noticed a group of children hidden in the raspberry bushes. "Whose children are you?" asked the bishop. "The Millers," answered the children, who were well trained. "And where is your daddy," asked the puzzled bishop. "Oh! he went to a sick man with the Lord."</p>
