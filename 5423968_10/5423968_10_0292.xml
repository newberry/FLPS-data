  <body>
   <p>This coming Sunday, Dec. 25, there will take place the dedication or consecration of the Church of Saint Mary's N. P. It will be the first Polish church consecrated here in America; this type of a ceremony very seldom takes place and very few people have had the possibility of witnessing a ceremony of its kind.</p>
   <p>We shall note for ourselves that the ceremonies of consecration can be only performed by a bishop. Usually a dedication of this kind takes place on a Sunday, or some solemn holiday; the day before this ceremony the bishop likewise the ones who imitiated this consecration, that is, the pastor and parishoners, must prepare themselves for this ceremony with prayer and fasting.</p>
   <p>Only this kind of a church can be dedicated, that is built of stone and has a stone and has a stone alter, which must be exempted from taxation and dues, to be sure, that in the future it can maintain itself financially.</p>
   <p>In the presence of the relies consecrated by the bishop the believers recite prayers, rosary, and the lithany, this takes place in the "EVE" before the dedication, the relies often remain as a vigil through the night for this consecration, and adoration.</p>
