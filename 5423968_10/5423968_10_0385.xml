   <p>Forty-hour devotional services were concluded on May 4 at the St. Hedwig Parish.</p>
   <p>These services were of great spiritual benefit to the rapidly growing parish. They strengthened the faith of the devout parishioners, and aided those about to stray to return to the true fold.</p>
   <p>All had an opportunity to hear the word of God, the word of truth, from the lips of true priests. All had an opportunity to beg forgiveness for their sins against the Almighty.</p>
   <p>And it is firmly believed that this was so, because many hurried to their true <pb facs="5423968_10_0386.jpg" n="2"/>church [St. Hedwig is considered the true church while the All Saints, an independent church, is considered to be leftist]. They hurried because they wanted not only to be worthy of God, but to be influenced by the light of truth.</p>
   <p>The reverend priests, imbued with the spirit of zeal and love for us, as well as for our brothers who have strayed, preached the word of God, the truth of life--clear, emphatic, and understanding to all. Sadness prevailed when it was realized that there are subversive people who deny the truth and dare to sow seeds of falsehood before God--that there are people who do not wish to know the truth.</p>
   <p>But we parishioners of St. Hedwig Parish will, according to the suggestion of the priest, pray for the return of those who have strayed from the path of truth; we will pray that the light will strike their hearts. In this way, they will be able to return to the fold of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0387.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We are prepared to forgive them, accept them, into our temple, into our homes, if only they will convert themselves.</p>
   <p>Many Polish priests took part in these services, namely: Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church; Reverend John Kasprzycki, pastor of St. John Cantius Church; Reverend S. Nawrocki, pastor of St. Mary of Perpetual Help Church; Reverend T. Szypkowski, Reverend F. Byrgier, of Sobieski, Illinois; Reverend J. Barzynski, of La Salle, Illinois; Reverend J. Gieburowski, Reverend W. Rapacz, Reverend B. Pawlowski, of Joliet, Illinois; Reverend Wotypka, and Reverend A. Babski.</p>
   <p>Sincere thanks are extended to the visiting priests for taking part in this yearly event.</p>
   <p>J. Braha, a St. Hedwig Parishioner.</p>
