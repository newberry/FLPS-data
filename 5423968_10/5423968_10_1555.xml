   <p>Twenty-six new members have been added to the ever growing St. Casimir Young Men's Club, according to an official announcement made at the quarterly meeting last week. During the past few months, the society has gained more recognition, patronage, and members, than in any preceding months. The spirit of the Polish Catholic groups is awakening and they are becoming more interested in Polish Catholic organizations.</p>
   <p>March 4 marked the anniversary of the St. Casimir. In memory of this patron of the society, a special religious ceremony was held for the members at St. Stanislaus Kostki's Church in the evening. Prayer, songs, and lectures, were a part of the rituals.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1556.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A Cultural Committee constantly plans programs of interest which enrich the members in traditional, historical, and literary knowledge of the Polish people.</p>
   <p>Every Polish Catholic young man past his sixteenth year can become a member of this organization. Entrance fee is two dollars, and regular monthly fees are twenty-five cents. Besides giving assistance in case of sickness, mishap, and death, the club offers many educational advantages to its members.</p>
   <p>Julius Szczepanski, president.</p>
