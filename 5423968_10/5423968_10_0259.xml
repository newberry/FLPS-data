   <p>Yesterday a new Polish Catholic church was consecrated in Chicago.</p>
   <p>At seven o'clock in the morning at the intersection of Superior and Bickerdike street, people were gathering, most of them members of chuch societies, Polish people in this neighborhood decorated their homes with Polish and American flags, some had streamers strewn across their houses and yards, some put streamers from house to house across the street.</p>
   <p>At 8 o'clock a 26-piece band was present. Church societies gathered and sang Polish songs and hymns, followed by the band playing "Boze cos Polske," after which the parade was started. They marched to Carpenter and Milwaukee, where they met the group of St. Michael from South Chicago, thence they paraded down Noble street to the parish of Holy Trinity where many societies and people were waiting to join in this great celebration. Then the paraders marched to St. Stanislaus, where for a distance of three to five <pb facs="5423968_10_0260.jpg" n="2"/>blocks Polish flags and those of different church societies were displayed. The fifth division of cadets from St. Stanislaus joined the paraders; they paraded to Chicago avenue and Halsted street, where they awaited the arrival of his Excellency Archbishop Quigley.</p>
   <p>At 9:30 Archbishop Quigley arrived escorted by the Polish cavalry from Bridgeport.</p>
   <p>Now the triumphant parade started in earnest, they paraded down Chicago avenue to the parish of Holy Innocence where the consecration ceremonies started at exactly 10:15 A. M. Superior street was so filled with societies, banners of different church groups, cavalry, cadets, and a Polish band that the people couldn't move. The echo of the band from the new church tower could be heard for many blocks.</p>
   <p>The societies marched in file by two's in front of the church and placed their offerings at the foot of the church steps.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0261.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At 10:30 the procession started from the parsonage to the church. The altar boys, priests, and his Excellency Archbishop Quigley accompanied by deacons and sub-deacons.</p>
   <p>The church was empty, nobody was in it.</p>
   <p>Next was the blessing, first the interior, then the exterior.</p>
   <p>The people were moving about trying to get closer to witness this ceremony. At last the doors were open to the public, and in a few minutes every seat and available space was occupied, hundreds of people went home, but some remained outside in front of the church.</p>
   <p>The first church mass was under the direction of the Most. Rev. Father Skumisnki, rector of St. Anna's parish, who briefly stated that the Polish people haven't any more alibis or excuses to make; they can attend this Polish church and forget about the German church, which they have been attending for years.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0262.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>At the close of the mass archbishop Quigley thanked the Polish people for their undying love for the Catholic religion; he also asked that they send their children to this parochial school. Then he blessed the congregation, the school and the parsonage.</p>
   <p>Among the priests present were Father Wojtalewicz, Father Ziemba, Father Rogalski, Father Kosinski, Father Spetz, Father Kotecki, Father Dunne, Father Sobieszczyk, Father Filipski, Father Czajkowski, Father Sztuczko, Father Nawrocki, Father Slominski, Father Rhode and Father Bobkiewicz.</p>
   <p>Archbishop Quigley acknowledged this splendid work to the pastor of Holy Innocence, Father Zwievzchowski. He said, "Although he is young, he is energetic, a hard worker and in a short time will have the love and respect of every member of this parish."</p>
   <p>Father Zwievzchowski took this opportunity to thank all the different societies, cadets, choirs, and different parishes for participating in this <pb facs="5423968_10_0263.jpg" n="5"/>great celebration. The "sisters" also received great credit for decorating the altar and the rectory.</p>
   <p>Now the Polish people can attend a new Polish parish, Holy Innocence.</p>
