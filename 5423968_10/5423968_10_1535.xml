   <p>Delegates representing Polish youth societies met yesterday at St. Adalbert's school hall, Sixteenth and Paulina Streets, for the purpose of organizing the Polish Youth Alliance of America. The delegates accomplished their purpose, organizing the Alliance.</p>
   <p>The following youth societies sent their delegates: The Polish Patriotic and Educational Youth Society (four delegates--S. J. Napieralski, Francis P. Danish, J. J. Bielinski, and S. J. Segers); the St. Casimir's Society, from St. Stanislaus Kostka parish (nine delegates--John Nering, V. J. Jozwiakowski, J. Paszkiewicz, Francis Budzban, R. Szajkowski, Stanley F. Cjwinski, A. Ogorek, A. Barwig, and J. Jarzembowski); the St. Stanislaus Cadets Society (three delegates--P. Lama, W. Wieckowski, and Francis Grzes); the Patriotic Organization's Youth Society, from St. John Cantius parish (four delegates--A. Chabowski, Francis Kwasinski, Francis Gliniecki, and John Gizon).</p>
   <p>The meeting was opened by Reverend Eugene Siedlaczek, who acted as chairman.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1536.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>B. Klarkewski was recording secretary.</p>
   <p>After a short discussion, all delegates agreed unanimously in the organization of the Polish Youth Alliance, which was joined immediately by the four societies represented at the meeting. It was announced that the new Alliance would be under the guardianship of the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>Although the Polish Youth Alliance of America will have a management of its own, it will be under a supervising committee consisting of three guardians--one appointed by the Polish Roman Catholic Union, the other, by the clergy, and the third, by the Alliance itself.</p>
   <p>As to the principles under which it will function, the Alliance agreed to adopt the ones suggested in its appeal, published not so long ago. These principles call for a stronger faith, mutual help, moral upliftment, education, an awakening of patriotism among our youth, participation in national celebrations, and so forth. A constitution, embodying these principles, will <pb facs="5423968_10_1537.jpg" n="3"/>be written by a special committee and approved by the delegates.</p>
   <p>After Delegates R. Szajkowski, J. Jarzembowski, Stanley F. Cywinski, A. Chabowski, Francis P. Danish, J. Segers, W. Wieckowski and V. J. Jozwiakowski had debated on the death benefit question, it was finally agreed that the Alliance would appropriate seventy-five dollars for the funeral of every deceased member. It was agreed that the regular monthly fee would be fifteen cents--ten cents [for belonging to the Alliance] and a special assessment of five cents for patriotic and educational purposes.</p>
   <p>The following delegates were chosen for the committee to draw up the constitution: Francis Danish, Stanley F. Cywinski, W. Wieckowski, A. Chabowski, and J. Paszkiewicz.....</p>
   <p>The delegates adopted the age-limit regulation, which reads: young men, 16 to 30 years old, may belong to the Polish youth Alliance.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1538.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Yesterday's gathering resulted in the foundation of a new and very important institution. Let us hope that this institution will help our development, our religion, our morals, and that it will help us to be better patriots.</p>
