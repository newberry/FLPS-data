   <p>Here in the east part of the town not many of the people have the habit of complaining about the city of Chicago. But there are those, who sincerely believe, that this city consists of only thieves, murderers and falsifiers. Nobody praises this city and the newspapers rebel against it. The general opinion is that the inhabitants of the city of Chicago are not only rude, but even ignorant; others believe that the entire city of Chicago heedlessly cares only for the dollar; other phrases claim that the industrial Chicagoans are people without any principles. As a result, tourists passing through this city, write about it just as Englishmen wrote about America and American affairs some years age.</p>
   <p>Chicago is not a city without fault! It is a large city with a population of 2,500,000 at least. And like other large cities of similar size itself they, also, are found with their own faults. It was this way from the very beginning -- and beyond all question shall remain this way <pb facs="5423968_10_0246.jpg" n="2"/>to the end. But Chicago has also great virtues. Without exaggerating it is great in many respects. For example, it is one of the most cosmopolitan cities on earth. If the people only knew that they would not have to spend thousands of dollars to visit other countries to meet other nationalities and could save themselves hundreds of dollars by just visiting and exploiting here in the city of Chicago! Why? Because, as I have mentioned before, there are here, not less than fifty-two nations represented. There are more Poles than in Warsaw; more Czechs than in Prague; more Jews than in Jerusalem; more Irish than in Dublin; as many Germans as in Berlin and more Roman-Catholies than in Rome.</p>
   <p>Catholic life, as lived in Chicago, is something astonishing. There is nothing similar in any other city of the United States. Chicago possesses over 1,000,000 Roman-Catholies served by 452 priests, and 191 Catholies belonging to various convents. People should step and think that England with all of its bishops (recently it also secured a cardinal) has not so many Catholies as the Archdiocese of Chicago. They probably are <pb facs="5423968_10_0247.jpg" n="3"/>astonished!</p>
   <p>Furthermore, Chicago possesses 170 Catholic churches, these having 125 parochial schools, attended by an army of 70,000 children. There are six Catholic orphanages. In general, there are 100,000 children under the superintendeney of the church. In addition, in this city there are ten colleges and academies attended by 2,000 students. Chicago has 23 academies for girls - and in these schools this year there are 4,265 students.</p>
   <p>The Catholic schools, parochial and high schools, have made a higher average than the public schools.</p>
   <p>That is only a small part of the work done by the Catholic church. Chicago has 19 Catholic hospitals, and every one of them takes care of thousands of patients during the year. There are 9 homes for the old people. maintained by the Little Sisters of the Poor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0248.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Beside these there are other convents of sisters here on the East Side, of which no one hears, for example: Poor Handmaids of Jesus Christ, of nuns who go to homes and care for the sick, the same work is done by the sisters of the Little Company of Mary. They do not demand a reward for their work. Every one of them is a qualified inspectress of the sick.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to try and portray all of the work done by these various different monasteries and convents. Please understand; there are Polish nuns, Czech nuns, Italian nuns, English nuns, Irish nuns, French nuns; there is even one convent from Holland. Some of the monasteries are: Benedicts, Lazareths, Franciscans, Crusaders, Clerks of St. Wiatura and many others.</p>
   <p>There isn't a city in this country that has as much Catholic life in it as this one. The St. Vincent organization waits consistently upon the poor. Last fall it expended $16,000 for the needs of the poor. The Visitation <pb facs="5423968_10_0249.jpg" n="5"/>and Aid Society works most efficiently. To inform you of all of their good work would require another long article.</p>
   <p>Is Catholicism in Chicago intellectual? Decidedly yes, through the part taken in literature and music, likewise in politics, we slowly climb upward to the peak. A number of twenty-five of the most famous painters, carvers and illustrators are Chicagoans -- people of our faith. Last year there was organized a group of literati that now consists of over a hundred members. The city of Chicago has a Polish Catholic daily paper, also one in Czech language, one weekly edition in French, two in German, one Italian and two English weekly editions. There isn't yet a Catholic magazine, but we have the talent for it.</p>
   <p>As to music there exist Polish, German, Italian and Czech singing organizations and the Irish Choral Society is included with Catholic organizations.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0250.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>No one can say that, in polities, the Cathelies are not well represented. The Pole seems to be the coming man. He has versatility and acquisitiveness.</p>
   <p>In one word, Chicago is a mighty city and shall be the greatest. It grows constantly, 100,000 people arrive each year. The greater part of business and commerce comes through its gates. It is no wonder, then that in its midst there is a constant dreadful unrest. It feels and knows, before the passing of a century it shall be the largest city that any person has looked upon - more vast than the present or the future London.</p>
