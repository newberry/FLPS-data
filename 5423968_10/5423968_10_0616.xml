  <body>
   <p>We are informed that, at the last meeting of Kosciusko Court, No. 285, of the Catholic Order of Foresters, two of the most active members were rewarded by their fellow members for their good work for the good of the court.</p>
   <p>The first of those rewarded was Mr. Paul Giersz, who was given a gold medal in the form of a cross. Mr. Ign. Krakowski, an officer of the Foresters, performed the ceremony in the presence of the members of the Court, and them Mr. Giersz thanked the members for the honor.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Wengierski, the circuit leader of the Foresters, was present, and his few remarks were well received.</p>
   <p>The second member rewarded with a gold medal was Mr. M. Borkowicz, who likewise has been of great service to the Court. Because of Mr. Borkowicz's absence, <pb facs="5423968_10_0617.jpg" n="2"/>the presentation of the medal will take place in a few days.</p>
