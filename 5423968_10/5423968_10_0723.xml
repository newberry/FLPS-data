<title level="a">HOLY TRINITY PARISH PROTESTS AGAINST THE INDEPENDENT CHURCH MOVEMENT</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>(The following article has been received for publication in the Dziennik Chicagoski.)</p>
   <p>During a meeting held last night [Sunday] at the Holy Trinity Parish Hall, the parishioners adopted the following resolutions relative to the independent church movement:</p>
   <p>"Because some persons are sympathetic towards the independent Church movement and talk about the situation existing in our parish, thereby causing it considerable damage, for they present it in a false light in the presence of our parishioners, compatriots, and the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church, especially His Eminence Monsignor Satolli, Apostolic Delegate, to whom we have given an oath of honor that we will uphold the principles of the Roman Catholic Church, therefore, we parishioners of Holy Trinity Church of Chicago, along <pb facs="5423968_10_0724.jpg" n="2"/>with our pastor and parish committee, gathered at a parish meeting on November 10, 1895 make the following resolution:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Independent Church, primarily based on the principle, 'The means justify the end' violently opposes the well-understood foundations of morality; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Independent Church, as it appears to us, related in spirit and principles to the Russian Orthodox Church, always an enemy of the Poles, threatens the Polish element of America with defeat and endless misfortune; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Independent Church, casting away, ipso facto, the recognized authority of the Roman Catholic Church, casts from itself the founder of Christianity and the only hope of salvation, and deceives and leads our compatriets, who are not completely familiar with the tenets of the true faith, and who would rather seek salvation where Christ is absent, to the true faith, and who would rather seek salvation where Christ is absent, to the road of evil; <pb facs="5423968_10_0725.jpg" n="3"/>be it therefore</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we have not authorized anyone to show sympathy for the Independent Church, and we not only do not favor the movement but are definitely opposed to it. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That, as we have sworn to Monsignor Satolli, we are going to stand by the principles of the Holy Faith which our forefathers adopted, and will always be faithful to the Roman Catholic Church. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That we beseech all compatriots who are sympathetic towards the so-called "Independent Church," in the name of the parish, to refrain from such action in the future. Be it further</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That the above resolutions adopted by us shall be reprinted in all the Polish papers in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0726.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"In the name of the Holy Trinity Parish:</p>
   <p>Reverend C. Sztuczko, pastor;</p>
   <p>Joseph Gillmeister,</p>
   <p>Peter Binkowski,</p>
   <p>Joseph Grejczyk, and</p>
   <p>John Knietz,</p>
   <p>Parish Committee."</p>
