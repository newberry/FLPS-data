   <p>"We are giving this idea to the American Poles for them to think about." writes the editor of the article "Poles in Chicago," referring to the Second Polish Catholic Congress held last week in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This article is very important because it deals with our work in the future. It is our belief that our interest in all movements dealing with the American Poles is well known to all other nationalities.</p>
   <p>It is true that the Poles through their hard work and effort in the years gone by, have brought upon themselves many enemies who make it their duty to see that the Poles do not place themselves above other nationalities. Is this what people in America call freedom and justice?</p>
   <p>In regard to the question of religion, we believe that the people of other nationalities should not interfere. Let the Polish people run <pb facs="5423968_10_0307.jpg" n="2"/>their schools and churches the same way they are run in Poland, within the rules and laws of the pope and the Bible. For this cause we will fight and continue fighting if necessary.</p>
   <p>The penalty for bad deeds does not belong to us, but it is our duty to do everything in our power to overcome them. On the other hand, every good deed should be brought out to outshine the bad one and to build up love and respect for our future.</p>
   <p>The newspaper Poles in America refers to the work and words of Bishops Eis and Messner. The newspaper claims that in the ranks of the Polish priests in America, none have reached a higher position than the Most Reverend Father who is the head of a church. We Poles must work in unity and make it our duty to see that our Polish priests are made suffragan bishops and hold this rank, and others general vicars and other highly respected ranks.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0308.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We received word from Rome that all this is possible and can be fulfilled, providing the Polish-American clergy and societies will work in this respect in harmony and solidarity. Up to the present time we have not reached this stage and have not followed the above rules, but we can make it our duty to abide by these rules in the future and continue working until we have reached our goal, which is just as other nationalities. The entire American Polonia, that is, all the Poles declaring themselves as Catholics, should take active part in the manifestation of our efforts for the truth which the other nationalities do not want to admit. We should rebel against this tyranny, but the Polish priests and all the societies ought to support our every movement.</p>
   <p>This may be a reality if we can call a mass meeting or hold a Second Catholic Congress and thrash out these drawbacks. Besides priests, we want every Polish society, lodge, club or any other group, to send delegates to that eventual convention.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0309.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We have had a Polish Catholic Congress in Chicago, and all the laws and rules passed at that convention have been lived up to, abided by, and a new motion was made to hold the next Catholic Congress in Buffalo this year. The Polish people are on the verge of taking drastic steps if the bishops do not agree to have the Polish priests hold higher offices, such as vicar and bishop, or higher. Why doesn't Bishop Eis or Bishop Messner name a Polish priest for promotion. It is because they do not want the Polish clergy to emulate with the Irish and Italian priests. We Poles should support our own flesh and blood and do as the other nationalities do, who care about their own welfare and have no consideration for the others.</p>
