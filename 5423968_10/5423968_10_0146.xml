   <p>Poor unenlightened Polish workman! Here in America wherever he turns he meets sky pilots who, either by promising him eternal happiness in heaven after death or by scaring him with the infernal abyss and black, boiling pitch, fleece him unmercifully of his hard earned money for collections, donations, for the saints and other humbugs. This is not all far from the old country over the large ocean, the consecrated parasites are extending their beggarly paws, asking donations for the upkeep of the "Houses of God." With the sweetest words they knock at the pocketbook of the Polish workman, who already has been exploited by their co-workers right here in America.</p>
   <p>They ask for all kinds of donations, using very tricky and convincing arguments that all misfortune is caused by the neglect of the "houses of God." Another clever argument is the biblical quotation, "Give and it shall be given to you," but sometimes the quotation reads, "And because you did not give that what you have shall be taken away from you." O yes, that what we have is taken away from us by the insatiable ravens in cassocks.</p>
