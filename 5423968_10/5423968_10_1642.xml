   <p>The House of Representatives is at work on a bill to bar from this country all immigrants who cannot read and write. That is a pretty good example of the trifling futility which characterizes most of the recent deliberations of Congress.</p>
   <p>The United States has received many grievous insults and wrongs from its foreign-born citizens during the last year and a half, but not from those who would be excluded by the literacy test.</p>
   <p>The foreign-born residents who defend the sinking of the Lusitania are not illiterate.</p>
   <p>The men who denounce President Wilson for insisting on the rights of Americans at sea are not illiterate.</p>
   <p>The men who in every controversy that arises between Germany and the United <pb facs="5423968_10_1643.jpg" n="2"/>States take the side of the Kaiser against the President all can read and write.</p>
   <p>The sedition-mongers on whom von Bernhardi and his ilk rely to start a civil war in the United States are well-educated men.</p>
   <p>Illiteracy, as President Wilson so finely said, proves that a man has lacked opportunity in the land from which he has come, not that he will misuse opportunity in the land to which he is going.</p>
   <p>If we are to restrict immigration, we need to find better means by which to separate the sheep from the goats than is furnished by the spelling book.</p>
