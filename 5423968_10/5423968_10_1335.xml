   <p>At the date of this writing the Polish American Veterans Alliance is holding one of its frist national conventions in the Polish National Alliance Building. This organization is one of the youngest of its kind, and we feel it is not sufficiently appreciated by the Polish element in America.</p>
   <p>In the years which followed the world war a chauvinistic movement was created by a group of American people of Anglo-Saxon descent, who wished to exercise this belated spirit of patriotism. Although it was much too late for this group to fight and participate in the hardships of war the continuous danger of the loss of life and health on the field of glory, this group began an intensive hunt for a non-existent foe of the Star Spangled Banner, under the guise of true Americansim. In this manner they spread a spirit of intolerance which is contrary to the principles of a free nation, as set forth by the founders of this glorious United States.</p>
   <p>The surprising attack of chauvinism was so sudden that the greater part of the loyal and law abiding people at whom this attack was directed, were caught unawares. Agitation and unfair propaganda, directed at all foreign groups brought the results desired, by this chauvinistic group, to a point where the clever ruse bad swayed the opinion of the patriots and citizens on the side of chauvinism.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1336.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It has been a rule of life, that one who cannot defend himself against attacks must perish. Very fortunately there are, among us, those who have found an excellent method by which we can defend ourselves against similar attacks, by those who represent themselves as true Americans, and this method is the organization of Poles, who, not by mere words, but by deeds filled with sacrifice, proved their status as Americans, by loyalty to the Star Spangled Banner at a time when this country was put to the supreme sacrifice of its citizens, and likewise, those who have not as yet become citizens but who are endowed with a sense of loyalty to their adopted country which has provided food, shelter, and freedom through the medium of the Declaration of Independence.</p>
   <p>We know that in the ranks of the United States Army, during the ward, several hundred thousand soldiers of Polish descent served the country bravely and the lions share of these were volunteers. Records of the War Department indicate that the Polish people had the largest percentage of enlistment, in proportion to the population. Let us then ask, is this display of loyalty not a proof of good citizenship? We say yes, it exceeds the loyalty of those 100% Americans who stood on the side lines and let the parade go by; but nevertheless, it seems that we do not understand the dire necessity for organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1337.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Only a very small percentage of Polish American Veterans are members in this organization Therefore, we must unite in a membership drive. Every service man of Polish extraction is an eligible candidate for membership even if only a small percentage of them joined we could still create an organization 100,000 strong; and thus display enough influence and power to gain considerable respect. A soldier who has served overseas, has certainly earned the priority rights to citizenship, which even the staunchest of chauvinists would not dare to impeach.</p>
   <p>We can observe the important role played in civic life by the American Legion, and its influence cannot be ignored,because the organization is composed strictly of ex-service men. No doubt it has been said, "Why form foreign service groups in this country?" the answer is that chauvinism must be fought in order to protect and sustain the rights of citizens who are most unjustly referred to as foreigners. In forming this organization, we are serving notice to these enemies of foreign element, that there is such a unit as the Polish American Veterans Alliance, thus checking in the bud, the promiscuous use of the word, foreigner.</p>
   <p>The Polish Veterans Alliance, in its drive for members has an unlimited field from which to reap a harvest, if it approach all who are eligible for membership.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1338.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The present convention is its fifth. The present national commander, L.T. WALKOWICZ, for four terms, has declined to accept a nomination every year, during the term of office, Mr. Walkowicz conducted a tag-day which added about eight thousand dollars to the treasury of the organization. We must pay our respects to him for his work in the development of this organization. His knowledge of business principles together with his knowledge of good advertising, are methods which brought about these very comendable results. To further show our appreciation of his work, the Veterans Annual Program of this year has given Mr. WALKOWICZ a very prominent place.</p>
   <p>One of the candidates for the office of National commander is Dr. V. B. KOBRZYNSKI. He is well known for his work in the civic life of Polish people in Chicago. He was chairman of the reception committee to great GEN. JOSEPH HALLER, also the martyr priest, the late Archbishop GIEPLAK, of Chicago. In addition he is financially independent and has for the present, retired from practice, so that he could devote all of his time to the affairs of the veterans in whose welfare he takes great interest, which fact he displayed while in office as financial secretary. The Polish Union Daily, will in the future, as in the past, support any program sponsored by this worthy organization.</p>
