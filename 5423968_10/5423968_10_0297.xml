   <p>One of the eminent traits of our Polish people is the love of work, which is desirous and pleases God. A work with the purpose to inspire in the younger generation the religion of their forefathers, cleanliness of living. That work is without question the organization of new Parishes and taking care of older ones.</p>
   <p>What can be dearer to the heart of a Pole, than our little churches, whose modest belfries are for us wanderers an oasis, where the unhappy find consolation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0298.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There one wanderer close to the other nurses the national spirit and in his thoughts is borne to that country, which was sprinkled with his forefathers bleed, but to which country he probably never will return.</p>
   <p>In truth, the little Polish churches, these monuments of a living faith and patriotism, these fortresses defending us effectively against enemies of our faith and our religion, these are foundation rocks for the coming generations and signs of devotion and sacrifices of the Polish people.</p>
   <p>The parish of St. Josaphat was organized in 1883.</p>
