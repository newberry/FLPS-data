   <p>The fallen priest, Anthony Kozlowski, who was instrumental in starting the schism in St. Hedwig Parish, was excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>The text of the excommunication was read yesterday [Sunday] in all Polish and Bohemian Churches during the divine services. This order [which is in English] reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Reverend Anthony Kozlowski, a Polish priest, not belonging to the Archdiocese of Chicago, and having no jurisdiction in it, has grievously violated the laws and the discipline of the Catholic Church and of the Archdiocese of Chicago; and,</p>
   <p>"Whereas, He contumaciously persists in his unlawful and schismatical conduct; <pb facs="5423968_10_0746.jpg" n="2"/>"Therefore, after due process of ecclesiastical law, the Reverend Anthony Kozlowski is hereby publicly and solemnly excommunicated.</p>
   <p>"The effects of this most grave censure of the Church are:</p>
   <p>"First. He is out off from the communion and society of the faithful.</p>
   <p>"Second. The faithful are forbidden, under severe penalty, to held communion or any intercourse with him.</p>
   <p>"Third. He cannot receive or administer any sacraments. If he should attempt to give absolution in the tribunal of penance, the absolution is invalid.</p>
   <p>"Fourth. He cannot be present or assist at any of the public exercises or offices of religion. He cannot be present at Mass, Vespers, or any other <pb facs="5423968_10_0747.jpg" n="3"/>public services.</p>
   <p>"Fifth. He cannot receive or fill any office in the church.</p>
   <p>"Sixth. If he should die in that state, he should be deprived of Christian burial.</p>
   <p>"The foregoing, accurately translated into the Polish language, is hereby ordered to be read at all the Masses in every Polish church in the Archdiocese of Chicago, Sunday, September 29, 1895.</p>
   <p>"Given at Chicago, September 27, 1895.</p>
   <p>"Signed: Patrick A. Fechan,</p>
   <p>"Archbishop of Chicago."</p>
   <p>The local American papers are also publishing this text in its entirety today.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0748.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In view of this notice, perhaps Kozlowski will discontinue to befuddle the people. At any rate the people know the status of this fallen priest in relation to the Catholic Church.</p>
