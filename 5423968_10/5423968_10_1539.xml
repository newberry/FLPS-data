   <p>The Polish Youth Alliance was born yesterday. This is confirmed in the statement made by the delegates representing the youth societies of St. Adalbert's parish, and which appears in the next column of this issue. In our opinion this is a very important event, because our future depends upon our youth. Up to now our youth has been exposed to the evil forces of denationalization, demoralization, and atheism, forces which made great devastations in their ranks.</p>
   <p>The Polish Youth Alliance will be a bulwark against these forces. It will unite the Polish youth sharing in common the same faith and nationalistic ideas, teaching them to love our language and making them acquainted with our past. Furthermore, the Alliance will keep our youth away from saloons, <pb facs="5423968_10_1540.jpg" n="2"/>safeguarding them against the so-called American habit of loafing. On the other hand, it will encourage wholesome pastimes, such as reading, etc. Such organization may render us and our future generation in America a great service. All young men and young men's societies ought to be affiliated with such organizations.</p>
