  <body>
   <p>A very imposing parade was held yesterday, in St. Hedwig's and St. Mary of the Angels'parishes, for the purpose of increasing enlistments in the American Army. Yesterday's parade was eloquent testimony of the high patriotism among the members of St. Hedwig's parish, who by this act proved that they not only understand their rights and privileges as citizens, but that they understand also the duties required of them by this, their adopted motherland.</p>
   <p>All organizations and societies in St. Hedwig's Parish participated in yesterday's parade. There were the men's and women's Falcon groups, the Scouts, the citizenry, recruits, and infantrymen, led by Police Lieutenant Joseph Palczynski. The parade started at the St. Hedwig's parochial school, moving down Webster to Wood Street, Armitage, Paulina, Cortland, Western, Fullerton, <pb facs="5423968_10_1396.jpg" n="2"/>Robey, Lubeck, Leavitt, and Webster and back to the parish hall.</p>
   <p>The parade was headed by Police Lieutenant Palczynski and a platoon of police, among whom were eleven Polish policemen, followed by the St. Hedwig Scout band, who were in turn followed by a troop of scouts.</p>
   <p>Among the [prominent] citizens who participated were: Judge E. K. Jarecki, Judge Joseph LaBuy, B. Mindak, County Commissioner Albert Nowak, John M. Nowicki....Vincent Zwiefka....and others.</p>
   <p>Among enlisted men who participated there were: John Nowak of the state militia, S. J. Nowakowski, a sailor of the Navy hospital corps in Michigan, Bezwinski, and W. Wostyn. The American flag was carried by L. Holysz of St. Hedwig's Parish, an infantryman stationed at the recruiting office at 984 Milwaukee Avenue, while the banners with inscriptions were carried by F. Tylkowski, F. Ciuszko, and Joseph Kubies, all in uniform. John Plenclo deserves special mention for his masterful leading of the Scout band, twirling his baton like <pb facs="5423968_10_1397.jpg" n="3"/>an expert. The St. Hedwig's Parish band was led by F. Tesmer, the Falcons by J. Janusz, and the Scouts by the energetic J. Michalski.</p>
   <p>The parade was arranged by Florian Przedzianowski, who worked indefatigably with Commissioner Nowak to make it a success.</p>
   <p>Following the parade, an excellent program was presented at the St. Hedwig Parish Hall. The program was as follows:</p>
   <p>1. American national anthem, by the St. Hedwig's band.</p>
   <p>2. Polish songs, by the St. Hedwig Scout band.</p>
   <p>3. Opening remarks, by Albert Nowak, who called upon J. M. Nowicki to act as secretary.</p>
   <p>4. Address by John S. Konopa, secretary-general of the Polish Roman Catholic Union and chief official of the Polish recruiting station, who spoke ably, vigorously emphasizing the fact that Poles are not cowards.</p>
   <p>5. "Jesczce Polska Nie Zginela" [Poland is not yet lost"] by the St. Hedwig band.</p>
   <p>6. Address by Judge Jarecki, in which he pointed out how Poles can work <pb facs="5423968_10_1398.jpg" n="4"/>for their adopted motherland, namely, by enlisting in the army, joining the Red Cross, and purchasing Liberty Bonds.</p>
   <p>7. Address by Sergeant Z. Wisniewski, veteran of the Spanish-American War, who declared that every Pole should serve his country. He spoke of the little portion each of us can contribute, out of gratitude, to this country.</p>
   <p>8. Address by Miss Emily Napieralski, secretary-general of the Polish Women's Alliance, who, with her usual suavity, spoke of the woman's place in this war, and of the pride that fills a Polish woman at the certainty that every Pole will do his duty.</p>
   <p>9. American hymn by the St. Hedwig band.</p>
   <p>10. Short address by F. Przedzianowski, who told the gathering that recruiting officials were ready to take enlistments in the regular American Army, and would do so at the hall at the conclusion of the exercises.</p>
   <p>11."Boze cos Polske" [God Save Poland], by the St. Hedwig band.</p>
   <p>Nineteen men enlisted. [List of volunteers omitted by translator.]</p>
