   <p>We have had many opportunities to write about the fine work done by St. Casimir Young Men's Club. Its activities have always met with our approval, and whenever a chance has been offered, we have recommended it to our readers and our friends. This society has continued from the day of its origin to improve its purpose, and despite the many laurels it has gathered, the quality of its work has not changed.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, January 17, this society is going to celebrate its fifth anniversary. In honor of this occasion, a special program will be given at the Polish hall at Bradley Street.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1580.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The public is invited to attend, and we feel that it should come en masse to show its appreciation for the work rendered by this organization. We feel that the rich program alone should be incentive enough for a capacity audience.</p>
   <p>A fifteen-act program has been carefully worked out, which will include: singing, concert music, speeches, and short dramatical sketches.</p>
   <p>Among the guest speakers will be the well-known City Treasurer, Peter Kiolbassa, and the concluding speaker will be the Reverend Father Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostki's parish. The orchestral music will be handled by our popular Nowicky brothers. Miss Rosalie Kiolbassa, Mr. J. Kondziorski, and Mr. W. Bombek will be the <pb facs="5423968_10_1581.jpg" n="3"/>singers for the evening.</p>
   <p>The elocutionists for this event will be: Messrs. F. Kiolbassa, and John Oszwaldowski. Other speakers will be: Julius Szczepanski, president of the club; S. Cywinski; and W. J. Jozwiakowski. For a concluding number, a one-act play will be presented by Szczesny Zahajkiewicz called the "Casimirites."</p>
   <p>How can anyone overlook such a splendid program?</p>
   <p>Tickets can be obtained from Frances Kaczmarek, at 668 Noble Street. The price per person is fifteen cents.</p>
