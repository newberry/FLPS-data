   <p>It is really gratifying to note that the Polish Roman-Catholic Union of America is at last awakening to the honest and true fact, that in our youth lies our future. For a few years preparations were being made to enroll all young Americans of Polish descent in this organization. Nevertheless the organizing of young men is now being done on a larger scale than ever before. This is due to the fact that the present administration of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union of America is more interested in the younger element, than any other administration has ever been.</p>
   <p>Due credit must be given to the officers concentrative untiring efforts and influence for this large organization, while at the same time lending assistance to the younger generation. Basehall teams or sports of any other kind, are not powerful enough to hold the young men together; therefore an effort should be made not only to organize and fit them for sport, but also for active social life.</p>
   <p>The present system of organization will be of no benefit to the large and prosperous organizations of the Polish Roman-Catholic Union of America until there is more interest and enthusiasim in those who are enrolling now. The question that arises now is whether, in order to have young men join the P.R. C. V. of America, new junior chapters should be organized instead of the present method of combining the activities of both junior and senior chapters. With the present system, young members are reluctant in attending meetings which are conducted by senior members. It seems, their attendance is by proxy: as is the payment of dues. Therefore, the apparent and urgent need is Junior Chapters.</p>
