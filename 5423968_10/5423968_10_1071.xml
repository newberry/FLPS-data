  <body>
   <p>A very solemn ceremony took place yesterday in St. Adalbert's parish. Misunderstandings, which for some time have been dividing the Poles there, have been settled, God grant, forever. All of the Polish Catholic societies have returned to complete harmony with the parish, and yesterday this reunion was celebrated during the consecration of the banners of three societies: Sacred Heart of Mary, Holy Name of Jesus, and St. Dominick's Mutual Aid.</p>
   <p>All of St. Adalbert's parish was beautifully decorated with banners and flowers. A colorful procession issued from Pulaski Hall, especially decorated for the occasion, at about one o'clock in the afternoon. The precession was led by the Krakus Society, followed by the Knights of St. Casimir and the Falcons. These were followed by the "Polish Group," the Polish Commerce and Tradesmen's Association, and other parish societies. Behind these marched the three societies with their new banners, youth societies, and delegates from the societies of other parishes. Finally, bringing up the rear, a <pb facs="5423968_10_1072.jpg" n="2"/>great number of beautifully decorated carriages. It was a magnificent spectacle. Bands played, banners waved, and the national colors glistened in the sun. The procession marched in a great circle, and returned to the church.</p>
   <p>With the church filled to overflowing the memorable ceremony began at three o'clock in the afternoon. Solemn vespers were celebrated by the Reverend John <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, who also <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> the banners. The Reverend Eugene <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish, delivered a beautiful sermon, appropriate to the occasion. Expanding upon the words In hoc eight vinces, he urged his listeners to....persevere in their faith and in their nationalistic work. He explained the significance of the hearts of Jesus and Mary as symbols. Finally, he insisted upon the necessity of harmony and co-operation. The congregation was deeply affected by the sermon and by the whole ceremony. Besides the priests of the parish and Father Siedlaczek, the Reverend John <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>, of St. Stanislaus Kostka parish, was also present, To close this auspicious occasion, the orchestra played Polish <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> hymns.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1073.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The three banners, designed and executed at Mrs. Slominski's establishment at a cost of thirteen hundred dollars, are very beautiful. The banner of the Sacred Heart of Mary Society is green and has on one side the Adoration of the Sacred Heart of Mary, and the name and date of organization of the society; on the other side is a picture of the Virgin of Czestochowa, with the words, "Holy Virgin of Czestochowa, Queen of the Polish Crown, pray for us!"</p>
   <p>The two other banners are red. The Holy Name of Jesus Society's banner has on one side the Infant Jesus and the name and date of organization of the society; on the other side it has a small picture of the Virgin of Czestochowa and the words, W Bogu ufam, W Bogu umieram (I trust in God, I die in God). The third banner, that of the St. Dominick's Mutual Aid Brotherhood, depicts St. Dominick and St. Vincent De Paul. Besides the usual inscriptions (name and date of organization of the Society) are the words: "St. Vincent De Paul, pray for us."</p>
