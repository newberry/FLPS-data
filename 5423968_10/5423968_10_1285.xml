   <p>Not long ago Father Vincent Barzynski, the pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish in Chicago, was supposed to express himself in the presence of his acquaintances in the following manner: "What shall I do? They want to make me famous."</p>
   <p>Whether or not Father V. Barzynski's merits have already made him famous among the Poles in America is only his affair, and we have no intention of questioning him about it, for we trust that in the end, time will show all his good and bad deeds in a true light. However, we are sure of a fact: his enemies, the supporters of the faction that opposes the Polish Roman Catholic Union, are to be thanked for spreading his fame.</p>
   <p>Supported by this undeniable fact, we take the liberty of using, or perhaps <pb facs="5423968_10_1286.jpg" n="2"/>misusing, Father V. Barzynski's name in this article, for which we wish to apologize to this patriotic priest, so much more as it is not on his account but on somebody else's (perhaps to some extent on our own) that we intend to cut down some of this unwelcome popularity.</p>
   <p>Looking impartially at the bitter conflict between the Polish Roman Catholic Union and the Polish National Alliance, leaving out disreputable questions, and disregarding who is right or wrong, the reader of this fight with the press cannot but notice this: When the Polish Roman Catholic Union makes any charges against the Polish National Alliance or any other organization, group, or individual friendly to or independent of that organization, it always refers directly to the Polish National Alliance as an association composed of many persons and with a constitution; it treats an association as an association and an individual as an individual.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1287.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But, on the other hand, if the Polish National Alliance, or any other organization opposing the Polish Roman Catholic Union, has any objections against the Union, instead of aiming its attacks directly at this organization it aims them at Father V. Barzynski. Any pretext, be it a resolution adopted by any church, society or organization not even connected with the church, is sufficient cause to bring forth an onslaught of insults against Father Barzynski. Even when any individual makes a statement disagreeable to this faction, regardless of whether or not he or she is friendly to or shares the views of Father Barzynski, instead of refuting the party responsible, the cry is that he or she is a "tool" of Father V. Barzynski, following this statement with as many insulting remarks as they can concoct. This is how Father V. Barzynski's fame has spread.</p>
   <p>In the opinion of these persons, only two things are possible for the Poles living here: Either they accept their views blindly, no matter how ridiculous they may be, or else become a tool of Father V. Barzynski. In their <pb facs="5423968_10_1288.jpg" n="4"/>opinion, there is only the Polish National Alliance and its allies on one side, and Father V. Barzynski on the other. In their eyes it is impossible for any one to disagree with them unless he or she is a blind tool of the father. In other words, the opinion of others is zero as a mathematical exponent, unless it be expanded by Father V. Barzynski. Under these circumstances it is quite natural that a respectable newspaper opposed to their views and, still worse, opposed to the unjust attacks directed against the father, be considered by them Father Barzynski's organ.</p>
   <p>Is this the right thing to do? Is it decent to accuse every one of having no convictions of his own, of not knowing anything, of not understanding anything, of being nothing but a zero, a pawn in the hands of a clever person?</p>
   <p>What would the supporters of the Polish National Alliance say if during a controversy <pb facs="5423968_10_1289.jpg" n="5"/>all of them and each of them were ignored and called simply the tools of Mr. Frank Gryglaszewski? And what would they say if all attacks were directed only at him?</p>
   <p>They would be indignant, of course; they would say immediately that not Mr. Frank Gryglaszewski but the people rule. Then such acknowledgment on the part of the opponents would be justified and would greatly simplify the fight, because in that case it would be only necessary to state that the tools of the persons who do not bring up their children to be Polish patriots, or the tools of the individuals who belong to non-Catholic associations, have no right to proclaim that they have the welfare of their fatherland at heart.</p>
   <p>It makes us laugh when we read in Zgoda a reply of Father Mozejewski to an article written by the editor in the last issue of Wiara I Ojczyzna. "I recognize the style of writing and I know that it was written by Father V. <pb facs="5423968_10_1290.jpg" n="6"/>Barzynski and to him I shall reply." And this pious priest is not afraid to defile himself with such a lie! If Father Mozejewski will not recall this statement in his reply, then we cannot comprehend how his conscience permits him to sleep.</p>
   <p>It is a fact that Dziennik Chicagoski has already been proclaimed as the organ of Father V. Barzynski; its editor and his co-workers as blind tools and enemies of the Polish National Alliance, even though our paper has never attacked the Alliance, with the exception of this article, which is just to express the fact that it does not agree with the opinion of these organizations. If we ever objected to their insinuations, our objections met with the old wornout reply, "That's an old story." If it is, let it be so. If Zgoda continues its attacks on Father V. Barzynski, and refers to others as his "tools," then we will reciprocate by aiming a few darts at His Censorial Highness (the censor of the Alliance) in our future argumentations, and no <pb facs="5423968_10_1291.jpg" n="7"/>one can blame us for that. It would be foolish to defend ourselves with a fancy sword if we are attacked with a heavy saber.</p>
   <p>If it is your desire that individuals should face each other instead of the public, we will grant you that privilege. The future will tell which of us will compare with St. Michael.</p>
