   <pb facs="5423968_10_1534.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Stanislaus Kostka Parish Polish Dramatic Club do not waste time at their meetings and that while amusing themselves they acquire education. Besides it should be emphasized that in spite of the fact that this was the first meeting after their vacation and that the time to prepare the program had been very short, the members of the club did their work excellently.</p>
   <p>We are proud of what we saw yesterday, and we wish that all dramatic clubs and youth societies would follow the example given by this club, whose members spend their winter evenings pleasantly and profitably.</p>
   <p>At last nights meeting it was decided to hold such meetings every second Monday. On a motion by S. Zahajkiewicz, the club also decided to participate next Thursday in the Saint John Cantius Parish bazaar.</p>
