<title level="a">MAX KUCHARCZYK WRITES ABOUT THE FINANCIAL COST OF THE NEW ST. JOSEPH CHURCH BUILDING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Max Kucharczyk, organist of St. Joseph Church, Town of Lake, has sent a letter to the Illinois Staats-Zeitung to clear up the misunderstandings in St. Joseph Parish. This letter appears in today's edition.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kucharczyk, in view of the publication of yesterday's article, "Discord in St. Joseph Parish", has requested Dziennik Chicagoski to publish his letter, also.</p>
   <p>The letter reads as follows:</p>
   <p>"Chicago, August 26, 1895.</p>
   <p>"In regard to your article about the discord in St. Joseph Parish, I wish to state that the root of the evil is the jealousy of certain contractors who lost out on bids for the contruction work on the new church building. They <pb facs="5423968_10_0795.jpg" n="2"/>lost out on this work because their bids were too high. As to the leader of this disturbance, his bid was rejected on the grounds that his previous work was unsatisfactory. A building he put up adjoining the rectory seven years ago sank three inches because of an error in construction.</p>
   <p>"I am definitely against the assertions that a majority of the parishioners are opposed to the present pastor, Reverend M. Pyplatz. The discontented do not number more than fifteen and these have never been considered parishioners because they have never fulfilled their duties to the church.</p>
   <p>"In respect to the cost of erection of the new church building, the contract was given to a contractor who gave the lowest bid. An agreement was signed and the cost of the new structure will not be more than $21,900. But the interior decoration, such as pews and altars, and repairs on the school building, and bells for the church, will amount to not more than $4,000, making the total cost about $86,000.</p>
   <p>"The parishioners have been kept informed about these details, so it is strange <pb facs="5423968_10_0796.jpg" n="3"/>that certain persons should start a rumor circulating that the work on the new church will cost $45,000. This agitation, however, thank God, did not create any dissention among the parishioners.</p>
   <p>"Neither is it true that a majority of the parishioners have demanded an accounting of the parish books and my resignation. The parishioners have received a financial statement each year and will receive one this year also.</p>
   <p>"I have never heard from anyone that any of the parishioners were dissatisfied with me or that they have demanded my removal. Reverend Pyplatz has not heard of any such rumor either. I would be the first one to ask to be released from my duties if the parishioners should desire my dismissal, especially if this would avoid dissention.</p>
   <p>"It is also untrue that Reverend Pyplatz threatened the dissenters with exclusion from the church with full punishment according to the laws of the Roman <pb facs="5423968_10_0797.jpg" n="4"/>Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>Max Kucharczyk,</p>
   <p>Organist of St. Joseph Church,</p>
   <p>4812 South Paulina Street"</p>
   <p>We are of the opinion that Mr. Kucharczyk's letter, if it agrees with the facts, clarifies and closes the whole matter. God will see to it that no trouble will crop up in this parish, for in truth there is no cause for any trouble.</p>
