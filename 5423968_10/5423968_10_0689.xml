   <p>This morning the Reverend John Obyrtacz, C. R., who was recently ordained by Archbishop Feehan, celebrated his first Mass at the St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish. The services began at 9:30 A. M. The new priest was assisted by the Reverend Andrew Spetz, who acted as archdeacon, and the Reverend John Kruszynski, who served as deacon, and the Reverend Vincent Rapacz, who assisted as subdeacon.</p>
   <p>The master of ceremonies was the Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek, C. R. He also sang a solo "O Salutaris Hostia," accompanied by the parish choir.</p>
   <p>A fiery and impressive sermon was delivered by the Reverend Adolph Nowicki, pastor of St. Michael Parish of South Chicago. The theme was: "The Cross of Suffering". He stated that there is salvation in the Cross. He spoke with a deep, serious voice and in conclusion paid tribute to the new priest.</p>

   <p>Among the guest priests were the Reverends John Kasprzycki, John Radziejewski, Paul Rhode, Casimir Truszczynski, J. Gieburowski, and all resident priests of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish.</p>
   <p>Besides blessing the above priests, the Reverend Obyrtacz also blessed the Sisters of Notre Dame and all their present candidates, the Sisters of Nazareth and their candidates, and all those present at the ceremonies.</p>
   <p>The church was filled to capacity. All the school girls of the Sisters of Notre Dame School were dressed in white. The altars were beautifully decorated with fresh flowers.</p>
   <p>The new priest celebrated his first Mass in rich vestments which were donated to him by the Polish Women's Society. The silver chalice was contributed by the Young Ladies' Sodality and the missal by the Women's Sodality.</p>
