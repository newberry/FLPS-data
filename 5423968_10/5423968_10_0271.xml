   <p>In the Polish Courier, dated October 2, we noticed three columns of correspondence signed by J. M. S., in which he writes about the parishioners' uprising and attacks Rev. Father Kopytkiewicz.</p>
   <p>We are not surprised at the correspondent because in this neighborhood the Independent Catholics were in a rage, and I think are still in a rage, We are almost certain that this correspondent is a member of this independent group of Catholics working against the Rev. Father Kopytkiewicz, a true Roman-Catholic priest.</p>
   <p>We are not surprised that the Polish Courier, which usually deals in and publish important news items, should find enough space in their paper for this article. But we know that any sensational news that will stir up trouble is considered good news, especially when it is about priests.</p>
   <p>We cannot refrain from expressing our indignation to the correspondent and <pb facs="5423968_10_0272.jpg" n="2"/>the Polish Courier, which published this article. This whole correspondence is evidently so strained and spiteful that we could not resist calling the Polish Courier's attention to it.</p>
   <p>The correspondent started his article this way: "In the year 1902 Rev. Father M. F. Kopytkiewicz arrived and was made the Most Reverend Father of a Polish Catholic parish. He was always under close observation. Although his records are clean, we will have to check them to be positive."</p>
   <p>He is well behaved and is loved. He has a good record at this new parish because he started the movement for a new church and succeeded in raising funds to bring this dream to reality. Surely, this correspondent must be 'green' if he has never heard of Rev. Father Kopytkiewicz. But the Polish Courier surely must have heard of Father Kopytkiewicz. Still they allowed an article like this to be printed. You have printed good articles about Father Kopytkiewicz in the past, but this article, from the first to the last line, is a mass of groaning and slanderous lies. This correspondent knew where to send his scribbling; it is best to throw dirt in a dirty writer's face.</p>
