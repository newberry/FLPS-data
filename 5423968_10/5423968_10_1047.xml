   <p>The Blessing Of The Lower Church Of The St. John Cantius Parish on Carpenter Street took place in a beautiful and glorious ceremony on Sunday, December 24.</p>
   <p>Great crowds gathered to celebrate this momentous occasion, which originally was to be very simple.</p>
   <p>Archibishop Feehan arrived at three o'clock in the afternoon, surrounded by Polish mounted troops, which made a splendid showing. The crowd was very large. Not only was the church overcrowded, but three times as many people waited outside. After the ceremony of blessing the church, the Archbishop assisted at the Vesper services and bestowed his blessing on the multitude, after which he spoke to the Poles in a very sincere manner.</p>
   <p>The church had been beautifully decorated in green fern and flowers by the <pb facs="5423968_10_1048.jpg" n="2"/>venerable Sisters of Notre Dame, assisted by the Rosary girls.</p>
   <p>Exceptionally touching was the view of the beautiful picture of the Blessed Mary of Czestochowa, placed on the center altar and decorated with flowers. This picture is very dear to the heart of every Pole. On one side of this picture was the statue of St. Peter, and on the other, the statue of St. Paul. The wonderful statue of St. Veronica on one of the side altars also attracted considerable attention. All of these statues were purchased at the World's Fair in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The faithful visited the church all day in great numbers and one of the military societies of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish stood guard during High Mass.</p>
