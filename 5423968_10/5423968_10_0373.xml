   <p>An appeal for the support of a new parish was made to the St. Casimir Society of St. Casimir's parish recently; however, the members have not heard of such plans, nor do they wish to hear of them. The request was unanimously rejected on the ground that the committee is not fit to organize a parish, for we are fully aware as true Catholics that Jesus Christ gave the power to his Apostles, that is, to St. Peter, and stated that the gates of hell would not overwhelm his Church. Therefore neither the Muscovites nor the American schismatics have anything in common with us, the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>It is hoped that if this group still has an iota of faith left, it will return to the true fold and accept the doctrines of the Church and the authority of Pope Leo XIII; and that it will recognize the Bishop and the pastor. If they do not wish to be condemned forever, it is suggested that they do not mock the names of the Miraculous Virgin of Czestochowa and the Saints.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0374.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We will come to their help with prayer to God, beseeching Him that He may lead them back to the road of righteousness and show them the true light. No other assistance will be given.</p>
   <p>In the name of the St. Casimir Society,</p>
   <p>Max Adamowicz, recording secretary</p>
   <p>Paul Pawlowski, president</p>
