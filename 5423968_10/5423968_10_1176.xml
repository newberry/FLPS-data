   <p>Yesterday marked the fiftieth anniversary of the origin of the Order of the Resurrection Fathers. In accordance with recent announcements, a special celebration was held yesterday at St. Stanislaus Kostka Church in honor of the occasion. Although it was a regular working day, a large number of workers took the afternoon off in order to participate. This noble gesture on the part of the working class was only one example of the high regard held for this original Polish monastic order.</p>
   <p>The large attendance at the ten o'clock mass was unexpected. Only a regular pulpit announcement was made last Sunday, yet all the available space in the <pb facs="5423968_10_1177.jpg" n="2"/>church was occupied. The center pews were filled with uniformed representatives of Polish societies. Two of the outstanding Polish societies, Knights of the Blessed Virgin, accompanied by cadets, and the Virgin Mary Sodality, were in full regalia. An orchestra, composed of local talent, added color to the strains of the church organ.</p>
   <p>In the morning, the six o'clock bells from the belfry of St. Stanislaus' Church joyously announced the dawn of the jubilee festivities. Soon after a number of priests, friends of the Order of the Resurrection Fathers, came out to say mass. All the masses, both low and solemn, were offered to God, in honor of the Order, to continue His blessings. Reverend Father M. Matkowski, pastor from Bay City and an old friend of the Order, officiated at the children's mass at eight o'clock. At ten o'clock he presided at a solemn high mass, assisted by Fathers Gordon, Bernard, and the Right Reverend Simon Kobrzynski.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1178.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The orchestra, headed by the Nowicki brothers; the church organ, played by A. Kwasigroch; and the mixed choir thrilled the audience with their melodies during the services. Solos were sung by Misses Frances Kwasigroch, Antonia Olejniczak, and Josephine Kwasigroch. Solos were sung also be Andrew Stachowicz, John Kondziorski,noted bass, Walter Dabek, and many others.</p>
   <p>After the services, the visiting priests and the members of the Order were escorted by the societies about the grounds, while the orchestra played serenades from national songs at the foot of the rectory. After this, the officers of the societies, headed by Peter Kiolbassa, City Treasurer, assembled at the school hall to pay their respects to the members of the monastic order. At the reception, Mr. Kiolbassa, one of the oldest members of the parish and one of its founders, gave a tributary speech, giving special emphasis to the accomplishments of this true Polish order. He thanked them in the name of the parishioners for their work, for their guidance, and for their holy fruits, of which the largest parish in the city of Chicago can be justly proud.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1179.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Rt. Rev. Simon, assistant of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, his eyes flooded with tears, gave thanks for this recognition of the work of the Order. He stated that it was this kind of support that has enabled the growth of this monastic organization. "It is the kind of support that will make possible the expansion and the endeavors of this order," he concluded.</p>
   <p>Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, voiced his opinion on the rostrum. With great acclaim he extended his appreciation to those present and stated that as long as the parish continues to have such splendid supporters, the fate and the work of the missionaries are assured. At the conclusion of the reception, Father Barzynski thanked all those present for their fine representation on this memorable day and occasion. As the officers of the societies departed, Peter Kiolbassa and P. Lubienski were invited for dinner.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1180.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Besides the local priests, the following visitors were present: Father M. Matkowski, of Bay City; Father Koblinski, of Hammond; Father K. Domogalski, editor of Wiara I Ojczyzna (Faith and Nationality); Father Swiegurski and Father Joseph Barzynski, of St. Hedwig's; Father Pyplatz, of South Chicago; and many others.</p>
   <p>At the close of the dinner Father K. Domogalski, editor of the Dziennik Chicagoski, and Wiara I Ojczyzna, pointed out in his speech the importance of this moment to the Order as well as to Poland, for this is the first organization of its kind that has marked its fiftieth anniversary. Its work in the fields of religion, teaching, and patriotism is something not to be overlooked. The remainder of his talk was devoted to the innumerable accomplishments of the Resurrection Fathers.</p>
   <p>Rev. Vincent Barzynski reiterated his former address. City Treasurer Kiolbassa related the history of the parish. W. O. Halter, C. R., a German-Canadian, told in German of the early founders of this Order and of the two members who later came to America to expound their teachings.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1181.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>This dinner could have easily been called international for other speakers spoke in their native tongues, such as German, Polish, French, and Lithuanian. Peter Kiolbassa closed the dinner by speaking in English.</p>
   <p>Conversation was continued long after the dinner.</p>
   <p>This day will not only be remembered by the Order of Resurrection Fathers, but by the Polish people as a whole. The work of this Order will be remembered for many years.</p>
