   <p>In Tuesday's edition of your paper you published a long article about the St. Josephat Parish and about Reverend Lange. If you are so smart and can talk about our debts, which do not exist, will you then please explain the following three points:</p>
   <p>1. Please explain in what way Reverend Lange is a liar. Knowing him in this parish for six years, we know well that he has never lied to anybody, and the St. Josephat parish has full confidence in him, and he in his parishioners.</p>
   <p>2. When and where did Reverend Lange ever cheat anybody?</p>
   <p>3. How is Reverend Lange a criminal? In the category of criminals I include burglars, thieves, people who swear falsely, and others like that. Now show <pb facs="5423968_10_0579.jpg" n="2"/>me, gentlemen, anybody whom Reverend Lange defrauded or injured in any manner whatsoever.</p>
   <p>Finally, I ask you: Where, and to what bank, is the St. Josephat Church indebted for the sum of twenty-nine thousand dollars?</p>
   <p>Your Dziennik Polski, which smells of tar and sulphur, will not get far with much lies and falsehoods. If these infamous lies are not retracted within a very short time, you will get acquainted with the "Kaszubs" (Poles from Pomerania); heretofore you have not known them. They will talk to you in a different manner.</p>
   <p>One of the St. Josephat parishioners.</p>
