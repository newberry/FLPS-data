   <p>It was decided at yesterday's meeting of the St. Stanislaus [Youth] Society that a ten-cent fine would be paid by each member for every absence from meetings, unless the absence was unavoidable.</p>
   <p>After the regular business of the meeting had been disposed of, Ignatius Bogucki gave reports on several books he had read. Following him, Stephen Kwiatkowski gave an excellent book report, earning thereby the praise of the president and the applause of the members. Paul Blaszkowski's recitation of a poem was also good.</p>
   <p>The Society's president next addressed the meeting, explaining the manner in which Polish books ought to be read in order that the reader should gain the utmost good from them. He encouraged the members to write down passages from the books they read in order that these could be repeated at meetings.</p>
   <p>Although the Society has existed for only three months, a check proved that only <pb facs="5423968_10_1553.jpg" n="2"/>three members have as yet failed to make use of the parish library. All others have been reading zealously, learning poems and acquainting themselves with Polish history.</p>
   <p>Every young man [of Polish descent] ought to belong to some such organization.</p>
