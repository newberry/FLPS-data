  <body>
   <p>After President Wilson's declaration of war on Germany, the Government summened to the ranks of the army young men of this country to fight on the blood-soaked fields of France for the ideals of democracy and liberty.</p>
   <p>In this great army we found three hundred thousand boys of Polish descent who showed in action, and not in speech, the quality of their patriotism. They left with a song of victory upon their lips; following them to the battle front was the sincere, hearty, and at times sorrowful farewell of their dear ones. They went to fight for the Star-Spangled Banner, and for their country, which was in need of their services. The young Poles, who were the flower of a brave and patriotic nation, went into battle confident of victory and of a triumphant return home.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1330.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Just as any of the other three hundred thousand Polish patriots, Michael Ellis joined the ranks of this army and sailed to France. There his acts of bravery, his utter disregard of danger, and his power of orientation during the most critical moments of battle deserve to rank with the immortal deeds inscribed on the pages of American history.</p>
   <p>Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, in articles appearing in the San Francisco Examiner, has written about this outstanding and brave Polish-American soldier, Sergeant Michael Ellis. Ellis was in the First Division, which consisted of regiments of the regular army, the 16th, 18th, 26th and 28th Infantry, and the 5th, 6th, and 7th Field Artillery. The organization and formation of the First Division was begun only in July [of 1917], but as early as December this unit was on the Western Front. In March of the following year the First Division found itself in the front line of battle.</p>
   <p>The Germans had concentrated their power at Montdidier. They were encountered there by the 28th Infantry, to which Michael Ellis had been assigned. In the <pb facs="5423968_10_1331.jpg" n="3"/>battle which ensued Ellis first displayed his courage, bravery, and efficiency in line of battle.</p>
   <p>But it was not until July that a definite proof of this valor was established. The First American Division, accompanied by French and English units, had pushed its way far into the German front. Ellis found himself near Saint-Mihiel, where he was assigned to the reserves, to be thrown into action wherever the need might arise. Orders were issued for the 18th Infantry and Ellis' regiment, the 28th, to assault Montrefagne Hill [sic].</p>
   <p>Ellis went forward with his company. Time after time, as they came out of clumps of bushes, they were met by the swishing hall of a machine gun. Those in advance fell, some dropping in their tracks, some throwing up their arms and staggering to and fro before finally crumpling down. A combat patrol was formed, with Corporal Galvas in command; Ellis was one of this group. The immediate objective was one of the guns on the right <pb facs="5423968_10_1332.jpg" n="4"/>that was sweeping the terrain over which the company must pass.</p>
   <p>On their bellies the men wormed their way forward, over mud, dead leaves and twigs. Corporal Galvas felt his leg touched; he turned. It was Ellis.</p>
   <p>"Say, Corporal, you fellows stay right here; let me go ahead alone to try for the gun."</p>
   <p>Galvas agreed. Ellis crawled to the right and gradually worked around the flank. He could now see both the machine gunner and his helper. Carefully he aimed at the gunner. The Springfield crashed, and the German pitched forward on his gun. For an instant the helper stood bewildered. Again the rifle crashed, and he dropped beside his comrade. Turning on the rifle squad behind, Ellis called on them to surrender. Believing that they mare covered by a large detachment of Americans, they threw down their arms. Twice more Ellis attacked the machine gun emplacements. Twice more he killed some of the Germans and captured the rest. Single-handed Ellis took ten machine guns and <pb facs="5423968_10_1333.jpg" n="5"/>more than sixty prisoners. For this bravery Private Ellis was made a sergeant, and was awarded the Medal of Honor.</p>
   <p>For several years after the war, Ellis was a Post Office clerk in St. Louis, later being transferred to Chicago. He is a member of the Polish-American Veterans Alliance.</p>
   <p>In 1879 Anthony Eliasz and his wife came to this country from Denzig. The Eliaszes settled in St. Louis. Anthony got work as a laborer and changed his name to Ellis, in order to make it pronounceable by the average American. In 1891 a boy was born whom they named Michael. The strain of childbirth was too much for Michael's mother, and she died shortly afterward.</p>
   <p>Early in February, 1912, a young fellow came to Fort Jefferson Barracks to enlist. With him was his father. The boy was Michael Ellis, and he was starting his career in the regular army. For nearly three years Michael <pb facs="5423968_10_1334.jpg" n="6"/>served with the 7th Infantry. He was discharged early in 1817, only to re-enlist six months later and join Company C of the 28th Infantry.</p>
   <p>Upon his transfer to the Chicago Post Office he visited the editorial rooms of Dziennik Zjednoczenia, and by request left his photograph and an article written by Colonel Roosevelt. Also, in true soldier fashion, he spoke of the importance of the American victory in the war in relation to the independence of Poland, and with great pride displayed the Medal of Honor with which he had been decorated by General John Pershing.</p>
