  <body>
   <p>Dear parishioners, beloved brothers and sisters in Christ:</p>
   <p>By the express recommendation of my physician, and through the permission of the local Bishop, and with the help of a number of leading parishioners, I have decided to make a change of residence for a few months. It has been suggested that I leave the Chicago climate behind and recuperate in the sunny clime of California. To safeguard my health I have chosen to stay at Los Angeles, California, until my condition improves.</p>
   <p>I do not wish to make this change without informing you about it, and saying good-by. Since my health does not permit me to speak to you in person, I am compelled to use the medium of the printed word.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0707.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Therefore, my dear and beloved parishioners, you all know that we are always to abide by the will of God--and to do so willingly and sincerely. I judge that not one member of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish will be angry with me because I am to leave for the first time in twenty years, to go to another part of America for the purpose of regaining my health and strength after so many years of hardship.</p>
   <p>At any rate, there are a number of old and young priests at St. Stanislaus Kostka Church who are capable of executing all of the duties and services in this parish. As long as you will place trust in them there will be no lack of spiritual help. Then, too, I am not leaving you for long, nor am I going far across the ocean. Although it is far, I will feel for you--and will not stop praying for all of you.</p>
   <p>As to the management of the parish, especially since Advent is approaching, <pb facs="5423968_10_0708.jpg" n="3"/>nightly meetings will be held by the parishioners, who will make arrange ments and come to a mutual agreement with the parish committee.</p>
   <p>The chairman of these sessions, as my substitute, will be the Reverend Eugene Siedlaczek [also Sedlaczek], C. R.</p>
   <p>At these meetings everyone will receive a copy of the financial report and a copy of the transactions of the parish. Remember to attend these meetings when you are called, and bring along your parish book. Those who have not obtained a parish book as yet are requested to do so at their earliest convenience. At these meetings you will be informed about the procedure used in the management of the parish. As soon as God permits me to regain my health I will return and take over my former duties. On my return all will be relieved of their work and a new parish committee will be chosen.</p>
   <p>You all know, dear brothers, in what kind of times we are living. The <pb facs="5423968_10_0709.jpg" n="4"/>number of godless people is continually increasing. Drunkeness, divorce, family desertion, blasphemy, etc., are increasing to alarming proportions among the Poles of America. The cause of all this to a large extent falls upon the writings in the loathsome papers which tend to poison the hearts of week-minded persons, and first of all the hearts of the youth. Upon such foundations the devil builds independent temples [churches not connected with the pope] and makes those who have been excommunicated his dignitaries. These individuals then garner all the evil into one sacrilegious flock in order that not one may escape the claws of the devil.</p>
   <p>Because of these circumstances I wish to warn you, my dear brothers and sisters in Christ, against coming in contact with such persons, and to advise you to keep a more careful eye on your children. Precautions should also be taken against reading godless literature, for he who swallows this poison becomes lost forever.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0710.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>All kinds of schism, history shows, becomes established on lies; it thrives on these poisons. These lies are spread as decayed matter is spread by bugs.</p>
   <p>Only the truth of the Lord lasts forever," and in it life and salvation!</p>
   <p>The various forms of schism sin against the Holy Spirit. They not only contradict the recognized Christian truths but at the same time kill in the individual's heart the love for man and God. You all know that sins against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven in this world nor in the next. That is why all schismatics become lost without penance.</p>
   <p>Therefore, you, my most beloved, who have continued for the past twenty-five years as righteous members of the Roman Catholic faith at St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish in Chicago, and have withstood all kinds of storms and <pb facs="5423968_10_0711.jpg" n="6"/>agitations, and held the banner of Christ upright, should, in this day of scandal, lift your hearts toward the love of the Roman Catholic Church, so that the enemies of the truth may recognize the strength of God's will through your firm determination and demonstration.</p>
   <p>Our brotherhoods and arch-brotherhoods, made up of Polish men and women, young men and young ladies, represent the head of St. Stanislaus Kostka Parish, while our societies, imbued with the indomitable spirit of our forefathers, represent the body and arms which guard the Roman Catholic faith. I trust that your prayers will withstand the contumaciousness and blindness of our erring compatriots and help them to see the true light and become reunited in the Roman Catholic religion.</p>
   <p>And now, dear brothers and faithful sisters, keeping you in mind in my prayers to God for my recovery and your patience, I anticipate and trust <pb facs="5423968_10_0712.jpg" n="7"/>that I will return to you in good health and strength and ready for further work.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, I wish to bless you, my beloved, and until my happy return I leave you in the protection of the Blessed Virgin, and conclude with an old Polish saying, "Remain with God."</p>
   <p>Reverend Vincent Barzynski, C. R., pastor</p>
   <p>of St. Stanislaus Kostka Church.</p>
