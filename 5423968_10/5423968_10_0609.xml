  <body>
   <p>We have received the following correspondence with a request that we publish it in the Dziennik Chicagoski:</p>
   <p>The agitation for calling a Polish Catholic Congress in America is interesting many persons and groups. Everybody will agree as to the necessity of, and benefits to be derived from, such a Congress; everybody is willing to participate in the Congress. Much is said and written about it, but it is progressing very slowly from a practical viewpoint. To date, as far as I know, no effort has been made to call the Congress.</p>
   <p>As I understand it, nobody wishes to do so, chiefly because he does not wish to be the first one. And yet, the ice must be broken, and the first step must be taken. Without a beginning, there can be no further action, and no <pb facs="5423968_10_0610.jpg" n="2"/>accomplished work. This is only natural.</p>
   <p>I propose, therefore, to the reverend priests and to all Polish Catholics in America the following method of tackling the problem:</p>
   <p>1) First of all there must be a preliminary conference to decide on the program, the place, time, and composition of the proposed Polish Catholic Congress.</p>
   <p>2) This conference should be held in any one of the three cities most centrally situated among the Polish communities in America: Buffalo, Cleveland, or Detroit.</p>
   <p>3) It should take place not later than April of this year, after Easter.</p>
   <p>4) The conference should be attended by representatives of Polish settlements from New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Nanticoke, Buffalo, Cleveland, <pb facs="5423968_10_0611.jpg" n="3"/>Pittsburg, Toledo, Detroit, Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul--in fact, from all settlements that can be represented--at the rate of one delegate (either clergyman or layman) from each community.</p>
   <p>5) The delegates should be selected by the local clergy of each individual city.</p>
   <p>Such a conference would have the authority to:</p>
   <p>1) Determine the place and time of the Polish Catholic Congress.</p>
   <p>2) Outline the purposes definitely.</p>
   <p>3) Define the composition of the Congress, and the manner in which delegates to it are to be elected.</p>
   <p>4) Select a central executive committee (preferably from the city where <pb facs="5423968_10_0612.jpg" n="4"/>the Congress is to be held) to publish suitable appeals, actual summons to the Congress, etc.</p>
   <p>5) Authorize the delegates of the various communities to organize local executive committees in their respective cities.</p>
   <p>6) Select a special committee to prepare a definite program for discussion at the Congress.</p>
   <p>By this method of calling the Congress together and deciding on the above suggestions, we will be able to begin working.</p>
   <p>How to call such an advance conference together is the question which will be asked by every reader of this article.</p>
   <p>Here is my solution: Let every pastor of a Polish church in America interested <pb facs="5423968_10_0613.jpg" n="5"/>in this important cause, and every society or organization that has already signified willingness to participate in the Congress, prepare the following statement (even on a plain postal card)!</p>
   <p>"I agree (or we agree) to the calling of an advance conference concerning the Polish Catholic Congress in America in the city...........(here mention one of the three cities suggested above, or some other place), on..........(mention the date in April, or another time), with the understanding that every Polish colony (city) will send one (or more) delegates to this conference. The conference is to be authorized to consider............(mention the points proposed herewith in this article, or mention any other points).</p>
   <p>"Date............Signed............"</p>
   <p>Let everyone send one of these forms, properly filled out and signed, to one of the following three Polish priests: Most Reverend Pitass, Buffalo; <pb facs="5423968_10_0614.jpg" n="6"/>Reverend J. Radziejewski, Chicago; or Reverend Major, St. Paul, Minnesota.</p>
   <p>Of course, these forms must be sent within a specified time limit, perhaps before March 25 of this year.</p>
   <p>After receiving these forms, the three priests mentioned above will consult with one another, will count the votes, and will publish the time and the place, the composition, and the scope of discussion of the advance conference, according to the expressed opinion of the majority, and to the best of their understanding.</p>
   <p>In this manner, the work will be begun, and it will then proceed in a proper manner for the benefit and good of everybody.</p>
   <p>I have considered this matter at length, and feel that we will never realize our aim in any other way.</p>
   <p>Without any further comments, I submit this for your consideration. All newspapers favorably inclined toward this proposal are cordially requested to <pb facs="5423968_10_0615.jpg" n="7"/>reprint my article, and to pass judgment on it.</p>
   <p>Reverend Eugene Sedlaczek,</p>
   <p>Congregation of the Resurrection Fathers.</p>
