   <p>My dear Bicz Bozy:</p>
   <p>I read you regularly every week together with my "cassocker" since the first day you appeared into this world and must admit that I like you so much that I could not live without you.</p>
   <p>What a delight you are to us 'spiritual vessels' (priest housekeepers), "priest nieces," and "sisters of mercy," describing in a true light our pious and full of sacrifice lives, devoted to God, not like those 'paw lickers' (those who kiss priest's hand), from our ignorance, spreaders, so called half progressives who always sing us hymns of praise but lie like anything, describing our pious lives.</p>
   <p>I hope that a goose kicks those scribblers. Let only one of them take a <pb facs="5423968_10_0148.jpg" n="2"/>cassock and find himself amongst our spiritual midst and I assure you that he would see everything upside down. But what can you expect from the paw lickers, they are afraid to lose their grub. Isn't that so?</p>
   <p>Honor to you, Bicz Bozy, for that. You are the only one who can publish the truth unveiled and I, even if I am a spiritual vessel, must admit that I like the truth sometimes. Therefore, for a long time I wanted to write you a letter but I was always prevented. Well, I had to take a trip to the country in the summer; you know why,so I don't have to make any explanations.</p>
   <p>As soon as I was through with the farm and orphanage I returned to the rectory. A few days after, the bishop sent to our parish a young and handsome assistant. How could I even think of writing a letter?</p>
   <p>As soon as I became well acquainted with our assistant, our "cassocker" conceived an idea to conduct a mission for our parish "herd" for they were terribly spoiled by all kinds of unbelievers, and heretics; the <pb facs="5423968_10_0149.jpg" n="3"/>collection got so small that he couldn't squeeze out enough to lay aside one thousand dollars a month for his own savings account.</p>
   <p>That mission lasted six weeks, during which time we squeezed out a few thousand dollars for indulgences, sacraments, pictures, medalions, tickets to the paradise and other holy things. And did I work hard during that mission! Lord have mercy on me. As you know my little whipper, I had to please not only the rector and his assistant but also those four bulls, the missionaries, who tired me out so that I could hardly drag my feet at the end of the mission.</p>
   <p>But thank the Lord, I was well rewarded, for the old cassocker bought me a fur coat, one of the missionaries bought me a diamond necklace, another a ring, the third a few odd things with the exception of our skinny assistant, who did not get anything out of the whole business; he did not buy me anything but let that go, he is still young and handsome. I prefer his wink and still better do I like when he pinches me somewhere than diamonds from those old piggers, the missionaries or old rectors.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0150.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>At last I have some peace now, for the assistant is out somewhere with one of the lady parishioners, to cure himself, and the old rector complains of an ache in his bones, so I made up my mind to write to you, my little whipper, and from now on I will write every week, and I have many interesting things to write. This is enough for today, for I have to go to the old man to give him a rub.</p>
   <p>Your friend,</p>
   <p>Margaret Pullet</p>
   <p>The Priest's Housekeeper.</p>
