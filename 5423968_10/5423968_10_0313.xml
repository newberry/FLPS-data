   <p>With happiness in our heart we are bringing to you the good news that we want you to share with us and help our parish celebrate the silver jubilee of 25th anniversary of its existence.</p>
   <p>This is the 3rd Polish Roman-Catholic church in Chicago that has existed long enough to celebrate its 25th anniversary, we should all be happy and rejoice at this good news.</p>
   <p>To celebrate this great occasion, the committee has invited all Polish societies in Chicago to participate and take active part in this jubilee, to show other nationalities the solidarity of all Poles and their undying love and good will for everything pertaining to us.</p>
   <p>We are happy in our thought that the Polish public will whole-heartedly support us, and take an active part in this great celebration, which will take place Sunday, April 23, 1899, at 1 o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0314.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The real celebration will take place at 7:30 in the evening at the parish hall, where everything will be set in order to make this the greatest silver jubilee ever celebrated by Poles in the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>At this time we are inviting the marshals of different societies to meet at St. Adelbert's hall on Palm Sunday, March 26, at 2 P. M. At this meeting the parade, the program and other affairs will be discussed and settled, so that everything will be in readiness on the day of the celebration, and to acquaint ourselves with each other and work in unity to bring to reality this great undertaking.</p>
   <p>All societies, clubs and organizations will soon be notified by mail not to make any arrangements for dances or bazaars for this day, as it will be harmful to both.</p>
   <p>We are sure that all these organizations will be kind enough to grant us this wish.</p>
   <p>Rev. Father Radziejewski, pastor</p>
