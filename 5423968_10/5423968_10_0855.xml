<title level="a">SPLIT AT ST. HEDWIG PARISH WIDENS</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The split between the parishioners of St. Hedwig Parish was widened considerably yesterday. The unscrupulous, fallen Reverend Anthony Kuzlowski roused a handful of people to revolt, trampled upon the rights of the Church, and led his followers away from the fold of the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>Yesterday a sacriligious consecration of a shed, which was put together in a few days, at Lubek Street, near Hoyne Avenue, pompously called the "Independent Church," or the "Cathedral of All Saints," took place. Afterwards sacriligious services were celebrated in the ritual of the Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>At this "historic" event two or three other charlatans, feigning to be Catholic priests, participated. According to information we have received, these were: Kolaszewski from Cleveland, Kaminski from Omaha, and another hero "Ejusdem Generis" (of the same breed). The latter's name is not given because it has not been confirmed.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0856.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Yesterday's affair clinches the fact that Kozlowski has rebelled against the rights of the church--plain severance from the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
   <p>Kozlowski and his accomplices are now making unheard-of promises: to build a now completely severed church, to bring suits against the old church, etc. God will surely bring their plans to nought.</p>
   <p>The parishioners of St. Hedwig Church were to have held a celebration yesterday. The church was to have been opened to the parishioners, the majority of whom are peaceloving and true to the desires of the Archbishop of Chicago. As soon as the agitators heard about this, they tried by various means to stop this demonstration. In this respect a Polish lawyer, M. Kaczmarek, appeared before the court in the name of Dziewior and others of the opposition group of St. Hedwig Parish, against the Archbishop of Chicago, and requested an order against the opening of the St. Hedwig Church by its respectable parishioners.</p>
   <p>Judge Payne issued a staying order which temporarily restrains the opening of the church. Facts about this order were published in a special 4 P.M. edition <pb facs="5423968_10_0857.jpg" n="3"/>of Dziennik Chicagoski yesterday. Mention of this has been made again for the benefit of the out-of-town subscribers.</p>
   <p>Naturally, in view of Judge Payne's decision, the opening of St. Hedwig Church for its parishioners, who were to hold an ostentatious celebration with solemn services, in which many neighboring church societies were to take part, was postponed.</p>
   <p>The process will be heard in Judge Payne's courtroom during the course of the week. Details of the proceedings will be given as they reach our office. We are stating the main facts in the matter. We only regret that we do not have enough space to cover the details in full. In short we wish to make it known that this split between the Poles of Chicago causes us indescribable pain. The blame for the entire trouble, the condemantion for this terrible step, should fall upon the shoulders of the leaders of this agitation, and upon the shoulders of the fallen priest, Reverend Kozlowski, who has led the people on this road.</p>
   <p>To the blind whom he has duped we wish to declare that the building which has <pb facs="5423968_10_0858.jpg" n="4"/>been erected is not a Catholic Church, that the services and ceremonies in which they take part constitute a sacrilege, and that those who oppose the powers of the church expose themselves to punishment and perpetual condemnation by the church.</p>
   <p>They will claim that this is a free country, that the law permits the existence of various temples of God, even if they are pagan, and that is why the building created by the schismatics will remain and no one will be able to stop the continuation of services; but there is and will be no God, and there will be no salvation under the principles of the Catholic Church. Therefore, all those who are members of Kozlowski's congregation and who wish to call themselves Roman Catholics are mountebanks.</p>
   <p>So much for the schism. As to the decision issued by Judge Payne, staying the opening celebrations of St. Hedwig Church, it was only a temporary injunction that was issued to the party of the opposition, and it undoubtedly will be removed when he hears the story from the other side. According to yesterday's <pb facs="5423968_10_0859.jpg" n="5"/>Tribune, the judge said: "I do not know what precipitated this trouble and I will not know until I hear the story of this case in its entirety." This statement explains the gist of the issuance of the order.</p>
   <p>More will be said after the court proceedings, which will start in the very near future.</p>
