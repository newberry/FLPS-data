<title level="a">THE ALLIANCE OF POLISH FALCONS</title>

   <p>The first idea of organizing an Alliance of Polish Falcons among the Polish immigrants in America was born at a small gathering of friends and warm adherents of Falcons on the seventh day of September, 1893 in the Pulaski Hall, 800 S. Ashland Ave., Chicago, Ill.</p>
   <p>As a result of the above mentioned gathering, a meeting was held on January 7, 1894, by the representatives of the then existing Falcon "nests" in Chicago. The purpose of the meeting was the formal founding of one common organization in order to save the Polish youth from complete adherence to everything American and total neglect of everything Polish. The constitution adopted, with few corrections, was that of the Polish gymnastic Alliance in that part of Poland that was under Austria. Then followed the election of the Central Committee of the Alliance of Polish Falcons with the reservations that the committee is only temporary and can hold office up to the first congress of Falcons, which was going to be called shortly in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1490.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It was agreed to send the copies of the minutes of the meeting to all Falcon nests that were in existence in different Polish communities in America with the suggestion that they join the one common organization, The Alliance of Polish Falcons, as soon as possible. At the same time it was decided to ask the Reverend Polish clergy and eminent Polish citizens for support and help in the spreading of Polish Falcons in America. With this ended the first organizational meeting.</p>
   <p>The biggest credit for the establishment of the Alliance of Polish Falcons must go to "nest" No. 1 of the Polish Falcons which spared no efforts in interesting other "nests" in the praiseworthy endeavors of the Alliance.</p>
   <p>The first congress of the delegates of the nests belonging to the Alliance of Polish Falcons of North America took place in 1895 in Pulaski Hall, Chicago, Ill. Mr. John Smulski presided. The Alliance then numbered four nests: No. I from Chicago, No. II from Chicago, No. VIII from Chicago and No. IV Jersey City. The delegates and the Falcons were present in corpus at the mass in the church of the Holy Trinity which was ordered by the Central Committee of the Alliance for this occasion. At that time the Alliance numbered 150 members.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1491.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The beginnings of the Alliance were extremely difficult, but by perseverance and quiet, but ceaseless efforts of the adherents of Falcons so much was accomplished that to-day this young organization of Polish youth in America shows a great band of fighters for beautiful Falcon ideas, and devoted workers in the national cause. Nearly all Falcons are young people born and reared in America. This is exactly the aim of Falcons, to unite the growing Polish youth under one patriotic banner and save it for Poland.</p>
   <p>In the Falcon nests, the youth is reborn in the Polish spirit, through drills and discipline the love of everything Polish is awakened, the weakened powers are restored and strengthened, Polish children are protected from complete denationalization and hardened for future life's struggles. This exactly, is the Falcon idea.</p>
   <p>The second congress of the Alliance of Polish Falcons in the United States of North America took place in Pulaski Hall, Chicago, Ill., in 1896. There were twenty one delegates, seven nests belonged to the Alliance with more than two hundred members.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1492.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The first number of Sokol (The Falcon), the official publication of the Alliance, was issued September 1, 1896.</p>
   <p>The third congress took place in South Bend, Indiana, in 1897. The Alliance had, at that time, "nests" with 281 members.</p>
   <p>The fourth congress was held in Buffalo, N. Y. in 1899. The Alliance had then fifteen "nests" with 367 members.</p>
   <p>The fifth congress was held in Pittsburgh, Pa. in 1901. There were thirty three delegates representing twelve "nests" with the total membership of 384.</p>
   <p>By the decision of the majority of the delegates to the congress, the seat of the Central Committee of the Alliance of Polish Falcons was transferred from Chicago to South Bend, Indiana.</p>
