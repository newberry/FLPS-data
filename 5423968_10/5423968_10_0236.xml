   <p>The weather was favorable to the parishioners of St.Hyacinth's yesterday for their day of festivity, on which the consecration of a beautiful structure - their new church - was observed.</p>
   <p>From early morning a bustle through the streets reigned in the parish. The homes, and the church that was to be consecrated, were beautifully decorated; the front of the church facing Wolfram street bore papal hues and garlands of conservative colors, and on the side of the structure, facing Lawndale avenue, it had wreaths of Polish colors.</p>
   <p>Before 2 P.M. the church societies left in large groups to meet the archbishop and many other guests of various other parishes. A fine band was at the head of this procession.</p>
   <p>The following St. Hyacinth's societies participated at the event: The Knights of St. Hyacinth Z. K. L., Knights of Michael Z. K. L., St. Hyacinth Organization, the group of St. Floryan's and the Polish national group.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0237.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The construction of this church was under the workmanship of Polish contractors (Messrs. Ostrowski, Jankowski, Zgorski and Crolkowski).</p>
   <p>We can gladly state that there is not any public school in our city that can beast of a structure built with the energy this one was.</p>
   <p>The cost is estimated around $65,000.</p>
