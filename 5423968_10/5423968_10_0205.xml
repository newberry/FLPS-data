   <p>10,000 people in the procession; 50,000 people on the streets of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Consecration of the first Polish bishop, Paul Rhode, Suffragan Archdiocese in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Not only the Chicago Poles but all the American Poles yesterday celebrated this unusual holiday. On the 29th of July our Most Rev. Father Paul Rhode was consecrated the First Polish Bishop in the United States of America.</p>
   <p>From all parts of our country, from all our states, large cities, small cities, towns and villages, arrived our fellow citizens and clergymen to take part in this greatest of all Polish ceremonies; all day yesterday, from morning till late at night, one of the greatest manifestations, a manifestation of Polish origin, the inseparability of the Poles from the Catholic faith, took place.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0206.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>From 7 o'clock in the morning people began to throng and congregate at the Most Sacred Name Cathedral, located at State and Superior Streets; companies of police officers were on hand to keep law and order.</p>
   <p>A great number of automobiles went to the parish of St. Michael of Archangel in South Chicago, located at Bond and 83rd street, where Rev. Father Rhode is provost, ready to escort him in dignified style to the cathedral.</p>
   <p>At the front of the rectory a large group of parishioners congregated to bid Father Rhode a happy trip, success and prosperity in his new position. Father Rhode thanked the parishioners for their kind thoughts and blessed them with his last blessings as the rector of St. Michael's Parish. He arrived at the cathedral at 9 A. M., where Archbishop J. E. Quigley and all the other bishops, prelates and priests were awaiting him.</p>
   <p>The procession started at 10 o'clock, being led by the mounted police, <pb facs="5423968_10_0207.jpg" n="3"/>followed by various church organizations, societies, the Polish veterans, and the various clergymen and His Excellency Quigley, Father Rhode and the parishioners. The police had to make room for the hierarchy and clear the church aisles, because the cathedral was filled to capacity; many people were disappointed because they were not allowed to stand in the aisles. Archbishop J. E. Quigley and his assistants, Bishops Muldoon and Koldelka, occupied the main seats, while Father Paul Rhode occupied the center seat at the foot of the altar. The greatest per cent of the priests assisting Archbishop J. E. Quigley, were Polish; the rest consisted of Czechoslavs, Lithuanians, Slavs, Italian and French. The Polish reporters occupied the first three pews behind the priests.</p>
   <p>Among the well known Polish groups represented were the Union P. R. K., Z. N. P., Polish Alma Mater Society, Polish Veterans, and the Polish Singers' Union and Choirs of America.</p>
   <p>Before the consecration the Most Rev. Father E. M. Dunne, chancellor, read the Pope's letter nominating Rev. Paul Rhode to the rank of bishop, <pb facs="5423968_10_0208.jpg" n="4"/>to be blessed and receive the holy blessings from His Excellency J. E. Quigley, as the Bishop "in partibus infidelium" and sufragan of Chicago archdiocese. During the time that Archbishop Quigley was blessing Father Rhode the Polish and Lithuanian choirs, under the direction of Mr. Malka, sang Polish hymns. At the conclusion of the choirs' singing, Archbishop Quigley placed his hand on the forehead of Father Rhode, gave him the Sacred Crosier, Cross and Ring; then placed on his head the Miter, proclaiming him Bishop.</p>
   <p>At 12 o'clock noon Bishop Rhode, dressed in the robes of a bishop, marched through the cathedral's aisles blessing the people for the first time as a bishop. In the eyes of many people were tears of joy, that at last a Pole has attained the rank of bishop.</p>
   <p>In one of the pews sat an old gray-haired women reading her prayer book, with her hand bowed down, her thin hard work hands shaking from years of hard labor; as the Bishop came down her aisle, she looked up, tears streaming down her cheeks, her face beaming with happiness, for she was <pb facs="5423968_10_0209.jpg" n="5"/>the mother of Bishop Rhode.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of the mass, the priests, bishops, prelate and other out of town officials went to the cathedral's hall where a beautiful dinner was served, arranged and under the supervision of all Polish priests in Chicago.</p>
   <p>There were about 1,000 priests taking part in this consecration; of this number about 400 assisted in the church ceremonies. We cannot print all the names of the priests, the names of groups or societies in this paper, but the people that will take part in the celebration at the hall of St. Stanislaus will see posters and credentials hanging on the walls of every high official and priest taking part in this great celebration.</p>
