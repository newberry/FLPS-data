   <p>Another Polish church was consecrated yesterday to swell the ever-growing number of Polish churches in America. St. Michael's Church, located near 83rd Street, South Chicago, in the so-called Warsaw neighborhood, was officially opened by Archbishop Feehan. The completion of the two buildings [church and school] in five months is considered one of the marvelous examples of present-day efficiency. The church is of Gothic architecture.</p>
   <p>When Archbishop Feehan arrived in a coach with Reverend Adolph Nowicki, the indefatigable pastor of St. Michael's parish, it began to rain a little. Despite the inclemency of the weather, the members of the following societies were assembled to welcome the Archbishop: St. Michael, Knights of St. Mary, St. Casimir, Krakus, Immaculate Conception, St. Vincent de Paul, St. Joseph, Knights of The Blessed Virgin, and St. Joseph Legion.</p>

   <p>Besides these Polish church societies,several German Catholic societies, from Reverend Batz's parish and a few Irish groups were also represented. The members of the John Sobieski Society of South Chicago were also present.</p>
   <p>The members of all these societies came in full regalia, with standard-bearers and a well-rehearsed band leading the parade. Amidst music, song, and the tolling of bells, the Archbishop was escorted to the newly completed church.</p>
   <p>Besides Reverend Nowicki and his assistant, Father Lipski, Reverends [John] Radziejewski, Gordon, Krzywones, Baltz, Sullivan, Vandelare, [Francis] Wejtalewicz, Mallone, Byrne, and Mr. John Belrowski, instructor of theology at the Polish Seminary in Detroit, were present to witness the ceremony.</p>
   <p>During the ceremony Reverend Radziejewski officiated as deacon, Reverend Batz as subdeacon, and Reverend Vandelare as archdeacon.</p>

   <p>Members of the young ladies' sodality societies, all dressed in white, were seated in the front of the church. Behind them sat the members of mens' societies. Guests and parishioners filled the remaining pews.</p>
   <p>Archbishop Feehan took the crosier and miter before the center altar--brought from St. Louis and graced with a beautiful statue of St. Michael, the patron saint of the parish--and began the dedication ceremony. The Archbishop began the blessing from the main portal of the new church. While Reverend Wojtalewicz sang the impressive "Miserere," the Archbishop blessed the entrance hall and then proceeded to the altar, where he said the customary prayers. After the singing of the litany to All Saints by the officiating clergy, Archbishop Feehan walked about the entire church, blessing all with holy water. Meanwhile the parish choir sang "Ecce Sacerdos Magnus" and "Veni, Sancte Spiritus".</p>
   <p>This was followed by a popular sermon, appropriate to the occasion, by Reverend Gordon. He was followed by Archbishop Feehan, who made a brief speech in English.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1109.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Archbishop then bestowed the Sacrament of Confirmation upon one hundred and fifty boys and girls.</p>
   <p>During the banquet held in the new school hall, and at the request of Reverend Nowicki, Professor I. Machnikowski delivered a speech in Latin. Archbishop Feehan was the next speaker. He expressed his admiration for the Polish people, commended them for their devotion to the Catholic religion, and praised them for their support of the parish church and school. In conclusion he pleaded for the continued support of everyone, and congratulated the pastor for his efforts in organizing a Polish high school in so short a time. The school will probably be opened this week.</p>
   <p>Although it was a rainy day, the people gathered in large numbers to witness the ceremony. More than half of the devout could not enter the church, which was filled to capacity before the Archbishop arrived. A large arch made up of <pb facs="5423968_10_1110.jpg" n="5"/>garlands graced 83rd Street just in front of the newly completed church. Polish and American flags were at each side. On the front of the arch, the inscription "Welcome" appeared in large letters.</p>
