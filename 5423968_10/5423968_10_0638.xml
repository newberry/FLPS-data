   <p>(We have received the following correspondence with a request that we publish it in the Dziennik Chicagoski.)</p>
   <p>We wish to announce that the Most Sacred Name of Jesus Society of Brotherly Help, of St. Adalbert's Parish, (Group No. 12 of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, under the Protection of the Sacred Heart of Jesus), held its regular monthly meeting on January 4. At this meeting the Society decided to take an active part in the Polish Catholic Congress, which is to be held this year in America.</p>
   <p>We urge all our dear Polish brethren all over America to take part in this Congress, and we also hope that our brethren from across the ocean will help us in this undertaking.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0639.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Dear brothers! It is evident that the Polish people in America do not come up to expectations, and seem unable to compete with the representatives of other nationalities. It is time we considered ourselves and discussed matters together; then, with God's help, we will be able to eradicate the evil tendencies in our midst.</p>
   <p>The matter is important and urgent. Let's go to work, brothers!</p>
   <p>The Society of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus selected the three members whose names are signed below, to act as delegates at the coming Polish Catholic Congress in America.</p>
   <p>Adam Martyn,</p>
   <p>Frank Nowak,</p>
   <p>Joseph Kraner,</p>
   <p>828 West 17th Street,</p>
