  <body>
   <p>This year (1917) the parish of St. Michael Archangel celebrates its 25th anniversary or Silver Jubilee.</p>
   <p>The history of St. Michael's parish is very closely connected with the parish of the Immaculate Conception.</p>
   <p>Organizing of the Parish</p>
   <p>In 1888 a group of members from the Immaculate Conception parish organized St. Michael's Archangel Society for the purpose of founding a new parish. The membership grew quickly and in a short time there were sixty-five members. In 1889 they bought a banner which remained in that church till 1892.</p>
   <p>In 1891 they bought a location at 83rd street and South Shore Drive for $14,700. As the church of Immaculate Conception was too small, father Pyplatz agreed to split the parish. The members of the new parish bought the location <pb facs="5423968_10_0085.jpg" n="2"/>but the treasury was empty. In order to raise funds they conducted a bazaar which brought them $3,700.00</p>
   <p>At that time there were about three hundred families in the new parish. A social committee was formed and that committee applied to Archbishop Feehan for a priest. After Many efforts the Archbishop granted them an audience which resulted in the appointment of Father Zyla as a pastor of the new parish. Father Zyla lived at 8236 Bend avenue (today's South Shore drive) but he did not stay very long. There was some misunderstanding and father Zyla left. In his place father Adelf Newieki was appointed and on the second day of February, 1891, day of his arrival, father Newicki started to build a church or rather a chapel. It was a historical day for the parish. Father Newicki with a hammer in his hand working hard; the members, including women and children, sawing boards and helping Father Newicki. In a short time the chapel was ready, so was the little but for father Newicki. The whole affair was rather comical. This little parish gave to the world the first Polish-American church dignitary - Bishop Rhede. In this little church services were held until 1892.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0086.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>During that time father Nowicki collected money all over Chicago and built a new and large church which was dedicated in Sept. 1892. Years of 1893, 1894 and 1895 were very poor years for South Chicago, as there was unemployment. Father Nowicki helped the poor members as much as he could. He left St. Michaels Archangel parish in 1897. The parish debt was then $58,000</p>
   <p>Father Paul Rhode as pastor of the parish</p>
   <p>On the 31st day of October, 1897, glad news were spread in St. Michael Archangel parish that Bishop Feehan appointed father P. Rhode, who was the organizer and pastor of St. Peter and Paul parish. The members started to like their new pastor. Father Rhode looked the situation over very carefully. He decided to pay off the debt first, and after some time the parish was freed from the obligations. During his pastorship many church societies were organized which still exist today.</p>
   <p>The Growth of the Parish</p>
   <p>In time many families settled in St. Michael's Archangel parish; prairies and wooden houses began to disappear and in their stead modern briek buildings <pb facs="5423968_10_0087.jpg" n="4"/>appeared. Poles started to build, business developing St. Michael's Archangel parish was growing.</p>
   <p>Building New Church</p>
   <p>On account of the growth of the parish the church was getting too small. Father Rhode thought of building a new church. In 1907 the foundation was built for the present church. Generous donations were made the were of great help and speeded the work. On the 3rd of November, 1907, the corner stone was laid for the new church and not quite two years later, after elevation of Father Rhode to the office of bishop, the church was dedicated.</p>
   <p>This magnificent and very imposing solemnity took place among unusual ceremonies in which thousands of people participated. This took place on the 23rd of May, 1909. The structure of St. Michael's church costs $200,000, that is why it is called the cathedral of the first Polish bishop in America. It is an imposing gothic edifice.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0088.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The good work in St. Michael's Archangel parish progressed wonderfully and no one suspected that a great honor would be bestrowed upon that parish. Then, the 17th day of June, 1908, the news were spread that Father Rhode, the pastor of St. Michael's Archangel parish, was made a Polish bishop in America.</p>
   <p>On Friday the 19th day of June, 1908, Archbishop Quigley received from Mgr. Faleoni the papal delegate in Washington, the papal "breve" signed by cardinal Merry del Val, making Father Paul Rhode a bishop. Not only Chicago "Polonia" but the whole American "Polonia," celebrated this great event for on the 29th day of July their countryman, Rev. Paul Rhode, was consecrated the first Polish bishop in America. His countrymen came to Chicago from all over the country. Like a great parade it was. They took him in an automobile. Great crowds greeted him. The ceremony of consecration was performed in the cathedral by Archbishop Quigley. About one hundred priests were present at this celebration, and three hundred took active part in the ceremony.</p>
