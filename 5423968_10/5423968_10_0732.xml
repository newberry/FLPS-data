<title level="a">MEETING HELD TO ENLIGHTEN ST. JOHN CANTIUS PARISHIONERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF MEMBERSHIP IN THE POLISH ROMAN CATHOLIC UNION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A meeting was held last Sunday, October 27, in the St. John Cantius Parish Hall for the purpose of enlightening the parishioners as to the advantages of membership in the Polish Roman Catholic Union. The meeting was opened by Jacob Rybant, who called upon F. Sobieszczyk to preside as chairman and Michael Ptaszek to act as recording secretary.</p>
   <p>The chairman began the proceedings with a prayer which the audience repeated after him. He then explained the purpose of the gathering.</p>
   <p>C. J. Bielinski, president of the Polish Roman Catholic Union, was the first to take the speaker's stand. He explained the aims and advantages of his organization. He said that, besides joining the Poles in brotherly unity, the Union works for the good of the holy faith and the Polish race, along with <pb facs="5423968_10_0733.jpg" n="2"/>security for widows and orphans of the members. The financial setup of the organization, including the annual turnover of income, was fully explained.</p>
   <p>"Those who wish to assure themselves prosperity and existence under the true faith," continued the speaker, "and work for the good of the fatherland, and those who desire to have their children remain good Poles and Catholics, should join with their brother Poles under the sign of the Cross and unite their strength into one great body. There are a great many obstacles that must be overcome, many battles to be fought and many dangers to be faced. The enemy is lying in wait for us, while its spies are spreading discord and hostility among us. In order to prevent all this, in order not to lose trace of our religion or our fight for the Polish cause [liberation of Poland] on this strange soil, we should join our hands in one common bond for the protection of our mutual welfare. In unity there is strength. That is why the Union [at that time there were a number of them in the United States] should be one great organization."</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0734.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Before Mr. Bielinski concluded he told the audience that it was not his purpose to force anyone to join the organization of which he is president. He put this decision entirely in the hands of his listeners, saying that they should make a careful study of all the conditions of the Polish Roman Catholic Union. He told the gathering that his only intention was to impart information about the organization he represents.</p>
   <p>The second speaker was W. Wachowski, trustee of the Polish Roman Catholic Union. He also spoke about the noble aims of the organization, urging the people to continue in their belief in the holy faith and to join the Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>"There is concern about our moral standing and material gain," said Mr. Wachowski. "Only through the medium of solid organization can we gain recognition and respect from other nationalistic groups. A member of the Union can be sure that after his death his wife and children will be safe. Each member also gains more confidence in this institution and in himself, from a moral <pb facs="5423968_10_0735.jpg" n="4"/>and religious standpoint, because he knows that no one of questionable character will be taken into the organization."</p>
   <p>Isidore Komorowski was the third speaker. He expressed the hope that all societies in St. John Cantius Parish will affiliate with the Polish Roman Catholic Union, and that the officers of these societies will influence their members in this direction.</p>
   <p>All speakers thanked the audience for its attendance and kind indulgence.</p>
   <p>Upon a motion made by Mr. Komorowski, the audience rose, as a gesture of tribute, to thank Messrs. Bielinski and Wachowski for attending the affair.</p>
   <p>Before the meeting came to a close, Mr. Bielinski spoke once more and urged the members of the audience to join the Polish Roman Catholic Union. J. Rybant also spoke in the same vein.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_0736.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The audience responded enthusiastically to all the speeches. All left the hall with a feeling of great satisfaction, and on their way home they all discussed the Polish Roman Catholic Union.</p>
   <p>Before closing it should be mentioned that a capacity crowd filled the auditorium of St. John Cantius Parish.</p>
