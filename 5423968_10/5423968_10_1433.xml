  <body>
   <p>The Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor of St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish, has received the following invitation from the Grand Army of the Republic Memorial Association:</p>
   <p>Chicago, May 17</p>
   <p>The Reverend Vincent Barzynski:</p>
   <p>Reverend Father: Polish military societies are cordially invited by the undersigned to participate in the Memorial Day parade with the Grand Army of the Republic. We ask you to be gracious enough to extend this invitation to all officers of Polish military groups and to have them indicate their acceptance in a letter to the committee that is arranging the parade for <pb facs="5423968_10_1434.jpg" n="2"/>May 31. The address is R. H. Peters, Room 506, 87 Washington Street.</p>
   <p>Very Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>R. H. Peters</p>
   <p>All Polish military societies should take this invitation under consideration. Hope is expressed that all will participate in order to demonstrate to Chicago that they can grace the parade as well as others with their military organizations. Attention is called to the fact that all societies desiring to participate in this event should notify the above committee. This should be done as soon as possible in order that the Poles may get a prominent place in the parade.</p>
   <p>All military societies of St. Stanislaus Kostka's parish, namely, the Knights of St. Martin, the Uhlans, Companies A and B, and the Queen of the Polish Crown Guards, should have their officers get in touch with the Reverend Father Barzynski.</p>
