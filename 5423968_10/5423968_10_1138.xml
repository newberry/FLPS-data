   <p>A new charge has been leveled against the instituting and erecting of Polish churches, especially beautiful, expensive and magnificent churches. The charge is that the churches are "unproductive", that the capital expended for their erection could be turned into more advantageous channels and bring marked profits.....</p>
   <p>Evidently, this charge could have been made only by a comparative stranger, by a person who is completely unacquainted with existing conditions and, moreover, who is completely deprived of practical sense and judgment as to what is really "productive" and what is not. This assertion is not at all supported by the Jews and members of other sects who wish to do business with the Poles, antagonistic as they may be toward the churches. These people, in their desire to subdivide land <pb facs="5423968_10_1139.jpg" n="2"/>and sell it to the Poles and to establish some Polish settlement, first assign a few lots as a donation to erect a Polish church, because they well know that it will be profitable to them. Certainly they would not do this if the donation of the lands was "unproductive". Whoever has seen the growth of the Polish settlement during the recent years, whoever has compared the present value of Polish real estate in the vicinity of Noble Street with its value in former years--and the same holds true of other parts of the city--whoever, even in the past few years, has watched the development of St. Hedwig's Parish from the time when the church was instituted there and compared it with the previous long period of time in which the locality was known as "the prairie", whoever will even take into consideration only the last few months during which in South Chicago within a few days a "Warsaw" was erected out of a "brush land" as soon as a temporary church was established--that person cannot say that the instituting and erecting of churches is "unproductive". It would require a very limited vision not to see their productiveness; or again, it would be necessary to have a sincere <pb facs="5423968_10_1140.jpg" n="3"/>hatred for the church to make such assertions public.</p>
   <p>The Polish people are a religious people and even today stand firm in the faith of their forefathers. Consequently, the Poles live around their churches and congregate only where the church is near. The result of this is a rise of prosperity. True, a short-visioned person will not see that out of the five dollars given for the church indirectly either the capital or the interest from it returns to the donor; but what large material gains even these five dollars bring to this same donor over a period of a few years, everyone knows who has lived here for several years. Every foot of his land increases in value by tenfold; every home brings so much the greater profit, every store, every type of undertaking, gains that much in value. And indirectly they also gain who do not possess either land or homes or businesses: in proportion to the increase of prosperity there are created needs of different kinds, and employment is found for musicians, teachers, writers, and the <pb facs="5423968_10_1141.jpg" n="4"/>like--in the end, everyone residing in such a settlement gains when a church is near.</p>
   <p>We do not speak here of another type of "productiveness" or "gain" of the Polish churches because it would be incomprehensible to those who do not recognize the need of churches; for the time being, we limit ourselves strictly to "business productiveness" and everyone who bears no ill will or has no extremely limited vision will agree with our statement.</p>
