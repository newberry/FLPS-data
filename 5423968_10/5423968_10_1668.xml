<title level="a">THE ANTI-IMMIGRATION BILL VETOED</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The President of the United States, Woodrow Wilson, on January 28, 1915, sent to Congress his veto of the Immigration Bill. This bill would restrict entry of immigrants to the United States, especially those unable to read and write. Together with the veto, the President sent his report on this matter, setting forth the reasons why he had to veto this bill.</p>
   <p>Congressman Burnett, the main author of the bill and a rabid chauvinist, was uncontrolled in his anger. He announced at a meeting of the immigration commission that the bill would pass over the President's veto. He has hopes of gaining the two-thirds vote, in the lower house of Congress, necessary to overrule the veto.</p>
   <p>After a joint session of the committee--of which Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, of Chicago, an undaunted opponent of the bill, is a member--it was decided <pb facs="5423968_10_1669.jpg" n="2"/>that a new vote on this measure should take place on Thursday, February 4, 1915. If there is a two-thirds majority in favor of the bill, then the President's veto will be overridden and the bill will become law.</p>
   <p>Congressman Sabath, an opponent of the proposed measure, wanted the voting on the bill to take place immediately, or at the latest on February 2, 1915. He relied upon the effect that the President's veto had created upon the Congressmen.</p>
   <p>Congressman Burnett, the creator of this unjust bill, was opposed to Mr. Sabath's plan and succeeded in gaining the commission's assent to bring the bill to a vote on Thursday. This was done for the purpose of giving Burnett an opportunity to rally his followers to support the bill.</p>
   <p>Congressman Sabath, however, has hopes that the President's veto will be sustained. Some of the congressmen who formerly voted for the bill have <pb facs="5423968_10_1670.jpg" n="3"/>changed their views and do not want to act against the President's will.</p>
   <p>When the President's report explaining the reasons of the veto was read in Congress, the hall rang with the applause of Democratic Congressmen and some of the right-thinking Republicans. The protests against this bill have accomplished their end.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Morrison, the secretary of the American Federation of Labor, is perturbed no end over the outcome of the bill. He is conferring with numerous congressmen and senators for the purpose of abolishing the President's veto. We wonder whether he will be successful in this.</p>
