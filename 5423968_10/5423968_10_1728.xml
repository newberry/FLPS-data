<title level="a">THE IMMIGRATION QUESTION</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Among the many important problems on which our Washington statesmen are working there is the very important question of immigration.</p>
   <p>The Yankees' (being themselves sons or grandsons of immigrants) feeling of aversion against immigrants deepens every day.</p>
   <p>Congressmen, influenced by chauvinists of the worst kind, and being themselves in the majority chauvinistic, are trying to bar immigration to this country.</p>
   <p>Immigration from Japan and China is entirely stopped; and now the chauvinists in Congress are trying to decrease the quota or stop all immigration from Europe.</p>
   <p>Thanks to a few wiser congressmen the passing of the anti-immigration bills was blocked, some of them were vetoed by Presidents Cleveland and Taft, but <pb facs="5423968_10_1729.jpg" n="2"/>the danger of new attempts still exists, and we must watch and oppose vigorously the destructive work of the American chauvinists.</p>
   <p>Some of the best brains in this country, not only politicians but also men of science and labor leaders, are working on the immigration problem. Newspapers often publish articles on this subject. These articles consider the problem from different angles, and soon we shall probably witness another attempt of our chauvinists to decrease or stop the entrance of immigrants from Europe to this country.</p>
   <p>One Roscoe F. Hall, a noted writer from Boston, published in a magazine an article, in which he says that immigration authorities pay more attention to the quality of cattle than to the quality of immigrants admitted to this country. This man prefers to admit more cattle without any restriction, than human beings whom he considers more dangerous.</p>
   <p>On the otherhand, some well-known economists, men with more common sense, say that newcomers from Europe are not jeopardizing prosperity in this country, but are rather increasing it by their laboriousness, thrift and endurance, a virtue that seldom can be credited to native Americans.</p>
   <pb facs="5423968_10_1730.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Dr. Richard Cabot, of the Medical department of the Harvard University, in his speech to the Students' Association said that examination of immigrants by the immigration authorities is a farce. Immigrants with slight eye disease are not allowed to land, while those affected with tuberculosis are accepted. The latter should be examined in European ports. Dr. Cabot further states that immigrants are physically healthier and possess higher morals than the average Americans; true they are not so well educated, but thanks to their individuality and eagerness for manual work they beat the native Americans. But healthy and strong immigrants are slowly killed by local conditions. Feverish and nerve racking life, unsanitary dwellings, adulterated and often spoiled canned food, and hard labor in mines and factories are shortening their lives rapidly.</p>
   <p>The immigrants are a good asset to this country. They are doing the hardest and most dangerous work, which the native American avoids. Yet he raises an outcry against immigrants, accusing them of depriving him of work.</p>
   <p>We should not enforce assimilation by drowning entirely one race in another, but we should teach the immigrants to honor the law and become good citizens of this so far hospitable country; we should encourage them to settle on <pb facs="5423968_10_1731.jpg" n="4"/>farms and thereby to increase the nations's wealth. We should not stop the immigration, but we should segregate immigrants according to their ability and occupation, and they will be beneficial to the welfare of this great country.</p>
   <p>Doctor Cabot's speech proves that not all Americans are chauvinists and are against immigration. We, Poles, sons of immigrants, but loyal American citizens, will watch all attempts of native chauvinists and raise our voice of protest in due time.</p>
