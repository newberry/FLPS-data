  <body>
   <p>Amidst solemn ceremony, Reverend John J. Bednarek celebrated his first Mass yesterday at 10:30 A.M. at Saint Stanislaus Kostka Church.</p>
   <p>The new priest was escorted to the church by many priests, clerics, and friends. He was led by a group of school girls dressed in white, carrying flowers, and acolytes. Reverend Bednarek was assisted by Reverend Kesinski, who acted as deacon, and one of his friends, who acted as subdeacon. The entire Mass was under the careful guidance of Reverend Vincent Barzynski, pastor, who also delivered a sermon.</p>
   <p>During the services of the Mass, the young priest had the honor of offering Holy Communion to his parents, while his grandparents and other kin looked on. After the services the priest was congratulated by the clergy, relatives, and friends.</p>
