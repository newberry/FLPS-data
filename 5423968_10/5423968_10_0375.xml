   <p>A plea for help was received by the Holy Name Society of St. Adalbert's parish from an independent faction [a group that does not recognize the authority of the Pope] in the neighborhood. The matter was taken up at a regular monthly meeting, and a stern rejection was adopted.</p>
   <p>This reprimand was mailed to the Dziennik Chicagoski; however, it was published only in part because of its severity. The measure adopted on May 1 reads in part:</p>
   <p>"We are opposed to any schismatic movement that opposes the powers of the Church, for we are loyal to our Pope, our bishop, and our pastor and will continue to be so. Any member desirous of joining the independent faction will immediately <pb facs="5423968_10_0376.jpg" n="2"/>be suspended from membership.</p>
   <p>Joseph Kramer, secretary,</p>
   <p>828 West 17th Street.</p>
