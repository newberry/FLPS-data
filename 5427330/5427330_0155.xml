   <p>I am adopting as my slogan, "Keep the Filipino Association of Chicago a National Organization". This is my appeal to you in my candidacy for the Presidency of the F. A. C. I present to you our problems as I see them.</p>
   <p>A person who is selfish can never be a good head. Sometimes we put up men of this type as candidates for president. Due to their selfishness and self-interest, they have created a system of Buying Votes. By crooked politics they succeed in winning elections. Even now this kind of crookedness in politics still exists in our organization. THIS IS ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THE DOWNFALL OF THE F. A. C.</p>
   <p>Shall we let our beloved organization go down? No, we must not let our beloved F. A. C. go down! It was founded by Filipinos for Filipino people, therefore, it is our duty and moral obligation for the sake of our people and country to keep clear of such practice, support and protect our integrity and pride. The name of our organization is sacred because it binds the Filipinos in Chicago.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0156.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Are you willing to see our beloved organization go down? Shall we let our club be destroyed vote buying. Shall we admit that we cannot run an organization successfully? Shall we admit that we cannot find a good leader in the community? Shall we admit that we cannot co-operate together? Are we going to let crooks run our organization?</p>
   <p>My countrymen, nobody will help us, we must do something ourselves. If we keep on sleeping, if we quit, if we lose our interest and courage, the F. A. C. is sure to go down, and if it goes down, the whole Filipino people in Chicago will go down.</p>
   <p>May I appeal to you? Come and vote on April 19th at 16 E. Ontario and Keep the Filipino Association of Chicago, Inc., a national organization.</p>
  </body>
