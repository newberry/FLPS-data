   <p>Is there anyone who can go thru life unassisted? Do you think you can get along by yourself without the aid of others? The correct answer is "NO." The food you eat, the clothes you wear and the shelter you enjoy during your daily existence are the contribution of the various agencies which are suppying your needs or demand.</p>
   <p>Why is it that the Filipino business in Chicago is slow? Why is it that the Chinese and the Japanese are successful in business? The comparative reasons are as follows: THE FILIPINO BUSINESSMEN DEPEND MOSTLY UPON THE FILIPINO PATRONAGE AMONG THE FILIPINOS IN THE COMMUNITY</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0140.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>WHILE THE CHINESE AND JAPANESE BELIEVE IN TRANSACTING BUSINESS WITH THE AMERICAN (All Nationalities).</p>
   <p>Is capital a Handicap or is there any Filipino capitalist? YES! BUT FILIPINO CAPITALIST ARE SO SENSITIVE OF LIABILITY THAT AT THE FIRST FALL OF AN ENTERPRISE IS ALSO THE LAST. THERE IS NOTHING FUNDAMENTAL CATASTROPHIC IN BUSINESS TO THE CHINESE OR JAPANESE? FAILURE IS ANOTHER VENTURE FOR THEM.</p>
   <p>FILIPINO BUSINESSMEN MUST DEAL WITH AMERICANS AND FILIPINOS PLEASING THEM RESPECTIVELY IN LINES OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, AND ALSO IN THE <pb facs="5427330_0141.jpg" n="3"/>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL USEFULNESS.</p>
