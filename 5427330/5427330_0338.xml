   <p>Commissioner Delgado's Family, Deputies of Foreign Consulates as Special Guests of the Evening. Commissioner's Stunning Daughter Good Dancer. Celebrities and Socialites on Parade. Beautiful Artist Sang Popular Songs. Filipino Trio Scored Great Applause.</p>
   <p>Sherman Hotel, Chicago, June 16, (Special to the Associated Filipino Press). The heavy rain and strong wind did not dampen the ardent enthusiasm of the Filipino population in Chicago and their many friends. They arrived by the car loads just the same. Taxis and privately owned cars filled up with energetic young Filipinos and their charming lady friends immaculately dressed, arrived early and late. Quite a job for the Sherman Hotel door men and the elevator operators. It was the night of the International Dinner held under the auspices of the Filipino Community Center.</p>
   <p>Celebrities On Parade.</p>
   <p>The gentlemen of the Press, pencils and papers in hands and pockets were the <pb facs="5427330_0339.jpg" n="2"/>first to arrive, to record the names. They were Eugene Laway, President of the Mindanao Fraternity; Alfred Arce; C. C. Jensen of the City News Bureau, and F. A. Lopez, of the Associated Filipino Press.</p>
   <p>Those at the speakers' table: Commissioner Francisco Delgado, Mrs. Delgado, and their charming daughter, Rosario; Hon. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Oesch, Secretary, Swiss Consulate; Hon. Daniel MoGrath, Consul, Irish Free State; T. C. Shen, Deputy Consul, China; Vice-Consul Oscar Hayskar of Finland; Dr. Walter Templeton, President, Board of Directors of the Filipino Community Center; Mr. Gerkins, formerly Assistant Attorney General, P. I.; Dr. Curtis Reese, Dean of the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Center; Dr. &amp; Mrs. I. de Vera; C. Santa Ramona, University of Chicago; Judge Mathew Hartigan, official representative of Mayor Kelly; and other representatives of the French and Hindu students at the International House.</p>
   <p>The short program was preceded by an invocation led by Rev. F. Laxamana and the introductory remarks of Director Antonio Gonzales. Speakers - Hon. Francisco Delgado, Resident Commissioner (House of Representatives, U. S. Congress) Philippine Islands; greetings from consuls and students from foreign lands; <pb facs="5427330_0340.jpg" n="3"/>remarks by Dr. Reese, Judge Hartigan and Mr. Templeton.</p>
   <p>Music was furnished by Filipino Community Center's Trio. Prof. H. Miller and Miss Veronica Jennette gave vocal solos.</p>
   <p>The Ball.</p>
   <p>The ball which immediately followed the banquet and program, brought forth the pleasant climax of the evening's most unique features. The "Chicagoans", who furnished the rhythmic music, assisting the sensational blues singer had, in the opinion of all, given the evening's finishing touch to everyone's content. Everybody danced.</p>
   <p>Miss Rosario Delgado, daughter of the Commissioner, representing the most typical Philippine beauty, wearing the impressive and delicate Filipino dress, was the center of the night's attraction, yea, the object as well of everyone's secret and sincere admiration. Even the American ladies admired her lovely dark curly hair that framed her beautiful face and smooth cheeks. She had a genial democratic attitude toward all her fellow countrymen, whom she had impressed with her friendliness. In the opinion of all, she was a very good dancer and could dance the latest steps, retaining the true Filipino poise and <pb facs="5427330_0341.jpg" n="4"/>calmness.</p>
   <p>Commissioner and Mrs. Delgado were kept quite busy shaking hands and talking with everybody.</p>
