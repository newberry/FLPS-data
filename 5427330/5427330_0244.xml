   <p>A new era of the lives of Orientals! A dawn of progressive spirit looms on the far distant horizon! A blessing to the thousands who reside in Chicago or in the State of Illinois and elsewhere. All these crystalized in the formulation of the Oriental Aid Society, incorporated under the laws of the State.</p>
   <p>After undergoing a close and thorough study of the life of the Orientals, men of different learnings, all authorities in their respective professional fields, lawyers, doctors, insurance men and newspaper men, formulated and organized the Society, the Oriental Aid Society, Inc., which tends to eradicate the unnecessary worries of the Orientals. When one becomes a member of the Society, he will receive a legal protection, medical and dental assistance, employment security, health and accident indemnity, subscription to an Oriental newspaper, and many other benefits.</p>
   <p>Purposes.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0245.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Society aims to promote a more friendly relationship and better understanding between the Orientals and people of other nationalities, and only thru mutual assistance and cooperation of its members can the Society protect their interests. It further helps its members to secure health and accident insurance for their protection.</p>
   <p>Favorable Comments.</p>
   <p>Various critics who have been informed of the Society, and who have looked into the set-up of the organization commented, unbiasedly: "I never heard of any organized body such as your Society that gives all this protection against all adversities", declared Mr. L. O. Napier, President of the Travelers Casualty Insurance Co. Mr. Napier has a wide experience in the insurance business.</p>
   <p>"I think that a member who lives in a big city like Chicago, will never be afraid of anything anymore", remarked Mr. Green of the famous Green &amp; Costigan law firms.</p>
   <p>"One of the benefits alone is worth the annual dues", commented Dr. Fernando I. Aguila, a Filipino physician.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0246.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This remark was identical to the remark of Dr. Paul Koesun, a leading Chinese physician in Chicago.</p>
   <p>"I think the benefits offered for the small annual fee required are extremely liberal", emphatically declared Mr. Dexter of the Marie Louise Employment Agency. "If I am out of a job twice a year, I get the worth of my annual dues."</p>
   <p>Membership.</p>
   <p>The Society welcomes all Oriental people and their friends to membership. Yearly dues of $20 can either be paid in full or by installments.</p>
   <p>The dependability of the Society is unquestionable. It is chartered under the laws of the State of Illinois. Its founders and formulators possess unquestionable character and prestige, and are specialists in their respective businesses and professions. Every one of them has gained the confidence of the people with whom they have been dealing for many years, because of their honesty and square dealings.</p>
