   <p>Contest fought closely, and the manager nervous.</p>
   <p>A beauty contest, never equalled in the history of the Chicago Filipino Community, was held last Sunday night, at Germania Hall and at the Fraternity Hall. It was quite exciting, and everyone was actively campaigning for their favorites.</p>
   <p>Two Plaza beauties were elected: Miss Helen Paul, who was practically unheard of before, and said to be the last to enter the contest, was elected 1934 Rizal Queen of the F.A.C. She was backed up mostly by the Visayans.</p>
   <p>Miss Bonnie Martin, another Plaza beauty, was elected "Miss America", under the banner of the Associated Filipino Clubs.</p>
   <p>The Judges of the A.F.C. unanimously elected Miss Flora Diaz, now pursuing courses leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, at University of Chicago, "Miss Philippines."</p>

   <p>Miss Estelle (Babe) Vulin, of the Mayfair, was elected First Princess. Miss Greta Gliblichman, student in the College of Music, Chicago, was elected second Princess.</p>
   <p>Results of the balloting, (penny a vote): Helen Paul, 22,714; Babe Vulin, 15,857; Greta Gliblichman, 10,534; Janet Johnson, 1,050; (F.A.C); Miss Bonnie Martin, 5,000 votes, (A.F.C.)</p>
