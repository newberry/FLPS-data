   <p>Is there any Filipino "big shot" in Chicago, who can come forward with a clean record from the past, with an ability to mold the public opinion to that which is favorable to him without inviting, at the same time, the jealousy of a certain group?</p>
   <p>Is there one, who has thousands of loyal friends and supporters from both the American and Filipino groups; who can command the respect and attention of all the people, without any voice of resentment from these insignificant, disgruntled groups?</p>
   <p>Is there anyone, who for three years, worked night and day in the Filipino Community Center without pay? Is there anyone, who when the Filipino people, especially <pb facs="5427330_0268.jpg" n="2"/>the unemployed ones, had partly lost their self-respect, their courage, and most of their friends, stood by loyal to them?</p>
   <p>Is there anyone, who has helped many a down-trodden man who was picked up by the police, by pleading for them before the courts, aiding them in times of difficulty, when he also was beset by misfortune, and entangled himself in the barb-wire of social complexity?</p>
   <p>I ask of you, dear readers, and critics of the present administration of the Filipino Community Center to come forward in defense of the truth. If you can present one, then this person ought to be the one most qualified to direct the Filipino Community Center of Chicago.</p>
   <p>But, in the meantime, this publication admires the open-mindedness of the present American Board of the Filipino Center. The chairman, Mr. W. Templeton, Dr.Guthrie, Mrs. Wilson, and many other American benefactors, who are responsible for <pb facs="5427330_0269.jpg" n="3"/>the promotion of the undertakings of the Filipino Community Center, knew, and still know, too well, that the life of a public man is not rosy, especially the life of a director of a Filipino Community Center. They know that a leader cannot please all the different groups in his community, because it is practically impossible for a leader to satisfy all, especially the Filipinos, who are the hardest people on earth to please, and who talk too much, but act little.</p>
   <p>I hope that this may serve as a candid pointer, especially to those who talk excessively against Director Antonio A. Gonzales of the Center. It is always disgusting to hear those whom he helped, aided, secured positions for, loaned money to, now criticize him behind his back.</p>
   <p>That is always the case in every community, the one who is doing something is the one bound to be criticized. If this is not so, then a Filipino "Saint" is wanted, to become a Director of the Filipino Community Center of Chicago.</p>
