   <p>The Filipino Chapel, last Sunday evening, December 16, was the scene of fiery debates between the groups of "Filipino soap-box orators of the Philippine Junior House of Representatives", in Chicago. The Frianeza Bill, providing for the appropriation of $500,000 for settlements in Mindanas, was under hot discussion.</p>
   <p>Representative Frianeza of the first district of Panzasinan was the father of the bill. He was ably supported by Representative Alajado of Iloilo.</p>
   <p>Representative Jose B. Gataan, second district from Panzasinan, spoke eloquently against the bill. F.A. Lopez of Zambales, in opposing the bill, stated that such a bill at this time would invite danger of revolution, national calamity, and an economic death knell in the Philippines. It would mean an additional burden to be borne by the tax payers. He emphatically cited the facts that schools and colleges were closed, and thousands of school children were forced <pb facs="5427330_0228.jpg" n="2"/>to stop for lack of accommodations. He vigorously fought against the bill in a manner, that would give due warning to those supporting it.</p>
   <p>The bill, though bitterly opposed, was passed after a desperate plea of the opponents.</p>
   <p>The "thundering debates" were precipitated by a grand banquet tendered by the Junior House of Representatives at Dennis Hall, Filipino Community Center in honor of the many prominent community leaders and club officers.</p>
   <p>Among them were the following: M. Hinoguen, president of the Cebu Club; D.T. Duga, a successful business man in Chicago, and the president of the Big V. Club; Dr. F. Duerme, inventor; J. De La Paz, president of the Zambales Club and the chief executive of the Associated Filipino Clubs of Chicago; Jose Albertson, ex-president of the Pampangan Circle; Dr. F.I Aguila, Center's house physician; Avarilla of the Big V; Gombis and Velis, orators; J.B. Tataan, president of the <pb facs="5427330_0229.jpg" n="3"/>Married Couples Club; Mr. and Mrs. Marcelino, Attorney of the Filipino Community of Chicago; Attorney Calderon of New York City; Professor Miller and Professor Keen, and his "technical adviser."</p>
