   <p>Filipino Chicagoans should open their eyes to what the Filipinos in Hawaii have done. Papers in the Philippines have carried headlines on their front pages about the $16,000 contributed by Filipinos in Hawaii for the purchase of an aeroplane for the use of the Philippine Army. Such an act has been applauded by people who are interested in the welfare of the Philippines.</p>
   <p>What have the Filipinos in Chicago done for the material benefit of their motherland? Chicago has always been considered to be the center of the Filipino "intelligencia" in the United States. This is born by the fact that no other city in the United States has as great a number of professional men as Chicago. There are many doctors, engineers, lawyers, chemists, etc. There is not one university or college in the city that hasn't Filipinos enrolled in it. There are also many who are enrolled in technical schools.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0413.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In spite of this academic training which should give the Filipino Community of Chicago an advantage to look ahead with clearer vision in the future and to plan in a systematic way what should be done to attain their objectives, Filipinos in Chicago, with the exception of two or three, have not yet shown their willingness to help their mother country. Filipino Hawaiians, a great majority of them, have not the academic training and background that Filipinos in Chicago have, yet they first saw the opportunity to help their motherland. It is now high time for Filipino Chicagoans to wake up and show what they can do for the young Philippine Commonwealth.</p>
   <p>There are so many Filipino clubs in Chicago. Nearly every Sunday there is a dance given by Filipinos. The expense involved in holding Sunday dances averages around $80. This would amount to around $8,000 a year. Again Filipinos have the reputation of being sports - they are smartly dressed. They also have the reputation of being good spenders whether in the right way or the wrong. The young Philippine Commonwealth needs the help of her citizens in a material way in order that she can assert herself and be respected in the family of nations.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0414.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Cannot the Filipinos refrain from some of their unnecessary expenses and put the money instead as a contribution toward the purchase of some kind of equipment needed by the young Philippine Commonwealth? Cannot the Filipinos sacrifice something of their needs for the upbuilding of the young Commonwealth? Can they not sacrifice some of their Sunday dances and contribute that money to purchase of something needed by their motherland? Can they not contribute the proceeds from the dances they give on Sundays for the purchase of something worth while for the young Commonwealth? Cannot the Filipinos in Chicago cooperate and work together in raising funds for the purchase of anything needed by the Philippines?</p>
   <p>It is now time for the Filipinos in Chicago to unite and put a solid front in raising funds needed. Let the Filipinos take as their motto, "Where there is unity there is strength," or "United we stand; divided we fall."</p>
