   <p>We never had one Rizal day celebration in our community. This is a great mistake on our part and, I think, it is time for us now to unite for the sake of one great and glorious national day celebration.</p>
   <p>The reason for division in the celebration in the past was due to lack of unity. A group of our leaders said that there is no hall big enough to accomodate us. Is this true? Certainly not. Americans have had many big affairs in Chicago where 10,000 people have gathered peacefully, in carrying out their programs and activities. And yet we excuse ourselves by saying that there is "no hall" to accomodate a group of Filipino hero worshippers of a number much less than 10,000.Brother, our reasons hold no water, especially when we have already experienced in the past that we could hardly get over 1,000 people to come to the hall that we had rented for the occasion. Another class, of mere figure heads and self-styled leaders, contend that we haven't a club big enough to shoulder the responsibility of organizing such an affair. This is a case of short-sightedness. We could remedy this situation by uniting ourselves, as one body, and selecting a committee to represent the whole. The committee of the whole would be the agency that would represent us all regardless of our <pb facs="5427330_0352.jpg" n="2"/>Club affiliations, creed, religion, or station of life.</p>
   <p>I am sure we could do this for our common good. If we want unity for one Rizal day it is time for us to act on the matter. Leaders! here's your chance to move. We trust you will make some negotiations and arrangements among yourselves so that there shall be but one great Rizal day for this year.</p>
