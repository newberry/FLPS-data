   <p>Pizarro was recipient of much applause, firm handshakes, affectionate and laudible congratulations from the people that were present at the church meeting. Most of the enthusiasts were lovely ladies. Pizarro said: "The newspaper flashes of uprisings in the Philippines were misrepresented. Our American friends here should not take them to mean that we, Filipinos, are opposed to America."</p>
   <p>Branding further the reports as mere journalistic bunk and challenging the Manila correspondents of American papers, particularly those who are opposed to the granting of Philippine Independence, Pizarro told his hearers that Benigno Ramos, the alleged leader of the Sakdalista, went to Japan, not to seek aid from the Nippon Government, but to save his neck.</p>
   <p>The speaker was introduced by Rev. F. Laxamana, of the Filipino Chapel. The other speakers were: Miss Flora Diaz, of the University of Chicago; M. Alojado, of the Northwestern University; and Miss Dorothy Schmekle, Vice President of the League. The above meeting was sponsored by the Joyce Epworth league of Chicago and was held last May 5.</p>
