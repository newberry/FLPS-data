   <p>The movement to establish a hospital in order to serve the needs of Filipinos in the city of Chicago got into full swing April 4th when Filipino physicians and dentists met at the Palmer House and founded the Filipino Medico-Dental Association.</p>
   <p>Officers were elected at this meeting. Dr. Apolonio F. Montezon was named chief of staff; Dr. S.B. Ledesma, recorder; Dr. Potenciano V. Varilla, comptroller; Dr. Jose Zialcita Cailles, recreational director; Dr. A.E. Ablaza, chairman of the hospitalization committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0253.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The financial committee is headed by Dr. Baltazar G. Raz, as chairman, Members of the financial committee include Dr. Francisco M. Duerme, Dr. F. I. Aguila, and Dr. F. Hicano.</p>
   <p>Who is going to be director of public relations is not definitely decided yet but announcement will be made in the near future.</p>
   <p>National Pride</p>
   <p>The Filipino physicians and dentists of the city of Chicago have long sought to uphold the integrity and pride of both the medical and dental professions in order that we as a group of people may be able sufficiently to take care of our brothers who need both medical and dental care. We need your faith and confidence to enable us to cope with various conditions of human ailments. Your undivided support would substantiate the purpose of the Filipino physicians and dental professions.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0254.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In our experiences in the practice of medicine and dentistry in Chicago, we have many occasions to see patients who were in need of hospitalization but could not have it due to lack of funds. To such a misfortune we are all subject sooner or later during our existence; but through well organized community we can establish an institution of our own which will take care of ourselves. This New Deal is a challenge to every thinking Filipino who unselfishly lives his life. This movement we have initiated is not only needed in the City of Chicago but also in other cities in the United States where there are Filipinos. Not long ago the birthday of President Franklin D. Roosevelt was celebrated throughout the nation and has been capitalized to obtain funds for care of sufferers of Infantile Paralysis. Over a million dollars have been raised to perpetuate the humanitarian principles which will serve as a monument to the New Deal.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0255.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Long Wait</p>
   <p>After the conference concerning the New Deal we have decided to establish a dispensary clinic through which we can gladly serve the Filipino community of this metropolis. You should avail yourselves of this opportunity, the burden is ours whether we like it or not we have to take care of it ourselves. Keep up your faith, devotion and prayers for our countrymen who are in sympathy with our many mistakes and pitfalls.</p>
   <p>With the cooperation of various organizations of this city, we feel that the movement of the New Deal would succeed. On the contrary, no matter how good the proposition is presented to you and no matter how capable we are to run this enterprise, we are doomed to fail without the dynamic force of action from you.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0256.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Earning Power Law</p>
   <p>During the present conditions we have learned that our earning power has greatly diminished whatever work or enterprise we may handle; as a result many of us could not meet the expense of medical care. To alleviate our suffering the medical and dental professionals have thought of this movement; furthermore, we cannot escape old age and therefore, it is essential not to forget the New Deal which we are presenting for your consideration now. The New Deal is ours and we must support it at any cost.</p>
   <p>From our daily experiences every nation has her national pride and doubtless we Filipinos have our own. It is natural that we should show our Filipino pride even to the least extent possible. The New Deal would serve the purpose and you would then have your institution.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0257.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Public Hospital</p>
   <p>It is true that there are public hospitals in Chicago which may take care of us at their own rate which in many occasions we could meet. As a consequence we have to resort to charity institutions which are not much interested in us. Through cooperation we can make the New Deal of service to all.</p>
   <p>There are at least five thousand Filipinos in the city and several hundred families with approximately seven hundred to one thousand children in whom we are profoundly interested. The majority of these families are sufficient to provide professional medical care. The minority perhaps are forced to apply to the various city clinics for medical treatment. The aim of the New Deal is primarily to extend a helping hand to those who are otherwise unable to obtain medical aid. Frequent examinations of these children will prevent many untold sufferings both for the parent and the child. Deformities and complications are great drawbacks in the future attainments of our children We solicit your faith in us and remember that it is our earnest purpose to give you the best that medical science can afford.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0258.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Ask Cooperation</p>
   <p>The Filipino physicians and dentists of Chicago appeal to the different Filipino organizations and to the American people who are in sympathy with our cause to cooperate with us in this movement. We need the support of everyone at all times. We must start somewhere no matter how small; hence, we need your moral and financial support.</p>
   <p>Financial Sources</p>
   <p>We don't hesitate to say, without reservation, that our existing organizations of the city and American friends will gladly cooperate with the New Deal. To maintain such an institution it requires money. There are thousands of dollars that are being raised and paid out by various organizations to the hotels of this city every month for entertainment purposes.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0259.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>From every such function held by an individual club to help the New Deal enough should be realized to purchase the necessary instruments and bandages. Such funds will furnish a substantial income for the maintenance of the dispensary clinic.</p>
   <p>While attempting a relatively new movement in the field of human endeavor the scope of the New Deal is fulfilling an important requirement in this new era of the progress of civilization and the advancement of the Filipino race. The New Deal was conceived as a powerful influence in cementing a firmer relationship between our brothers far and near through a common bond of human interest. In sponsoring this ideal we believe that the time has arrived to broaden our social, professional and economic horizon.</p>
   <p>The sincerity of your cooperation can not be question but the continuance of your helpful interest is needed and petitioned. We look forward with hope and courage, for better days and better friendship for the great <pb facs="5427330_0260.jpg" n="9"/>family for the imperishable brotherhood of all Filipinos. We shall always cherish with affectionate pride the memories that linger from our association in this New Deal for the advancement of human happiness. Let us hear from you. Let us have your suggestion for building this New Deal into the kind of a resting place that you believe will be most beneficial to you and the community.</p>
