   <p>A brother Filipino, Bonifacio Oranio, lies in jail at Woodstock, facing a charge of murder. If convicted, he faces either imprisonment or death. He was brutually assaulted by a white ex-convict and fired the fatal shot in self-defense. His trial is coming up very soon. Alone and undefended, his case is hopeless. If money can be raised for a defense fund, the best legal talent of Chicago will be secured for him.</p>
   <p>Here's a call for united action, if his life means anything to you. Will you contribute your share towards his defense? The charge against him is unjust.</p>
   <p>Contributions can be sent to the office of this paper. They will be acknowledged in these columns. The following have already given their financial support: Zam-bales Club, $5.00; F. A.C, president, $15.00; Ilocas Norte, $5.00; Pangasimanes Club, $5.00.</p>
