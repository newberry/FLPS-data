   <p>Last Thursday, August the 15th, was the last day in the Art Appreciation Class sponsored by Miss Lucille Windett. She was commissioned last year by the Emergency Educational Extention to undertake this class among Filipinos at the Filipino Community Center. She was quoted as saying, "I enjoyed very much my association with you (Filipinos) as well as learning with you. Consider me not as a teacher but one of you." Mr. Antonio Aonsalez, the Director of the Center, expressed his deep gratitude and appreciation for the splendid work she had done for us.</p>
   <p>Refreshments were served, and dancing followed after a class' picture was taken. Among those present were: Mr. and Mrs. A. Gonsalez, Dr. Vega, Miss Windett, Mr. Capiz, and many others.</p>
