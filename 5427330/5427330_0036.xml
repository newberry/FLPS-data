   <p>School days are here again. Some of the older students are anxious to go back to their classrooms and campuses, while many are still in doubt as to whether they would go back or not, because of funds or other important reasons.</p>
   <p>Among the students who are lucky to be at school are the new beginners. It is to this group of students that I desire to impart this brief message. Of course, I don't need to tell of your coming problems, because you are conscious of them already. As a countryman of yours, who is anxious and proud to see you attain noble goals in your life, permit me to share with you my personal experiences in the schools, with the hope that I may point out to you some obstacles that you can overcome. Expenses, social re-adjustments, and even the weather conditions will be among your problems. But I could still add another problem, the habit of giving up.</p>
   <p>Some people are easily discouraged, because they lack perseverance, courage, and will to go on. Consequently they give up. I feel terribly disappointed about this class of scholars, especially when they are about to complete their studies giving up almost at the finish. They become discouraged, hysterical, <pb facs="5427330_0037.jpg" n="2"/>cynical, and "grass root" critics of the school system. This type of student instead of encouraging you to fight out your difficulties try to force you to quit. If you want to succeed ignore this group of undergraduates. If you happen to meet them just set your heart and mind with your main idea to finish school and college. Some day you will reach the goal of your ambition, and I think you will be contented and happy because you have struggled hard for it. The quitter did not give it to you, you captured it with your own efforts, and deserve the praise of other people and mine.</p>
