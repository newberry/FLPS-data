   <p>The Zambales Club, Inc., had invited Mayor Kelly of Chicago as a guest for the Quezon-Osmena victory dance which was held last Sunday at the Midland Club. But due to the pressure of duties, the Mayor instead sent to Hon. Carl H. Lundouist to represent him. The guest stressed the fact that Chicago is a great city, which is composed of a mass of races of which the Filipino people are a part. He was praised and cheered several times by the audience, especially when he emphatically voiced the Mayor's best wishes for the brightest future of Quezon-Osmena Administration.</p>
   <p>We are reproducing here, in full, the telegram of the Mayor to the President of the Zambales Club, Inc.:</p>
   <p>Delivered 8:15 P. M. Sunday, Zambales Club of Chicago. Care Midland Club Hotel Walnut Ballroom, 127 West Adams Street, Chicago, Ill. An extremely sorry that an especially urgent civic matter will prevent my having the pleasure of being present at your victory dance tonight and I am therefore <pb facs="5427330_0334.jpg" n="2"/>sending the Hon. Carl H. Lundquist, Assistant Corporation Counsel for the city of Chicago, to represent me officially and to extend my cordial greetings to your fine group. My best wishes for a very enjoyable and memorable occasion.</p>
