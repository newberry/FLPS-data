   <p>Due to the untiring efforts of Miss Lucille Windett, who unselfishly offers her services in engaging professional speakers, especially those closely connected with art, was again able to have Mr. V. R. Shoemaker, cartoonist of the Daily News, speak on the importance of cartooning as a profession on Tuesday of last week at the Filipino Community Center. He was humorously introduced by Mr. M. Makbanua before a crowd of around forty people. Mr. Shoemaker was a very clever speaker. He fascinated his audience with his wholesome humor.</p>
   <p>He illustrated many interesting cartoons, one of which had a double purpose, that of portraying Depression and that of portraying Prosperity in one drawing. He said that a cartoonist is more creative than an artist, and that he could make something out of nothing.</p>
   <p>In response to Filipino hospitality, Mr. J. Risula prepared and served tea and cookies.</p>
