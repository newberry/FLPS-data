  <body>
   <p>Mr. Val Reyes, who is at present employed in the X-Ray Dept., Henrotin Hospital, holds a splendid record during his many years of employment.</p>
   <p>Mr. Reyes is a member of the Ilacos Norte scions, Philippine Islands, and he is here in America for adventure and study. "I am merely trying my best to obtain what I can get in the United States", he said when he was interviewed. The X-Ray technician revealed that he would not for a long time bother himself with love entanglements, for he devoted all his time to the study of his profession.</p>
   <p>Nothing but praise for his industry and generosity can one find from Val's associates, superiors and fellow-workers in the hospital. His intimate friends also find him to be industrious and efficient in his profession.</p>
