   <p>The most unique Rizal Day commemoration in the history of Chicago, since Filipinos have begun residing from way back in 1906, will be held at the Grand Auditorium of the Steuben Club Building when the Associated Filipino Clubs will celebrate the 38th anniversary of the death of Dr. Jose Rizal, Filipino martyr and hero.</p>
   <p>Free Admission.</p>
   <p>The affair will be free to the general public and to all Filipinos and their American friends. It will consist of a literary program and also a dance.</p>
   <p>The literary program will precede the dance. This free affair will be the first of its kind since Filipinos have been celebrating Rizal Day in the city.</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0371.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Among the participants in the literary program will be the winners of the annual oratorical and declamation contest. An invitation has been forwarded to Senator James Hamilton Lewis who is to be the principal speaker. A colorful feature will be the coronation of a queen who will be selected by a committee of prominent citizens of the community.</p>
   <p>Juan de la Paz, chief executive of the Associated Clubs, announced recently that the Rizal Day affair, this year, will be dedicated to true nationalism and to the principles for which the Filipino National Idol gave up his life. It will be a new chapter in the life of the Filipinos in the city.</p>
   <p>Montezon For Toastmaster</p>
   <p>Dr. Apolonio F. Montezon, President of the Filipino Gibbons Society, has accepted the toastmastership. Attorney Marcelino E. Moreno authorization officer of the Veteran's Bureau at Hines, Illinois, is head man of all the committees; Dr. Isidoro L. P. de Vera, of the Dental Staff of the Veteran's Hospital, is chairman of the Social Committee; Dr. Juan G. Udan, (Ph.D.) President of the Filipino Times, is chairman of the Publicity Committee; and Rev. F. Laxamana, of the Filipino Chapel, is chairman of the Program Committee.</p>
