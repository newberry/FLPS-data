   <p>That the Filipino people should be given their complete independence sooner than the time required by the Philippine Independence Act enacted by the United States Congress, is the firm belief of Dr. A.B. Howatt, dentist, at 1588 Milwaukee Ave., Chicago, who is an Oriental sympathizer.</p>
   <p>"I believe that the Filipinos are now able to maintain a stable government," declared the doctor. "The rapid development and progress of the Philippines during the 36 years of American occupation is extraordinary and beyond comparison. No one can deny that the Filipinos are a progressive people. With America's relinquishment, they will be able to develop their own initiative."</p>
   <p>When asked by the reporter of "The Oriental Press" what were his feelings towards the Orientals, Dr. Howatt earnestly replied:</p>
   <pb facs="5427330_0110.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"To be frank with you, I haven't any racial prejudice. The color of a person is of no prime consideration to me. What I consider most in a person is his character. The fact that a person's color is white, brown or yellow does not mean a thing to me if he treats me wrong. I am for square deal and equality."</p>
