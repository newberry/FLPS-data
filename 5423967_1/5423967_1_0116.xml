   <p>It is already known to our readers that in the Russia of today, in the Russia of the sickle and hammer from which we have been expecting so much good for the workmen and peasants, there has been restored the state monopoly of the sale of whiskey.</p>
   <p>The tear's taverns, a name which has been changed now into that of soviet taverns, will again beset the people and rob them of one billion golden roubles every year.</p>
   <p>We have been waiting long and now we have got it. Freedom, education, welfare everything one can wish for -- were at our disposal; but now the green snake has attacked all that and has swallowed it up so that nothing remains.</p>
   <p>As far back as 1915, if I remember correctly, under the tsar's regime there appeared on the pages of one of the Russian magazines an article in which I read what follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0117.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"From all corners of Russia are being sent telegrams with resolutions passed by the zemstvos, towns and village communes, demanding the prohibition of the sale of liquors. Russia has become sober and has soberly considered the problem of drunkenness which has been put before it. During the long years when the state had the monopoly of selling whiskey, and during the few months of temperance enforced by the order of the tsar, Russia had the opportunity to learn all the advantages of a sober life, as compared with a life of drunken revelry, and now the Russian people voluntarily and consciously take their stand for the prohibition of the alcohol snare, not wishing to go back to the horror of the poisoning of the whole nation which had been experienced before.</p>
   <p>"When the Ministerial Council decided to transfer the right of prohibition of the sale of liquors to the organs of local self-government, many of the earnest prohibitionists were against this measure, as they suspected that it was something like a camouflaged repudiation of the principle of absolute prohibition, - the beginning of a wavering in the relentless fight against alcoholism, and that, too, just the next day, after a brilliant victory over the green snake, which, <pb facs="5423967_1_0118.jpg" n="3"/>badly smitten, lay prone in the dust. However, later events proved that the appeal of the government to the organs of local self-government in this important matter of our national regeneration had been quite timely. The prohibition decreed by the tsar's government was achieving its aim, yet it still remained only a prohibitive measure, enforced from the outside, emanating from those higher up. While essentially this measure was in harmony with the demands of the public conscience, it had been realized without the immediate participation of the Russian society itself.</p>
   <p>But now we saw a totally different picture, still more bright and pleasant. Alcohol was being eliminated, no longer by a decree of the administration, but by the spontaneous decision of the awakened thought and will of the people. An eight-month-long experiment in sobriety, when compared with the memories of a long stretch of years full of the horrors caused by the scourge of alcohol, had converted everybody and caused all the people to become staunch supporters of temperance. Agriculturists, owners of factories and workshops, all were declaring with one voice that the elimination of drunkenness had increased the general productivity of the nation's labor at least 30%. This had enabled <pb facs="5423967_1_0119.jpg" n="4"/>the agriculturists to get all the crops into the barns in good time and thus to have everything ready for the sowing season. This helped expand industrial activities, in spite of the fact that many millions of workmen were withdrawn from the labor market, having been called to serve as reservists, occasionally before the normal time for such service was due. The billion roubles which had previously been spent on whiskey had remained in the pockets of our peasants and workmen. This improved the life of their families; created prosperity where previously there had been poverty; reacted favorably on the state of their households, and had created possibilities of still greater well-being in the future.</p>
   <p>Both our economic regeneration in our country and our victories on its borders are intimately connected with the sobriety of our people.</p>
   <p>The unanimous vote of Russia for sobriety inspires us with confidence, and we trust that the green snake, smitten by the decree of the tsar, will not be resurrected from the dead."</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0120.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Yes, in 1915 we were still thinking that the green snake would not be resuscitated. But the snake came back to life again. It has been resuscitated by those men calling themselves communists.</p>
