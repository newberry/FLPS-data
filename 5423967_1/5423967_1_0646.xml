   <p>Adventurers from the Novy Mir [Bolshevik paper published in Russian in New York], with some elements sympathizing with Bolsheviks, have for a long time ceaselessly worked on the creation of "a united front"; but it seems that all their efforts are in vain. The "United front" men are filling up the Bolshevik papers with appeals to the Russian colonists for action, are delivering lectures and holding meetings and conferences; but the Russian still keeps away from the Bolshevik windbags and does not want to listen to their prattle.</p>
   <p>When these "united front" men are asked, "Why do you want a 'united front?'" they, like parrots, give the same answer, "To fight against Fascism and war".</p>
   <p>If these men of the "front" were a little more sensible they would know that with such an answer they could not possibly hope to attract thoughtful people <pb facs="5423967_1_0647.jpg" n="2"/>to their Bolshevik cause, and that some other reason should be given.</p>
   <p>To their stereotyped phrase Russian colonists usually retort: "Well, if you set for yourselves such a task you should organize 'united fronts' in countries where Fascism rules or where wars are going on. Here in America we have neither Fascism nor war." Some other colonists tell them quite openly: "You Bolsheviks are in no way better than Fascists, and for that very reason we do not want to have anything to do with you."</p>
   <p>With such reasoning on the part of our colonists one cannot but agree. Indeed, why do not Bolsheviks create their "fronts" in Japan, Italy, Germany, and other Fascist or semi-Fascist countries instead of in countries where there is no Fascism and no war? Besides, what right have they to indulge in loose talk about Fascist repressions and persecutions when they themselves are the most extreme of reactionaries and constantly defend the Red oppression in Russia?</p>
   <p>Lately the pages of the Bolshevik sheet [the Novy Mir]are full of vituperation <pb facs="5423967_1_0648.jpg" n="3"/>and attacks on Rassviet. Editors of the paper and the "united front" men claim that their efforts directed toward creating a "united front" have been dashed and shattered against obstructions set up largely by Rassviet. "If it were not for Rassviet, "they say, the 'united front' would have been a reality, and the Russians in the United States would be fighting Fascism and war."</p>
   <p>But, of course, Rassviet does not matter in this case. It is the Russian colony which decides the issue. If we Russians could see in the Bolshevik leaders true defenders of freedom and working-class interests, neither Rassviet nor any other paper could keep the Russian colony from joining hands with Bolsheviks in their fight for a "united front". But Russians in America have quite well understood for a long time just who the Bolsheviks are. They are convinced that Bolsheviks, as Fascists, are the blackest of reactionaries, and the worst oppressors and exploiters of the working class. This is why we turn away from the Bolsheviks and their sympathizers.</p>
   <p>If the Bolsheviks connected with the Novy Mir want to know on what terms <pb facs="5423967_1_0649.jpg" n="4"/>Rassviet would agree to join them in fight for a united action we answer them briefly: "on only one condition; namely, when freedom of expression, a general amnesty for political offenders, disarmament, improvements in the situation of workers and peasants--when these things are carried out and fully realized first of all in Russia.</p>
