   <p>He who has not known yet in his life the allurements of a masquerade, should go to the festivity which is to be given by Rado at the Roosevelt Hall, so well known to everybody.</p>
   <p>These words were to be read in a notice of the club Rado, inviting the Russian colony to visit an evening entertainment given by this club.</p>
   <p>In that notice we were told that a "grand masked ball" and "a varied entertainment" were to be given by the club.</p>
   <p>Many of those who have visited that "grand" ball and "varied entertainment," left it in a state of great disappointment, being sorry that they had wasted their time in going there and staying there.</p>
   <p>That entertainment was so miserable, so beggarly poor that one could not find anything there that could hold one's attention even for one minute.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0336.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There was only dancing, and even that was lazy, lifeless. In addition to that, soon things became quite chaotic: there was a large group of young hooligans, foppishly dressed, who were behaving the whole time in a disorderly way.</p>
   <p>These fops were noisy, interfered with the dancing, the speeches of the manager of the entertainment and the performances of the artists, who even apart from these interruptions, were very poor. (One of these young fops, by the by, was ejected with the aid of the police).</p>
   <p>Those who arranged this entertainment belong to the intellectuals, and it is to be regretted that in arranging it they did not think that some sort of spiritual food should be provided for the public, and that order should be kept.</p>
   <p>The first two entertaiments given by the club Rado were not bad, but this last entertainment was the worst we have had in our Russian colony.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0337.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Rado is a young club, and it will hardly attract the attention of the colony if it acts the same way in the future.</p>
