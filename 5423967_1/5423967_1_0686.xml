   <p>During recent months the American communists have received a series of severe blows, from the effects of which they cannot easily recover. The blows have struck at their most vulnerable point--their Bolshevik propaganda, which the American Reds spread most assidiously, especially among the foreign-born elements in this country. As everyone knows, the Red propaganda and, as a matter of fact, the entire structure of the American Communist party, are based on the brazen lies and impudent tales about the Red paradise now to be found in Russia.</p>
   <p>Many American newspapers, from the socialist Forward to the sensation monger sheets published by Hearst, have recently published many interesting articles baring the Bolshevik lies and revealing the true conditions existing today in Soviet Russia. Much revealing material was brought from Russia and given to the American public, through the American press, by three former communists, Lang, <pb facs="5423967_1_0687.jpg" n="2"/>Schmidt, and Bill. Rassviet is publishing now a series of extremely interesting articles on Soviet Russia based on experiences and observations of A. M. Tavdul, former Russian Red, who only recently returned from Russia. He became cured of his Red sympathies after seeing, with his own eyes, the unbelievable hunger, the suffering, the exploitation, and the arbitrary rule of the Red masters. Mr. Tavdul now completely agrees with us that, in Soviet Russia, there is no freedom of thought, of speech, of action, or of movement, and no freedom of regulating one's own life in accordance with one's needs, wishes, or desires. These attributes, characteristic of human liberty, are absolutely unknown to the Russian worker or peasant.</p>
   <p>Some time ago, several thousand Russian workers from the Chicago and Detroit areas, after listening to the impudent Bolshevik propaganda, went to Russia "to build the socialist state and initiate the workers' paradise". Those who signed the contracts and went to Soviet Union to work were later bitterly and terribly disappointed and fully disillusioned. For many of these workers, the entire venture ended in tragedy, either for themselves or for their families.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0688.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Two significant facts stand out from these latest reports on conditions in the Soviet Union. The first fact is that the information and the denouncements come from former ardent communists, who want now to warn the American public against the Red danger. The second important fact is that the American workers who read their daily newspapers now have an opportunity to learn the truth about Soviet Russia and about communism in general from those who had been active members of the Communist party. Mr. Tavdul's articles about Soviet Russia now appearing in Rassviet have a great value to the Russian people; they help to spread the truth about the Soviets and help to solidify public opinion in the struggle against communism. It is the first time in several years that the American people have been able to learn the truth about communism directly from those who had actively participated in grafting the movement on the American soil.</p>
   <p>Americans have to this day a completely mistaken idea that all the Russian people in America belonging to the older, prewar immigration group are communists, while all those who came to this country after the Great War and after the Bolshevik revolution, are all monarchists. The anti-Soviet articles of Mr. Tavdul, who <pb facs="5423967_1_0689.jpg" n="4"/>belongs to the prewar class of Russian immigrants in this country, are good examples of the attitude toward the Soviets of almost every Russian immigrant of the prewar vintage.</p>
   <p>Mr. Tavdul's articles, as well as the articles of the "Minsk Muzhik,â€œ issued in book form by Rassviet, should be translated into the English language and presented to the American public, whether in a form of newspaper and magazine articles or as a book. The American public should be systematically informed about conditions in Soviet Russia. This information service should be well organized and should be based on facts culled by those who visit Russia. Therefore it is important that every Russian returning from a visit to the Soviet Union should communicate to Rassviet any bit of news, any observation made during his stay in Russia. By doing so, he will render great service to the Russian cause. Those who know the English language may write directly to the English language newspapers, others may send their letters in Russian to Rassviet. We, on our part, shall see to it that these letters or their contents reach American readers.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0690.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The truth, reality, and good organization are the only weapons with which we can fight successfully the lies, slanders, and provocations of the communists.</p>
