   <p>Look up the local chronicle in any number of our paper and you will be astonished at the great number of Russian organizations in the city of Chicago.</p>
   <p>You will find notices about the agricultural commune; about the clubs Zvuki Rodiny (Echo from the Homeland) and Lira (Lyre); the Society of Workers in the Arts (Obshchestvo Rabotnikov Iskusstv), the Literary and Dramatic Circle (Literaturno-Dramaticheskiy Krushok), fraternities, Russian restaurants, labor organizations, the Independent Society, schools, etc.</p>
   <p>Lectures, evening entertainments, gatherings, massmeetings,theatrical performances.</p>
   <p>About two years ago that section was a very poor one. Now it is rich in information.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0385.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This is something to rejoice about; it is the best proof of the fact that the Russian colony is alive.</p>
   <p>The most consoling part of it is that among all these organizations there are many which carry on a work of enlightenment and spiritual education.</p>
   <p>The Russian colony of Chicago is a small spot in which is reflected the spiritual life of our great native country ... A powerful call has been heard among us, Man does not live by bread alone. We have been impressed by this call and ... we open schools, organize clubs which work for enlightenment; we learn, we aspire.</p>
   <p>We welcome this new life-giving influence which makes itself felt in the Russian colony.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0386.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Let this powerful influence find a way into the home of every Russian immigrant; let it light in everyone of us an aspiration for active life, for knowledge and light.</p>
