   <p>The writer of the letter to the editor wishes to answer the letter of a man who had written asking for the names of Russian organizations in Chicago (ed. note--the paper is evidently in New York.) He says that he has lived six months in Chicago and has learned of several organizations here. They are: The Group of Socialist-Rev-olutionaries, The Group of Social-Democrats, The Hand (Ruka) of Aid to the Russian Revolution. They give two or three plays and concerts a season. And this is Chic-ago with the largest Russian Colony outside New York. There are organized groups in other cities and only in Chicago is there a lack of necessary organizations.</p>
   <p>Ed. note--The name at the end has been almost completely torn off but enough remains to identify the writer as, in all probability, Dr. H. R. R.Krasnow, (at this period be signed himself Kraszikii).</p>
