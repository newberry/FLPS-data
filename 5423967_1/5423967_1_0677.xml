   <p>In the August 14 issue of Rassviet there appeared an article, under the title "Bright Words and Dark Reality," signed by Mr. Alexeev. In his article Mr. Alexeev proposes some fundamental changes in the national viewpoint of the Russian group in America. He suggests, for instance, that the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society should adopt, at its approaching convention, the Marxist principles, by embracing which, Mr. Alexeev states, the society could once and for all depart from the old capitalistic methods of business. He also advocates a new social system of education for children. Mr. Alexeev also recommends, with the insistence of a fanatic, the liquidation by violence and massacre of the entire Russian intelligentsia living in America, and the destruction of every trace and vestige of the great contributions of Russian intellectuals to the life, culture, and education of Russian immigrants and uneducated former peasants.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0678.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These statements of a communist, Alexeev, are intended to engender suspicion, enmity, and hate among the Russian masses, and to create in the minds of the common people a feeling of distrust, hostility, and scorn toward the Russian educated class. The chief underlying aim of Mr. Alexeev in sowing his seeds of evil among our people was to destroy our national culture, our language, and all other things which hold us together as a national group.</p>
   <p>Speaking in his article about education for Russian children, Mr. Alexeev simply declares that our children should not be taught the Russian language, or Russian culture, or religion, and that no political or national history should be taught to Russian children.</p>
   <p>Mr. Alexeev regards all independent thought, progress, and evolution as very harmful to the Russian-American youth. Instead, he suggests a Marxist collective system of education, in order to produce a generation of class-conscious workers and fighters for a communist world order.</p>
   <p>This writer solemnly protests against all these absurd propositions of <pb facs="5423967_1_0679.jpg" n="3"/>Mr. Alexeev, and against his baseless insinuations and attacks directed at the Russian intelligentsia. This writer himself belongs to the Russian peasant class which Mr. Alexeev tries so hard to save from the "destructive" influence of the Russian intelligentsia. Yet, were it not for the helpful hand of the intelligentsia and for the influence the Russian educated class exerted upon the uneducated peasants, millions of Russians, including this writer, would still remain in complete darkness. Only because of the work and sacrifice of the Russian intellectual class, of writers, teachers, artists, and technicians, were the downtrodden, ignorant Russian peasants and factory workers able to lose some of their ignorance and to gain some enlightenment and culture. I, as a worker, peasant, and member of the American community, again lodge my strong opposition to the usurpation, by representatives of Marxism and communism, of the right to speak in the name of Russian or of American workers. I demand of Mr. Alexeev that he point out publicly all the alleged poisons with which the Russian educated class is supposed to poison the minds of the Russian workers. I challenge Mr. Alexeev first to present public indictment, setting forth all the charges he makes against the <pb facs="5423967_1_0680.jpg" n="4"/>Russian intellectuals, before he starts pronouncing them guilty, and before he sets out to incite the masses against the intelligentsia.</p>
   <p>I propose that the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society ignore Mr. Alexeev's suggestions concerning the reorganization of the society to the leftward, and continue, as before, its useful work of guarding the old principles upon which the organization was built and developed to its present strength.</p>
