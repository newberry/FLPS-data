   <p>Many years ago the Independent Society inserted in its bylaws a special clause which states that the Society must carry on cultural and educational work among its members and must open new schools and maintain the existing Russian language schools for Russian children. At almost every annual convention this question is raised, and invariably a resolution is adopted concerning the opening of schools in connection with each branch of R. I. M. A. S.</p>
   <p>To the honor of the most active [members] one must say that these resolutions of the conventions are being lived up to, and most of the recommendations are being realized. The network of Russian schools in connection with the branches is being rapidly extended, and we are certain that the time will come when every child of Russian parentage will know the Russian language. We already have our schools in Detroit, Benton Harbor, Kenosha, Pullman, and in many other places.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0074.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In Chicago the Krylov School carries on its activity in close collaboration with our Branch Number Eighteen. The Bunin School works in close co-operation with Branch Number One, and it is very desirable that Branch Number Three shall assume responsibility for the school on Wood Street.</p>
   <p>People preserve their identity only as long as they preserve their language, and the Russian people in America will preserve their nationality only as long as they speak the Russian tongue. Our children's schools help a great deal in preserving the Russian language. By experience we know that only those children who have attended such schools like to speak and actually do speak Russian.</p>
   <p>Russian-language children's schools are necessary here also because they teach children correct Russian and help them to get rid of the errors which creep into the language through the influence of improper home surroundings and of the language which they learn in American schools. Their mother tongue becomes more <pb facs="5423967_1_0075.jpg" n="3"/>grammatical and more polished, and they acquire what we may properly call the literary language.</p>
   <p>ROOV [Translator's note: Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society] on its page in Rassviet has called our attention to the fact that the convention recently held of the teachers of Carpathian Russia adopted a resolution to the effect that teaching in all schools of that country should be conducted in the literary Russian language and not in the dialect which had theretofore been employed. The convention was attended by nearly a thousand delegates. This news should gladden the heart of every Russian and remind him of the strength of the Russian people and of the mighty influence exerted by it, of the greatness of that family to which he has the honor to belong. But we must be people who deserve to bear the great name of Russian. It is possible that all Carpathian Russians in the United States will introduce the Russian language as a required subject in their schools, and it is to be regretted that the Russian colony is not prepared <pb facs="5423967_1_0076.jpg" n="4"/>to take this step and has no teaching personnel with which to supply the Carpathian Russian schools to teach the Russian language and Russian literature.</p>
   <p>At any rate, R. I. M. A. S. does a big job. It awakens national self-consciousness among its members and prompts them to take an interest in Russian culture. It compels them to send their children to the Russian-language schools. Some day our children or grandchildren will express their gratitude to the administration of R. I. M. A. S., for we are absolutely convinced that nothing good done in this world fails to yield good results, and thus the self-sacrificing efforts of our members will not have been in vain.</p>
