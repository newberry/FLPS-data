<title level="a">AT THE BOLSHEVIKS' MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last Sunday, January 15, at the quarters of Obzhorka (Gluttony Inn), a meeting by the managers of the "Federation Schools" was held at which leaders of the bolshevik "Center" promised to show the difference between the "Workers'" (bolsheviki's) and "White Guards'" (independents') schools.</p>
   <p>Did they show us the difference?</p>
   <p>Let the reader, himself judge. All the bolshevik "leaders" namely: Mornell, Deviatkin, Ebergardt, Seoeff, Klimko and others appeared and spoke.</p>
   <p>I am submitting their speeches in the order they were given. First to step out was Mornell, who began to read an item from the newspaper Rassviet, which would tend to show that the White Guards with the aid of the Independents were willing to destroy the bolsheviki's schools. His speech ended with this statement.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0245.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The second to step out was Seoeff, formerly a White Guard officer. "Comrades", declared Seoeff, "I am very often denounced because although I was formerly a White Guard officer, I now work together with the bolsheviki. Do not reproach me, you know that I must eat, and since the bolsheviki feed me, naturally, my duty is to defend them. To save our schools, I recommend that we declare a boycott on Rassviet; by so doing, we will doom Rassviet to pardition and it will not bother us any more".</p>
   <p>Third to step out was Klimko, the footman of Deviatkin. He roared all over the room: "Comrades, the White Guard Voronko has organized a pogrom at the Douglas Park School; the children of Independents beat up our children (--when?). This, comrades, is a worse form of terror than was that of 1905 in Russia..... This Belogvardeyshchina (White Guard) is worse than any vermin; you can kill vermin, but the cursed White Guard, no matter how often we strike at it, continues to raise its head. I ask you, comrades, to declare a war on the White Guards, and to wipe out those vermin.....forever."</p>
   <p>The fourth Oratel (the bawler) [sarcastically used] to step out was Deviatkin.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0246.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Raising his hands, as if in prayer to God, he bawled at the top of his lungs: "Comrades, one of our members has been converted into a counterrevolutionist, he is the abominable Joseph Moroz! So far as we are concerned, he is worse than any White Guard. We must nail him to the post of disgrace, because that abominable person knows all of our schemes, he already has written to Rassviet about our business, he intends to write more. I summon you, comrades, to reorganize our organization. To the devil with bolshevism! To hell with communism! Let us be organized into a professional union, then the Independents will take off their hats and salute us. But when the American Government recognizes the bolsheviks, then not one of the White Guards will remain in Chicago."</p>
   <p>Deviatkin offers a very good plan; organize under the guise of professional unions! He knows that if America decides to recognize the bolsheviks, then the American Government will know where to deport all of the bolsheviks, because Russia, unrecognized, does not admit any of the deported. And Deviatkin is afraid of being sent to Soviet Russia; he prefers to attain his old <pb facs="5423967_1_0247.jpg" n="4"/>age in a capitalist country.</p>
   <p>The professional unions, however, according to Deviatkin's plan, will lead and direct bolshevik propaganda, but in the eyes of American Government they will be classified only as unions, and of course, it is understood that the American Government will not persecute them.</p>
   <p>The fifth speaker was Ebergardt, who said that the boycott of Rassviet, as comrade Seoeff proposed, would not help, and that the Independents have the backing and support of the peasants; to crush them it would be necessary to find other means.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, Mornell spoke again: "I am against the boycott of Rassviet. I have to buy that newspaper daily, because I am studying. This cursed Be logvardeyshchina (White Guard) has run away from us, and we have no one to teach us. We do not have anyone who is more or less educated."</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0248.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Here you are; do you see to what lengths the bolsheviki's demonstration in favor of the Federated Schools, in preference to the Independents, has led them? Insult, calumny, lying, and even personal threats (the incident with Moroz), are used.</p>
   <p>The bolsheviks at this meeting certainly proved one thing--that their attack upon the Independents disrupted their own ranks, and that they fight among themselves.</p>
   <p>In the meantime the Independents, in spite of the malicious slander of the Mornells and Deviatkins, have gained a good deal in the colony. It is necessary to continue even more energetically the project of organizing the independent youth, and then the Deviatkins and Monells will return to that place from which they have come.</p>
   <p>An invisible hat.</p>
