   <p>There were in Chicago in the fall of 1913 two Russian branches of the Socialist Party. One of them had its headquarters in Hull House, and the other - called Branch Number Four - had its headquarters at 1233 No. Robey Street. I. Laveter, one of the oldest and most active members of the Russian colony in Chicago, was the secretary of branch one. Other officers of the branch were Khadmovich, Levitt, and Statuyev. The officers of branch four in the second half of 1913 were N. Ratoff, secretary; N. Matass, financial secretary; K. Nikiforoff, treasurer, and Poladneff, librarian. To these names should be added Maximenko, who became the recording secretary in June, 1914; Kravetz, who was elected financial secretary in June, 1914; Juk, Gaidalovich, Bell, Ivan Lagoda, Stolar, and Likhachov, members of the executive committee during that period. Bell died in Chicago in 1918; Likhachov, a few years later in Russia. Lagoda has been a resident of New York since 1918.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0582.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The executive committee of branch one (from June, 1914, to the end of 1915) consisted of the following: Loktev, Silin, Gerin, Zurman, Statuyev, and Laveter (died in Chicago in 1933, I think).</p>
   <p>Chicago at that period was also the headquarters of the Oblastnoy Commitet (Regional Committee) of the Russian branches of the Socialist party in northwestern states. The committee was elected at a special conference, which took place in Chicago in January, 1913, and consisted of the following (according to Novyi Mir of Jan. 17, 1913): Belousoff, former member of the Russian Duma; Rusoff, Stolar, Statuyev, and Nikiforoff. Belouseff, the secretary, had to leave Chicago for Minneapolis, and was replaced (in November, 1913) by Ratoff. Ratoff died in the Soviet Union a few years ago.</p>
   <p>Besides the two branches in Chicago, there were three in three neighboring <pb facs="5423967_1_0583.jpg" n="3"/>cities: Kenosha, Wis., where the leading spirit for years was a mechanic and Russian Social-Democrat, Chumak, executed by White officers in Eastern Siberia, 1918-19; Milwaukee, Wis., where the leader was an old metal worker from St. Petersburg, Timoshenko, also a Social-Democrat, now in Detroit; and Rockford, Ill., whose leaders' names I do not recall.</p>
   <p>Since I joined Branch Four, I am better acquainted with its activities than with any other. This branch became in 1917 a large mass organization with hundreds of members, but even in 1914 it was an active cultural and Socialist organization. An example of its activities is revealed in the semi-annual report of its officers, as published in Novyi Mir for July, 1914. During a six-month period the branch organized eleven free lectures with an average attendance of forty at each lecture. Also, five larger educational meetings with an average attendance of 250. The branch's library had 102 <pb facs="5423967_1_0584.jpg" n="4"/>subscribers. Among the lecturers should be mentioned Michael Berg (alias Grusenberg), director and owner of the Berg Progressive Preparatory School, 2058 W. Division Street; a member of the branch, under the name of Borodin, who is now editor-in-chief of the Moscow News. Also, Dr. R. Krasnow, a physician still residing in Chicago; Ratoff, Likhachov, Stolar, and M. Khinoy. Later this list was increased with the names of L. Geruss, ex-member of the Second Russian Duma; Dr. Knopfnagel, Ozol (also an ex-member of the Duma from Latvia, who lectured once); Nabatoff, from Detroit; Chumak, from Kenosha; Timoshenko, from Milwaukee, and Derman, a Lettish writer, from New York. The list is far from being complete, for there were occasional lectures by other people, Doctor Sahud - a Chicago resident - among them. However, mention should be made of two lecturers who were especially active in the years 1915-16, and part of 1917. One of them is now in Russia; Kievsky is his name. The other one, M. Polak, a brilliant speaker and <pb facs="5423967_1_0585.jpg" n="5"/>lecturer, died from influenza in 1920 (?)</p>
   <p>From time to time lecturers came from New York. Among them was the secretary of the Russian Federation - Melnichansky - at present a discarded leader of Soviet trade unions; Madame Alexandra Kollantai, now Soviet Ambassador to Norway, who visited the United States in December, 1915 - January, 1916; and Nikolai Bukharin, who later became a leader of the Soviet Union and of the Communist International and, still later, an alleged Trotskyist counter-revolutionary.</p>
   <p>Russian Branch No. Four, as mentioned before, had in 1913 its headquarters at 1233 N. Robey Street. From there it moved to 1206 N. Hoyne Avenue. This place, however, was burned down in November, 1914. The next headquarters were established at 2131 Evergreen Avenue, where, in addition to the meeting place and library, there also functioned <pb facs="5423967_1_0586.jpg" n="6"/>a night school for members and non-members. The school had four instructors: Dr. Knopfnagel, Kievsky, Polak, and Khinoy. All working without remuneration, naturally.</p>
