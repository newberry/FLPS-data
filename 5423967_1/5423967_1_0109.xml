   <p>A notice to the Russian colony implores adult Russians to avail themselves of the opportunity offered by public night schools, beginning in the autumn, to learn English. The writer also mentions one private school (Chicago Preparatory School), where a fee of $15 is charged for a course in English to beginners.</p>
   <p>Without mincing words, the writer admonishes his people to prefer an intimate knowledge of the American tongue to an intimate knowledge of American whiskey. He points out that rather than 'cuss' at the damned English language, they will profit much more by learning it, since without knowledge of it they are as much at a disadvantage as an infant or a deaf-mute. He points out that the very forces of nature are in favor of learning the language of the land in night school, without any charges. "The sultry summer evenings have passed, and the parks are no longer inviting you to spend time there. Time hangs on one, not knowing what to do with <pb facs="5423967_1_0110.jpg" n="2"/>(the) long fall and winter evenings. The best remedy for it is to go to school."</p>
