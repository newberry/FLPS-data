   <p>During depressions the Russian peasants and workers in America became organized and created brotherhoods and various progressive organizations. At the same time they founded Russian schools in order to enable their children to learn the Russian language. It was very difficult to find professional teachers and to defray school expenses.</p>
   <p>The majority of Russian workers and peasants up to this time, did not really understand the importance of teaching Russian to their children. Professional teachers are able to show along what lines a child should develop its faculties so as to achieve lifelong happiness. On the other hand, a poorly qualified teacher can spoil the child's mind and morality for his whole life. The reason is that a qualified teacher may be able to suggest to the child a tendency toward higher ideals, enrich its mind with constructive knowledge, and show it possibilities of attaining a higher education. A qualified teacher might be able to ascertain a child's capacities and talent, and show it the right path to follow in its development. At the same time, half-illiterate Bolshevik teachers and politicians can in a short time corrupt and pervert a child's entire life, kill its desire to learn the Russian language and stifle its interest for study. The child, losing this interest, may remain uneducated for the rest of its life.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0167.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In America, an illiterate man usually works hard and for his toil gets small pay. Those who have been born in America do not like to work hard, but they like to live in comfort. Young people who adopt such a view of life become entangled in various criminal activities and finally land in jail or a reformatory. Nevertheless, some parents show a very strange attitude toward those who refuse to send their children to Russian schools and do not want to support really qualified and honest teachers. Without any knowledge of the Russian language, a child becomes estranged from its parents. This is especially true in families where parents do not speak English. Very often a ten or thirteen year old child becomes disrespectful toward its parents and even threatens to leave them. Under such circumstances, the parents lose authority over their children and often have to undergo much suffering as a result.</p>
   <p>It is necessary to arrange lectures and various meetings pertaining to this matter, and invite competent lecturers who will explain to people how to protect their children from being enticed to lead a life of crime. In the United States there is plenty of literature explaining the necessity of a rational bringing up of children. There are also many magazines for children and parents, published in the English language.</p>
   <p>In my opinion, it would be much more profitable for the parents to have competent <pb facs="5423967_1_0168.jpg" n="3"/>and qualified teachers of the Russian language, than to leave their children at the mercy of fate without giving them any education.</p>
