   <p>In the Russian-American press in general, and in Rassviet in particular, during the last several years there have been frequent discussions of the question of a closer union among the many groups and factions of the Russian people in America. Not long ago, Rassviet published a lengthy editorial concerning the advisability of calling a general all-Russian convention, which could lay the foundation for closer union among Russians in this country.</p>
   <p>We must state with regret that all our efforts to arouse public interest in this matter have failed completely. As a national group, we have been standing still, and have been making no progress. It is true that some of our organizations have increased their memberships, but this increase, rather slight, is unimportant when compared with our other problems and with the great many thousands of Russians in America still unattached to any Russian organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0183.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Some persons in our group explain this grievous condition by the fact that the Russian immigrants in America belong to two separate groups, each of which differs somewhat from the other. There is the old Russian immigration group, dating back to prewar days, and there is the group of those who came to this country in recent years. The psychology of the two groups is different. In our opinion, however, this is not the reason for our slow progress. For, how can be explained the fact that even the old-time Russian immigrants are not united. Almost all Russian organizations in this country are composed of men who belong to the "old guard" class of Russian immigrants, yet there is no unity among them. They are split into many political, social and religious factions and cannot agree on any single question. The overwhelming majority of them is composed of religious people, yet they cannot agree even on matters of religion.</p>
   <p>The younger immigration group has the same faults and traits as the older group; It, too, is divided into cliques opposing and fighting each other.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0184.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The lack of unity between themselves among both groups of the Russian immigrants in this country is the real cause of their extremely slow development and actual backwardness in many phases of their group life. The Russian people in America are still far below other national groups in their social, cultural and educational development.</p>
   <p>The Russian people in America will become united only when each and every Russian learns to regard the common good as higher than his own political views and other personal considerations. In the first place, the leaders of various Russian organizations should set the good example to the other members of their organizations, and to all the Russian people, by forgetting their differences and their quarrels, and by uniting all their efforts toward one single aim--the unification of all Russian people in America.</p>
