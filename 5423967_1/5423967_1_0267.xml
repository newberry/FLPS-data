   <p>The Carnival of Nations, sponsored by the Daily News, was held with great success last Saturday at the Chicago Stadium. Fifteen thousand people attended.</p>
   <p>Twenty-five different national groups and prominent American artists participated in the Carnival. Among the latter were prima ballerina Ruth Pryor, radio star Jane Froman, B. Bernie, V. Lopez, "Amos and Andy", dancer Vera Mirowa and others. The Scandinavian, Welsh and Ukrainian choirs were the stars of the evening.</p>
   <p>There was no Russian group at the Carnival despite the fact that the Daily News had stated the Russiah group would appear on the program, and in addition had printed the names of P. Grib, I. Antziferoff and other artists who had promised to appear on the program at the Chicago Stadium.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0268.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There were even pictures of some of the artists, but none of them participated. The Russian colony was represented by Lila Volkov who performed a Russian dance.</p>
   <p>It is a shame that the Russian artists, of whom there are so many in Chicago, for some unknown reason did not feel that it was their duty and privilege to introduce Russian art to an audience of fifteen thousand.</p>
   <p>This time the Russian colony brought shame upon itself; such behavior makes us look cheap before the other national groups.</p>
   <p>If the Russian artists had no intention of participating in the Carnival, they should not have advertised themselves in the newspaper, thus declaring openly that they were not interested in glorifying Russian art.</p>
