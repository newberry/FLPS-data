   <p>On August 3, 1924 at 3 o'clock P:M in the building of the Y. M. C. A. an organizational meeting of the local branch of the National Russian Christian Students Union in the United States was held. At this meeting a constitution for the Union was accepted, which is already active in New York, San Francisco and Seattle. The problems of the Union include mutual aid, the establishment of a spiritual bond between America and Russia, the support of the Russian ideals in America, and so on.</p>
   <p>In the spring of the current year it was resolved to keep the constitution absolutely out of politics. The organization of this Union is assisted by the secretary of the Y. M. C. A. Mr. Bowers, who at the same time, promises his support (according to the circumstances). At this gathering as the secretary of the Union, the student Papov was elected. All desiring to become members of this Union, students and also non-students, who desire to support this beginning, can apply to:</p>
