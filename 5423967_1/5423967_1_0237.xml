   <p>Almost in every number of the Rassviet one can find some article about the lack of unity and cooperation between the various Russian clubs and societies in Chicago, and the harm which this state of affairs causes to the local Russian colony. The author of the article the title of which appears above, points out that the Russian group in Chicago is not as helpless as it may appear, because of its lack of proper organization. There are many able literary men, musicians, artists, lecturers, etc., among the Chicago Russians, and if they would only cooperate, they could achieve great things and help the Russian colony to occupy the place which should properly belong to it among the other foreign groups of Chicago. "But," says Mr. Yerin, "we Russians lack organization. We lack solidarity. We lack mutual good will, we lack national feeling; we do not value properly all the good things that we possess, and this makes us weak, both materially and spiritually. Because of this state <pb facs="5423967_1_0238.jpg" n="2"/>of things, we are unable to create anything, not even to preserve that which has been created by our ancestors and contemporaries, our great artists and thinkers."</p>
   <p>The author mentions the unification which has been achieved to a certain extent between the various Russian "societies for mutual aid," and points out the great advantages that have resulted even from this incomplete unification; and he says that this important work of unification and coordination of activities should be continued and transferred also to the other Russian organizations.</p>
   <p>"The more organized we shall be," says the author, "the stronger we shall become, and then the other nationalities will respect us more, and our colony will conquer that place which it should rightfully occupy in the civic and economic life of the nation. Let us imitate the Germans, Poles, Czecho-Slovaks and others. We see what place they have conquered in the municipal and other institutions."</p>
