   <p>The strike of the West Side bakers is nearing its end. Almost all the employers gave in and signed a contract with the union. They gave in because the Jewish population refused to buy bread without a label. Only one large firm, Shapiro &amp; Newman on Maxwell Street is still obstinate. But here too the population, chiefly Russian peasants, is looking for a label when they buy a loaf of bread. As a result the clever bosses began to slap false labels on their scab bread. The union detected this and filed suit. The bosses were arrested and later let out on bail. At present they are obliged to abandon their trick, and are again selling their bread without a label.</p>
   <p>Comrades of that region are asked to watch closely that storekeepers do not sell bread without union labels.</p>
