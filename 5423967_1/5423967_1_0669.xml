   <p>The American press informs us that during the economic crisis the consumption of newsprint has increased considerably in all democratic countries. This means that during the depression period the number of newspaper readers has also increased.</p>
   <p>Accounts published by American libraries indicate that during the past year the demand for books also has been increasing very rapidly.</p>
   <p>All this shows conclusively that since the depression began, people have taken a more lively interest in reading, and thus the old adage that "it is an ill wind that blows nobody good" is confirmed once more.</p>
   <p>In the dictatorship countries, on the contrary, the consumption of newsprint during the depression has been reduced. The totals of newspaper circulation in these countries continue to show a drop, for people are interested very <pb facs="5423967_1_0670.jpg" n="2"/>little in reading government-controlled and much-censored party and official publications.</p>
   <p>Thus, for instance, in England during 1927, consumption of newsprint reached the total of 844,000 tons, and by 1934 it rose to 1,291,000 tons.</p>
   <p>In the United States, due mainly to reduction of advertising space contracted for, and consequent reduction in the number of pages, though not in the totals of circulation, the consumption of newsprint has decreased from 3,778,810 tons in 1929 to 2,680,619 tons in 1934.</p>
   <p>In France, during the year 1927, 235,000 tons of paper were used, and during 1934 the consumption amounted to over 400,000 tons. Like increases in consumption of newsprint during the last few years were observed in all other countries where freedom of the press still exists.</p>
   <p>In England, during the past year, the consumption of paper reached the figure <pb facs="5423967_1_0671.jpg" n="3"/>of 57.5 pounds per capita of population. The United States took second place in this respect; Australia and New Zealand third; Argentina, fourth; and then followed Holland, France, and the Scandinavian countries.</p>
   <p>In Germany, in a country which always prided itself on the highest percentage of literate people, the consumption of newsprint has fallen, during the National Socialist regime, to 11.6 pounds, and in Fascist Italy, to 3.6 pounds. The last place among civilized nations, as far as consumption of paper is concerned, is occupied by Soviet Russia, where the per capita use of paper is only 2.4 pounds.</p>
   <p>In the dictatorship countries, all newspapers are alike. Thus, for instance, Moscow Izvestia is the official organ of the Soviet government, and Pravda is the official organ of the Communist party, but one is not distinguishable from the other save only in the form and type used. The same is true of all newspapers either in Germany or Italy. For that very reason the <pb facs="5423967_1_0672.jpg" n="4"/>cultured reader is not interested in such newspapers.</p>
   <p>In countries where freedom of the press still exists many people read not one but many newspapers, and this is the reason why the consumption of newsprint in the free countries is increasing, instead of falling, as is the case in the countries ruled by the dictators.</p>
