<title level="a">IS IT POSSIBLE TO UNITE WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI?</title><title level="a" type="sub">by N. Sidorovich</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>In the Novyi Mir (The New World), the evening before the annual assembly of the first branch of the Rnzov - Russkoe Nezavisimoe Obshchestvo Vzaimoponoshchi (Russian Independent Mutual Aid Society), an article appeared in which the following was stated: "We and you, Independents, are both labor organizations and therefore we must unite for the common cause."</p>
   <p>In regards to that article, I want to say a few words. Under no circumstances can there be any thought of uniting the Independents and the Bolsheviki, because the organization of the Independents is composed of free and equal people. Real freedom lies in the fact that the life and conduct of an individual as well as the whole nation is not dictated. Equality is the natural right of the people in order that they may participate in all physical and spiritual blessings and may have complete freedom for the development of their abilities. We renounce <pb facs="5423967_1_0261.jpg" n="2"/>any form of dictatorship in the transition to a new political regine. The Independents are against the dictatorship of the Bolsheviki over the Russian nation.</p>
   <p>Bolshevism, which grew and developed under the difficult conditions of a realistic situation, is the practical theory of socialism. Bolshevism is socialism dressed in a Russian blouse. The main problem of the Bolsheviki consists in enslaving the Russian nation and establishing their dictatorship. It is a necessary weapon to uphold Bolsheviki power. The Bolsheviki do not believe in freedom and equality of the people, they do not permit freedom of speech, press, and organization, regarding them as bourgeois prejudice, and old-fashioned rubbish. In short, there should be no talk of ideal or practical relations between the Independents and the Bolsheviks, and any suggestion in favor of such unity must be rejected.</p>
   <p>But there is a skeleton in every family. There are Independents who directly or indirectly talk in favor of common cause with the Bolsheviks. They are the so-called Bolsheviki's fish that are caught but do not bring any benefit to <pb facs="5423967_1_0262.jpg" n="3"/>anyone.</p>
   <p>I openly declare; if you Messrs. Bolsheviks were not a detriment to the progressive movement of mankind, if you really were willing to help the Russian nation, and followed the voice of truth, then your victory would not be delayed. But you still think of how to become majors, municipal counselors, and how to attain power; that attitude should be destroyed. If you had not tried to live selfishly at a time when the poor laborers died from hunger, if you would throw out that dirt called politics, and work together with all the workers, with the Russian nation, then your actions would be worthy and would create something beneficial for yourselves as well. But your present actions only show that you are traitors and enemies of the Russian nation.</p>
