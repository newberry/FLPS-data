   <p>The removal of alcoholism, from the medical point of view, not only helps the health of the people, but also raises the moral level of a country. The world is experiencing the terrors of war, says the writer, but they pale before the terrors of alcoholism, Only recently have doctors fought alcholism. That was considered the duty of the clergy. But now the doctors are actively in the fight.</p>
   <p>The press plays an important part in this struggle. It did good work in fighting tuberculosis and typhus. Thanks to the press, people now go to clinics and get treatment. Although tuberculosis is caused largely by social-economic conditions, the press has done much in lessening its ravages... The cooperation of press and medical profession is necessary in fighting epidemics. If the people will listen, the press can help save many useful lives.</p>
   <p>Domashnii Vrach is one of the weapons against the ills and misfortune arising from ignorance. Therefore the reader is asked to send his mite for this purpose and to circulate the magazine among his friends and acquaintances.</p>
