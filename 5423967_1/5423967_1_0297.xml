   <p>The author of this article, Dmitri Nyeghin, points out the existence of much fanatical intolerance among the Russians in Chicago, which is often manifested when various questions are discussed at meetings of different societies. Religiously-minded people attack those inimical to religion or holding religious views differing from their own; atheists fiercely attack all religious views; Communists attack all those holding non-Communistic views, etc. The author of the article points out how harmful such an attitude is to the interests of the Russian colony, and says that the numerous meetings of the various branches of the Independent Society for Mutual Aid should be a school where people holding various political and religious views should learn how to talk to each other in a friendly, courteous way, trying to understand each other better than before. He appeals to all Russians in <pb facs="5423967_1_0298.jpg" n="2"/>Chicago to unite around this non-partisan society and the Chicago Russian Daily Herald and Rassviet, and to work harmoniously for the common welfare of the Russian colony, forgetting often superficial differences and remembering the important fact that in spite of these differences they are all children of poor, struggling Russia, and as such should help each other in all useful undertakings as good friends and brothers.</p>
