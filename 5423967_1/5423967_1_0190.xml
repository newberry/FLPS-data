   <p>In analyzing the activity of the Russian colony in America one is constrained to admit that its social work is carried on with extreme weakness. The cause of this weakness remains the same--lack of organization among a great majority of its members, It is true that a small minority in the colony joined mutual aid societies; but, in comparison with the total number of Russians residing in the United States and Canada, their membership represents only a small fraction of the colony. Some small part of the Russian colony belongs to church brotherhoods, but its membership is also very insignificant. There are some other Russian organizations in the cities, but their memberships, too, are very small; they carry on their work independently of other organizations. In other words, if we look impartially upon the social activity among Russians, we come to the conclusion that the Russian colony in the United States still slumbers.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to establish the reasons for slothfulness and indifference among Russian colonists in America. Many regard unemployment as one of the <pb facs="5423967_1_0191.jpg" n="2"/>contributing factors. Idleness, they claim, killed every desire to do any social work. Others find the explanation in the fiasco suffered by the Russian Revolution, in which the colony had placed so many hopes. These hopes and expectations have not been justified by the subsequent events. Some other people see in our illiteracy the main cause of our slumber.</p>
   <p>Undoubtedly, unemployment has had something to do with the sentiments of the people, and has put them in a difficult situation; however, all people are suffering from unemployment and not the Russians alone. Moreover, one should not think that everything in life is lost irrevocably. Without faith there can be no joy in life, As regards the fiasco which led to the Russian Revolution, only the Russian people [in Russia] suffer from it. The Russian colony in the United States suffers only mentally, not physically. We can help the Russian people there only by positive action only, by propaganda against the Bolsheviks and not by sorrowing and moaning. People with conviction and fortitude give all their energy in fighting the evil and do not get discouraged, unlike the Russians in America, who shut themselves off from the rest of the world and live like clams within their own shells.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0192.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>With reference to the backwardness and illiteracy prevailing among the Russian colonists one may speak only with a sense of regret and a feeling of heartache. The core of the matter lies in the old Russian immigrants who have lived in America not less than twenty years. During this period there were opportunities present for them to proceed on the road to knowledge, and to learn a great deal. Despite this, the old Russian colony remained on the same cultural level that it occupied at the time of its coming to this country. Only individual persons attempted to improve themselves culturally, while the preponderant majority remained oblivious to the benefits of education. Thus, illiteracy must be considered as the main cause of our backwardness in organizational work. If the Russian colony were more cultured and more enlightened, its social life would be entirely different from what we observe now. Just look at the manner in which the Russian colony approaches the problem of school education for its children, the questions of the press, books, Russian concerts, and lectures, and at once it becomes obvious that education and cultural development are the last things in which the colony is interested. If the colonists continue to lead that kind of life in the future, they will always remain at the dead center point in so far as social work is <pb facs="5423967_1_0193.jpg" n="4"/>concerned.</p>
   <p>The worst of all is that attitude of theirs which permits them to think that they know everything, and that there is nothing that they can learn. This very unhealthy state of mind accounts for the fact that people did not go to schools and did not read books. Matters have gone so far that it is impossible to criticize anybody. One can only praise and flatter every giftless, indolent man. As a consequence, our press should continue to subject to severe criticism every unsound opinion or attitude among the Russian colonists. This criticism will help the colony to find a more direct path toward education and culture. There is enough self-praise already. We should frankly and openly regard the truth, then we shall know ourselves and our defects. When we attain that stage we shall become more educated and more active in social affairs.</p>
