   <p>Among us Russians, there aften arises curious discussions about the education of children. This shows acknowledgement of the importance of better education of our children and, of their preparation for life. It cannot be said, that the children of America are deprived of care and attention! Yet, we would like to draw the attention of the public to something, to which we are accustomed and which therefore we do not heed. We are hinting at "dimes, candy, and shows."</p>
   <p>There is not one country in the whole world, where candy and shows for children would be in such great demand as they are in America. It would not be hard to imagine a street in any provincial American town without a grocery or bakery. But it would be almost impossible to imagine a street without a candy store with cheap candy for children. Not seldom you can find candy even within the walls of schools.</p>
   <p>Most buyers at candy stores are children, and that is, where the dimes of the parents go. This would not be so bad, if we did not know that the excessive <pb facs="5423967_1_0170.jpg" n="2"/>use of sugar, especially in childhood, tends to develop Scrophulosis, all kinds of inflamation of the eyes, catarrhs and also annemia. And that is not all--. The school children acquire a habit of chewing gum, from which they cannot desist, even during school hours. Being occupied with chewing gum, they certainly cannot concentrate their attention on the subjects taught. Besides candy and dimes, there are all kinds of shows for children, the visiting of which is regarded as something almost obligatory.</p>
   <p>It is said, that children must get acquainted with life, but unfortunately life has two sides, and one must know with which side of life he wants the children to get acquainted with, through shows. It is well known that most picture shows are based on sensational episodes of life. The usual attributes of such pictures are:</p>
   <p>Love affairs, naked women, crime and activities of detectives. These scenes excite the imagination and, irritate the nervous system. And <pb facs="5423967_1_0171.jpg" n="3"/>this does not have a beneficial influence on the soul. Our children get acquainted with such sides of life, in the shows. This will corrupt good manners. It does not mean progress, but a way to moral and physical degeneration. In his work on "Psychology", William James says that with most people the accumulation of ideas acquired before twenty-five years of age is their intellectual baggage until the end of their life, if we disregard the sphere of activity that they have chosen as their specialty. One should think about the baggage with which he lets his children out into life. Work is required in order that the character, sympathy and inclinations of the children be directed towards goodness, so that our children, when walking on the path of life, would be strong morally and spiritually, able to meet victoriously the assaults of fate and life.</p>
