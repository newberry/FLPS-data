   <p>This editorial stresses the fact that since 1913 the cost of living in the United States went up 46 per cent on foods, 69 per cent on other articles of elementary necessity, which - it is pointed out - is an average rise of 55 per cent in the cost of elementary needs for the workingman and the man of a low income.</p>
   <p>On the other hand, it is indicated that wages, which for all good intents and purposes should have kept pace with the high cost of rent, bread, meat, eggs, vegetables, fruits, clothing, and fuel, have been raised slightly only in the skilled trades, whereas the wages for common labor are practically the same as in 1913, as for example, at the Pullman shops, the Western Electric Company, the stock yards, the Crane factories, etc. The editorial mentions the Department of Labor as the source for the above figures, and reflects the opinion of the Russian colony, which is chiefly engaged in unskilled labor <pb facs="5423967_1_0435.jpg" n="2"/>and is generously provided with the excellent advice to be thrifty and to save up for a rainy day. Save up from chronic deficits.</p>
   <p>"During the World War the common laborer achieved a raise in wages. Then the capitalist was able to force it down again to normal. As a result these are harder times for the unskilled laborer than were the prewar times. He cannot eke out a living.</p>
