   <p>According to information supplied to us through the Krestross news agency Soviet workers are beginning to fight against the sweatshop conditions of work imposed on them by the so-called Stakhanov system. Reports coming from local authorities to Moscow tell of a great deal of dissatisfaction brewing among factory workers, of numerous active cases of workers' r<gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/>onstrances against the new system, and even of the assassination of workers and officials who either meekly fall in line with the system or try to impose it on others.</p>
   <p>Quite serious is the situation in this regard in the province of <gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> and in many other provinces, particularly about the coal mines. In the Don basin, for their unwillingness to enforce the new regulations for coal digging, twelve mine workers' committees were dismissed and charged with <pb facs="5423967_1_0613.jpg" n="2"/><gap unit="words" extent="unk" reason="illegible"/> in the month of December alone. In the first five days of January, at the mines of the Stalinugol combine, all the pneumatic hammers and coal-cutting machines of those workers who obeyed the new rules were put out of commission by unknown persons. Many technical men are being charged with resistance to the introduction of this system of labor in the coal mines. For the purpose of hearing such cases of sabotage a special committee composed of high administration officials of the departments concerned was sent to the affected districts.</p>
   <p>In Stalingrad the followers of the new system are leaving their places of work because of the threats of those workers who are unwilling to submit to the new rules.</p>
   <p>The resentment of the workers against the new sweatshop system is evident in the fact that in the Russian republic alone 118 workers and technical men have been brought before the courts charged with sabotaging the system. There <pb facs="5423967_1_0614.jpg" n="3"/>were also seventeen murders committed in connection with reprisals against the slave drivers of the new system.</p>
   <p>Quite interesting also are the results obtained by the introduction of the new system. In a survey made in the textile mills in Ivanovo province it was established that because of the new rules the productiveness of labor increased only 5 to 8 per cent, whereas the quality of the goods fell off 12 per cent, and the defects increased 15 per cent.</p>
   <p>At present, according to the same source, the highest officials are working on a new scale of work quotas to be imposed on workers in basic industries. The new standards will be introduced either in May or in June.</p>
   <p>These higher standards of production undoubtedly will meet still greater resistance on the part of the workers concerned. Unheard-of exploitation is being developed by the Bolsheviks under the guise of "free socialist labor".</p>
