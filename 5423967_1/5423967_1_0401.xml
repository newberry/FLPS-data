   <p>Every time you come to think about the life of our Russians in America, about their organizations and societies, the above line of our poet comes to mind.</p>
   <p>Was it not among the tall stalks of grain, among palaces, mansions, and courts of other nations that the modest life of our compatriots, their organizations, their homes in the poor, forsaken sections, became submerged? Wherever you cast your eye, you see poverty, destitution.</p>
   <p>At a time when life in Russian is, after all, bubbling and gushing, the Russian in America continues in the same old slumbering state.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0402.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Here, too, our land is immense and opulent, now as before, but is devoid of system, even as our native land in the past and now. Of order there is none.</p>
   <p>Chicago and suburbs contain by count 30,000 Russians. How many strong organizations do these 30,000 people have?</p>
   <p>Where is a Russian to look for justice in the bitter hours and days of his life in a strange land? To whom turn for help, with whom hold counsel?</p>
   <p>There are about two or three comparatively strong organizations in all. Even these are as yet young, not yet properly fortified by wisdom and experience. The others are not worth mentioning.</p>
   <p>Out comes some kind of dawn, and before you know it flame is its name, and soon enough it turns firebrand, then ashes, finally nothing.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0403.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>At a time when clubs, reading rooms, and social centers are on the increase in other nationalities in the United States, steadily broadening their programs, enlarging and multiplying their influence, the Russian colony is growing richer daily only in the abundance of appeals, in the abundance of conceited words and promises.</p>
   <p>The orator steps upon the platform at a meeting, dispensing promises of all sorts by the ton, but when the time comes to act, he is crestfallen. Where did all the pep go, not even a tiny reading room can we organize, not a place where we can gather in comfort to talk over things. We are scattered, some to the woods, others after kindling.</p>
   <p>Factions and organizations are in such a bundance that even when they call for unity in reality they cause only disunity. Extremely few are those who give true unity. For, disputes and opprobrium do not make for unity, quite to the contrary, they lead to disunity, dissociation.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0404.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>What causes all this? Why are we so poor in unity, why such inaptitude for action?</p>
   <p>The key to this enigma lies hidden in the old trouble, not alone of the Russian colony in America, but of Russia proper.</p>
   <p>Those of any intelligence at all are soaking in their own juices. They create small circles, small groups, and there they, so to say, keep enlightening each other, keep learning from each other, and keep feeding their organizations with these same churned-up juices. How much may we expect from a tree nourished by stale juices?</p>
   <p>The Russian national forces are not yet sufficiently roused in America. But seldom does a leader appear from amongst the workers or peasants. Seldom will a Russian colony's "intelligent" comprehend that activity <pb facs="5423967_1_0405.jpg" n="5"/>must be conducted not within one's own confines but rather should it go forth into the thickest of the masses.</p>
   <p>This is the reason for the eternal sleep from which the life of the nation's masses is perishing. This is why we are such paupers where the blessings from culture are concerned. This is why taverns prosper rather than education, organization, and helpful association.</p>
   <p>It is time that the forces of the Russian intelligentsia in America be ejected from groups and circles, and propelled into the mass-thicket. Enough of that self-gratifying indulgence in eloquent speeches and proclamations.</p>
   <p>To school the scholar is to do harm.</p>
   <p>It is time for the masses of the Russian colony to think better of its <pb facs="5423967_1_0406.jpg" n="6"/>lot, of its inadequate knowledge, and of the harm from disunity. It is time that these masses give attention to useful books, and that close contact be established with persons and organizations calling to unity and organization.</p>
   <p>When these requirements are fulfilled, our colony will not be so deficient.</p>
   <p>Then shall we not be so defenceless.</p>
   <p>Then shall we not be so disorganized.</p>
   <p>Then shall we stand up in behalf of ourselves and others.</p>
