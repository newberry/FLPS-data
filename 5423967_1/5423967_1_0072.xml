   <p>In recent years Americans have become very interested in Russia and Russian books. Old and new Russian classics are being translated into English and published in great numbers. Many are studying the Russian language and are convincing themselves of its richness and beauty. It is being taught in schools as well as at home; both adults and children are learning it. This is especially true of the Russian Americans of Russian parentage. Their interest has become very great since they began organizing and educating themselves.</p>
   <p>The author then mentions the publication of several grammars, brought about by this increasing interest.</p>
