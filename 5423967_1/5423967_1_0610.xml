   <p>After reading the articles signed by "Alexiev" in Rassviet under the title "What to Do" one is forced to conclude that their author should by all means visit Soviet Russia. And this is apparently his personal desire. Many people like Alexiev have been curious about just what is going on in Soviet Russia and have gone there in the firm belief that in the Marxian Paradise they would be better off than in the capitalist hell. However, upon their arrival there they quickly realized their error, and those who had means sought to escape to neighboring countries and later on to return to capitalist America. On their arrival in America they did not ask others what to do. They had already found out.</p>
   <p>But Alexiev belongs to that class of people who want others to reap the fruits of the Marxian theory and prefer themselves to remain in the capitalist hell. Several years ago,when he traveled all over the United States as an organizer for the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society, it seemed that Alexiev was <pb facs="5423967_1_0611.jpg" n="2"/>by nature a public-spirited man and a social worker who deserved some credit, but now it has become clear that at that time he skilfully concealed his allegiance to Marx and to Marx's followers in Russia. Quite frequently he raises Marx on a high pedestal, and it appears from his articles that the entire history of mankind began on the day when Karl Marx was born. He also very often mentions capitalism. I am not a capitalist; I defend social justice, and I should like to know what Alexiev means by the term "capitalism".</p>
