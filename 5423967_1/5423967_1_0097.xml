   <p>In the September 29 issue of Rassviet, we published an article prepared by the Foreign Language Information Service on illiteracy among the foreign born. According to the statistical data contained in this article, there are 160,000 illiterates among the Russians in America. This shocking figure should make us think.</p>
   <p>This continuing inability of so many of our people to read and write automatically evokes the question, what are the causes of this deplorable ignorance of our people? And who is to blame? The illiterates themselves blame the Russian czar and his government, or the capitalistic system, for not giving them the opportunity to learn even the rudiments of the art of reading and writing. But with fairness to all, it may be said that the blame lies with the illiterates themselves. A certain amount of the blame may be imputed to Russian czarism for neglecting the people's education, but it would be ridiculous to accuse the American government or the American system of public education <pb facs="5423967_1_0098.jpg" n="2"/>of neglecting to provide the means and opportunities for education to every man, woman, or child living in this country. And the 160,000 Russian illiterates have lived in this country for more than twenty years, and they have had every opportunity to learn how to read and write, and to acquire a knowledge of the English language. Yet they have failed to take advantage of the educational opportunities offered them by the American public schools. They have even scorned the offers and inducements of the Russian schools and classes conducted for their benefit by Russian societies and educational organizations. Those Russians who have wanted to learn have succeeded in learning, despite the fact that they were illiterates when they came to America.</p>
   <p>This widespread ignorance among the Russian people in America has a deadening and even destructive effect on the entire Russian community life in this country. Our community life is based on our organizations. All the Russian organizations in America, taken together, have no more than ten thousand members. The great majority of our group in this country are unorganized, unaffiliated with any of our societies. All efforts to interest this mass of people in the educational, <pb facs="5423967_1_0099.jpg" n="3"/>cultural, or social activities of the Russian group have failed. Nevertheless, it would be suicidal to leave things as they have previously been and as they still are. A way out must be found. There is one, and only one way out. The Russian organizations in America should undertake the task of freeing the mass of the Russian people in America from their illiteracy and ignorance. As the first step, the Russian societies should organize Russian schools; they should undertake a campaign among their members, and among non-members as well, which would bring home to them the absolute necessity of acquiring the ability to read and write--the minimum, basic requirement of life in a civilized country like America.</p>
   <p>The organized portion of the Russian group in America should think and work for the unorganized. When the network of Russian schools is ready, when the campaign is well on its way, it may be easier to convince Russian parents that it is not enough to send their children to school as long as they themselves remain ignorant; that it is indispensable for every Russian in America to know, at the very least, how to sign his name and how to read a newspaper. Without education, no productive work in behalf of the full development of the Russian <pb facs="5423967_1_0100.jpg" n="4"/>group in America is possible.</p>
