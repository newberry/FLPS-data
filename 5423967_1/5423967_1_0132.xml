   <p>In the women's section of a recent issue of one of Chicago's daily newspapers there appeared the letter of a woman asking advice on a vital matter. Her problem no doubt caused many people to laugh, while in many others it evoked sad reflections.</p>
   <p>The gist of the letter was as follows: "I am a married woman and have a six-year-old child. My mother recently received a divorce and married her fourth husband. Please advise me how I should address my mother's present husband. Should I call him 'father,' or simply 'Mr. Smith'?" The editor's answer was as follows: "There is no established rule regulating a case of this kind; therefore you may address your mother's husband the way you or your mother prefer."</p>
   <p>This question may provide a good deal of comedy for the general public, but <pb facs="5423967_1_0133.jpg" n="2"/>there is an element of tragedy in it for the person directly involved. This and many other family problems are the direct result of too many divorces. Getting a divorce seems to have become a new sport with many people. Whatever satisfaction parents may derive from this new game, it is a sorrowful tragedy for their children. When death takes away the father or the mother, the child's misfortune is due to inexorable fate; but when it is left practically an orphan because of a divorce, the parents are responsible for the child's misfortune.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to predict what proportions this criminal sport may assume in the next twenty years. If divorces continue to increase at the present rate, it is safe to say that in the near future the number of divorces in this country will equal the number of marriages.</p>
   <p>When a person has been divorced just once in his or her life, one can understand and condone, as there are occasions in life when a divorce is the only salvation from marital torture. But in these days, some people flagrantly dissolve the marriage tie three, four, or even five times in order to marry <pb facs="5423967_1_0134.jpg" n="3"/>again. A certain portion of these irresponsible divorces are nothing else than a racket, indulged in mostly by women for financial gain in the form of alimony.</p>
   <p>As a result of the wide-spread passion for this game of frequently changing one's life partner, monogamy exists only on the statute books. In practice, polygamy and polyandry hold sway--things unknown even in ancient Greece.</p>
   <p>No one seems to be interested in starting a movement to combat this criminal sport, this evil which is preying upon our society. On the contrary, the epidemic of divorces has been abetted, glorified, and made into a regular business, not only by various individuals, such as lawyers, but even by municipalities and states. The Reno divorce mill is notorious not only throughout the entire United States but all over the world. And no one seems to pay any attention to the fact that this unholy sport brings misfortune and unhappiness to millions of children and destroys the last vestige of morality and decency in men and women.</p>
