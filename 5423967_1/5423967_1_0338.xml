   <p>At the home of Miss Jane Addams, that celebrated American woman, and at the well known Hull House, there has been staged several times in English Gorky's drama, "At the Bottom."</p>
   <p>This drama has been a great success. The hall was always filled to capacity.</p>
   <p>Hull House is in great sympathy with the Russians and with everything Russian.</p>
   <p>In the library of Hull House there are Russian books. Lectures on Russia are sometimes given in the hall of this settlement. Some Russian emigrants reside at Hull House, the well known journalist Victor Yarros and his wife, Dr. Yarros.</p>
   <p>Some well known Russians have found a temporary home there.</p>

   <p>In 1919 the "Grandmother of the Russian Revolution," Yekaterina Bresh-kovskaya, stayed there as a guest. A few months later the well known Professor Lomonosov was also a guest there. He stayed at Hull House until he left for Russia.</p>
   <p>There are in Chicago quite a few circles of Americans who love Russia and who have a deep respect for Russian art. It is to be regretted that in our colony these circles are known very little.</p>
