   <p>To the editor: Permit me to use your newspaper for publishing the following appeal to those American Russians who recently returned from the U. S. S. R., where they were employed in different soviet industries as American specialists, as well as to all Russians living in America.</p>
   <p>Some American newspapers, among them the New York American, have just begun publishing a series of articles written by me about life in the Soviet Union. These articles are based on my personal experiences in Soviet Russia as an American worker and communist who went to Russia to help build the socialist workers' paradise.</p>
   <p>I stayed in the U. S. S. R. almost three years, working in different giant factories in various parts of the country. As a communist in good standing, <pb facs="5423967_1_0682.jpg" n="2"/>and as an American citizen, and as a specialist in my line of work, and also as one who spoke the Russian language, I had ample opportunity to see much that is usually hidden from the eyes of all but a small group of Red confidants.</p>
   <p>I found, in Russia, not the Kingdom of workers and peasants I expected to find, but a country of hunger, death, the eating of human flesh, and unparalleled oppression and exploitation of workers and peasants. As a specialist in my line of work I was well treated, in the beginning, and highly paid. I could have become rich and have an easy life in the U. S. S. R. had I chosen to stay there. But I could not be indifferent to the great poverty and suffering of people around me, and I could not look unprovoked at the self-satisfied composure of the Red bureaucrats wielding the whip over the backs of the Russian masses, so I decided to return to America with my family, even at a time when there are over ten million unemployed people in the United States.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0683.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>After my return to America, I decided to share my experiences and my knowledge of conditions in Soviet Russia with all Russians in the United States, and for this reason I began to publish my reports on the Soviet Union in the Russian-American press. The scope of these reports will now become even greater, and their contents will be known to millions of the American people, since some English language newspapers have consented to publish my articles on Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>It is a foregone certainty that the communists high on the ladder of the party's policies and their less informed "yes men" will now begin to harass, attack and slander this writer, and will use all kinds of reprisals against him and against his relatives and friends in Russia. But I must not be silent. All my friends--workers, peasants, and intellectuals--with whom I was in contact in Russia, and who put their trust and confidence in me, implored me to tell the truth about Soviet Russia to the American people. So, by telling all I know about the Soviets, I am merely performing faithfully and gladly my sacred duty to <pb facs="5423967_1_0684.jpg" n="4"/>my suffering country.</p>
   <p>Every member of our party of seventy-five men, with families including more than one hundred and fifty persons, who left America to build the new communist Russia, went through harrowing experiences and disillusions. Only those few individuals from our party who went to the Soviet Union for purely financial reasons, to make more money, and without any idealistic considerations whatsoever, were satisfied, at least in the beginning. Some of them still remain in Russia. All others, however, either fled the country at the first opportunity that presented itself, or are begging their friends in America to help them get out from the Soviet trap.</p>
   <p>I appeal to all of you who returned from the Soviet Union to answer my call. But, above all, I appeal to you to tell the people, wherever you go, tell courageously and bravely what you saw in the Soviet "Eden". Write articles and letters to all Russian newspapers, write also to the American newspapers. Only by telling the truth will we be able to help the labor movement <pb facs="5423967_1_0685.jpg" n="5"/>and save American workers from cruel disillusionment and from swinging to fascism and reaction. </p>
   <p>At the present time, a number of us who recently returned to America from the U. S. S. R. are busy organizing a society of the "returned". This society will attempt to enroll every person who made a trip to Soviet Russia and returned disillusioned and disappointed. The aim of this society will be systematically to inform the world on what is going on in Soviet Russia.</p>
   <p>All Russian newspapers have my permission to reprint or translate this article, if they so desire.</p>
