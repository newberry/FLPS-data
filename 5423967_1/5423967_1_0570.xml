  <body>
   <p>Many Russians in Chicago have been without work for a long time and have no hope of obtaining any.</p>
   <p>The Russian-American Citizens' Club, which comprises about 90% of the early immigrants, seeing its duty, planned to give a concert and dance for the benefit of the unemployed. Owing to this initiative, other large Russian organizations in Chicago, have chosen representatives at their general assemblies and entrusted them with the task of tackling the question of unemployment.</p>
   <p>On Feb. 12th, the first meeting was held at 1815 W. Division St. Twenty-four delegates were present, representing: (1) The Central Board of the Russian Independent Society; (2) The Holy Trinity Brotherhood; (3) The Brotherhood of St. George; (4) The Wood Street Parish Church; and (5) The Russian-American Citizens' Club.</p>
   <p>At the meeting, the following unanimous decision was reached: (1) To organize a relief committee for unemployed Russians in the city of Chicago and vicinity; (2) To sponsor the concert to be given on Mar. 1st by the Russian-American Citizens' Club for the benefit of the unemployed and needy; (3) To advertise widely <pb facs="5423967_1_0571.jpg" n="2"/>the committee's purposes, and beginning Mar. 1st, to collect contributions for the fund for relief of the unemployed; (4) To organize a joint committee, comprising one representative from each organization, in order to make the work more successful.</p>
   <p>The following representatives were elected to this committee: A. Fedukevich, V. Kishun, O. Sleznik, V. Konashevsky and V. Olesuk.</p>
   <p>Further information can be obtained from the representatives of the organizations which participated in the above mentioned meeting, or at the Russian-American Citizens' Club, 1815 W. Division St., from 8:00 to 10:00 P.M.</p>
   <p>Russian Unemployment Relief Committee.</p>
