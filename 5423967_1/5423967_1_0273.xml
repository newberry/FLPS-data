   <p>The impression of the newcomers to America is that here the dollar is dominant and that nothing else matters. But if one would have attended the meeting of the American Medical Association, this impression would have disappeared, says Dr. Nedselnitzky. Listening to the reports of hundreds of disinterested workers, scattered all over the United States, one easily changes his mind about the country of the dollars and plainly sees the striving toward pure science and the sincere eagerness to serve suffering humanity. Seventy-five hundred physicians were gathered at the meeting. The meeting was opened with a speech of the president, Dr. Thayer. During his speech Dr. Thayer pointed out, that during the last twenty years many fundamental reforms of the Medical Schools have put America in the 2nd place among the nations in respect of medical training. After the general meeting, which took place in the auditorium, one of the best American buildings. 15 sections of medical science were organized. Many reports, discussions after each report, exchange of opinions were going on during three days. The physicians discussed annemia, the cure of which is helped <pb facs="5423967_1_0274.jpg" n="2"/>by using liver for food; the cure of cancer with radium; infantile paralysis and its cure by a special serum. If used in time out of 100 sick children only 19 would probably have shown bad results. Many other sicknesses were discussed. Dr. Nedselnitzky pointed out, that apart from a wealth of purely special information many of the discussions were devoted to subjects very important and interesting from the standpoint of the general public.</p>
