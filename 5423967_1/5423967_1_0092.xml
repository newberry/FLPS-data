   <p>It is much more complicated as to grammar. On the new Russian orthography, there is not a single grammar in United States. There are Russian Publications on the market, but for American born children, they are difficult and not easily understood. Many colonists through misunderstanding are calling the new orthography "bolshevistic", but this is not so. The new Russian orthographic was worked out by the Imperial, Russian Academy of Science shortly before the Revolution, partly affirmed by the temporary government and finally carried out by the Bolshevics. The Bolshevics accomplished the things in which their predecessors failed.</p>
