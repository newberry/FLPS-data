   <p>Discussion of the "Russian Schools in America."</p>
   <p>On October 30, 1926, the Russian Center in Chicago, arranged a discussion on the subject of the "Russian Schools in America." The question under discussion was the relation in which the Russian schools should stand to the American schools. The Russian engineer, Mr. Pustovoitov, teacher of the new Russian school at 2127 Crystal street, was to explain his standpoint, namely that the Russian schools should be quite independent. Dr. Pertsoff was to oppose him, contending that the Russian schools should be considered as only subsidiary to the American schools; Mr. I. Y. Voronko was also expected to speak on the subject. The discussion was to take place at the Y. M. C. A., 1621 W. Division st.</p>
   <p>(Note. In the Nov. 2nd, 1926 issue of the Rassviet, I found a short notice telling that this discussion could not take place because of some difficulties in obtaining the promised lecture room at the Y. M. C. A., and therefore was postponed for an indefinite period. D. S.)</p>
