<title level="a">THE COLONY IS DEMANDING THE ACCOUNTS OF ORGANIZATIONS</title>
</bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The editorial office of the paper Russkii Viestnik often receives inquiries from many people, regarding the amount of money that was collected by this or the other organization for aid to Russia, or orphans and needy persons in America. The editorial office is generally not able to answer such inquiries. Most of the organizations for some reason do not find it necessary to give accounts to the colony of how much money there is collected in this or another case for such purposes, or how much is spent. Only few of the organizations find it their duty to publish accounts in the papers. Several times we pointed out this unnatural phenomenon to the organizations, but all in vain; very few accounts were received. It is the duty and obligation of every organization to do this. Persons contributing money for certain purposes wish to know how it is spent, if it is sent to its destination, and if it is spent as they expect it to be. Such a demand is more than just. This money is earned by hard work, and everyone's desire is that it be spent for the purpose for which it is intended. Silence <pb facs="5423967_1_0378.jpg" n="2"/>in this respect and failure to publish the accounts of the money spent do great harm. Such silence causes many members of the colony to distrust the organizations, which are collecting money for good purposes.</p>
   <p>In connection with this reactionary-minded people are spreading rumors in the colony which are harmful to the successful work of organizations in collecting money. On account of this, one can hear the phrase, They ask for money, but how it is spent nobody knows. And more often one hears the complaint, Why do the organizations not publish exact accounts of money collected and spent by them? While complaining the people remember two or three cases in which money was collected without anybody's knowing how it was spent. We do not - in any case - want to (obstruct) the activities of any of the progressive organizations, but we consider it our duty to the colony to demand the publishing of the accounts of every organization concerning money collected among the colony for different purposes, and the record of its expenditure. Accounts given only to members are not sufficient. This is general in the colony; but accounts for the whole colony are the (ones) demanded.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0379.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Publicity in this respect will strongly help the successful work of the organizations in cases when there be the necessity of collecting money for certain purposes. Silence and failure to publish accounts will invite distrust from many of the members of the colony. The Russian colony demand reports from organizations and the latter must obey.</p>
