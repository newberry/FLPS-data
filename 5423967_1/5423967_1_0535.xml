   <p>The latest speech broadcast by President Roosevelt overthe radio was an optimistic one. Touching upon the economic situation in the country, President Roosevelt declared: "Not since I was elected president have I felt more confident of the approaching economic recovery than at the present time. This recovery is felt not only in the re-establishment of the material welfare of our people, but also in the strengthening of the faith of the people in democracy and its legislative institutions. Fear is vanishing and confidence is taking its place in every phase of life." In President Roosevelt's opinion, the near future will show an even greater return of economic prosperity because the immediate task of the government is to organize public works, which will give employment to three and a half million people.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0536.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>American business circles also look optimistically toward the future. The United States Chamber of Commerce, at its convention in Washington, was informed that American industrialists are ready to spend twenty billion dollars for expansion and improvements during the next two years, and will furnish jobs to 2,000,000 unemployed. The Chamber of Commerce, however, considers that this will be possible only if Congress refrains from passing bills whose provisions are designed to retard the restoration of industry, and takes a firm stand toward stabilizing the political and financial structure [of the country] and works out a course which will eliminate the uncertainties that have existed heretofore.</p>
   <p>Among the bills that are considered by the Chamber of Commerce undesirable are those concerning the revision of the laws pertaining to regulations of railroad transportation, monetary inflation, the thirty-hour week, compulsory social insurance, the Wagner Labor Relations Act, bills designed to increase taxes, and a number of others. Consequently, the Chamber of Commerce appears <pb facs="5423967_1_0537.jpg" n="3"/>to be opposed mainly to the bills that are sponsored and supported by organized labor. Among these bills, only the one providing for monetary inflation will affect both industrialists and workers because monetary inflation inevitably leads to a lowering of the standard of living of the entire population.</p>
   <p>Whether all these bills will be enacted into laws, it is difficult to say. At the present time, it seems that Congress will pass them in somewhat modified form, with the inclusion of at least partial concessions to both workers and industrialists. So far as one can tell government and business circles in the country are entertaining rather optimistic views regarding the future. Both government officials and businessmen say that the country has passed through the worst and most dangerous period of the crisis and is now on the road toward economic recovery. This can be seen in a considerable revival in commerce and industry and in the continued reduction in the number of unemployed men.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0538.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>According to the data made public by the Federal Bureau of Unemployment Assistance, the number of actually unemployed persons is smaller than the number of those listed as receiving unemployment benefits. This discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that there are many persons receiving compensation, who do not deserve any. Thus, for instance, in Los Angeles, on checking the clients who were receiving relief, it was found that during one week 829 families voluntarily went off the relief rolls because they were afraid that their dishonesty would be found out, and 378 families were taken off the relief rolls after it was discovered that they had adequate incomes of one sort or another to maintain a normal life.</p>
   <p>There are many dishonest individuals in every city. All of them are listed as unemployed, but in reality they are either employed or else have some source of income. Consequently, the actual number of really unemployed persons will be reduced considerably when the unemployed are transferred from the unemployment assistance rolls to public works.</p>
