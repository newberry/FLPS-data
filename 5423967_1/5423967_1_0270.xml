   <p>The Russian-American colony shows now a great revival of activities. The Russian colonists seem to be tired of fruitless political debates. They realize now that the political questions are questions of secondary importance. The colonists, therefore, are now concentrating on creating powerful economic and cultural organizations, and such organizations are being created now.</p>
   <p>For instance, not so long ago there arose the Russian Consolidated Mutual Aid Society of America. This powerful organization arose as an amalgamation of organizations, which were separate but of a similar character. The Pittsburg Russian Mutual Aid Society is also unifying a considerable part of the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Independent Society consists of nearly 2,000 members. It is quite possible that all these organizations, which have one aim, will <pb facs="5423967_1_0271.jpg" n="2"/>unite in the near future, because the tendency to amalgamation is manifested now among R. C. M. A. S. and C. I. S. This tendency is strong only in the Pittsburg society, because this society, being built by Communists, puts politics above culture and economics. In many towns there have been built many people's houses. In these houses a cultural enlightening work is going on as far as possible. Though many Russian organizations are of a purely economic character, they pay much attention also to cultural work, and this fact should be considered as a very consolatory one. In large and small towns there are children's schools. The existence of these schools is evidence of the fact that the Russian colony values Russian culture and Russian language, and (that it) connects as much as possible its children spiritually with that great culture. Not long ago there was created a Russian opera in New York; also, in Detroit there will probably be arranged a theater. In our colony there are many cultural powers. These powers could enrich the <pb facs="5423967_1_0272.jpg" n="3"/>spiritual life of the colony. All that is necessary is the existence of a spiritual bond between the cultural workers and organizations. All these creative endeavors do not appeal to leaders who for their own benefit, or the benefit of their party, ignore the interests of the society. But one must hope that these leaders will not be able to carry destruction into the life of the colony. Sooner or later the colony will become stronger and free itself from all her sicknesses. And the colony will without doubt get stronger, because it has understood the importance of uniting on the basis of culture and economics.</p>
