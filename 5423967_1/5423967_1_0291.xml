   <p>The writing of this editorial was occasioned by a students' strike at the Emerson High School in Gary, Ind., where fourteen hundred students struck, demanding that twenty-four colored students should be dismissed from the school. In the beginning, the administration of the school did not pay much attention to this demand and refused to comply with it. But it was found out later that the parents of the striking students were those who really inspired the strike; the initiative came from them, not from the students themselves. The parents have been inciting their sons, tried to persuade the school administration to expel the colored students and have even gone so far as to write threatening letters to the parents of the latter. The administration was intimidated by such a belligerent attitude of the parents and seemed to be willing to make at least some concessions to them, such as keeping the colored students segregated from the others in the class- and dining-rooms. The school administration was alarmed, thinking that if the demands of the students <pb facs="5423967_1_0292.jpg" n="2"/>and parents would not be complied with this may lead to riots.</p>
   <p>The editors remind the readers that soon the citizens of the United States will celebrate the 119th anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln. This anniversary will be celebrated also in Gary, and the same officials and prominent citizens of this town who will praise in their speeches the great things done by Abraham Lincoln, the liberator of the Negro slaves, will think in their hearts about the best way of depriving the descendants of these slaves of the right to be taught in schools that were open to all other children born in the United States.</p>
   <p>"But," says the editor, "this is not all. If the so-called one-hundred-per-cent patriots have their way in this case, they may soon try to expel out of the American schools all 'foreigners,' such as Germans, Russians, Poles, etc. Fortunately, not in all states the notorious <pb facs="5423967_1_0293.jpg" n="3"/>K. K. K. is as powerful as in the state of Indiana."</p>
   <p>In their protest against the presence of colored students in the Emerson High School, the parents mentioned that this presence "offended their religious feelings." "It is hard to understand," says the editor, "how the presence of Christian colored people can offend the religious feelings of other Christians. The one-hundred-per- cent patriots resent that radicalism which is spreading among the colored people. But this is only the natural result of the intolerant attitude which such 'patriots' have towards the Negro race. The racial problem will never be solved in the United States as long as such an unfair attitude is fostered by fanatical organizations such as the K. K. K."</p>
