   <p>A well-known French journalist, Mr. B. Ormesson, closely acquainted with international affairs, considers all forms of dictatorship to be social ulcers. In his opinion there is no difference among Russian Bolshevism, Italian Fascism, and German National Socialism.</p>
   <p>All dictators, says he, lead the world not toward peace but toward war. The present Italian adventure in Ethiopia, in his opinion, is only a modest rehearsal. If this rehearsal ends favorably, Italy will be followed by Germany. In view of the political and economic difficulties confronting the dictators war seems to them the easiest solution of all their troubles. It is only necessary to dress up even the most distressing situation and to transform it into some sort of noble ideology, to present the facts in a <pb facs="5423967_1_0643.jpg" n="2"/>certain light, to arouse the mob by appealing slogans, and the ground for an adventure is well prepared.</p>
   <p>B. Ormesson considers that at the present time Europe is being prevented from returning to normal conditions by those countries in which dictatorial power exists--by Italy, Russia, and Germany. His opinion he outlines as follows:</p>
   <p>Italy [is a hindrance] because it shook and disturbed Europe by attempting to gain by force of arms that which might have been obtained through diplomacy.</p>
   <p>Germany [is a hindrance] because it forges the senseless tools of war and thereby creates in this world a feverish state of mind, and because it shuns co-operation and collaboration with other nations.</p>
   <p>And finally, Russia [is a hindrance] because after changing her policies in <pb facs="5423967_1_0644.jpg" n="3"/>the sphere of foreign affairs she still continues to support revolutionary parties [beyond her borders], regarding them, perhaps, as her most reliable military allies. The countries which have suffered most in the economic crisis by their own policies continue to aggravate this crisis with every passing day.</p>
   <p>From all that he says Mr. Ormesson draws the conclusion that at present the fate of Europe depends on the will of only a few men. But these men are tied hand and foot, for they are the dictators. They are tied by their own past, by their fanatical ideology; they are drunk with power. For that reason, says Ormesson, once and for all we must reconcile ourselves to the idea that the principal question in the political and economic struggle which we are witnessing is whether it will ever be possible for any one to unite the dictatorial regimes in a disciplined collective system or not.</p>
   <p>This is the reason why, in the opinion of this French journalist, the <pb facs="5423967_1_0645.jpg" n="4"/>significance of the Italo-Abyssinian conflict extends far beyong the scope of a mere colonial problem. That is why the fate of Europe is being decided now.</p>
   <p>All this leads one to draw one conclusion , namely: the world will not enjoy peace or normal economic development until the social ulcers of our days, called dictatorships, are outlived or destroyed.</p>
