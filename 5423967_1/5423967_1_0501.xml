   <p>p-28- Valerian Ivanovich Tereschenko, young Russian scientist, visited our city, on the 7, 8, and 9th of September. He arrived recently from Prague and at present is working with a well known cooperative advocator F. S. Mansvetov on the question of a possible emigration of Russian refugees from Western Europe to the United States of America and Northern Mexico.</p>
   <p>During his short stay in the city, V. I. Tereschenko succeeded not only in meeting several of the social leaders of the Russian Colony, but in attending also some of the meetings of the Russian Societies, namely: the Brotherhood Society of Wood St., and the Brotherhood Society of Leavitt St., and on Tuesday, September 9th, he gave a lecture, presenting the idea of reorganizing the work of establishing a Russian People's Bank in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The meeting was held at the Y. M. C. A. on Division St; V. I. Tereschenko, in a very interesting discourse, explained to the audience all the possibilities that are in the hands of the Russians here, in developing a cooperative movement.</p>

   <p>p-28- In the speeches that followed wholehearted approval of the plan was expressed.</p>
   <p>A proposal was made to continue the work unceasingly, despite any difficulties that might arise in their path.</p>
