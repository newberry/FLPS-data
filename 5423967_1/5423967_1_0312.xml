   <p>It is necessary to talk much about our situation, about the needs and sorrows of our colony. One has to discuss this subject not only in a quiet, dispassionate way; sometimes it is necessary to raise one's voice so that everybody's attention would be attracted. This is especially so in our city of Chicago, where 30,000 Russians are living. This is quite a large army. It would seem that one should only rejoice seeing such a large body of children of the same mother, our native country. However, in reality there is no reason for rejoicing. On the contrary, we have to be sorrowful because all this great body of people is torn into small parts each of which wants to have life organized in some different way, according to its peculiar views.</p>
   <p>One part of our colony has adopted the hermits' attitude towards life; these persons lead a solitary life and do not participate in the public activities of the colony. Some have become extreme egoists and do care about anybody but themselves. Some others have become <pb facs="5423967_1_0313.jpg" n="2"/>frantic professional clamorers and have acquired the art of swearing like troopers.</p>
   <p>There are many people who are able to do some creative work, to be very useful members of the colony; by their activities they make the public life of the colony more healthy, they enrich it. But the reckless clamoring busy-bodies interfere with the work done by such persons; they create obstacles and kill the enthusiasm of many useful workers. The latter have to spend a lot of energy in order to achieve some results.</p>
   <p>Who are the masters of sabotage, who interfere with the normal pulsing of the life of our colony?</p>
   <p>They are partly intellectuals of a certain type and partly some "extremists" from the ranks of the working class. Some of these intellectuals have diplomas of various kinds and some have none.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0314.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Some of them have lost the characteristics of true intellectuals, and some are, so to say, just intellectuals in their teens. These people have as yet nothing to show us except a propensity for picking quarrels and for abusing all those who do not agree with them. Very much the same can be said about those extreme radicals from among the workmen who are no more than sham intellectuals despite their claims. They all sing the same song and do the same tricks. Whenever anybody is starting something good or doing some useful work, these trouble-makers declare it to be all wrong as long as they are not the bosses conducting these enterprises. And in their opinion all enterprises which are not under their direction should be destroyed and then started anew.</p>
   <p>Some time ago there was some talk among us about the necessity of founding a People's House. But before the question of its organization had been settled, there arose already disputes about the question of leadership: What group should be considered to be at <pb facs="5423967_1_0315.jpg" n="4"/>the head of affairs. And that is about as far as the enterprise went, for those who really meant business were not allowed to proceed with the work.</p>
   <p>There was also some talk about organizing a People's University, but the result was the same. Steps were also taken to start building a hospital of our own, but it was decided that we are healthy people and do not need a hospital.</p>
   <p>Schools for children were founded. This undertaking was fairly successful, but here also there is some hitch at present. Busy-bodies belonging to various parties and social strata have penetrated also into these educational institutions. As a result of this, the kind of teaching which children get differs according to the school: in some schools the children are taught Communism; in some other schools monarchism is inculcated. These things are taught by showing to the children moving pictures illustrating the activities of the armies fighting <pb facs="5423967_1_0316.jpg" n="5"/>in Russia. The children see how men are killing each other; they see all the sufferings and horrors of the civil war: how a soldier thrusts his bayonet into the heart of his own brother or shoots him; what sufferings the mothers have to endure. Thus hatred is instilled into the pure, undefiled souls of children.</p>
   <p>This is how the children are taken care of; this is the kind of humanism that is taught in some of our schools. And this is being done by our pedagogues who profess to be the light-bearers in our obscure, gloomy life! Is this not a shame, a disgrace, a nightmare? Should not these attempts to persuade the children that this or that army is the savior of Russia be condemned? Is it not a pernicious thing to poison the innocent souls of children? Children who have just learned how to spell some easy words are taught the principles of radicalism or monarchism of the Chicago brand! Is this not the direst fatality? Such is one side of the life of our colony. From another side we hear the vilest, filthiest abuse being <pb facs="5423967_1_0317.jpg" n="6"/>poured on all our best endeavors. Wherever you go you hear how people abuse each other in speech or in print. Everything is declared to be shameful and base. You hear constantly such expressions as "counterrevolutionist," "white guard," "monarchist," "chekist." And when attaching to a man such labels they forget about the real man, nobody even mentions what the man is in himself, apart from these party stamps. The real man is dead, does not exist any more; there remain only "-ists" and "-aries." And these unreal purely conventional beings have invaded our life and pretend to be very concerned about the state of our colony, about its needs. But all these cares of theirs are not sincere, you do not feel in them any love for this colony, nor any true devotion, nor any compassion. These clamoring busy-bodies cannot feel, cannot understand the needs of our colony. The interests of the people are foreign to them, they pursue only personal aims and are settling personal accounts. And therefore the colony should eliminate these busy-bodies and free itself from them, for they will not help the colony to develop into something better; they will kill entirely the life which is pulsating in it. This is their aim and their task.</p>
