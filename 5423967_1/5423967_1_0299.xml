   <p>Dear countrymen!</p>
   <p>We, Russian immigrants, peasants and workmen, have been cast by fate into this country while seeking a better lot. We were all forced by some cause to abandon against our will all that was dear to us.</p>
   <p>There are many of us here, and a good many have got used to the conditions prevailing in this country, have raised families, have even acquired homes of our own.</p>
   <p>It is not an easy thing to acquire a home; in order to build or buy a house and all the things necessary for a household one must have money, sometimes a considerable sum of money. But we, Russian immigrants, imitating the example set by other nationalities, have organized a Russian National Building <pb facs="5423967_1_0300.jpg" n="2"/>and Loan Association which helps you to become owners of houses, so that you would not need to move from apartment to apartment, but could live in your own house, not depending on anybody else.</p>
   <p>Our Association was founded only recently, namely in November 1924. But it has succeeded in doing already a lot of work in such a short period of time.</p>
   <p>It has already loaned $44,000 on first mortgages, and the cash in treasury is $3,700.</p>
   <p>Some of the readers may think that this last figure is not a very imposing one; but consider this figure carefully, and you will surely say that much has been done by our Association; and what has been done has done much good.</p>
   <p>Our Association numbers at present 167 members. Persons of both sexes are eligible to membership. It depends on you what sum of money you want to <pb facs="5423967_1_0301.jpg" n="3"/>save - $100, $500 or $1,000.</p>
   <p>Members who want to save $100 pay 25 ets. a week for six years. Those who want to save $500 pay $2.50 a week for three years. Those who want to save $1,000 pay $2.50 for six years.</p>
   <p>So then, dear countrymen, we invite you to join the Russian National Building and Loan Association and to save by this means the sum of money which suits you.</p>
   <p>If you are a member of our Association, and if you need some money in order to buy a house or a parcel of land, you get the sum required right away and have not to pay any high interest.</p>
   <p>We know that some of the immigrants will want to know who are our members.</p>
   <p>We are glad to have to answer that question. Our members are men who are <pb facs="5423967_1_0302.jpg" n="4"/>employed in factories and works, or, to put it simply, workmen. Workmen who have come to this city from obscure villages of the former tsarist Russia.</p>
   <p>None of our members belong to the intellectuals, though the latter should participate energetically in any work done for the purpose of raising the cultural level of the Russian colony.</p>
   <p>Our secretary is a workman, and he is bonded, and all the members of the Board of Directors are workmen. We hold our meeting every Thursday at the People's School, 917 N. Wood street, at 7 P.M.</p>
   <p>So then, Russian citizens and comrades, we invite you to join the Russian National Building and Loan Association, where you can borrow the money needed for buying houses or parcels on the easiest terms, without paying a high interest.</p>
   <pb facs="5423967_1_0303.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>For information apply on any Thursday, at the above mentioned address, to the Secretary of the Association, N. Shlapo.</p>
   <p>The 11th series is open at present.</p>
   <p>Officers and Directors: Iv. Kulik, F. Ustich, N. Shlapo, Iv. Maksimuk, W. Sabinsky, F. Tanchik, G. Zvenchrek, K. Lis, P. Gulko, Sleznik, Martisuk.</p>
