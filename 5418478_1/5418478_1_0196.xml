   <p>All members of the Board were present at yesterday's meeting. After deciding many business issues, the members of the Board began the election of the officers for the coming year. Mr. Clark proposed the renomination of the present chairman Doolittle. Mr. Nichoff proposed our countryman, Adolf Kraus, as chairman; many other members in their short speeches declared their approval to the proposition, proving the great confidence in our countryman. Many members publicly stated that the Bohemian Kraus was experienced in educational problems and will fulfill the duties of his office very successfully and to the fullest satisfaction of the City of Chicago. Both candidates had their followers among the members of the Board.</p>
   <p>The result of the voting was undecided, Doolittle obtained five votes and Kraus, seven; the second vote was postponed, and the election of other officers accomplished.</p>

   <p>Then followed the second vote for chairman; this time the Bohemian, Adolf Kraus, was elected chairman with a majority of votes.</p>
   <p>We certainly can be proud that our countryman was elected as chairman of such an important office.</p>
