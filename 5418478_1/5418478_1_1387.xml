   <p>All citizens, men and women, who are registered, have not only the right, but also the obligation to cast their votes in tomorrow's election.....Those who work should vote early in the morning before going to their respective places of employment. According to the state law, a man is allowed two hours' absence from work in which to do his duty as a citizen.....</p>
   <p>....Tomorrow's elections are most important. The women voters will cast their ballots for members of the board of trustees of the University of Illinois, for the clerk of the Appellate Court, for members of the Board of Assessors, and for municipal judges. They also have the right to vote on questions included in the so-called "little ballot," concerning bond issues for various public works.....</p>
   <p>In conclusion, there is absolutely no reason why Bohemian Democrats should not vote the straight Democratic ticket.....</p>
