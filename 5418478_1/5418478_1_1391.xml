   <p>The friends of Mr. Jos. A. Mendl, the Bohemian Democratic candidate for the office of sheriff of the City of Chicago, have been doing excellent work for his election.....Another of his campaign meetings is being held tonight in Pulaski Hall, on Ashland Avenue near 18th Street....where Bohemian, Polish, and other Slavic Democrats....are preparing a huge mass meeting for Mr. Mendl.....</p>
   <p>If we can judge by the enthusiasm shown by his friends, the election of Mr. John A. Červenka to the office of clerk of the Probate Court is assured, and he will win by a large majority. This fact, however, should not stop the work now being done in his behalf.....</p>
   <p>Although nobody doubts that Mr. Adolph J. Sabath will again receive the <pb facs="5418478_1_1392.jpg" n="2"/>nomination for Congressman of the Fifth District, we should all see to it that his victory is as decisive as possible.....</p>
   <p>The prospects for the election of Mr. Karel J. Michal, Democratic candidate for Congressman of the Fourth District, are growing better from day to day, and there is no doubt that he will win a splendid victory. It is, however, necessary that he receive all Bohemian votes in the coming primaries.....</p>
   <p>If our countrymen in the Ninth Senatorial District work together, they should easily be able to elect their own Bohemian Senator, Mr. John J. Petřík.....</p>
