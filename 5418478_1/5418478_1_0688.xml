   <p>p. 4.. The brazenness of the prohibitionists knows no bounds, and now is the time indeed to call them definitely to order. That riff-raff picks out some districts, places there two or three of its henchmen who will not lose any time to file a petition with the city council asking for a declaration of the district as a "dry" one.</p>
   <p>They used to succeed in this up to a short time ago; recently, however, Alderman Cermak obstructed their practices in numerous ways. But all this is useless, unless more vigorous methods are employed against the nefarious actions of the prohibitionists and their terrorizing of the liberal majority of the citizens. Where are our United Societies for home rule?</p>
   <p>They should be working right now, for it is no secret to them that the prohibitionists are at present developing an astonishing energy and are gaining position after position. Yes, indeed, it seems that the United Societies let their arms lie in their laps and that their leaders say: "We have done enough, and want a little rest." Your rest is taking a little too long, gentlemen, you should brace yourselves quickly to counteract the dark forces!</p>
