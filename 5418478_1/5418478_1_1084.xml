   <p>The Cesko-Slovanska Unie Slevaska (Czecho-Slovak Molders Union) held its third agitational meeting Sunday, Feb. 9, in Comrade Fr. Pitry's Hall, 1279 W. 20th St., between Morgan and Fisk Sts.</p>
   <p>It again met with good results and several new members were gained. By this, it is being shown that the Slavonic Molders really want to help in the effort to form an independent union, where business will be transacted in their mother tongue. However, it is regretable that so few of them are applying for membership. The duty of all molders is to assist in such a worthy purpose, as is being offered them now.</p>
   <p>Never before have you had such an opportunity to become members of that great organization, The International Molders Union of North America. Other nationalities have cared nothing about us and only left us in obscurity. We will show that we are alive and that we always support worthy things. Only in that manner can our present labor killing conditions be remedied. Let us take notice how capital is united against us in the form of trusts, and governs us. We will show by our strength that we don't need it and that we will overcome it.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1085.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Therefore, let everyone of you come to the meeting which is to be held Sunday, Feb. 16th at 2 P.M. in Pitry's Hall, where further explanation will be made.</p>
   <p>This invitation is respectfully extended by the</p>
   <p>Committee.</p>
