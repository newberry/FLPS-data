<title level="a">CZECH CLUB AT UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>There is only a small handful of Czech students at the University of Chicago, but they are all young men who show proper regard for the nationality of their origin and are conscientiously doing their patriotic duty. They founded a club recently to establish contact with the American intelligentsia and make them acquainted with our Czech ideals.</p>
   <p>"Czech Club" is the name of that body; R. A. Ginsburg is chairman of its executive committee. He presents an interesting account of its activities:</p>
   <p>"Times change, says the proverb, and of this the best evidence is the growth of our lately founded Club. Its full name is "Czech Club of the University of Chicago", It is the center of Czech activities at the highest seat of learning in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The organization of the Club was initiated at the beginning of the last winter <pb facs="5418478_1_0052.jpg" n="2"/>semester, J. Horak giving the impulse. It has become a real necessity for the small number of students to whom the language of their fathers and mothers is an object of reverence. Able management, combined with co-operation by the members, has helped the Club to attain the position in which it stands, regardless of its small membership; [it is] a monument to the moral support lent to the Czechs by intellectuals of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>"The first half year was devoted almost exclusively to mutual introductions, getting better acquainted, and forming friendships. Gradually the foundations were laid for attaining the ideals which the Club has accepted as its own. Now that the officers are elected--A. French, president, Miss M. Janovsky, vice-president, E. Vorisek, secretary, and F. Riha, treasurer--we can begin [to work for] the realization of those ideals.</p>
   <p>"The first step taken was to make an appeal to the administration of the University, and especially to its president, Harry Pratt Judson, well-known friend of the Czech nation, to consent to the establishment of a course on the social, political, <pb facs="5418478_1_0053.jpg" n="3"/>and economic history of Bohemia. A delegation consisting of Messrs. Zbytovsky, Horak, and Riha was advised by President Judson's secretary to address itself with its request to the director of the Department of History. Upon the latter's recommendation the petition would be sent to the board of professors of history, the document bearing the signatures of students intending to enroll in the course.</p>
   <p>"It became evident, however, that the continuance of a club with tendencies as advanced as ours was almost impossible without the approval of the professors' council, the "faculty advisors". We therefore decided last Friday to appears directly to President Judson. Should the president give his consent, that would make the Czech Club the only one under the special aegis of the head of the University. On the contrary, if the president should refuse, we shall appeal to Professor S. Harper, head of the Slavonic Department and a close friend of our political leader outside the boundaries of our old homeland, T. G. Masaryk.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0054.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"In order to establish more intensive and extensive contacts, we shall arrange for a meeting on the evening of May 31, to which all Czech high-school graduates who intend to continue their studies at the University will receive invitations."</p>
