   <p>A Czechoslovak mass meeting against prohibition will be held on Friday, October 6, 1922, both afternoon and evening, in the Pilsen Park pavilion and in Pilsen Park, West 26th Street and Albany Avenue. The meeting will begin at 2 P. M. The admission is only fifty cents per person, and tickets are being sold by all saloonkeepers. Mr. Anton J. Cermak, the champion of human rights, and other speakers will address the meeting. There will be four different orchestras playing in the Park...... Of the many attractions we mention only the following: An Indian reservation in which dishes cooked in the Indian style will be served by the most charming Indian maidens. The meal and drink tickets will be sold by ladies representing Liberty. Each ticket thus sold will count as five votes in the interest of liberty regained. [There will be] the Liberty Bell, the Spirit of 1776, [and] many other attractions. The entertainment will be exemplary in every respect.</p>

   <p>This mass meeting to be preceded by an automobile parade on October 4, 1922, at 7 P. M., starting from the Town of Lake, Pilsen, Bohemian California, and Lawndale [districts], and from Cicero, Illinois. [Locations of the various starting points for the several sections of the parade are omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>Owners of cars and supporters of the principle of personal rights of man are [hereby] asked by the committee on arrangements to participate in Wednesday's parades, and without regard to party politics and religious creeds to come to the great popular meeting to protest against prohibition.</p>
   <p>This is most important. Do not forget--Friday, October 6, 1922!</p>
