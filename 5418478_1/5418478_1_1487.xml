   <p>It will hardly be amiss if at this time we remind the Bohemian Voters of the 6 Ward of the importance of the duty which the coming City Elections place upon them. In this ward, for the greater part Bohemian, where without the support of Bohemians and against their wishes no party can succeed in electing any candidate and where only because of the lack of interest on the part of the Bohemian element any kind of crook can be elected to the City Council, there has been unanimously nominated by the Socialist Labor Party a candidate who is well known to all of us, Citizen Martin Baumruker. Friends of Bohemian interests who consider it important that Bohemians should be represented worked sincerely in his behalf at the City convention and they were successful in silencing all voices which were raised in objection to him as a Bohemian. Even the German and American delegates who formerly worked against him, not knowing the strength of the Bohemians in the 6th ward and not recognizing the ability of the nominee are now enthusiastically for him, knowing, <pb facs="5418478_1_1488.jpg" n="2"/>that he is a dignified representative of the Bohemian people in regards to honesty, energy and defense of the interests of the Labor Party. His election is almost a certainity if only his countrymen do not remain away from the polling places on election day and provided they attend meetings before election day conscientiously, where our battle lines are to be set up and preparations made against all opponents, who ordinarily vote only for the glass of liquor or for the few dollars which they receive, and who no doubt, as in the past, will try with their utmost to elect to the city offices those who know how to steal enough in their various offices to be able to pay for their reelection at the expiration of the term.</p>
   <p>We are confident that the Bohemian citizens of the 6th ward are well informed for they have proven so on more than one occasion. We know that the Bohemian citizenry wishes to support all things which are good and especially so when we are concerned with the election of a Bohemian candidate whom all honor and toward whom, among all his countrymen in the ward, there is probably not one unfriendly.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1489.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We must not forget that it is important for every citizen to attend pre-election meetings, where everything possible is being done to insure our success at the polls. Not that it is necessary for anyone to verify for himself the character of the candidate, for he is known to everyone who takes any interest in public matters, but so that the disinterested persons might be aroused and encouraged to activity so that a successful conclusion might be reached.</p>
   <p>It has always been a sad picture for Bohemians of this important ward, when so few of them participate in these meetings, leaving the task of recommending and supporting a Bohemian candidate to Americans and Germans.</p>
   <p>Any one at all interested in the outcome of the election should come, and even though he does not make use of flowery phrases and make lengthy speeches, he will at least through his presence make it known that it is of importance to him to have the Bohemian candidate elected. Thus far there are many complaints about the feeble attendance of Bohemians at these meetings and strangers lay it to indifference on our part, but if it should continue on in this manner there can be no doubt but that they too will lose their enthusiasm, seeing <pb facs="5418478_1_1490.jpg" n="4"/>that we show none where the election concerns us most.</p>
   <p>But this must not happen. Surely we will not forget ourselves so far as to neglect our honor and our own national interests. Surely every enlightehed person will take time to attend these encouraging meetings and then to cast his vote at election time.</p>
   <p>We will not permit it to be said that we ourselves have not upheld our honor and leadership, that we do not value the work which has been undertaken these many years, especially now when it should show some accomplishment for our cause in a victory for our candidate.</p>
   <p>Therefore Bohemians of the Sixth Ward, altogether now, To work.</p>
