   <p>Chicago, July 30, - I have seen published in the Chicago Daily News the following statement: "A Bohemian captain was found drilling with a Bohemian militia company."</p>
   <p>This is a mistake and a wrong done to the Bohemians, for it was a German captain of the "Lehr and Wehr Verein," Why do the newspapers in this town by mistake use the name of one native "Bohemian?" I think myself justified in recalling to memory our last Civil War, commencing in 1860 and ending in 1865. Then we can see how many Bohemians carried arms in the service of the United States, and see how many Bohemians died on the battlefield; also how many widow and orphans are crying for their husband and fathers. Our most respectable and honorable men have been in the service of the United States.</p>
   <p>As regards the Bohemians of the present time, we would have to travel through the States of Iowa, Nebraska, Dakota, and Wyoming. There we find Bohemian settlements. Their life is hard, but they will cultivate the land and work hard for <pb facs="5418478_1_0967.jpg" n="2"/>their living. Let us now see further on the plains of the West.</p>
   <p>If Gen. Custer's records were looked up, we would find amongst the massacred ones Bohemians too. I myself am only two years home from the Fifth United States Infantry, stationed at Fort Keogh, Yellowstone River, Montana Territory, of which General Nelson A, Miles was the commander.</p>
   <p>It was on the 25th of February 1877, after returning from the battle of Wolf Mountain, that Gen. Miles commanded a parade and thanked us men for our bravery and for the endured hardships, and for laying our lives down for the purpose of advancing civilization. Among these men I was myself and also many other Bohemians. I hope this will make a change in the public opinion about the Bohemians and give us the proper honors. We are poor but honest, and poverty is no shame. I sign myself, most respectfully, a true-born Bohemian.</p>
