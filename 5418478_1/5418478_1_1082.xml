  <body>
   <p>At their own request, the Bohemian-American Society of Journalists was inducted into the International Typographical Union of North America, and given number four (4). It was officially named "Chicago Bohemian-American Newspaper Writer's Union No. 4, International Typographical Union of North America." It became a regular affiliate, using the same union label as all other Bohemian union print-shops and newspapers. Of these, only those will be considered union-shops, which employ not only union typesetters and other labor, but union editors as well. The agreement, in which are formulated the demands of the members of the Bohemian-American Journalist Societies, has again been placed before the publishers of Bohemian newspapers for signature; they have not accepted as yet, but it is expected that they all will sign readily. The Union of Bohemian Journalists does not want to cause the owners of Bohemian papers unnecessary difficulties and will strive to maintain present friendly relations. However, it will insist upon the fulfillment of its reasonable demands. Thus far a mutual agreement with our Society has been signed by the publishers of the following papers:</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1083.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Denni Hlasatel, Spravedlnost, and Zenskychlisty, effective since the first of the year, and Lidovych Novin, effective since April 15.</p>
   <p>The other Bohemian papers are to accept or reject the agreement by Saturday, April 19. In case of rejection by papers using the union label, the local representative of the International Typographical Union will intercede.</p>
