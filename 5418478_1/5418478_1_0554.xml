   <p>The thirteenth convention of the United Societies was held yesterday in the North Side Turner hall, on Clark Street near Chicago Avenue. Our readers have always been kept well informed about the purposes and activities of this body. The organization has accomplished much for the preservation of personal liberty and the improvement of municipal government in our city. Much of puritanism and prohibitionist tyranny, as advocated by crazy moralists, has been suppresses through the meritorious intervention in the legislature and city council of the organization's leaders.</p>
   <p>It surely cannot be denied that the Socities' secretary, Mr. Anton J. Cernmák, deserves high praise for his work in behalf of certain rights which the organization succeeded in preserving. Also to be concerned are Mr. John Cěrvenka, Alderman John Toman, the unforgettable Hudge J. Z. Uhlíř, and <pb facs="5418478_1_0555.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Jandus, as well as our Mrs. Princ, Mrs. Zeníšek, Mrs. Skaloud, and Mrs. Sedláček. Besides the Czechs, the Germans also take the liveliest interest in the activity of the United Societies through their leaders....</p>
   <p>The meeting opened with the singing of "The Star-Spangled Banner". The President, W. Kramor, declared that, while in the war brother fights brother, in the United Societies all nationalities stands together in the fight for personal liberty and local government, while they all wish wholeheartedly for a victory for the United States.</p>
   <p>....The organization comprises 1,105 societies with 266,528 members. Czech associations are the most numberous with 189 men's and 113 women's organizations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Čermák pointed out that much untruth was said in Washington and the City Hall during debates on the question of special permits for dispensing alcoholic beverages.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0556.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Bolek called attention to the absence of Mr. John Červenka, one of the most zealous workers in the United Societies, who met with an accident recently. The Societies resolved to send a message of regret.</p>
   <p>Judge Bernard Barasa was elected president; G. Landau vice-president, and Anton J. Čermák, secretary.</p>
