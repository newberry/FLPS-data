   <p>A meeting of our Czechoslovak Democrats, both men and women, was held yesterday afternoon in the hall of Mr. Josef Čapek, Trumbull Avenue and 30th Street. The large attendance was characterized by much enthusiasm which is a new proof that our Czechoslovak people are strongly organized in their effort to support the candidacy of Mr. Anton J. Čermák and the entire Democratic ticket. The meeting was presided over by Mr. James Kostecka. The main speaker was Mr. Anton J. Čermák who introduced himself as a candidate for the office of president of the Board of County Commissioners. He was loudly acclaimed by the attending voters. In his speech Mr. Čermák portrayed his past life and activities, from which he deduced that since his past activities were trustworthy, his future actions may be trusted as well. He then told the audience about the rights, duties, and great powers with which the office of president of the Board of County Commissioners is associated, and ended with an appeal to all voters to <pb facs="5418478_1_1347.jpg" n="2"/>come to the polls on April 11, and thus insure his nomination.</p>
   <p>Mr. Čermák's speech was followed by that of Mr. Otto Fuerst who, by his humor and sparkling satire, more than once caused boisterous merriment to seize our listening citizenry. The next speakers on the program were Mr. Otto Kerner, former alderman of the Twelfth Ward, and Mr. J. Cepák, the present alderman of the Twelfth Ward.</p>
   <p>We are happy to report that this meeting was one of the best we have held thus far, and there was not one among the hundreds of our citizens who was not convinced of the ultimate success of our activity. The audience departed imbued with a new zeal to perform their duty at the polls and among their friends and acquaintances before going to the polls.</p>
