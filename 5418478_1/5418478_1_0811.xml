   <p>we have been lagging behind the activities of others, indeed. The Czech National Association began its work almost two years ago, and has accomplished wonderful work, we must acknowledge that. We Czech Catholics will begin to work now for the liberation of our old homeland. We will try to alleviate the sufferings of our brethren who are groaning under the hardships of a cruel war which shows its effects in Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia. We want to show our patriotism and true Christian love for mankind.</p>
   <p>Now that the offices of the National Association of Czech Catholics are opened, we shall put all our energy into the work. we shall begin with the creation of branches of the Cyrilo-Methodian Aid Fund. These <pb facs="5418478_1_0812.jpg" n="2"/>auxiliary stations will dot the entire United States, and their great number will raise them to the status of one gigantic organization, which will be able to extend its helping hand to the entire Czech world. Write for the statutes and by-laws of our organization. Report to us how the work is progressing in your community, and keep in mutual contact through the medium of the newspapers.</p>
   <p>The following rule should be observed: Each donor is entitled to select the branch which he wishes to support, either the national, which works toward the liberation of our motherland, or the auxiliary fund, which seeks to alleviate the misery in our homeland. Donations in the form of money should be sent to the treasurer of our organization, addressed: Jos. Kopecky, 3205 West 22nd Street. General correspondence should be directed to the office at 2601 St. Louis Avenue.</p>
