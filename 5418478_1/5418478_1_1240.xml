   <p>It is a well-established fact that the late Polish legislature became notorious for noise and disorder. Yesterday our Bohemian fellow citizens proved that they are well able to give competition to Polish raucousness. A large crowd filled the Bohemian Turnhalle. Dense tobacco smoke wafted over the excited assembly, and frenzied words in Bohemian--quite capable of twisting German tongues by the mere sound of them--interrupted the speaker continually. A serious topic was under discussion.</p>
   <p>At last the banished Socialists from Libuse's domain discovered a method of successfully attacking the accursed capitalists. It is a splendid idea. Macchiavelli is a mere tyro in comparison with our Bohemian fellow citizens, who decided definitely not to patronize any businessman who advertises in Republican or Democratic newspapers.</p>
   <p>To be fair, however, we must record here that a part of the assembly would not <pb facs="5418478_1_1241.jpg" n="2"/>subscribe to this movement, that there was intense opposition, and that the speaker extracted from his pocket a loaded revolver, with which he threatened the editor of the Sokol, who was taking notes on the speech.</p>
   <p>We shall not burden the reader with a detailed report of the various speeches, but it may be said that the whole affair was a glorious example of the well-known expression,</p>
   <p>" 'Much squealing and little wool,' said the devil, as he sheared a pig."</p>
