   <p>All of our large Bohemian neighborhoods will arrange a splendid automobile parade this evening. The parade, as previously decided, will be in conjunction with a huge Czechoslovak mass meeting in the interest of personal rights. Parades will start at 7 P.M. simultaneously in the following Bohemian districts: Pilsen, Bohemian California, Lawndale, Town of Lake, and Cicero. The parades will be limited to these districts, passing through their main streets. As previously announced in yesterday's issue, the various minor parades will converge into a huge one in Pilsen Park where the mass meeting is to be held. The parades will form as follows: For the Pilsen district, in front of the Ceskoslovenska Americka Sin (Czechoslovak-American Hall; for the Bohemian California district, at the corner of Albany Avenue and West 26th Street; for the Lawndale district, at the intersection of Crawford Avenue and 31st Street; for Cicero, Illinois, at the intersection of West 26th Street and 56th Avenue; for Town of Lake, in front of Mr. Hauser's restaurant, on 48th Street.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0512.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is easy to imagine that a great mass of our countrymen will attend these parades. This is highly desirable, for the avowed purpose of the parade is to show to the world that our people are really interested in regaining personal liberty, which the American people lost by the imposition of the prohibition act. The demonstration will also serve as a stimulus for a more concerted action of all the liberal voters who will thus have an opportunity to prove that a large majority of the people of the state of Illinois desires a change. If this majority is to achieve its ends, if it is to have full meaning, it must be active. The owners of cars in all our Bohemian neighborhoods fully comprehend the meaning of this demonstration and we may therefore expect them to turn out in full number tonight.</p>
   <p>There is to be another Czechoslovak mass meeting on Friday afternoon and evening in Pilsen Park, West 26th Street and South Albany Avenue. It will begin at 2 P.M., and those countrymen of ours who attend it will have an opportunity to hear the speeches of some of the most outstanding champions <pb facs="5418478_1_0513.jpg" n="3"/>of human rights of the American people. Among the speakers will also be Mr. Anton J. Cermak, candidate for the office of president of the Cook Country Board of Commissioners. For many years Mr. Cermak has been heading the struggles for the preservation of personal rights. Besides the speakers there will be other attractions, such as four orchestras. Altogether, the day promises to be filled with entertainment.</p>
