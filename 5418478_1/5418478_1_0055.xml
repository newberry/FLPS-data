   <p>The notorious "Six" of the Chicago School Board have not heeded the demands of public opinion to remove the bust of the "Iron Chancellor," Bismarck, which has been disfiguring a public schoolhouse in the very heart of the Polish district. In spite of the obstinacy of the Board, the "springtime cleaning" is making some progress in another direction. This is certainly highly gratifying: The executive committee of the Board was compelled to dismiss a teacher who has been setting a bad example with his disloyal remarks. This teacher flaunts his pro-Germanism. His name should have been stricken from the pay roll long ago as an example and warning to other individuals of his ilk.</p>
   <p>A steadily rising protest by citizens living on the North Side is becoming more and more conspicuous. It is directed against German street names, of which there are more than an abundance, indeed. The statue in Lincoln Park of <pb facs="5418478_1_0056.jpg" n="2"/>the great German poet also has not escaped outbursts of patriotic indignation. In brief, Chicago, as well as other American cities, has arrived at the conclusion that German influence will have to be broken radically, at last, and that everything tainted with the provocative Hun hue must unconditionally give way to Americanism.</p>
   <p>German lust for expansion has been blowing air for years and is naturally reaping the storm now. It is most desirable that the "spring cleaning" be carried out as thoroughly as possible--in fact, to the very foundations.</p>
   <p>If the people of almost all the world are now taking the Teutons to account, America must not dilly-dally. The three hairs on Bismarck's head may find some enthusiastic admirers and defenders among the members of the Chicago School Board, but the latter will have to capitulate in the long run. The loyal populace of Chicago will see to that.</p>
