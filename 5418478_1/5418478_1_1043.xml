<title level="a">A FITTING REPLY TO THE CLUMSY ATTACKS OF THE TYPOGRAPH AGAINST THE BOHEMIAN PRINTING TRADES CENTRAL UNION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Recently, we published in this paper a communication in which we portrayed in the proper light the attacks of the International Typographical Union No. 330 directed against our union, and at the same time we called attention to the unprincipled actions of the said International Typographical Union.</p>
   <p>In the latest issue of the Typograph, the masters are replying to us, but in such a manner as is not customary among decent people. Or are such expressions used among decent people as: "scamp," "driveling," "toad," and others, which cannot be published here? We expected a real argument, but experienced only insults. We made known a whole list of true examples of the rottenness of that union, and instead of answering us fittingly, they haughtily and snobbishly say that they <pb facs="5418478_1_1044.jpg" n="2"/>will not go to scabs for advice. They lie, and try to squirm out, but at the same time, in their reply to Spravedlnost, convict themselves of lying.</p>
   <p>For the sake of interest and judgment, as to whether or not we were right when we wrote about "union" conditions in print-shops coming under the jurisdiction of the International Typographical Union No. 330, we bring the following for consideration: Although Typograph in past issues called attention to the ugly conditions existing in the shop of Spravedlnost about which the secretary of the Allied Printing Trades Council, Mr. Straub, said that they are worse than scabs, that organ in its last issue states that it pictured those incidents in a manner almost too mild. Suppose then, if Typograph were to tell the whole truth, then some pretty deeds would be brought into the open. Typograph also accuses Spravedlnost of deceiving the public when it says that the printing plant and Spravedlnost are <pb facs="5418478_1_1045.jpg" n="3"/>undertakings of all progressive organized Bohemian labor. The International Typographical Union, with which Spravedlnost has an agreement, and which is certainly aware of the conditions existing in the shop of Spravedlnost, declares the claim of Spravedlnost is utterly false, and that the print-shop and Spravedlnost are really the joint enterprise of the Bohemian socialist section, which is still a long way from being the representative of all progressive organized labor.</p>
   <p>Further, Typograph points out that Spravedlnost is not sure that the printing label will not be taken away from it, because the minutes of the International Typographical Union are full of notations about the violation of union regulations by Spravedlnost. Also a member of the International Union, Mr. Mejdrich, admits that he once struck the former president of the Board of Directors of Spravedlnost, when that gentleman accused the typesetters of robbing the shop, and throwing away good type which was not worn out. A fine example of brotherly workingmen's action, <pb facs="5418478_1_1046.jpg" n="4"/>is it not?</p>
   <p>Also, it appears from these accusations that the full manifestation by the Central Unity of Bohemian Unions was misused so that the associates could draw commissions for themselves. Typesetters working for Spravedlnost do not receive the wage set up by the Union. They work longer hours than the Union permits and that for scab wages. In addition to this, the workers are compelled to contribute to the so called "workingmen's" newspaper, Spravedlnost.</p>
   <p>Well then, gentlemen, why do you become excited when your inconsistency is admitted by yourselves? Or do you suppose that when you write "that it is not possible for you to disprove the mass of lies and slander," the whole matter will be settled? You are very much in error when you say that the Bohemian Printing Trades Central Union was founded at the request of the employers. To that we reply: The Bohemian Printing <pb facs="5418478_1_1047.jpg" n="5"/>Trades Central Union was founded through necessity, so as to resist the often nonsensical orders and fancies of various self-styled saviors of workingmen, whom Haywood so excellently characterized in his lectures.</p>
   <p>Bohemian workingmen are, and always will be, so mature that they know what they should do, without the necessity of having any such overlords above them as are needed by the gentlemen in the International Typographic Union, who need some kind of a "sanctus spiritus" for every trifle, without the help of which they would soon be at the end of their resources.</p>
   <p>Further, you write that the scabs of Svornost and Hlasatel are impatiently waiting to take in the members whom you expel. Many thanks, gentlemen. We are not so greedy for numbers, a fact which you will readily agree and recognize from the fact that we have raised the initiation fee for <pb facs="5418478_1_1048.jpg" n="6"/>our union to twenty-five dollars. If we formerly accepted every member expelled by you, you did likewise with our expelled members. Or do you wish to have proof that you have members who formerly were zealous workers in our union? Also, we did not write that the former vice-president of the International Typographical Union worked for the National Printing Company for eighteen dollars per week when he should have been getting twenty-seven dollars per week. That is an error on your part. Your colleague, who worked in a certain shop in Bohemian California for eighteen dollars a week is the one to whom we refer. If you want to know his name, your present president, Mr. Aug. Capek, can give you the information. We congratulate you upon having him. We add: how can there be any talk of lying and slander? Isn't it really slander on your part when you denounce and insult the executive committee of our Bohemian Printing Trades Union? Do you not condemn yourselves by such action? How can you write that our secretary was expelled and fined by your union, when the truth is that he resigned, <pb facs="5418478_1_1049.jpg" n="7"/>willingly, from your union? And when someone resigns, can they still be expelled and fined? Perhaps only by you, gentlemen! Just a few more words. You call our union a "Bosses' Union." We have disproved your false assertion, and we know that the International Typographical Union No. 330 includes among its members four proprietors of printing plants, and about twenty-five shareholders of the National Printing Company. Therefore, more than half of all members of your union are "bosses." We, the members of Bohemian Printing Trades Union, wish you consolation, after a long groping in the dark. You will recognize, yes, indeed, that while they were members of your union, they were groping in the dark, but now they go by daylight, of that we assure you. In so far as your threat to pillory of every individual connected with our union is concerned, we are at your disposal. We add however, that on that pillory there will be room enough for many members of the International Typographical Union No. 330.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1050.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>We must not pass by your naive mention about machinists. According to you, machinists are unnecessary in a print-shop. Why then, do you have rules requiring a machinist for each three type-setting machines? Or why are there machinsts in every larger English establishment? Well! that remuneration which your colleagues receive for the function of machinists is darned small. That the members of your union are so thoroughly familiar with typesetting machines and those of our union are not, well, that is very easily said, using your own words, but it would be hard to prove. We advise you sincerely, gentlemen, don't lie, don't slander, and don't look for splinters in your neighbors eye when you have a regular log in your own. We urge you to learn decency. Speaking of the members of our union who "chip in" quarters for beer, as far as that is concerned, what of it? At least they drink at their own expense, while somewhere else the drinking is done at the expense of the International Union. That is the only difference between the two cases.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1051.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>Further, we remind you gentlemen that our organization committee is in no sense a secret body, at least not to the extent that your committee is. We will add only that just as soon as the names of your committee members are signed in full, our six member organizing committee will not hesitate a minute to do likewise.</p>
   <p>Every non-partisan and reasonable man who knows conditions as they exist between the publishers of Hlasatel and Svornost and their employees, who are fully satisfied with their jobs, union wages, and union working conditions, will arrive at the point of view that the Central Bohemian Printing Trades Union deserves the support of every countryman.</p>
   <p>Organization Committee.</p>
