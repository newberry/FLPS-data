  <body>
   <p>Mayor Harrison has been receiving deputations of citizens every day from various parts of the city--members of various nationalities and representatives of various trades--requesting him to give them the assurance that he will again be a candidate for nomination for the office of the mayor. The Cook County Bohemian Democratic League sent its officers, who were accompanied by a large number of members, yesterday for the purpose of delivering a resolution drafted by the resolutions committee of the League and approved by the recent plenary meeting of that body.....</p>
   <p>The resolution....contains an enthusiastic approval of Mayor Harrison's work for the city....and expresses the opinion that it is essential that he continue his work during another term in order to bring it to the desired end.....The Bohemians are especially appreciative of the Mayor's work....and their League has been instructed to urge him to accept another term.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1570.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Bohemian deputation was very large, probably numbering several hundred men and women.....</p>
