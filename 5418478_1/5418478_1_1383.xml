   <p>Cesko-Slovansky Poplatnicky Spolek v Morton Parku (Czech-Slavonic Taxpayers' Society of Morton Park) held a meeting on February 6, in which six new members were initiated, which proves conclusively that our society is a worthy one.</p>
   <p>It was agreed to send a protest to the town council against the closing of 22nd Place.</p>
   <p>The Western Electric Company owns the land on both sides of 22nd Place, between 49th and 50th Avenues, and wants to close those streets to the public. The residents living to the east are placed in the position, relatively speaking, of being locked in a cage.</p>
   <p>Because some of the members live in the neighboring community of Clyde, it was agreed to make a membership drive there, so that profitable service could be <pb facs="5418478_1_1384.jpg" n="2"/>rendered to members and to the community.</p>
   <p>For that reason a committee was chosen to visit the Clyde citizens, and ask them to become members of the Cesko-Slovansky Poplatnicky Spolek. By being unified we can present our petition for the many improvements, with a chance of success, which the individual could hardly hope to achieve.</p>
   <p>Those wishing to become members of the Cesko-Slovansky Poplatnicky Spolek may do so by calling on Vaclav Cilbulka, 5619 West 23rd Street, or on F. J. Blaha, 5412 West 23rd Place, who will be pleased to give further information.</p>
   <p>F. J. Blaha, secretary.</p>
