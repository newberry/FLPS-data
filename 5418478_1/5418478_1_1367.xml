   <p>The situation before the primary election has remained unchanged in the Czech wards, and the prevailing enthusiasm for our Czech candidates for municipal offices prophesies certain success. Although the campaign came to an end last night in most of the wards, it will be continued and until tonight in our Twelfth Ward. A mass meeting will be held in the Pilsen Brewery Park pavilion, 26th Street and Albany Avenue, mainly in behalf of the candidacy of Alderman Joseph Novak. A very large number of voters are expected there. They will not come for mere curiosity's sake, but to express their confidence in Mr. Novak's conduct in office.</p>
   <p>Alderman John Toman is a candidate in the Thirty-fourth Ward, where the campaign was closed with a crowded meeting in the hall of Mr. Havluj, 26th Street and Avers Avenue. All voters showed their appreciation for the way Mr. Toman has handled the duties of his office. Whenever people in his ward asked for <pb facs="5418478_1_1368.jpg" n="2"/>redress of grievances, Mr. Toman set out to satisfy them. One such instance was the removal of a coke oven from the neighborhood of 42nd Avenue and 24th Street. Attacks directed by unfriendly elements against our clubs, business concerns, or taverns were met by Mr. Toman with effective defense. He will continue to be a good guardian for his ward.</p>
   <p>Importance of Elections in Cicero</p>
   <p>We have repeatedly called the attention of our readers to the significance of the coming election in Cicero, one of our largest Czech communities. Yet, it will not be amiss to do it again in the interest of the voters. The discontent of the population there is known publicly, and the causes underlying it are no secret either, not even to those who are disinterested in the management of public affairs.</p>
   <p>The necessity for readjustment is obvious, and the means for effecting this change rest in the ballot of the voters. Tomorrow's election will give the <pb facs="5418478_1_1369.jpg" n="3"/>voters an opportunity to send the right men into the municipal offices, i. e., able and reliable persons whose primary interest concerns the welfare of the town and the voters.</p>
   <p>A candidate should be elected who will meet these requirements. Mr. Fr. Houcek is a man of this caliber. Young and able, he is competing for the office of town clerk. His election would mean the first step toward an improvement in the prevailing conditions. This move in the right direction would receive another impetus by the election of Mr. Joseph Hajicek, candidate for the office of trustee. Mr. Frank Waszkiewicz and the rest of the candidates on the Republican ticket would make a good team.</p>
   <p>The Cicero primary campaign will close tonight with a meeting in the hall of Sokol Karel Jonas, where able speakers will appear in behalf of the candidates mentioned above.</p>
