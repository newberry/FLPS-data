   <p>You have read, we are sure, about an alleged conspiracy among Germans to defeat any candidate at the next election, November 5, 1918, who would declare himself in any way against the German fatherland. It is directed particularly against Messrs. Anton J. Cermak, and John A. Cervenka, whose untiring activities in behalf of the Czechoslovak cause are said to have incurred disfavor and wrath among Germans.</p>
   <p>Mr. Cermak, when interviewed by his friends, answered as any other one hundred per cent American would have done: "I doubt, in the first place, that any such movement exists among local Germans. If it does exist, it is not among the German intelligentsia, which is loyal to the Government, stands firmly behind the President, and fully shares his views on the right of self-determination for nations.</p>
   <p>"If, however, there are Germans who are hostile to me and my friend Mr. Cervenka, <pb facs="5418478_1_1361.jpg" n="2"/>because we work for our people--if they feel vengeful--then I pity them, and feel contempt. On what level must a man be to harbor ill will against a man who bends his efforts toward the liberation of a people from which he comes? I do not believe that Germans here would sink so low, Germans, many of whom I know, and found in the majority to be loyal. Others must be men blinded by the Kaiser--they are poor Americans--to deal with them would be an insult to every honest man.</p>
   <p>"I am a candidate for the office of sheriff of Cook County on the Democratic ticket. My opponent on the Republican side is Mr. Peters, a German. This may or may not mean something. I am an American of Czechoslovak descent, and proud of it. I intend to work for the liberty of my nation, for a victorious finish of the World War, and for the utter defeat of all enemies of the Stars and Stripes."</p>
