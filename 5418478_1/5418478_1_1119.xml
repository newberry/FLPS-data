   <p>The order to strike was issued to thousands of men and women working in tailor shops throughout Chicago yesterday. They assembled in many parts of the city, men and women of all ages, welcoming the summons to the fight which, they are convinced, will bring them better working conditions, higher wages, and recognition of their organization.....</p>
   <p>Two meetings were held in the Bohemian neighborhood last night; one, attended by the employees of the Kuppenheimer factory at 22nd Street and Western Avenue, met in the hall of the Ladimir Kacel School at 19th and Leavitt Streets, and the other, consisting of workers employed by the firm of Edelheimer and Stein, met in the hall of the Chicago Sokol.</p>
   <p>The Kuppenheimer employees will meet [again] today at 9 A. M. in Mr. Cernoch's hall at 22nd and Troy Streets, and the attendance of all workers is confidently <pb facs="5418478_1_1120.jpg" n="2"/>expected. The strike headquarters for the Bohemian neighborhood are Mr. Zapotocky's hall at 25th Street and Homan Avenue, where the strike committee will be active throughout the day.....</p>
