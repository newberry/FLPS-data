   <p>A new feature of this year's primary campaign, which promises to accomplish much for Mr. Anton J. Cermak and the rest of the candidates offered by the regular Democratic organization, is the Czechoslovak Democratic Campaign Committee composed of our leading Czechoslovaks who are active in our national, political, or social life. All the Bohemian wards in Chicago; all the Bohemian and Slovak settlements in Cook County are represented on this Committee. This great body of men has now been split into smaller units, each of which devotes its energies to its own neighborhood where they arrange meetings in behalf of Mr. Cermak and his running mates. In a few days the Czechoslovak Democratic Campaign Committee will mail letters to all the Czechoslovak voters in the County. It is estimated that there will be about 25,000 of them. In these letters our Czechoslovak voters of <pb facs="5418478_1_1344.jpg" n="2"/>both sexes will learn about the main issue of this campaign, and the necessity of nominating Mr. Anton J. Cermak for the office of president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners. The letters deserve to be read carefully and to be given a thorough consideration; therefore, whoever receives such a letter should not throw it in the wastebasket, as is done with most of the campaign literature, but read it and act accordingly. The Democratic primary ballot will contain many names, and it would be difficult for a voter to make his choice were he not advised in advance as to the details of this ballot. He must study it and determine which candidate he is going to vote for.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak Democratic Campaign Committee will see to it that every Czechoslovak voter gets a sample ballot on which the names of those candidates who run with Mr. Cermak are clearly marked. This sample ballot ought to be taken with you when you go to the polls, and your ballot marked accordingly. If you have not received such a sample by mail you should call <pb facs="5418478_1_1345.jpg" n="3"/>at the Cermak headquarters on 26th Street and Homan Avenue, and it will be given to you.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, April 9, which will be two days before the primaries, a huge mass meeting will be called in the hall of the Sokol Chicago. Preparations are now being made for this meeting, and it is expected that it will be the largest meeting of its kind ever organized by us. The Lawndale Automobile Club alone will furnish 300 cars for a street parade which will precede the meeting.</p>
