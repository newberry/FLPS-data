   <p>Reactionary American newspapers reproach our newly elected President Wilson, saying that he is not independent, that he frequently takes advice from Bryan. These same papers were in the habit of glorifying President McKinley, calling him "the greatest President" America has ever had, because he permitted himself to be dominated by Mark Hanna and gave the trusts an entirely free hand. Wilson is right in listening to the advice of a man who is as honest and fearless as Bryan, and with whom even his greatest enemies cannot find any other fault than that they do not like his political opinions and actions. Even so, Bryan remains an honest and honorable man, very popular with the American people. Whenever he lost an election, it was because he was defeated by the superior force of capitalistic interests. As long as it is Bryan who stands by Wilson, the American people may rest assured that the President is on a good road.</p>
