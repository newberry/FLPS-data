   <p>Yesterday's Bohemian meeting held in the Gymnasium of Sokol Association was attended by eighty or ninety citizens. This is very consoling proof that the Bohemian citizens have begun to understand their duties. The meeting was opened by the chairman, Mr. Patera, and the minutes of yesterday's meeting were read and adopted. Sixty new members were enrolled and one hundred and twenty-five is the total number of members of the Bohemian Independent Club.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kralovec gave a detailed report of the meeting of the joint committees, which elected Mr. Lussem as chairman, and Mr. Chlader as secretary. We are publishing this a little ahead of time and we must add that the chairman of the meeting, Mr. Lussem, came to the conclusion that Vaclav <pb facs="5418478_1_1655.jpg" n="2"/>Kaspar would be the best candidate. He has known him since before the Big Fire in Chicago. The reason that this was published ahead of time was explained as indispensable because, as Mr. Lussem states, some of the German members of the joint committee intended to wait two weeks longer. Mr. Lussem was against this idea. The motion for immediate voting was passed and Vaclav Kaspar was elected candidate by a vote of nine to five. This report was accepted and the speaker proposed a reading of the platform, which was done by the secretary.</p>
   <p>"The Platform of the Independent Club of the 8th Ward. Whereas, the citizens of the 8th Ward know and have seen for years that our representatives in the City Council do not care for the welfare of the citizens, therefore, it is resolved, that in the future only those candidates will be supported who will direct their activities strictly in accord with the platform, set up by the citizens of said ward.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1656.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>I. Every case of corruption committed by the City Council shall be immediately revealed to the public.</p>
   <p>II. All improvements like building of new bridges, sewers, paving of streets, shall be properly constructed under strict supervision.</p>
   <p>III. To watch and enforce with all power the regulation that only workers of good reputation shall be hired for city constructions, not lazy and idle men patronized by the ward politicians as has been practiced heretofore.</p>
   <p>IV. To see to it that personal liberty shall not depend on the individual opinion of hot-headed fanatics.</p>
   <p>V. To strive with earnest zeal towards the refusal of further concessions to the present monopolists."</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1657.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>This platform was adopted by the committee and by the candidate.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kralovec proposed at this meeting to nominate the speakers for tomorrow's joint meeting. Ad. Chladek and J. Benes were proposed. Both accepted.</p>
   <p>T. Kralovec suggested Mr. Lussem as chairman of tomorrow's joint meeting, because Mr. Lussem always acted with dignity and was always very friendly towards the Bohemians. Mr. Lussem accepted.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chladek referred to the disagreements occurring ordinarily on election day, and all kinds of disorder during the counting of the votes. We are in need of dependable people who will watch that the counting is honest, because it is the only way we can win, and we know well that the police officers are against us Bohemians and all are working for Irishmen.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1658.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>A long and effective speech by Ad. Chladek pleased everybody. The following additional speakers were elected for tomorrow's joint Bohemian-German meeting; Dr. Kohout, J. Kralovec and Jiri Nikodem.</p>
   <p>Concluding this meeting, there was an appeal to the Bohemian citizens of the 8th ward to appear at tomorrow's meeting in Houdrov Hall in large numbers and not to be confounded by the Germans. Strive to gain the respect of other nationalities is what was recommended.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow's meeting is the most important one and it should be demonstrated to the Germans and to the other nationalities, with whom we will fight, that we know how to handle our affairs and that it would be unwise for them to scorn our Bohemian power in the 8th ward.</p>
