   <p>The Bohemian Sharpshooters are not improving their case by the examination before Judge McAllister, which is to determine the question of admitting them to bail pending the determination of the fate of the worst wounded of the men fired upon.</p>
   <p>The testimony thus far taken mitigates in no degree the atrocity of emptying loads of buckshot into a crowd of unoffending spectators at short range, for it appears that none of those hit were connected with the disorderly demonstrations which the Bohemians set up in palliation of their offense. The facts developed in the examination are such that the prisoners may count themselves extremely fortunate if no death results from their picnicking. And it would be to their interest if some kind friend could prevail upon the Socialist orators not to organize sympathetic mass-meetings for the sake of delivering themselves of savage and inflammatory speeches.</p>
   <p>The Bohemians were in the wrong in using their muskets murderously, and their position will not be improved by the kind of talk indulged in at last night's meeting.</p>
