<title level="a">BOHEMIANS SECEDE FROM NORTH AMERICAN UNION</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>p.1--There are still some people in America who think that they are at liberty to take a fling at the Bohemians whenever they choose to do so. Yes, there are some who believe that Bohemians are an inferior race, to be looked down upon and scorned, and not qualified to resent the worst insults that are flung into their faces. Only ignorant persons, it is true, entertain such opinions, persons of limited horizon and narrow views who either have never taken the pains to know us or else, knowing us, are too stupid to learn from us for their own good.</p>
   <p>And it is equally true that there are many educated American imbeciles who have never taken the trouble to inform themselves about the qualities of other races but are arrogant enough, in their ignorance, to cast slurs upon them. One of these educated persons--for a physician certainly should be ranked among the educated--calls Bohemians "undesirables." Now if such an insult had been offered to us by some Irish hoodlum, we should ignore it, considering that we could expect nothing else from one of that type. When, however, such an attack is made by a man who pretends to be a person of culture, <pb facs="5418478_1_0894.jpg" n="2"/>and when the insult is even placed on record in a publication, we deem it to be our duty to protest most vigorously and to demand redress.</p>
   <p>It is well known to our readers and to the Bohemian public in general that another attack of this kind recently occured. In the North American Union, the organ of an association numbering among its members twelve hundred Bohemians in Chicago alone, a vulgar and malicious insult was hurled against us.</p>
   <p>The chief physician of that association, a certain Dr. A. H. Brumback, or whatever the name of the savant may be, wrote in his report that people who live in dirt and filth cannot be considered desirable members of the association. He does not explicitly mention Bohemians, but immediately thereafter he expresses his disapproval of the admission of Bohemians as members because, so he says, they have the highest mortality rate among racial groups. Thus he reveals distinctly whom he had in mind when he spoke of people who live in dirt and filth.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0895.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But we are very much gratified to hear that the Bohemians in the Union have demanded redress and after failing to obtain it have decided to demonstrate in an energetic and emphatic manner to the gentleman above mentioned that they will never allow any Brumback, chief physician or not, to throw mud at a race which not only can hold its own against his nation but excels it in many respects.</p>
   <p>Plzen (Pilsen) and Cesky Lev (Bohemian Lion) orders of the North American Union in joint action demanded of the supreme council a public declaration disavowing Dr. Brumback's derogatory remarks and further stating that Bohemians are considered equal to members of the Union of other racial origin.</p>
   <p>And what was the response received by the grievance committee? The supreme council delegated its chairman to direct a letter to the Bohemian orders in which it declares itself to be in accord with Dr. Brumback's article, contending that it implied no insult. On top of this the chairman of the supreme council in a separate letter to the Bohemian orders reprimanded them for not being an asset to the Union, inasmuch as the dues paid by them <pb facs="5418478_1_0896.jpg" n="4"/>did not cover the expenditures entailed by the mortality among Bohemian members.</p>
   <p>In consequence of this treatment the Plzen order, in a meeting held on January 23 in the Bohemian-American Hall, resolved to secede from the North American Union. Besides these insults there were other motives which prompted the Bohemians to sever the ties which bound them to the supreme order of the Union. Difficulties had developed regarding payment of death policies for several brethren and also regarding some special by-laws which restrict the occupations of members.</p>
   <p>In spite of full information about the movement in progress to sever connections the supreme council did not make the slightest effort to prevent the separation, thus precipitating the break and evoking feelings which led to another gathering. This meeting was called by Messrs. Marsik and Bernard in Krizek's Hall at Homan Avenue and Twenty-fifth Street.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian organizers of this meeting informed the assembly that the supreme <pb facs="5418478_1_0897.jpg" n="5"/>council had called it and had promised to be represented to be represented by some officers. These officers preferred to stay at home and did so with one exception, a certain Mr. Hinckley, assistant to the general manager.</p>
   <p>The meeting was a very stormy one. After several speeches in which members gave vent to their opinions of the injustice done to the Bohemians the chairman called on Mr. Hinckley for an explanation of the supreme council's attitude. But Mr. Hinckley did not take the cue. Instead, he told the assembly in plain words that those who wished to remain in the Union might do so provided that they continued to pay their dues, and he also took care to protect the physician, who, said Hinckley, had had no intention of insulting the Bohemians when he wrote about dirt.</p>
   <p>Thereupon Mr. Basta exposed Hinckley by putting to him the blunt question as to whether he knew how much the Plzen order had paid to the supreme council, and how much benefit it had derived in return. Mr. Hinckley replied that he could not answer this question without his records, which were in his office and could be consulted there. He persisted, however, in his contention <pb facs="5418478_1_0898.jpg" n="6"/>that the Bohemians are a liability to the Union because they draw out more than they pay in. However, Mr. Basta thereupon proved to him by figures that the Plzen order has paid in $13,000 more than it has withdrawn in benefits.</p>
   <p>Thereafter Mr. Holub read the passage from Dr. Brumback's article which had offended the Bohemian members, and which had been endorsed by the subsequent letter from the chairman of the supreme council.</p>
   <p>Mr. Holub then gave a description of Dr. Brumback's person as depicted for him by a lodge brother. He who wished to know Dr. Brumback, said he, should stop at a certain Italian restaurant on Wood Street between the hours of five and six, where one may see that gentleman indulging in whiskey, often to such an extent that he has to execute with hands and feet a normally two-legged motion.</p>
   <p>"And such a fellow has the cheek to chide us! Shame on him!"</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0899.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Mr. Hinckley remarked that a libel suit should have been filed against Dr. Brumback in this case.</p>
   <p>Mr. Basta further asked Hinckley whether he remembered a meeting of the supreme council in which the officers of the Bohemian orders had been called "grafters." Hinckley could not remember it, but Mr. Chadraba, who had attended the meeting, declared that he had heard this expression uttered by a certain McLanghenry. Then Mr. Basta pointedly asked Mr. Marsik, who had also been present at this meeting of the supreme council, whether or not he too had heard the insulting remark made by McLanghenry.</p>
   <p>"No, I did not hear the remark," replied Mr. Marsik.</p>
   <p>"I expected such an answer," retorted Mr. Basta. He then demanded to be informed by Hinckley why the present meeting had been called by the supreme council against the will of the officers and principally at the instigation of certain men of whom one had not attended a meeting for two years, and another had not attended for four years.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0900.jpg" n="8"/>
   <p>Hinckley refused to give any further explanations and restricted himself to the simple statement that he had come only to define the attitude of the supreme council toward the Bohemians, reiterating, that those who wished to remain members of the supreme order might do so. But he also informed the Bohemians, that the supreme council had obtained an order from the Superior Court enjoining the officers of the Bohemian orders from consulting the books and records of the Union except under the direction of the Court. He himself had nothing to do with the affair, said he; on the contrary, he considered Bohemians desirable members, some of them even excellent members.</p>
   <p>Mr. Basta took the floor again, reviewing the grievances of the Bohemians and calling attention to the humiliation which Bohemians would suffer if they continued to pay dues thirty-three per cent higher than those paid by members of other racial descent. He also mentioned the limitations to freedom of action imposed by the restrictions of the by-laws, which prohibit members from following a large number of trades and occupations.</p>
   <p>Mr. Bolek interrogated Hinckley about the fact that the supreme council</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0901.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>had called a meeting and had then failed to be represented in it instead of delegating its chief officers to be present and give the enlightenment demanded in regard to the council's attitude. Finally, Mr. Basta declared it to be impossible, for any Bohemian to remain in an organization which dealt to Bohemians nothing but rebuffs and raw insults.</p>
   <p>"Are you with us, brethren? Will you permit your officers, who have defended your material interests and the honor of your Bohemian name, to be excluded? If you see the necessity of secession, then demonstrate your consent by rising from your seats!"</p>
   <p>Almost all present rose.</p>
   <p>"Yes," members shouted, "we are with you! Let us sever all connection!"</p>
   <p>"Now all those who are not with us are Judases and have betrayed us!" shouted Mr. Basta, and the assembly answered with cries that resounded through the hall like peals of thunder.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0902.jpg" n="10"/>
   <p>"Judases, Judases, that's what they are!"</p>
   <p>Mr. Marsik tried to make himself heard above the tumult and the shouting: "Just wait, we'll show you!"</p>
   <p>"Be quiet!" Members shouted in reply, adding other exclamations still less flattering.</p>
   <p>Mr. Basta demanded that Hinckley promise to recommend the exclusion of Marsik from the supreme council on the ground that he had formerly been employed as a bartender. Hinckley promised to consider the demand. Feeling was running high, and the chairman pronounced the meeting closed.</p>
   <p>The separation of the Plzen order from the North American Union is now complete. The Bohemians have given the proper reply to the insults heaped upon them. And for this they merit our respect.</p>
