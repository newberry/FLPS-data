   <p>The teaching of German in the public schools will doubtless be discontinued as the majority of the school board are not in favor of continuing this study and because school finances are insufficient.</p>
   <p>This matter is to be definitely decided at the next meeting of the School-Board. Consequently there is great pressure being exerted in German circles for the continuance of this study in our schools and to discontinue instead the teaching of music and drawing.</p>
   <p>As far as we are concerned we are against the teaching of German in our schools for the reason that like the German people, the Bohemian, Polish, Scandinavian and all the other nationalities could request the teaching of their various languages, for they are taxpayers also.</p>
   <p>Not wishing to see their children denationalized, they should maintain private schools for the teaching of their mother tongue just as the Bohemian's are doing.</p>
