   <p>The report that Mr. Joseph W. Cermak has decided to seek the office of alderman as an independent Democrat was received with enthusiasm in the widest Bohemian circles. There is every indication that great efforts will be put forth in the interest of this Bohemian candidate.</p>
   <p>According to the enthusiasm apparent among our citizens we feel sure that with harmonious co-operation we will win, and the Tenth Ward will continue to have two Bohemian aldermen, an advantage to which it is fully entitled.</p>
   <p>We have had two Bohemian aldermen for many years, and it is our duty to see to it that by electing Mr. Joseph W. Cermak, two Bohemian aldermen will represent us in the future, also. At present the principal duty of every Bohemian citizen, man and woman, who is not yet registered, is to go next Tuesday to his or her polling place and register. In that way the number of Bohemian votes <pb facs="5418478_1_1405.jpg" n="2"/>will be greatly increased.</p>
   <p>The time for the filing of petitions of independent candidates in the office of the City Clerk expires today at midnight. According to all indications, more independent candidates will enter the aldermanic races than ever before.</p>
   <p>In the Tenth Ward, in addition to Mr. Joseph W. Cermak, Mr. Frank J. Bilek came out as an independent candidate. In the Eleventh Ward no independent Democratic candidate will be put up, and the followers of Joseph J. Sabath will support C. F. Pettkoski.</p>
