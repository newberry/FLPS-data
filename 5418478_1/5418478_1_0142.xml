  <body>
   <p>To all friends of the Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani (Council on Higher Education)! This year the Matice has completed the eleventh year of its activities, and its executive committee presents the following brief report:</p>
   <p>The Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani made loans amounting to almost $1,600 to ten students during the year 1913-1914, and at the beginning of the year it was ready to loan them $2,400. However, no more than $1,600 was applied for by the students. The money was loaned to two students from Iowa, two from Nebraska, and one student each from Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, and Texas.</p>
   <p>In the year 1914-1915, $2,500 was apportioned to the students. This was necessary because living expenses are considerably higher this year than last, and the students seem unable to get along on less than $250 a year. Therefore, <pb facs="5418478_1_0143.jpg" n="2"/>should the Matice be in a position to comply with requests for loans next year, it will again be necessary to turn to our friends for the support of this most deserving institution. We know that the attention of all of us is now concentrated on the tragic conditions in the old country, but we know also that there are many of us who are in a position to do our national duty overseas and at home as well. And also, we hope that all our present members will renew their memberships during the coming year.</p>
   <p>We wish to use this opportunity to stress the fact that we manage the money put at our disposal most carefully, that we are doing all our work without any remuneration whatsoever, even paying our own traveling expenses. We do not give away the money, but rather loan it out. Once repaid, the money is loaned out again, and thus every contribution does perpetual service. We are the only Bohemian institution of this kind in America, and if we were fortunate enough to secure large amounts for our purposes, the Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani could do much more for our youth's education than it can do now.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0144.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Our new supervisory committee is composed of the following members: Mr. Robert L. Pitte, Chicago; Mrs. Milostina Bures, Omaha; and Mr. Frantisek Hrubecky, Cleveland.</p>
   <p>For the executive committee of the Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani, F. A. Korab, secretary.</p>
  </body>
