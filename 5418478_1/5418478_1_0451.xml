   <p>A few days ago we brought the information that our countryman, Mr. Jos. F. Kohout, was made a teacher in the City evening school, located in the Foster school building on Union St. So far as we know, English was taught previously by an Irishman, and in his classes were many Bohemians. These, however, practically all stopped attending the school, for that which he taught was anything else but English.</p>
   <p>We hope that everything will change now, and that all those who formerly attended the school will return and with them many new pupils. All those who wish to enroll in the class are urged to report to the principal of the school, and tell him that they are Bohemians and they will be assigned to the class which is under the supervision of Mr. J.F. Kohout.</p>
   <p>Especially our youth who do not know the English language would do well to attend, for they not only would benefit but would serve to advance Bohemian things in general.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0452.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>If Bohemians let it be known that they wish to learn English, a different attitude would be taken toward them in regards to their school matters.</p>
   <p>We shall expect that this little hint will be sufficient and that Mr. Kohout's class will be advantageous and successful.</p>
