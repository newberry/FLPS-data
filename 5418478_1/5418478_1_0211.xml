<title level="a">CZECH CLASSES EXCLUDED FROM THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF CICERO</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>In a meeting of the board of education, officially called Board of Education, School District 99, Cook County, Ill., held yesterday, a resolution submitted by Mr. Frank J. Petru, demanding that the Czech classes be permitted to use classrooms of the public schools for the purpose of teaching the Czech language on Saturdays only, was voted on. It was apparent that the majority of the school board was determined not to yield. Only one member of the school board, Mr. Blaha, supported Mr. Frank J. Petru's resolution, the third Czech member of the school board was not present. The rest of the members of the school board voted against it.</p>
   <p>Following is the text of the resolution:</p>
   <p>"Whereas, On the 23rd day of October in the year of 1919, this school board passed a resolution that it will not permit further use of classrooms for the <pb facs="5418478_1_0212.jpg" n="2"/>purpose of teaching the Czech language on Saturdays; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The majority of the entire population of the Town of Cicero is of Czech origin, although they now are sincere American citizens and good patriots in every detail; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Czechoslovaks of this district and all over the world have performed good service for the United States and its Allies during the World War, which was attested to by President Woodrow Wilson, with the creation and recognition of the Czechoslovak republic, and in other manners; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Czech language is taught in schools all over the world; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, In consequence of this unjust exclusion of these children from the public schools of Cicero, these children were forced to resort to stores, halls, and other places unsuitable, unhealthy and unsafe for them, in order to get this education, and in those places their health, and consequently, the <pb facs="5418478_1_0213.jpg" n="3"/>health of the whole community being endangered; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The Czech fraternal and benevolent societies provide all the necessary funds so that the children can have instructions in their mother tongue; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, These children attending the Czech classes were accused of trifling misconduct which accusations never were proved; and</p>
   <p>"Whereas, The school boards of Chicago, Berwyn, and other cities permitted, and still permit the use of their public schools for the purpose of teaching the Czech language; therefore, be it</p>
   <p>"Resolved, That this school board permit the Czech classes to use the classrooms of public schools, to teach the Czech language on Saturdays, and that for this accommodation and janitor's service the same amount should be charged now as before; and be it further <pb facs="5418478_1_0214.jpg" n="4"/>"Resolved, That if accidentally there should be more complaints against some of these children attending the Saturday Czech classes, or against some of their teachers, these complaints should be sent to this school board in writing."</p>
   <p>The struggle of the Czech school in Cicero apparently is over until the time when the public will elect and send new men to this school board.</p>
   <p>A communication from the Taxpayers' Association, requesting removal of the president of this school board on account of charges brought against him, was not voted on. It was simply announced that the school board had taken this matter up in a special meeting, and decided to pay no attention to this matter at all. Subsequently, we will throw more light on the activities of this famous school board.</p>
