   <p>He who acutely observes the environment and ways of our Czech-American community will notice things that provide food for thought. One of the conspicuous characteristics of the Czechs in America is the lack of self-criticism and insincerity in the exercise of it. We find this deficiency not only in our national and social life, but also in our everyday life, which has become to most people just an endless chase after the dollar, and this in turn has been adopted as the battle cry of every individual. Experience proves this. This lack of self-criticism and this insincere manner in which it is being practiced results in a proclivity to take offense easily, as is well depicted in Podebradka, by the well-known New York Czech-American writer and journalist, Karel Horky. This trait of character was <pb facs="5418478_1_0738.jpg" n="2"/>one of the first observations made by that writer upon his arrival in New York, where he has now made his home.</p>
   <p>Czechs who have settled in America are, for the most part, a very peculiar people. They view all things with optimism, and they are convinced that everything they do is of the best. They criticize the work of others but are sensitive to criticism directed against themselves, especially  when it might produce results unfavorable to them. Many, not all of them, are given to vanity and conceit, resulting in disappointments.....If there were less vanity among our fellow countrymen, the community would fare better in many respects.....</p>
   <p>We do not know how to face the truth. This fault may at some future time be a liability to us. We do not acknowledge our mistakes, even when we ourselves have recognized them. Our reason for this is that we are to blame. If others "had done it," we would submit them to scorching censure. The fact that our own work is at issue, knocks the protective weapon, <pb facs="5418478_1_0739.jpg" n="3"/>self-criticism, from our hand. If this weapon still remained in our grip, we would try to dull its edge or make it less obnoxious in some way or other. At times like those just mentioned, a goodly portion of our insincerity is dormant.....</p>
   <p>The ancient Greeks, guided by one of their eminent philosophers, believed that what is expressed in the words "Know Thyself!" was one of the greatest feats of man.....</p>
   <p>It is our duty to learn from others.....We should search our innermost thoughts and practice criticism of ourselves.....It is most important for our own welfare in Czech-American national and social life.</p>
