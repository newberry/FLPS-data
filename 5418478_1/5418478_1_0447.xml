   <p>Instruction in night schools will start next Monday, October 5, and as in previous years, there will be two-hour classes all weekdays except Friday and Saturday. As their principal purpose, these night schools offer adult immigrants an opportunity to learn the English language, and public school graduates can also add to their educations. For this reason, the schools offer classes in various practical subjects, such as stenography, bookkeeping, typewriting, caligraphy, business correspondence, and in higher classes, various technical subjects.</p>
   <p>In the Harrison, Crane, Lake, Lane, Englewood, Bowen, Medill, Tuley, Waller, Pullman, Phillips, and other high schools, there is instruction in mechanics, drawing, mathematics, electrical engineering, and other practical subjects. There are classes for women's work, such as cooking, sewing, millinery, etc. According to the Chicago School Board's decision, the instruction is free, but pupils of the higher classes, as usual, will have to deposit one dollar, which <pb facs="5418478_1_0448.jpg" n="2"/>will be returned to those who attend classes at least three fourths of the time. Classes will be held in the following schools in Bohemian neighborhoods: [There follows a long list of schools and their locations.]</p>
