   <p>The chief of Police has declared that fifty per cent of Chicago policemen are engaged in the illicit trade of selling alcoholic beverages, and if he should succeed in getting proper evidence, he would discharge perhaps the whole police force even if he had nobody to replace them with but rookies. This declaration was not made by a citizen of whom it might be said that he had political reasons to criticize the police department, but by the chief of police himself, and he must be expected to know what he is talking about. Policemen have a better chance to get away with whiskey selling because they are protected by their uniforms, but it seems that there are now thousands of other people in Chicago who welcome prohibition because it gives them an opportunity to make huge profits. This is only natural in a city where ninety-nine per cent of the population disagree with the prohibition laws and do not consider their violation an offense.</p>
