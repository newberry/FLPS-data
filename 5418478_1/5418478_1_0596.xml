   <p>The people of six Western states and one Southern state will receive a New Year's gift they will have reason to remember with bitterness for many years, and nobody can tell how long it will take before they get back their personal liberty. Six Western states having a population of 8,254,043 will become dry on New Year's Day, and tomorrow is the last day that beer and other alcoholic beverages will be sold there. These states are Iowa, Colorado, Washington, Idaho, Oregon; and Arkansas. The Southern state is South Carolina, which will also join the dry states January 1, 1916. What results this drying up of six prosperous states, some of which are just beginning to enjoy real development and progress, will have is easy to imagine. One immediate result will be that many thousands of people will lose their employment, thousands of families will be reduced to a state of privation, and many million dollars' worth of business will be lost. That will be the immediate result of prohibition, but other results will follow soon and will cause a cessation of the rapid tempo of progress of these states, the development of business <pb facs="5418478_1_0597.jpg" n="2"/>will be retarded, and thousands of people about to make their homes in these comparatively new states will avoid them. This applies, in the first place, to the immigrants. Immigrants do not like to settle in states where the personal liberty of citizens is restricted in that way, and some of the states mentioned are among those in which a new, steady flow of immigrants was being expected, and where they are otherwise offered many advantages. In Oregon, Washington, and in some parts of Colorado and Arkansas, there is a great deal of comparatively inexpensive land suitable for settlement, and a very large number of our countrymen who live there enjoy a high degree of prosperity. These will certainly not welcome their New Year's donation, it may discourage many of those who expected to go West, and, all in all, nobody can maintain that the introduction of such laws can do these states any good.</p>
   <p>Iowa is the only one of the older states that expects to enjoy complete prohibition after New Year's. A degree of prohibition is not new to Iowa. It has been rather dry for many years. Since its original enactment, many laws have been passed modifying some aspects of it, mitigating its unfortunate effects upon <pb facs="5418478_1_0598.jpg" n="3"/>the population. One of them was the so-called "Mulct Law" permitting the sale of alcoholic beverages, and after its enactment sixteen breweries were built in Iowa. This law was recalled a year ago and Iowa reverts to the state in which it was many years ago when its first prohibition law was put on the statute books. The first effect of this law will be that the sixteen breweries will be closed by tomorrow night, and 136 saloons will be put out of existence. Eleven breweries and 1600 saloons will be ruined in Colorado; many of the latter were in summer resorts where local option was not in force and enjoyed a good deal of prosperity. After New Year's no alcoholic beverages will be sold in Colorado, except on a physician's prescription, but at least for a time after that day the state will not be fully dry. It is reported that the people of Colorado have been laying in supplies of alcoholic beverages for several weeks, and that miners and ranchers are taking out with them whisky in barrels so that they will not go thirsty when the lights in the saloons are put out for good. Also, druggists are laying in supplies of wine and whisky so that they may have something to sell on doctors' prescriptions, a method which, at least at the beginning, will be the easiest one by <pb facs="5418478_1_0599.jpg" n="4"/>which to evade the law. So, Colorado will have some wine and some whisky for those who comply with the law and get a doctor's prescription, but the most harmless of alcoholic beverages, beer, will be most difficult to get in dry Colorado. The same undoubtedly applies to all the other states where prohibition comes into effect Saturday. It will be much easier for the people to buy whisky which, as is always the case in dry states and districts, will be of the worst kind imaginable, and thus prohibition, instead of promoting temperance, will result in excessive drinking of hard liquor of a quality more likely to be injurious to human health.</p>
   <p>Oregon will most likely have its prohibition on paper only, and its drying-up will result in people's paying more for beer and other alcoholic beverages than before because they will have to order them from other states. This is also likely to cause the consumption of inferior liquor because there will be no choice and the people will have to drink what they are sent. The new prohibition law of Oregon premits every family to order twenty-four quarts of beer and two quarts of wine or liquor every four weeks. Some Oregon liquor <pb facs="5418478_1_0600.jpg" n="5"/>dealers will move to California and send their goods to their former home state by express. Undoubtedly, also, most of the beer will go to Oregon from California.</p>
   <p>The closing of saloons in the state of Washington tomorrow will be accompanied by the hope that it will not be forever. The prohibition law will be submitted to the popular vote next November, and the liberal people hope that ten months' experience with prohibition will be enough to make everybody vote against it. They have thus a trial prohibition, and the ten months' trial should convince everybody of its unsoundness. The new prohibition laws of Idaho and Arkansas are particularly strict and will be hard to circumvent. Arkansas has a penalty of one year in the penitentiary for violation of the prohibition law, and, to make matters worse, the judges are not permitted to suspend or otherwise mitigate the sentence.</p>
   <p>General prospects for the future are by no means encouraging. Including South Carolina and Virginia, where prohibition will go into effect November 1 <pb facs="5418478_1_0601.jpg" n="6"/>next year, there will be nineteen dry states and a number of others in grave danger of becoming so. The prohibition question will be voted upon next year in Nebraska, South Dakota, Michigan, Vermont, California, and Alaska, and possibly a few more. Everything points to the fact that the prohibition wave is growing, which, by the way, the people in Chicago have experienced. Our dry Sundays made the beginning, and our prohibitionists hope that they will succeed in drying up Chicago for good by the April elections. It is quite certain that this will not be the case, but what is going on in other states and cities should be a warning to our people to be constantly on the alert.</p>
