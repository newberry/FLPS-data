   <p>.....There are many newly registered voters among us. These men in particular must be advised to vote for Mr. Anton J. Cermak and Mr. Josef Mendl. These new citizens must recognize that we as a group have never before had such an opportunity to distinguish ourselves as we have now by placing these two men in the offices for which they are candidates. Moreover, we are certain that this time there will be a great many Czechoslovak Republicans who for the past two years have avoided the primaries, but who will take part in the election this time with the sole purpose of voting for Cermak and Mendl, both of whom are members of the regular Democratic organization. Let no one forget that in primary elections it is not a question of victory of the Democrats over the Republicans or vice versa; this political battle concerns merely the nomination of candidates who will engage in the actual political contest in the fall elections.....</p>
   <p>In spite of inclement weather there were many meetings yesterday to boost Messrs. Anton J. Cermak and Josef Mendl. What particularly pleased us was the large <pb facs="5418478_1_1336.jpg" n="2"/>attendance of our Czechoslovak women and girls. It became evident that the young element--we might say our Czechoslovak Democratic juniors--attend all these meetings with great regularity, and are in the majority in all of them.....This was the case for instance, in a meeting which took place in the Marshall Square Theatre, 22nd Street and Marshall Boulevard, and again in Mr. Basta's hall on 26th Street. Both meetings were attended by great numbers of our young people....The latter meeting was addressed by Messrs. Otto Kerner, Jiri Basta, Alderman J. Cepak, and Otto R. Fuerst. Tonight another meeting will take place in Mr. Randak's hall on 27th Street and Turner Avenue....</p>
