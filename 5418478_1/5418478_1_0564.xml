   <p>The prohibitionists declare that at least $100,000 will be needed for the successful prosecution of the campaign which aims at mopping Chicago dry. It is not certain, at the present time, whether so much money will be needed. The "wets" are surely doing their best to keep contributions down. They do it by exposing forged signatures on the "dry" petition.</p>
   <p>When the prohibitionists made an attempt a few years ago to "dry up" Chicago, they had several Lincolns, Washingtons, and Roosevelts on their petitions; also numerous names known from history or otherwise, whose bearers have already departed from this wicked world or who never had the right to vote. Such names are likely to appear on the petition which is to be circulated now. Of those who are dead the prohibitionists may claim at least with some justification that they are really "dry".</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0565.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Incidentally, however, names of the sort just described do not count, and if a sufficient number of them is discovered it may happen that there will be no voting on prohibition next April. In the reverse case, the liberal element will have to make extreme efforts to win. The beating administered to the prohibitionists must become so sound that they will lose any desire to make Chicago dry for a long time to come.</p>
