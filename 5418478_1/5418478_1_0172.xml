   <p>The Council for Higher Education at this time is accepting applications of Bohemian students of both sexes who have talent and desire to continue or complete their studies, but do not have the means to achieve their aims. A sum not exceeding two hundred fifty dollars for each school year will be loaned on a pledge of honor, without interest, to such students who meet the requirements prescribed by the regulations of the Executive Committee of the Council for Higher Education. The requirements are published here, and we urge everyone who thinks of making application should read them. They are: Candidates, of both sexes, must be of Bohemian origin, have a knowledge of the Bohemian language, and the sentiment of a Bohemian, must lead a proper and moral life, and show the necessary capabilities for studies at a higher school of learning. Applications are accepted from those only who lack the necessary means for independent study. Further, the candidate must have <pb facs="5418478_1_0173.jpg" n="2"/>a certificate of graduation from an accredited High School or other school comparable to it. The petitioner, in his application, will make known at which of the schools approved by the Council for Higher Education he wishes to study, after which the student must comply with the entrance requirements of said institution and complete successfully at least a half year's work at the institution where he will use the loan, or give proof that comparable work was completed at some other school. The applicant will agree to complete the full Collegiate Course and consent to have the management of said school make reports occasionally to the Executive Committee about the student's progress. Special studies such as medicine, law, pharmacy, art, music, voice, theology, business and like subjects, are not included in the Collegiate Course. For that reason, loans are not made to students of these courses.</p>
   <p>Students should take notice especially of the absolute necessity for thorough preparation, and completed preliminary education in English <pb facs="5418478_1_0174.jpg" n="3"/>grammar, because all higher schools lay stress upon this subject, and the student should sense the importance of a complete grammatical knowledge of the language which is used exclusively at all lectures in this country. In many cases, Bohemian students prove to be weak in this subject, some of them even fail in various subjects as a result of insufficient preparation in English, therefore, the Executive Committee is forced to lay greater stress upon this requirement. Applications from students are made on special forms which are furnished to each applicant. They must be in the hands of the Executive Committee before September 1, 1911. Applicants should furnish the names of countrymen, teachers, or professors, who can give a report about the applicant and recommend him. All communications should be sent to the assistant secretary: John Stepan, Cedar Rapids, Iowa. For the Council for Higher Education: B. Simek, president. P. A. Korab, secretary.</p>
