   <p>In some of our wards settled by the Czechs, a lively interest is noticeable in next Tuesday's primaries, and we dare predict that in those wards where a number of candidates are seeking nominations, a large number of Czech voters will go to the polls.</p>
   <p>The wards in which there are a number of candidates for alderman, will witness a strong fight to gain the coveted place on the ballot sheet, and the citizens of Czech parents should not forget to take an active interest in the coming primaries, and to make certain to vote for such men who, in their opinion, will best represent their interests.</p>
   <p>.....The importance of next Tuesday's primaries in the 34th Ward lies in the fact that our sitting alderman, Jan Toman, should be shown that the citizens of his ward have the confidence in his ability, and should show it by going to <pb facs="5418478_1_1382.jpg" n="2"/>the polls in large numbers and casting their votes for Alderman Toman.</p>
   <p>Mr. Toman has shown himself a champion in the cause of the rights of the people, and as chairman of the license committee did invaluable work in the interest of personal freedom; and for the many attainments in this respect our thanks are due Mr. Toman.</p>
   <p>Our liberty-loving citizens should show, by registering a large vote for Alderman Toman, that we appreciate his efforts in our behalf, and that every vote cast for Jan Toman is a vote against the reactionary element.</p>
