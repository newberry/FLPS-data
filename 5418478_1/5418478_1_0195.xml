   <p>The State of Illinois has experienced considerable difficulty in forcing the foreign-born in sending their children to school. When asked why they did not send their children to school, they would reply that they had no money or clothes to send the children to school with. When that was furnished they still did not send them.</p>
   <p>Finally Mrs. Axford, a woman with a twelve year old boy, whom she refused to send to school after repeated orders, was made an example of. She was brought before the judge, fined $20.00 and forced to send the boy to school. This example made the other recalcitrant parents take notice and as a consequence the school was crowded on the following day.</p>
   <p>The law is that all children must attend school form the ages of 7 to 14. Heretofore, small children were sent to factories and lot of them had no schooling at all, leaving them illiterate. The English language is taught in all schools, whether they be secular or public and all children should be given an opportunity to acquire an education.</p>
