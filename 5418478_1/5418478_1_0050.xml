   <p>The settlers in Novy Tabor (The New Camp), known as the Merigold settlement, have long been trying to obtain a schoolhouse. One site was found, on 18th Street and Kildare Avenue, and was suitable for the purpose. Although it had previously been used only as a brickyard, Burke, the owner, demanded an exhorbitant price; and as a result the School Board was obliged to start expropriation proceedings. The lower court not only ruled against Burke, but even set the price of the lot at fully six thousand dollars less than that offered by the School Board.</p>
   <p>John Toman, Alderman of the Thirty-fourth Ward, later appeared before the School Board, where he was assured that, as Burke's appeal is likely to prove futile, teaching will be begun next year.</p>
   <p>School children will be enrolled in the lower grades; and the plan is to be extended gradually until all classes are established.</p>
