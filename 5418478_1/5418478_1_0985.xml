   <p>Many of our Chicago fellow-citizens of Czech descent have had frightful experiences as depositors of banks which were not under State supervision, and which had resorted to false pretenses in order to build up their deposits with the money of those who trusted in their honesty. Security is necessary in every transaction, and our Czech banks offer their depositors security beyond any doubt. We are giving a list of banking institutions which have earned a reputation by right conduct in their business. They are under strict state or federal supervision; all of them are members of the Chicago Clearing House, which accredits them as responsible institutions. If our fellow-countrymen will transact their business through these banks, the safety of their money will be assured. (Banks listed.)</p>
