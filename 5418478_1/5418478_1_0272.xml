   <p>It was only natural that we were greatly pleased last year over the introduction of the Bohemian language as a subject of instruction in the high schools on the condition that a sufficient number of pupils would enroll in the Bohemian classes. Shortly after this victory, we came close to a disappointment when the fact was disclosed that among Bohemian parents and pupils, there is no genuine interest in this most important achievement.</p>
   <p>This year offers an excellent opportunity to do what was neglected last year. If this opportunity is not taken advantage of fully, we shall stop wondering why the Chicago Board of Education tarried so long before consenting to the introduction of the Bohemian language into the high schools. This would almost lead us to believe that the Board may know us better than we know ourselves.</p>
