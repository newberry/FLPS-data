   <p>P .4--Mayor Dunne has not forgotten the promises on the basis of which he won so brilliant a victory last spring. He is working steadily on the establishment of public ownership, though thus far very little has been accomplished in this direction, since he has had to devote most of his time to the removal of the obstacles which others have persistently placed in the path of his project. The street-car company is trying to profit as much as possible by the deal, but Mayor Dunne played a trump card when he built a hundred miles of city lines. When these have been proved to be capable of competing with the privately-owned lines, the profit of the latter will decrease, their expenses will increase, and the way will be better prepared for a final agreement on the sale of the street-car lines to the city than by the cleverest handling of the project thru the agency of the courts.</p>
