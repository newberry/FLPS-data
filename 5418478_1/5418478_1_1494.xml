   <p>We urgently beg all of our countrymen who wish to have an honest administration in our city to work with utmost diligence to secure the election of the Socialist-Labor Party Candidates for office, at the coming elections. Do not remain away from the polling places. Induce those who would stay away to go and perform their duty as citizens. Particular attention should be directed toward the election of Aldermen in order that we may be able to announce the selection of at least four new Socialist Aldermen in the city council on Wednesday.</p>
   <p>All the candidates on the Socialist Labor Party Ticket are honest, experienced workers who will ardently support and work for the class from which they originate. Our countrymen, especially those living in the fifth ward are cautioned to let nothing mislead them but to unanimously vote for the nominated candidate T. J. Morgan. Mr. Morgan is deserving of the gratitude of the workingclasses of Chicago for his untiring efforts in helping them to organize. He is truly an honorable, educated man and an excellent speaker and most important of all, he is not a friend of the Gas Companies and other profiteering public utility companies.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1495.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The nominees of the other strongly Bohemian wards, namely the 6th, 7th, 8th and 14th are people who will bring honor to us in the city's Council Chambers and will serve us well. Attention is called to the fact that we will have specimen ballots for your guidance and we request you to examine and compare with our specimen ballot the ballot which you receive at the polling place.</p>
   <p>The Republicans and Democrats are expected to resort to strategic craftiness. They will have printed in addition to their own Socialist Ballots with the names of candidates either mispelled or disfigured. Failing to have you vote their ticket they may attempt to hand you one of these spoiled Socialist ballots so that your vote will be thrown out. So please be cautious.</p>
