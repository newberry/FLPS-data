<title level="a">THE GREAT POLITICAL CAMPAIGN NEARS ITS END</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The political campaign will end today, and tomorrow will be devoted to the final preparations for the election which, according to disinterested observers, will mean victory for the Democratic ticket. There does not seem to be the slightest doubt that the citizens of our district are determined to protest by their votes the unbearably high taxes, the shameful management in the City Hall, the School Board graft, and the scandals which appear from time to time in the various offices controlled by Republicans.</p>
   <p>By electing the Democratic candidates we will prevent the Thompson-Lundin clique from bringing the whole county under its control. The taxes are increased equally in the rural districts as in the city, and to prevent the continuance of the regime it is the duty of all citizens, no matter what their political party, to vote the Democratic ticket and thus bring about <pb facs="5418478_1_1269.jpg" n="2"/>an improvement in the offices of the county.....</p>
   <p>In the Sokol Chicago Hall there will be a great Democratic rally this afternoon; it will be the last meeting in the present campaign, and the Czechoslovak voters should attend it en masse. By a large attendance we shall prove that we are interested in the outcome of the Tuesday election.....To clean up Chicago it is necessary for every citizen, man and woman, to do the duty of a citizen, and it is therefore desirable for all citizens to come to a meeting to hear the reasons why they should vote Democratic next Tuesday. There will be excellent speakers here, including our foremost Democratic candidates. The program will also contain entertaining items, and among others, Mr. Ernest Balda, known as "a man with a girl's voice," will sing.</p>
   <p>There will be meetings also in the Bohemian free Thought School, 48th and Honore Streets, Town of Lake, and in the Plzensky Sokol (Pilsen Sokol), 18th Street and Ashland Avenue. In both of these afternoon meetings the citizens <pb facs="5418478_1_1270.jpg" n="3"/>will be addressed by candidates such as Mr. Anton J. Cermak, Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, Mr. Joseph A. Mendl, James M. Dailey, M. L. Igoe, Edmund K. Jarecki, R. M. Sweitzer, P. J. Carr, U. S. Schwartz and others.....</p>
   <p>Czech Republicans recommend Cermak. That aid and support are given to the Alderman A. J. Cermak on all sides, even by the ranks of Bohemian Republicans, is attested by a resolution which was just passed and signed by a large number of prominent Republicans from all parts of Chicago. The resolution is as follows:</p>
   <p>"Next Tuesday, November 7, there will be an election of county and other officials. In this election the well-known and devoted worker, Mr. Anton J. Cermak, is running for the office of president and member of the County Board of Commissioners. In considering his merits in our national life, his merits in our Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) and in all other works of charity; in considering further his ability <pb facs="5418478_1_1271.jpg" n="4"/>to guide public offices in which he always proved to be the champion of Czechoslovaks, and because the control of the various county institutions is in the hands of the president of the Board of County Commissioners--we, the undersigned Czechoslovak voters, belonging to the Republican party, recommend for national reasons the election of Mr. Cermak as president and member of the Board of County Commissioners, hoping that there will not be a single Czechoslovak who would deny him his vote."</p>
   <p>Here follow the names of our foremost citizens of Republican persuasion, located in all parts of Chicago and Cicero. Their declaration is a proof that enthusiastic work is going on among all groups of our people so that Mr. Cermak might be elected.</p>
