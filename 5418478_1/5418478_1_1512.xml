<title level="a">MINUTES OF THE MONTHLY MEETING OF THE CESKO-SLOVANSKY POPLATNICKY SPOLEK V CICERO</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Cesko-Slovansky Poplatnicky Spolek v Ciceru, Illinois (Czecnoslovakian taxpayers' association of Cicero, Illinois) took place last Saturday in the large hall of the T. G. Masaryk School. In spite of the very hot weather, the meeting was well attended. Mr. H. Krcek presided. Mr. V. Rous....read the minutes of the previous meeting. The minutes were approved as read. There were a great many applications for membership, due to the fact that the Spolek is fulfilling its mission conscientiously and honestly. All applications were approved. The induction of these new members will take place on August 20, 1922, which has been set aside for a picnic, the likes of which Cicero has never before seen.</p>
   <p>The most interesting report made by the committee was the one concerning a citizenship school, which is run by Messrs. Langer and Svoboda. Both gentlemen reported that over one hundred applicants [for citizenship] had enrolled <pb facs="5418478_1_1513.jpg" n="2"/>in the school, and since one teacher was not enough, another will be provided.</p>
   <p>As regards the paving of 56th Avenue, it was decided that a letter should be written to the City Council in which an urgent request should be made that the aforesaid street might be put into good shape. The vehicle license fees provide the city with an income for that purpose. It was decided to write to the Council and request that a statement be furnished showing exactly how much money has been received from vehicle-license fees, and how much of that money has been used, and for what purpose; the statement is to specify which streets have been paved.</p>
   <p>A discussion followed in which it was decided to ask the City Council to furnish a list showing exactly how many employees there are on the city pay roll, and how much each one was paid during the month of July (1921.)</p>
   <p>In this meeting certain bad features on the platforms of the elevated stations <pb facs="5418478_1_1514.jpg" n="3"/>were discussed. The platforms are not covered, are badly lighted, and have no toilets. It was decided that the secretary should write to the management of the "L" requesting that these shortcomings be eliminated.....</p>
   <p>V. Rous, secretary.</p>
