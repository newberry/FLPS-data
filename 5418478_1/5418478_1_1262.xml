   <p>It is expected of every voter that he perform his duty as a citizen correctly and conscientiously for the good of the whole [community], but at the same time the recognition which is accorded to Czechoslovak voters cannot be over-looked. At the Tuesday election many public officers will be chosen for the various offices of the County, the Sanitary District, the Board of Assessors, the Board of Reviews, and in Chicago sixteen judges are to be elected to the Municipal Court--all in all a large number of public offices will be filled. The political parties had, therefore, a good opportunity to choose men for these offices among all groups of Chicago's population which would thus be represented in the administration of the affairs of the city, the County, etc.</p>
   <p>We do not say that because a man is a Czech or a Pole he ought to be elected to office, but we do believe that really able people should be nominated for <pb facs="5418478_1_1263.jpg" n="2"/>public office, and when a [party] ticket is being organized care should be taken not to give the impression that certain groups and elements of the population do not have men fitted for office. As long as the political leaders act this way they cannot expect any enthusiasm among the voters who believe, and justly so, that they are intentionally being overlooked.</p>
   <p>It is necessary that we point to this situation for the simple reason that four of our countrymen are included on the Democratic ticket, and one of them--Mr. Anton J. Cermak--is a candidate for the high office of president of the Board of County Commissioners. It is one of the greatest and most responsible offices, in many ways parallel to the office of mayor of the city of Chicago. Czechoslovak voters should be pleased, therefore, not only because Mr. Cermak was chosen by the Democratic party to run for this office, but also because they may claim with good conscience that he greatly excells his Republican rival in abilities, energy, and outlook. If he is elected, a thing which we devoutly hope for, he will serve the interests of citizens in the entire County and surely for the great honor of Czechoslovak voters who by the full strength <pb facs="5418478_1_1264.jpg" n="3"/>of their vote will contribute to his victory next Tuesday.</p>
   <p>Besides Mr. Cermak there is Mr. Josef Mendl whose name may be found among the candidates on the Democratic ticket, and who is running for the office of county commissioner. He is generally known as an able and experienced man for he has already served one term as county commissioner, a fact which should make his election all the more certain. His election is assured with the aid of the Czechoslovak vote. But while Mr. Mendl's candidacy is that of a county commissioner for Chicago only, Mr. Cermak's candidacy affects both the city and all other parts of the County of Cook. We presume that our Czechoslovak voters will vote for the entire Democratic ticket, and if they place a cross in front of the name of the [Democratic] party, their vote will count for both of the aforenamed candidates. Whoever intends to split his vote must be extremely careful not to waste his ballot. In the case of his not voting straight, he must vote twice for Mr. Cermak if he is a resident of Chicago; thus he will vote once for Cermak as a member of the Board of County Commissioners, and again as the president of that Board. This double voting will not affect <pb facs="5418478_1_1265.jpg" n="4"/>of their vote will contribute to his victory next Tuesday.</p>

This double voting will not affect <pb facs="5418478_1_1266.jpg" n="5"/>voters outside of Chicago, and they need vote only once because Mr. Cermak's name will appear only once on all out-of-town ballots. It is further to be pointed out that only ten county commissioners are to be elected in the city [of Chicago], and if anyone should affix his cross in front of the party's name and later decide to put a cross in front of the name of a Republican candidate for a county commissioner, his vote would not go to Mr. Cermak. By doing that he would in reality vote for eleven county commissioners, that is, ten in the Democratic column and one in the Republican, and since the election commissioners would not know which of the ten [Democratic] county commissioners he selected they would scratch out all of the Democratic candidates including both Cermak and Mendl. The voters must therefore be extra careful and in case of their having the desire to vote for [one Republican] candidate they must specify which of the nine remaining [Democratic] candidates he desires.</p>
   <p>By voting straight Democratic a voter will avoid all these complications and dangers, besides giving his full vote to that party which gave recognition to the Czechoslovak element by slating four of our countrymen for public office.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1267.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>All Czechoslovak voters, both men and women, should forever bear in mind that there are four of our countrymen on the Democratic ticket and not one on the Republican--and act accordingly next Tuesday.....</p>
