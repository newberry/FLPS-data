   <p>The executive committee of the United Societies met in the Briggs House last Thursday after the summer vacation. A resolution was passed to send a protest to the city council against the proposed closing of dance halls and cabarets in which intoxicating beverages are served. Attorney Cyril Jandus, speaking for the Chicago Czechs, warned the gathering against the proposed measure. "The contention that the obnoxious ordinance will 'purify' the various places is only a pretense, a veiled threat to curtail personal liberty," he said. "The United Societies were founded to defend the right of anyone to drink his glass of beer whenever and wherever he pleases to do so."....</p>
   <p>The press committee of the Societies, of which two Czechs, Joseph Stastny and J. A. Hospodsky, are also members, announced that a press campaign against <pb facs="5418478_1_0578.jpg" n="2"/>prohibition has been launched.....Mr. Stastny suggested the establishment of a special press bureau which would supply all foreign language papers with the proceedings and resolutions of the United Societies. This proposal found unanimous favor.</p>
   <p>Judge Joseph Uhlir and Mr. Smejkal were two other Czech members present. Mrs. Zenisek, also a Czech member of the committee, was given thanks for her excellent work done in behalf of the Societies.</p>
