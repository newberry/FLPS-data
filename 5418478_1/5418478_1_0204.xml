   <p>We are obliged to enter in this public paper the names of the Bohemian pupils in our public schools, who have successfully completed the studies in the higher grades. In comparison with the large number of Bohemians in the city, they are very, very few in number, only three this year.</p>
   <p>They are Fr. Patera, Fr. Novy, both whom attended the local high school with great success and have obtained their diplomas, proving their industry and extra ordinary ability. At the Foster public school, Vac. Salek was the recipient of such recognition as is seldom given to more then one or two pupils of a class. However, much the successes of these pupils pleases us, we cannot overcome our sorrow over the fact that so few of our boys attend, (and probably none of our girls) the high schools.</p>
   <p>It must be understood that, the fault lies with the parents, who do not realize, that by giving their children an education, they give them more than any amount of labor could provide. It is about time that Bohemian parents took more interest in our high schools and helped their children to a better education. This would of itself raise their standing as <pb facs="5418478_1_0205.jpg" n="2"/>citizens and make their prospects of the future much brighter. There are quite a large number of us here and it is time to give thought to it, that we might have among us more men able to work in the interests of our countrymen in the midst of strange customs.</p>
