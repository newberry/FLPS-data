   <p>It is becoming quite manifest that religions are on the decline, churches are remaining empty, the clerical business is unprofitable and that people solicitous about the happiness, contentment and morality of their descendants, must make preparations to have their children well educated in the schools, to free them of all superstitions in the home, so that they will be able in the new century, without the aid of preachers and priests, to live orderly, morally and happily.</p>
   <p>A new era is approaching; it will be better than the old; it will be more progressive, more cultured and happier, but only for those who free themselves of prejudices, superstitions and ecclesiastical bug-bears, and depend upon honorable work, honorable thoughts, good will and sincere hearts, who will be loyal to truth, liberty and humanity in all their endeavors.</p>
   <p>One such indication of the nearness of the new era frightened the godly methodists on the 27th of March, who, in their prejudiced simpleness believe that only their creed redeems mankind, and that without their creed everyone becomes a criminal.</p>

   <p>jail-bird or gallows prey. The Methodist clergy of the city and environs hold a meeting every Monday, to formulate plans as to the best method of urging subjugation of the people to their creed.</p>
   <p>The Methodist Church is face to face with a decision and the coming twentieth century brings surprising changes, the question remaining whether for better or more likely for worse.</p>
   <p>Today whole groups of its members are turning away from the church and joining in preference social, scientific, literary and art clubs, and of these none ever return to the church.</p>
   <p>In vain do preachers pound the bible while preaching the old dogmas. We must find some new source of enthusiasm. In the coming century we must turn about or it will be amen for the church.</p>
