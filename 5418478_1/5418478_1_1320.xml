   <p>.....The Czechoslovak Democratic voters will find the names of candidates on their ballot who fully deserve their votes. We are absolutely certain that every Bohemian Democrat will vote for Mr. Anton J. Cermak for president and member of the Board of County Commissioners. We are equally sure that all of our voters will cast his ballot in favor of Mr. Josef A. Mendl who seeks the office of a member of the said Board, but we must emphasize the fact that Mendl's candidacy is for the city of Chicago only. Besides these two candidates, our Czechoslovak voters should also cast their ballots in behalf of other good candidates who deserve their confidence. Judge Edmund K. Jarecki [Pole] has proved that he is an excellent municipal judge, and that his activities encompass a wide sphere. That he is fully able to fill his important office was attested by two great legal organizations--the Chicago Bar Association being one of them.....</p>
