   <p>In recognition of his untiring activities among his countrymen, the Bohemian citizens of Chicago, Mr. Jaroslav Zmrhal, a teacher at the Farragut School, 24th Street and Spaulding Avenue, was awarded a scholarship to the University of Chicago by the Colonial Dames of America Society. Mr. Zmrhal won his position as a teacher through his own diligence. After his arrival in America he had to learn the English language like any other immigrant. Afterwards he taught in the lower schools, and attended evening lectures at the University of Chicago. Later, wishing to become more useful to his countrymen, he sacrificed the University lectures and dedicated himself to the development of an evening school for his countrymen. His activities were noticed by the University Settlement leaders, and it was upon their recommendation that he was awarded the scholarship mentioned above.</p>
