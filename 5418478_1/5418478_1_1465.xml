   <p>In a meeting of the 8th ward Democratic Club, among other things, it was resolved to decide on some capable Bohemian to be recommended to the Mayor for appointment to the School Board. Although it is somewhat early, because the Mayor ordinarily makes appointments to the School Board in June or July, we take the privilege to say a few words on the matter, for we know quite well the importance of the office, and what qualifications a citizen should have if he wished to strive for this office.</p>
   <p>To anyone claiming that "Svornost" as an independent paper has no right to give the Democrats advice, we must reply:- The Bohemian whom we expect will be appointed to the School Board this year, will not represent merely the Bohemian Democrats, he will represent all Bohemians in Chicago, regardless of party affiliation.</p>
   <p>If the man appointed to the Board is capable, it will reflect honor upon all Bohemians. If he is not capable of holding the office, it will likewise be a discredit to all Bohemians and not merely to the Democrats. For that reason we wish to mention briefly some of the responsibilities a member of the School Board must assume.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1466.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When our Democratic friends make their recommendation to the Mayor, let them answer the question at least ten times: Is the nominee qualified to fill the office?</p>
   <p>The School Board, like other bodies, is divided into various committees. There are only a few members on the School Board, making it necessary for each member to be on several committees. There is the committee on books and education, the committee on teachers, the committee on deaf mutes, the committee on legal affairs. A member of the School Board is expected to visit some school occasionally. Annually we have several celebrations, examinations, the distributions of diplomas and so on. It is a duty of a member of the School Board to ocassionally visit these schools and address the pupils.</p>
   <p>These are only a few of the most important duties, there are many more which require ability and education.</p>
   <p>Bohemian Democrats have among themselves many capable citizens, let them nominate and recommend to the Mayor several, and let him make his choice.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1467.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>If only one is selected the Mayor might have the opportunity to say that he did not know the man and appoint some one else. Take great care that those who are recommended for appointment are capable of filling the Office.</p>
