   <p>Last week, Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, representing a preponderantly Czech district in Chicago, presented to the House a bill demanding that all bonded liquor be bought by the Government, and to place it on the market for medicinal or industrial purposes. Besides this, the Government is to refund taxes to owners who had not been permitted to sell their liquor. Such an arrangement would certainly be justified, because people who have been deprived of their valuable property through no fault of their own, surely have a good claim for damages. The only question is, however, whether the Government can bear such an enormous expenditure.</p>
   <p>About sixty million gallons of liquor are stored up in the Government warehouses, and if the Government were to buy up the entire stock, the amount would be quite excessive. Those congressmen who are responsible <pb facs="5418478_1_0460.jpg" n="2"/>for prohibition ought also to find a way for a just restitution, and should, therefore, support Congressman Sabath's proposed measure.</p>
