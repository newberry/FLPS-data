<title level="a">TWO CICERO TAXPAYERS' ASSOCIATIONS WILL MERGE TODAY</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The residents of Cicero will witness an event of great significance tonight which will not remain without influence upon the future life and activities of the taxpayers' associations of that community. These associations often prevent injustices which would surely occur were there no supervision or control of community affairs. Cicero has an active Czechoslovak taxpayers' association which consists of some four hundred active members. In the same community there also existed the taxpayers' association, Clyde, which, though smaller in membership, followed all the current events with interest and took part in all those transactions which concerned its members and all other taxpayers in general.</p>
   <p>The members of these two bodies recently decided that it would be a good thing if they were to combine both associations into one and thus in unison launch a more effective campaign. Both sides appointed a committee which met on various occasions to deliberate on the realization of this plan; the results <pb facs="5418478_1_1531.jpg" n="2"/>of all these meetings ended in an agreement to unite the two taxpayers' associations. The official step will be made this evening at eight o'clock in the T. G. Masaryk school. It is expected that this significant event will draw all the members of both bodies. In addition to the unification ceremony, there will also be some interesting discussions.</p>
   <p>The executive and administrative officers of Cicero have been invited to this meeting, chiefly to give their reasons why Cicero should continue to operate as a community and not be granted the status of a city. Reasons why the Cicero community should become a city were given by other competent men, and so the present members of the aforenamed taxpayers' association were anxious to hear both sides of the controversy.</p>
   <p>Among those invited to the meeting are Professor Jaroslav J. Zmrhal, who is a principal of a public school; Professor Skřítecký, and others. These men have been asked to give their opinions as to the advisability of building high <pb facs="5418478_1_1532.jpg" n="3"/>schools for Cicero and its vicinity. It is expected that twenty-five new members will join the association and that there will be a discussion centering about the needs of the community, as well as other items of community interest.....</p>
