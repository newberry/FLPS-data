   <p>The hall of Sokol Chicago on Kedzie Avenue was filled to capacity yesterday by a meeting of the Democratic organization of the Twelfth Ward, called "Twelfth Ward Guards," in the interest of Alderman Anton J. Čermàk, president of the organization and a candidate for the office of the Chief Bailiff of the Municipal Court, and of F. E. Dunne, former judge and ex-mayor of Chicago, now a candidate for the governorship of our state.....</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by President Čermàk....who introduced a number of speakers, most of them Democratic candidates for offices to be filled in the coming election.....First among these was Mayor Harrison, who in a brief but well organized speech bespoke the support of the Democratic ballot.....He requested Mr. Cermak to introduce Mr. F. E. Dunne who....pointed out that the principal care of the Republican administrations in Washington and Springfield during the past sixteen years was merely to promote the interests of large corporations and to build trusts to the detriment of labor and small businessmen.....</p>

   <p>Among the Bohemian speakers were Mr. J. B. Dibelka, a member of the Chicago Board of Education....and Mr. John A. Červenka....both of whom talked about the unusual abilities and merits of the several candidates on the Democratic ticket.....</p>
