<title level="a">THE AMERICAN PRESS ON OUR PATRIOTIC WORK REPORTS ON CZECH NATIONAL ALLIANCE MEETINGS (From the Press Bureau of the Czech National Alliance)</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The English language papers gave considerable space lately to items on the recruiting of Czech volunteers, and to our exertions for the independence of the Czech nation.</p>
   <p>Though we would not attach excessive value to them we hold these reports to be important and we appreciate them. The American offices which furnish newspaper clippings work inaccurately, and so it is difficult for our press bureau to check up on the news which concern our national work.</p>
   <p>The liveliest interest was evoked in Chicago by our action for the removal of the Kaiser story from the Chicago schoolbooks in which it was retained by pro-teutonic members of the School Board. Our action bore fruit in that <pb facs="5418478_1_0762.jpg" n="2"/>it was reported by the local dailies and was particularly taken notice of by our state authorities.</p>
   <p>The publicity given our cause gathered momentum, and it may be contended that today the greater part of the community is grateful to the Czech National Alliance for having taken a stand against the Kaiser story. We have received hundreds of letters in which credit is given the Alliance. Newspapers of other cities have taken up the issue, so that the broader strata of the American public is paying much more attention to our organization than in former times.</p>
   <p>Our recruiting activities and the mass meetings arranged by the Czech National Alliance have contributed very much to the popularization of our movement which has been commented on by almost all the Chicago dailies, and also by papers of New York, St. Paul, Minneapolis, and Detroit.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0763.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>There was for instance a meeting in Minneapolis,...... where J. Turzicky spoke, who is secretary of the Czech National Alliance, to encourage enlistment, and which was commended in diverse papers.</p>
   <p>There is a difference in the liberation of nations. Czar Nicholas of Russia, and also the Kaiser, promised the Poles a separation from other nations, but under a new potentate in the person of a viceroy. The Poles do not want a king, and the Czechs do not long for any more kings from the royal line of the Ottakars. The Ukrainians do not hanker for the grand dukes from Kijev. These nations demand complete liberty and a crowning of the people themselves with the crown insignia of democracy.</p>
   <p>The news of the successful participation of the New York Czechs in the manifestation under the slogan "Wake up America" are of special interest to us, for the Czechs were given there, if not the first, still a prominent place.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0764.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Nowhere has the entrance of America into the War evoked more exultation than among the Czechs and Slovaks. These two nations know the methods of the Germans and Magyars. There are still thousands of Czechs and Slovaks in prisons, and thousands have been executed.</p>
   <p>The defeat of the Austrians in Galicia was inflicted upon them by the Czech and Slovak soldiers. Entire regiments of the latter are now fighting in the Russian ranks against Austria and Germany. In the French Army, there is the Czech Legion and one contingent in the Canadian Army.</p>
   <p>The Czechs and Slovaks of this country are going to support the President with their goods and with their lives.....</p>
