   <p>The Czech Sokol Community in America, with headquarters in Chicago, in a general assembly held here June 25th manifested its sentiment as follows: "From the moment when our beloved leader, Prof. Thomas G. Masaryk, raised the banner to take up the fight against Austria, and for Czechoslovak independence, we Czech Sokols of the United States of America have been faithfully standing at his side. We have given the movement our moral support, we have offered our sons for service and sacrifice on the battlefield; we have joined the great ranks with all that is within our power, we have joined in that organization which required so much exertion to build up--the Czech National Alliance--guided by the slogan of our own Tyrs, who, together with Fuegner, founded the Sokol gymnastic association: "Neither for profit, nor for glory! we have <pb facs="5418478_1_0775.jpg" n="2"/>been guarding the authority of this organization, that authority which was very difficult to establish; we have been loyally taking care of it so that this organization may stand before the whole world with a clear conscience, pure and mighty.</p>
   <p>Today, a man stabbed it in the back. One from whom we would have least expected such a deed--the Czech writer, Karel (Charles) Horky.</p>
   <p>At a time when all our Czech writers in the old homeland are jeopardizing their very existence to guard our nation against steps which would bring shame and humiliation for centuries upon it, there appears among us a Czech literatus to sling mud, and cast slurs upon the dear name of T. G. Masaryk, and also upon those who strive at his side and follow his leadership.</p>
   <p>We fully agree with the manifesto issued by Dr. Ludwig Fisher, chairman of the <pb facs="5418478_1_0776.jpg" n="3"/>Czech National Alliance, who condemned this blow in a manner befitting its merit. This blow is aimed against our entire movement and at that shield without a blemish which is carried by Masaryk, as well. Horky's attack is also a gross insult to the whole community of Czech Sokol organizations in the United States. The fight led by Maxaryk and the Czech National Alliance is also the fight of the Sokol organizations; the heritage of Tyrs cannot be consummated before it is climaxed by victory.</p>
   <p>We repudiate with profoundest indignation the unclean aggression against the economic angle of our movement. We fully trust in the examinations made by our honest men--esteemed by our people throughout the United States--such men as the Reverend Vanek, Mr. Klicka, the banker, and Mr. John A. Cervenka, clerk of the Probate Court of Cook County. We highly appreciate the pronunciamento issued in regard to this question by Dr. Fisher, and we are convinced that the attack is slander thrown into the face of the Czech element in the United States. These observations were made by us through the aid of Messrs. Vlk and <pb facs="5418478_1_0777.jpg" n="4"/>Simecek, whose names are above reproach. . . . .</p>
   <p>Our Czech nation is ashamed of her son who forgot himself so far that he would help drive his own people into destruction for the mere satisfaction of his selfishness.</p>
   <p>We proclaim most determinedly before the forum of Czech-America that the Czech National Alliance, the pride of our nation, must not be exposed to any attack from any side as long as it fulfills its duties with the same love with which it is regarded by the best people of Czech descent in America.</p>
   <p>The Czech Sokol Community of America is herewith giving expression of its full trust in the Czech National Alliance. For the Czech Sokol Community, Signed: Joseph Cermak, Chairman, Cyril Popelka, Secretary.</p>
