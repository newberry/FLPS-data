   <p>In the setting up of the Committee of Two Hundred Fifty, the Tenth Ward Organization was not consulted in the matter of representation. Congressman A. J. Sabath, himself, named the delegates without regard to what those who took part in the election of Mr. Harrison had to say about it. This action created much disturbance. At several meetings it was resolved that Mr. Sabath should not meddle in the affairs of the Tenth Ward. One of those who actively participated in the Harrison movement said: "When we were needed at the primaries and at election time, nothing was done without us. After the victory, however, the same old herding. Mr. Sabath names whom he wishes without consulting our organization even though he does not belong in the Tenth Ward. If he thinks that it is his business to decide and appoint whom he wants in his Congressional District, then we also know what we must do when he comes to the Tenth Ward as a candidate seeking Czech votes."</p>
   <p>Another of his former ardent supporters said: "Sabath committed a great <pb facs="5418478_1_1600.jpg" n="2"/>political error in the Tenth Ward. The Tenth Ward was ignored by the chairman and secretary, and thereby the entire Tenth Ward Organization was not informed concerning its representative of the Tenth Ward on the Progressive Democratic State Committee."</p>
