   <p>It has been heard from reliable sources that Mr. A. J. Cermak has other plans than to secure some important place in the committees of the City Council. He wants to resign from his position in the City Council because he has the best of prospects that Mr. Harrison will appoint him City Collector, which is decidedly more profitable and important office than that of Alderman.</p>
   <p>During the conferences of the non-partisan committee of the City Council, at Hot Springs, Ark., Mr. A. J. Cermak, alderman of the 12th Ward was the Democratic speaker, and the interests of the Republicans were looked after by Alderman Snow. Cermak is very capable of "roasting" the Republicans, when they fall back upon the agreement in regard to the non-partisan setup of the City Council's committees. He merely recalls for them, that in 1908-1909 such an agreement existed and in spite of this, <pb facs="5418478_1_1628.jpg" n="2"/>the Republicans filled all important places with their own people, because they had a majority in the City Council. Today, the Democrats have a majority such as neither party has had in a long time, that is, a full fourteen votes, and, therefore, they are entitled to all of the important posts. Democrats are just as capable of holding these jobs as are the Republicans and they want them. Cermak laid down the following rule, according to which the committees are to be set up: "We will first choose jobs for Democrats. Snow and his comrades can then fill those places which we leave for them.</p>
