   <p>For some time past there has been among several of the Bohemian Newspapers, including ours, some discussion about the possibility of having the Bohemian language taught in some of our public schools in districts inhabited mainly by Bohemians. We expressed ourselves as being of the opinion that informed Bohemians of Chicago would take notice of this important matter and take the necessary action for the accomplishment of this purpose. We believed that Chicago Bohemians would consider such a movement as being of the utmost importance to them personally and so far as their pocket-books were concerned. However after further thought and consideration of the matter, we are forced to admit that we were greatly mistaken. After the publication of this subject it was discussed here and there, one would say that it was impossible to accomplish this objective, another would say that he was satisfied to have his children learn English as the knowledge of Bohemian would in all likelihood be of no use to him in this land. If we asked some member of one of the National Societies what they thought of this matter and whether they would go on record for it, the answer invariably was that they would give it no consideration since they were a Benevolent Organization.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0346.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>That any one in the Reading Clubs has even mentioned this matter is doubtful. If the various Societies and Reading Clubs of the Bohemians disregard this important matter it can hardly be expected that the mass of citizehry as a whole will give it any thought.</p>
   <p>In Chicago we have some sixty national Bohemian Societies and Lodges, but in not one was there any mention made on this subject; it seems as though they were all afraid to even discuss it; much less to start a movement which if it was successful could only bring honor and recognition. We still believe that if some one of our organizations were to initiate the first steps toward the accomplishment of this matter, it would speedily receive the support of all the other organizations and of the entire Bohemian Citizehry. The German population has succeeded at the expense of the general public in having German taught in 16 schools, and there is no reason why we should not succeed in having Bohemian taught in five schools.</p>
   <p>All that is required is that we ardently and willingly work for it.</p>
