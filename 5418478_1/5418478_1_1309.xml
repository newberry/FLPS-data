   <p>All people who are acquainted with the present political situation predict a large registration of voters on October 7, 1922. These voters who realize the great importance of the forthcoming November election will not delay going to their precinct polling places to register and thus insure their right to vote. Of course, there will still be another registration day on October 17, 1922, but no one who is not compelled by circumstances to do so should miss going to his precinct polling place to register on October 7....</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak voters, without regard to their party affiliations, should fulfill their duty as citizens and register immediately, that is, on the day of the first registration--October 7. Not a single Czechoslovak vote can be wasted if those candidates for whom we care so much are to be elected. Among them, in the first place, is Anton J. Cermak, a candidate for the office of president of the Board of County Commissioners. Mr. Cermak is <pb facs="5418478_1_1310.jpg" n="2"/>not only a leader of the Democrats, but of all liberals in our county. Against him the "drys" and his political opponents wage a violent war. By registering their votes on the appointed day, the Czechoslovaks will be able to thwart the efforts of these opponents on election day. There are still others of our candidates in this political contest whose election will be assured if all of our countrymen will insure their right to vote. This may be done only by having their names registered, and when the day of election arrives, they will use their voting power as all Czechoslovaks should.</p>
   <p>Thus, for instance, in the Nineteenth Senatorial District, which includes the Thirty-fourth Ward, Cicero, Berwyn, and Riverside, Illinois, and the northern part of the Twelfth Ward, one of our countrymen, Mr. Albert B. Holecek is a candidate on the Republican ticket. His election is assured if all our countrymen living in that district, will register, and when election day comes, will cast their ballots as nationality conscious Czechs and Slovaks.....</p>
