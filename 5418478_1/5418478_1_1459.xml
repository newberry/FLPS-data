   <p>While Mayor Washburne was still a candidate and knew that for his election he had need of every vote whether it was Bohemian, German or Irish, he formally declared, that he would endeavor to give justice to every nationality, and that he would give its rightful representation in public bodies.</p>
   <p>How he kept this promise is proved by the fact that yesterday he named the members of the school board, and not a Bohemian is among them.</p>
   <p>By this action the question of the school board, so far as it concerns Bohemians, is closed.</p>
   <p>The mayor probably thinks that he will not again seek votes and that therefore he does not have to act like a clever politician. However, as a party member, he should have done so, in order not to scatter that last small group of Bohemian Republicans.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1460.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He was warned about that in time, but he did not care. It is only a confirmation of that which we expressed a short time ago, that the Republican party does not care about the Bohemian element, and anyone who forcibly intrudes upon it is crazy.</p>
