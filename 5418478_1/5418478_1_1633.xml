   <p>Bohemian Democrats of Cook County held their regular meeting yesterday evening in Pilsen Sokol hall, to elect officers. Cyril Fiala was elected chairman. E. Fort was elected secretary and A. J. Sabath was elected treasurer. Vice-chairman will be elected by the various ward clubs represented in the association. Many bitter complaints have been made that the democratic leaders, elected to office, pay very little attention to the Bohemians in spite of the fact that they with their enormous vote helped to elect these men County and City offices. Therefore there was appointed a committee of ten of our political leaders, who accompanied by the officers of the Bohemian Democracy of Cook County will visit Sheriff Barrett, Coroner to Traeger and Mayor Harrison to ask them, what kind of jobs they mean to give to the Czechs. The committee will submit a report at the next monthly meeting.</p>
