   <p>Our prohibitionists are having a difficult time securing a sufficient number of signatures for their petition to put the question of a dry Chicago on the small ballot. So far they have only a small fraction of the required number, and it is a big question whether some of those who have signed are not just having some fun at the prohibitionists' expense. At any rate, it would appear so, because among the signatures there are about a dozen Roosevelts, a multitude of Billy Sundays, several Carter H. Harrisons, Bryans, and Wilsons, and, no doubt, many dead people and many who will have to let a number of years elapse before they will be old enough to have a legal vote that will influence the future of Chicago as to its dryness or humidity.</p>
   <p>Once before the drys circulated such a petition. A careful scrutiny of it however, has shown that the majority of the signatures were "phony," and that many <pb facs="5418478_1_0595.jpg" n="2"/>people who had signed it wanted to have their little joke at the prohibitionists' expense. The same will, most likely, be the case with the present petition, and the prohibitionists had better secure at least twice as many signatures as they need to make sure there will be enough left after they are sifted.</p>
