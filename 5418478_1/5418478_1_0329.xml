   <p>We, as Bohemian citizens, would enter our protest against the unjust and partial action of the Board of Education on last Thursday night. We, up to that time, had thought that the members of the Board in all their doings acted in accordance with the principles of fairness and consistency. But we must acknowledge that last Thursday night's proceeding has greatly shaken our faith in them.</p>
   <p>It seems impossible that the members of the Board can afford to let such an action go on record before the searching criterion of public opinion. Can they allow their reputation for consistency to suffer in this way? A few years ago, at the merest suggestion of teaching German in the public schools, they at once admitted it. But now, when the precedent of teaching foreign languages in the public schools is established in a school where almost every pupil is Bohemian and the Bohemian taxpayers of the district are compelled to pay almost the entire assessment themselves, the unanimous petition of the whole district to teach Bohemian in that one school alone is disregarded and rejected. And on what grounds? Simply because one of our enlightened German members--who, by the way, knows as much about Bohemian as he does <pb facs="5418478_1_0330.jpg" n="2"/>about Choctaw--rises majestically in his place, and, after thundering forth denunciations against the language, says that Bohemian is not to be mentioned in the same breath with German."</p>
   <p>We wish to thank our German member for the high compliment that he has paid our language. In fact, a language like the Bohemian, which is superior to the ancient Greek in its variety of forms, declensions, inflections, list of patronymics, etc., cannot, by any sane man, be pulled down to the level of a language like the German. No, we thank our German member for not degrading our language in such a manner as to mention it in the same breath with German. Better had he ranked the ancient tongues equal with the grunts of the bushmen of Africa than lower the Bohemian down to the plane of the German.</p>
   <p>We do not approve of teaching any foreign language in the schools in America, but we, as citizens, claim equal rights with all classes of citizens. If the Germans have their mother tongue taught in the schools at public expense, we claim the same privilege. Surely we have the right to ask for our mother tongue in a district entirely Bohemian when the German language is taught in all of the schools of the city, even in those schools where the German scholars are in a decided minority. And it will be <pb facs="5418478_1_0331.jpg" n="3"/>comes a member of the Board to advocate the teaching of one foreign language and at the same time strenuously oppose the introduction of another. So the issue forces itself upon the gentlemen of the Board, and they as honest, candid men must meet it squarely; either admit Bohemian into the Throop School, or, on the principle of justice and consistency, abolish from the public schools all foreign languages.</p>
