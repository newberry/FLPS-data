   <p>The election of Samuel Gompers to the presidency of the American Federation of Labor was almost unanimous. This fact has a particular significance just now when our Germans, and their allies, the Irish, have been launching vicious attacks against Gompers for his disclosure of their underground machinations and plottings in local labor unions in an effort to prevent the manufacture of war materials for the Allies.</p>
   <p>The confidence shown in Mr. Gompers by the American Federation of Labor honors both him and it. It is a proof that the furious efforts of our Germans to use labor as a means of forcing the Government to discontinue the exportation of war material, none of which can reach Germany, and all of which therefore goes to Germany's enemies, is futile. Gompers is a good American, and a good enlightened man of labor. This he has proved by taking a stand against German <pb facs="5418478_1_0836.jpg" n="2"/>intrigues. His almost unanimous re-election to the presidency by the delegates to the convention of the American Federation of Labor shows that the American workingmen share his viewpoint. He should have a solid support in all his efforts.</p>
