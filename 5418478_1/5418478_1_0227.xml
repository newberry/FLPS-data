   <p>"To feed and clothe your children does not complete your obligations. There is one supreme duty which you must fulfill toward those of your own blood: to bring up your child to be a man in a moral sense--a man who loves not only his parents and companions, but also the nation in which his parents were born. For this reason it is necessary to inform your child about his nationality so that he will not ridicule or think lowly of the nation from which he is descended--or disavow the merits of our great men of art and science....."</p>
   <p>Our children must become acquainted with the nation and the language of their forebears. This can be done by the Czech school.</p>
   <p>We constantly hear about Americanization and assimilation with the great American people. Yes, we want to become good Americans; we want to show our <pb facs="5418478_1_0228.jpg" n="2"/>gratitude for the kind reception accorded to us; we want to show our appreciation by offering the best within the abilities of our people.... The Czech school is the link between us and this country.</p>
   <p>"Although we Czechs are a small nation we are more mature than others that are larger than we. Our glorious nation need not let other nations occupy the foreground. We were the first to fight for the liberty of body and mind, and only few nations can be compared with our glorious history....."</p>
   <p>The Association for the Maintenance of Czech Schools is opening classes in Chicago public schools, similar to those conducted in the private schools sponsored by the Chicago Czech people. The schools are [free-religious free thought, nonsectarian.]</p>
   <p>Classes were opened in the following public schools: Cooper, Corkery, Bryant, Farragut, Fulton, Gary, Hammond, Healy, Jungman, Komenský, and Sawyer.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0229.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"In the old homeland we fought for every Czech child so that he should not be lost to the nation. What good would liberty do us if we could not bequeath it to our children? How could we answer before the world the neglect of our national duty to our children?</p>
   <p>The Czech child belongs to the Czech school."</p>
