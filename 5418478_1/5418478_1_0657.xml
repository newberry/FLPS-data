   <p>The decision of Mayor Thompson requiring the closing of cafes on Sundays is to be deeply regretted and condemned. It is not only a slap in the face of all liberal-minded Chicago citizens, imparted in order to satisfy a handful of blue-Sunday pietists and prohibitionists, but it is also a decision which will do a great deal of harm to the City and its population in the economic respect.</p>
   <p>Nobody was forcing Mayor Thompson to issue the ordinance prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages on Sundays. Even our blue-Sunday pietists would have been satisfied by having the question of the Sabbatical law voted upon at the coming spring election. But it seems that our Mayor, ever since good fortune has been the lot of his political plans, has become cocky and has arrived at the conclusion that he can afford to do whatever he pleases. If that is the case, we believe that he is facing an ugly disappointment.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0658.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Merriam is one of those reformers whom we have learned to look upon with a great deal of suspicion. But it must be admitted that he believes himself to be waging a good fight, that he fights in the open, tells everybody frankly what he thinks of him, what he wants, and why he wants it. Such men as he are infinitely better, more honest, and more valuable than men who have secured the confidence of the liberal-minded public by false pretenses and promises, who have had that public put them into high offices, and then have revealed themselves as enemies of all that which the liberal-minded public favors.</p>
   <p>Carter H. Harrison was mayor of Chicago for five terms and always very definitely refused to yield to the desire of fanatics for the observance of Sunday by having saloons closed on that day. Thompson has been Mayor just a little over five months and has completely yielded to Sabbath fanatics. No doubt many people now will say, "Too bad we did not keep Harrison". But there is no use crying over spilt milk. The only thing to do is for our public to learn the lesson and next time refuse to give its confidence to an unknown man and take <pb facs="5418478_1_0659.jpg" n="3"/>it away from somebody who has always said openly what was and what was not his opinion and personal conviction.</p>
