   <p>At the instigation of several Bohemian societies, a Czechoslovak Democratic committee was organized last Monday evening. Its aim shall be the development of systematic and intensive propaganda for the securing and election of Czechoslovak candidates on the regular Democratic ticket, or the.... support of the whole ticket. The meeting was opened by Mr. Josef Placek in the presence of the members of the Cesko-Slovenska Obchodni Komora (Czechoslovak Chamber of Commerce), the Beseda Ceskych Odd Fellows (Bohemian Odd Fellows), the Lawndale Automobile Klub (Lawndale Automobile Club), Zabavni Klub Zobak (Social and Benevolent Club Zobak), the Sokol Chicago, and many others.</p>
   <p>For the office of president of this pre-election organization (which, with the goodwill of the voters, might become an important permanent body), Mr. Josef Mikolas was chosen; Mr. Vaclav Hnatek was elected to the office of secretary.</p>
   <p>It was pointed out that the forthcoming elections, especially those of county commissioners, are more important to Czechoslovak voters than any previous <pb facs="5418478_1_1520.jpg" n="2"/>elections. Mr. Anton J. Cermak especially called attention to the significant office of the president of County Commissioners, for which he is a candidate. The president of the Board of County Commissioners has the privilege of appointing men to many offices in the county; his influence is also felt when it comes to the question of receiving individuals in county institutions. The office to which Mr. Cermak aspires carries with it many other rights and privileges, and it would be a great honor for us--the Bohemian-Americans--if he were elected, for Mr. Cermak, because of his meritorious activities, is one of the most popular personalities of Chicago.</p>
   <p>After a lengthy debate in which all of the attending members (about thirty) took part, it was decided to present a resolution which would recommend the Democratic ticket to the Czechoslovak voters. The following men were elected to write such a resolution: Messrs. Josef Stastny, Felix Janovsky, and Otto Fuerst. A propaganda committee, consisting of seven members, was also elected. They are: Messrs. Stastny, Macek, Solar, Sus, and Fiser. [Translator's note: As is evident, only five names are given by the Denni Hlasatel.]</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1521.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The duty of the propaganda committee will be to devise ways and means for the establishment of a solid organization of Czechoslovak voters in the entire county, to aid Czechoslovak candidates, to urge voters to register and to vote, to keep up and to increase the membership in the organization even after the elections.</p>
   <p>The permanent office of the Cesko-Slovensky Demokraticky Yybor (Czechoslovak Democratic committee) will be located in the offices of the Czechoslovak Commercial and Realty Corporation in the Sokol Chicago building. A public meeting of voters will be called in a few days.</p>
