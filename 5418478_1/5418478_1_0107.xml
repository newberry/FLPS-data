   <p>The Senate committee which has been looking into the affairs of the Chicago Board of Education in recent weeks has made a number of exposures which will hardly please Chicago taxpayers. All the men who have been called by that committee agree that the business of the Board is not conducted in a manner suitable for such a large and important public institution. The committee does not care to find out what Chicago youth is receiving in return for the millions of dollars spent yearly on the school system; but it is concerned with the manner in which that money is spent, and in the way in which the business of the School Board is conducted. Facts so far disclosed are not very gratifying. No instances of corruption have been proved so far, and nobody has been accused of dishonesty, but all the witnesses who have testified up to the present time agree that the City schools are so poorly managed that no private enterprise could continue to exist under <pb facs="5418478_1_0108.jpg" n="2"/>similar management. The first rule of any business enterprise, that is, that expenditures should be limited by, and must be in proposition to, income, is absolutely unknown on the School Board. Nobody is concerned with the future income; the only question is how large should be the expenditure. The yearly budget is always made on that principle with the result that expenses exceed income by hundreds of thousands of dollars every year, and thus the Board pays one year's debt with the following year's income and runs into new, larger debts in its new budget. To keep within the income appears to be absolutely out of the question; it even seems that the majority of the Board do not so much as try to manage its financial affairs in that sensible way. Well, it is not the only body that acts that way. The Municipal Council and the County Board are doing exactly the same thing and with very similar results. Economy and carefulness in expending money do not prevail in either of these bodies; and if there are attempts to introduce them, it is mostly in matters where such measures are the least necessary or the most undesirable.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0109.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The mismanagement has put the School Board into a desperate situation, so that it was finally obliged to ask the State Assembly to raise taxes and thus provide for it a greater source of revenue. There never has been a question of cutting down expenses, but always a question of how to procure more money. There is hardly ever a thought of cutting expenditures in our public bodies, for the simple reason that an obliging legislature can always be found which sees to it that, by the raising of taxes, wastefulness may continue its rule. This, however, is not the only thing of which the Board, by the evidence disclosed even by its own members, is being accused. For instance, the Board seems to pay much more for the real estate it buys for its schools than any private citizen pays; and evidence of many other irregularities and of shameful mismanagement have been presented. The School Board is so full of intrigues, political graft, criminal schemes, that every taxpayer must be amazed by the conditions prevailing in a body that should be in the first place among those which are absolutely free from political and other influences because it is charged with the education of our future citizens. The membership of the Board is usually selected from among people of some prominence <pb facs="5418478_1_0110.jpg" n="4"/>in business and public life, and such people would naturally be expected to perform their duties honestly. But the investigation seems to prove that just the opposite is the case. The taxpayers, while continually complaining about high taxes, are reluctant to protest where public schools are concerned. They do not kick against spending eighteen million dollars a year for schools, and they would not mind spending even more, if it were really necessary for the proper education of Chicago youth. But their patience will soon be exhausted if the senseless management which had prevailed in school affairs for so many years should continue.</p>
   <p>The Senate committee is looking for the reasons for these sad conditions, and it is to be confidently expected that proposals for a complete reorganization of the Chicago Board of Education will be made in the coming session of the State Legislature. It is generally believed that the Board is too large a body to make efficient work possible. It consists of twenty-one members. Other American cities have their own boards of education, but the <pb facs="5418478_1_0111.jpg" n="5"/>common tendency is to keep the boards as small as possible. In Boston they used to have a board consisting of 116 members. This was later reduced to twenty-four, and now they find five members enough to take care of all Boston school affairs. Baltimore has reduced the number of her school board from twenty-nine to nine, St. Louis from twenty-one to twelve, Indianapolis from eleven to five, Milwaukee from thirty-six to fifteen, New Orleans from twenty to five, and other cities have small boards because it has been found that too large bodies are disadvantageous. Only three or four large cities have boards larger than Chicago. New York is in the first place in this respect; its board has forty-six members. Providence, Rhode Island, has a board of thirty-three members; Worcester Massachusetts, one of thirty; and Cincinnati, Ohio, one of twenty-seven members.</p>
   <p>The question is what would be the right size for Chicago. Most people agree that the Board should be smaller than it is now, and one of its members maintained, during his testimony before the committee, that eleven members would be all that are needed. He also maintained that they should be elected <pb facs="5418478_1_0112.jpg" n="6"/>directly by the people and should be paid a regular salary. At present, the members of the board are appointed by the mayor, and work free of charge. Most of them have comparatively little free time to give to the affairs of the Board. Paid officers would have to devote all their duties and it should therefore be expected that this arrangements would raise the level of the Chicago schools, at least in an economic sense, much higher than it is now. That particular member has said that this system would save for the School Board ten times the amount of money that would be the aggregate of the salaries of the eleven men. They would save money when real estate is being bought, and they would prevent the overcrowding of some schools while there is unnecessary space in others. By a proper redistricting so much space would be gained that much less frequent building of new schools would be required.</p>
   <p>To sum up, it is certain that the management of Chicago schools is in bad need of reform, and if such reform is not forthcoming after the present investigation, it should be expected that definite steps toward it will be made in the coming session of the legislature.</p>
