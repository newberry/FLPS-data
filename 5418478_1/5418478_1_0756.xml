   <p>Although we have started our organization work only one month ago, we have taken steps of importance in the patriotic endeavor of our fellow-countrymen. . . . .</p>
   <p>As soon as we learned about the McCormick bill which demands that the liberation of the Irish and Polish people be considered in the peace negotiations, we sent a letter to our Congressman Adolph Sabath, urging him to see to the inclusion of Czech liberty into the proposal. The Congressman replied that he <pb facs="5418478_1_0757.jpg" n="2"/>has not up to this day presented a bill about Czech liberty. "No such bill as that contemplated by Congressman McCormick shall, however, be recommended by the respective committee, unless it also contains the clause concerning Czech liberty. Of this you may rest assured. I deem the issue is of vital interest to me. I shall present the amendment when the time is more propitious for action." The letter was dated April 19, 1917.</p>
   <p>Conditions have changed since, and our Congressman presented the bill on May 3. It is before the committee now as is the McCormick bill.....</p>
   <p>We are rapidly being organized.... We have sent Mr. John Straka to Nebraska, a state with a large Czech population.... he founded branches of our Alliance there.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0758.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We are creating branches in every Czech part of Chicago, and we hope they all will strive to emulate the achievements of the Bl. Anezka Ceska (The Blessed Czech Agnes) settlement. We are now busy with preparations for a large gathering in Chicago of all Catholics. The pursuit of our national aims will be the key note. Prominent men have promised to deliver addresses.</p>
