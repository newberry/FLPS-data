<title level="a">THE SPEAKER OF - SVOBODNE OBCE - (INDEPENDENT SOCIETY) IS AUTHORIZED TO PERFORM THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY.</title></bibl>

   <p>The county circuit clerk in Chicago, Mr. Ryan, was persuaded by somebody that it would not be conforming with the law, if the speaker of "Svobodne Obce" a Bohemian independent society, incorporated as "Congregation of Bohemian Free-thinkers" can possess the right to perform the marriage ceremony like other ministers of the Gospel, who have the right to do it according to state laws.</p>
   <p>Mr. Ryan invited the speaker, Mr. Frank B. Zdrubek, last Saturday and expressed to him his doubts, requesting him at the same time, to visit the district attorney, Mr. Blisse and find out from him what the law says about it, to be sure of the legality of the situation.</p>
   <p>Conforming with Mr. Ryan's request, the speaker Mr. Zdrubka, explained the whole matter to the district attorney, who found the proper law and the decisions of the supreme court in similar questions, and sent his opinion in writing to the circuit clerk.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0706.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It stated that as long as the speaker of the "Svobodne Obce" acts lawfully, he is considered by the law as a "minister" like every preacher, Jewish, Mormon or Christian, and has the legal right to perform this ceremony. The speaker of the "Svobodne Obce" started to perform the marriage ceremonies in April, 1878, after consulting a prominent lawyer, Mr. H. Rubens, and the district attorney praised Mr. Rubens, stating that he was right in reference to this question and his advice was legal.</p>
