   <p>In the hall on the corner of 20th and Brown, there was held a regular meeting of all Bohemian Democrats for the purpose of finding a way to avoid the threatened split of the Bohemian vote in the 8th ward where there are two Bohemian candidates for one office.</p>
   <p>Citizen Matejka, who opened the meeting, expressed his opinion, he being for neither of the candidates, that the Bohemians should select a third candidate to replace the two already in the field. Some of those present, however, would not sanction such a move as they were positively for Mr. Dvorak as candidate. The delegates from the Irish Club from the other end of the ward, where Mr. Panoch was nominated, waid that they would never support Mr. Dvorak as candidate, but no matter who is selected by the Bohemians as candidate, with the exception of Dvorak, they would support.</p>
   <p>Toward the close, Mr. Panoch addressed the meeting and although he expressed himself as being indifferent about the candidacy, he still insisted that he would have the support of the voters from across the tracks (the Irish) where <pb facs="5418478_1_1650.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. Dvorak would get none.</p>
   <p>The gathering later dispersed without arriving at any definite understanding.</p>
