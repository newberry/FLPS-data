<title level="a">ABOUT THE TAILORING STRIKE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Bohemian tailors will exert every effort to bring the present struggle to an early victory. The tailors from large shops downtown, as well as the strikers from the Northwest Side of the city, point continually to the fact that Bohemian tailors in contractors' shops, particularly in Bohemian California, are still working and thereby prolonging the fight of the tailoring men for a better existence. Deputations from various parts of the city are arriving at the headquarters on 22nd and Troy Streets daily, and requesting that the work in contractors' shops be discontinued. The strikers are determined to do all that is in their power to stop work in contractors' shops working for large firms whose men are on strike.</p>
   <p>Organizer Silverman of New York has arrived in Chicago and has been detailed to help Organizer Skala in directing the strike in Bohemian Pilsen and California. Polish and Italian strikers have offered to picket the shops in these two districts. Briefly, the strikers will do all they can to <pb facs="5418478_1_1114.jpg" n="2"/>bring about an early victory. This morning, at 9:30 A.M., a meeting of the tailoring workingmen will be held in Mr. Cernoch's Hall on 22nd and Troy Streets. Organizer Silverman and others will speak at this meeting.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian members of the old union (United Garment Workers of America) do not share Lawyer John J. Sonsteby's opinion, and will, under no circumstances, harm the present strike, which is directed by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. News has reached a shop where members of the old union are employed that their shop had accepted work for a firm whose employees are on strike. The members of the old union stopped working immediately, came to the meeting, and declared that under no circumstances will they do scab work. Many of them had taken part in the 1910 strike and know how it would feel if somebody should break the strike and counteract the efforts of the strikers.</p>
   <p>"As soon as you learn that our shop has accepted scab work, let us know, and we shall stop work immediately and join you," they said.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1115.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The large shops are still idle and strikers consider the situation very favorable, on the whole. Also the cutters have struck in many firms, and it is expected that the tailors will be joined by the cutters in the rest of them. The fact that the cutters go with the striking tailors proves that they have confidence in the victory of this just fight.</p>
   <p>Elaborate preparations are being made for a huge parade to be held next Tuesday. At first it was planned for Monday, but it was impossible to receive a permit for that day. The strikers expect to manifest their power by that parade. It is expected that it will be joined by twelve thousand marchers.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that preparations will be in progress for the parade, no meeting will be held in Pilsen today. Announcements concerning future meetings will be found in the newspapers.</p>
