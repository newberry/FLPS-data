<title level="a">SCHOOL BOARD FILES BOHEMIAN RESOLUTION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Yesterday we told our readers that Mayor Thompson had complied with the request of the Bohemian committee which asked him to intervene in the matter of the resolution of the Straz Osvojenych (Guard of the Liberated) against the "Kaiser" article in our textbooks, and that he has given the committee a letter to the president of the School Board with the request that the representatives of the Straz Osvojenych be given the proper hearing.</p>
   <p>The letter was delivered to the president of the School Board by the representatives of the Straz Osvojenych, Dr. F. Iska, in a plenary meeting of the Board yesterday afternoon.</p>
   <p>The president voiced objection to the Mayor's recommendation that the hearing of the resolution be by the committee on school management, not the Board itself.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0124.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But upon being informed that the purpose of the committee's call on the Mayor was to cause the resolution to be read without delay in today's meeting of the whole Board, and after an energetic intercession by the Bohemian member of the School Board Mr. A. Holpuch, the president promised that it would be done.</p>
   <p>At four o'clock in the afternoon, when the meeting of the Board was opened, the hall was filled to overflowing by teachers and ladies who had come to learn the outcome of the objections filed against the installation of the assistant to School Superintendent, Ella Flagg Young. But before this matter was taken up, the president handed the Mayor's letter concerning the request of the Straz Osvojenych to the secretary. After the secretary had read the letter, the president ordered the reading of the resolution demanding the removal of the "Kaiser" article from the textbooks and the definite and permanent exclusion of articles dealing with the private life of members of any ruling dynasty or of people known to be seeking special advantages because of their claim of higher birth or riches.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0125.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The full text of the resolution has been already published, and those who have read it can easily imagine the gravelike silence prevailing in the room when the irrefutable and pertinent reasons were being read proving that the article is definitely unsuitable and unprofitable for American youth, and quite unfit from the general pedagogic point of view. Superintendent Ella Flagg-Young was present, the lady who in the previous meeting admitted the authorship of the article and designated it as the acme of all pedagogic perfection, and now, in the presence of a large number of teachers, statements proving just the opposite were read with full emphasis.</p>
   <p>Quite a peculiar impression was noticeable when the following part of the resolution was read: "This age does not need any creed based on deceit or delusion, but does need an ideal creed of Truth and Benevolence which would not divide the people into rulers by the grace of God and subjects destined to submit patiently to the rulers' domination, exploitation, and enslavement."</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0126.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We are sure that such a radical word as "irreverent," used to describe the classes and bodies who do or try to lord it over others, has never before been uttered in a session in the opportunistic [sic] School Board of our city, and that among the teachers and ladies there were many who heard such daring language for the first time in their lives. We do not blame, a bit, the president and speaker of the Straz Osvojenych, Dr. Frantisek Iska, for being elated over the unexpectedly successful result of the action of the Straz Osvojenych.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the resolution, School Board member, Holpuch, made a motion that the resolution be received and filed for use at the first opportunity. The motion was supported and the president announced shortly that there were no objections and the motion was passed.</p>
   <p>The success of the protest is complete, and all those who feel that an article eulogizing the German Kaiser does not belong in American textbooks may be <pb facs="5418478_1_0127.jpg" n="5"/>fully satisfied. The article will certainly be thrown out, and the "when" of it is just a question of time. A proposal to revise the textbook may now be made in any meeting, and the resolution of the Straz Osvojenych serve to have the flattering article about the Kaiser eliminated.</p>
