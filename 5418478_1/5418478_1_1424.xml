   <p>p. 1.. Wm. J. Moxley, regular Republican candidate for the nomination in the 34th Ward, won the primary with a total of 14,594 votes. The primary has attracted attention all over the country, as Moxley has been antagonized by the English-printed Republican press by pictures and all sorts of ridicule. It was the Czech vote that decided the issue.</p>
   <p>The voters had not intended to demonstrate their accord with Moxley's political convictions, but rather aimed at giving the Democratic machine an unmistakable hint that the time has arrived to expel from the organization the undesirable elements that are attempting to control it, who work only for their personal interests, and who brush everybody aside that becomes uncomfortable to them; the election was a proper answer to the treatment the deceased Alderman Kohout had received by them.</p>
