   <p>An interesting story from the life of Czech workingmen of Chicago from 1870 to 1880 is related in the German workingman's paper, Fackel, where Jacob Winnen reviews the "history of the labor movement" in Chicago. The ex-soldiers' and veterans' clubs among workingmen were not uncommon, and in connection with this, the story runs:</p>
   <p>The Czech Socialists had a picnic in the Silver Leaf Grove, Western and Ogden Avenues. A gang of rowdies invaded the premises, and commenced to annoy the female participants. When their behavior exceeded all limits, a company of Czech sharpshooters gathered and with fixed bayonets, drove them from the garden. Several disturbers were wounded.</p>
   <p>Shortly after, a squad of policemen arrived. Prokop Hudek, the commander, and the entire company of sharpshooters were arrested and taken to the police station on Madison Street, where they were exonerated by the court the following day.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0820.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We are glad to read of the incident mentioned, even though we are at a loss to connect it with "the labor movement in Chicago". It evokes, however, bitter recollections of the abuses immigrants had to endure in our city in those more remote times, when they were frequently stopped and rudely attacked by packs of boisterous blades, who took offense at their not speaking English. Not more than two decades ago, it was no rare occurrence that Czechs riding a street car, speaking their maternal language, were gruffly interrupted and bidden to "talk English".</p>
   <p>Conditions have since changed considerably in Chicago. The corner of Ogden and Western Avenues has long been given up as a picnic ground. Our city has spread in every direction, and gained a superb aspect. The activities of rowdies in the streets are on the decrease. The younger generation should think of the pioneers with respect for they have done much for the amelioration of the social conditions of our city.</p>
