  <body>
   <p>The Ceskoslovensky Poplatnicky Spolek v Cicero (Czechoslovak Taxpayers' Association of Cicero) held its regular meeting on March 6 with a large attendance. In this meeting, six new members were initiated and the names of seven others were presented for membership. All those who were present, including the representatives of the taxpayers' associations of Glyde and Warren Park, followed the proceedings of the meeting with interest. The past primaries and the political activity of municipal employees were discussed. Further, attention was called to the high cost of street paving and it was recommended to award these jobs to smaller contractors. A proper committee was appointed to consult with such property owners whose streets are to be paved, in order to obtain more suitable terms.</p>
   <p>In regard to the next elections, citizens were told to register on Tuesday, March 15, so they may vote for town and school officers next April. The <pb facs="5418478_1_1542.jpg" n="2"/>next meeting of the Association will be held Sunday, April 3, at two o'clock in the afternoon. Because the next meeting will be a very important one, citizens are asked to attend in great numbers.</p>
   <p>Vaclav Rous, secretary.</p>
