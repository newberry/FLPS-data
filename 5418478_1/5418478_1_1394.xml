   <p>Notwithstanding the fact that the Democratic organization in the Tenth Ward exerted all the power and energy it possessed to elect the regular Democratic organization nominee, James McNichols, nevertheless in the south end where the Bohemians and Slavs live, the Independent party candidate, Mr. Josef W. Cermak, won in almost all the precincts. In the north end of the ward where the Jews and the Irish reside, however, the voters showed their hostility toward our Bohemian candidate and defeated him.</p>
   <p>How our countrymen in the Tenth Ward voted is shown by the votes cast in two of our most representative precincts, the twelfth and fourteenth. In the twelfth precinct Mr. Cermak received 180 votes from men and 129 votes from women, making a total of 309; for Mr. McNichols, 98 men's votes were cast and 55 women's votes which totaled 153. In the fourteenth precinct the votes cast for Mr. Cermak were 171 from the men and 129 from the women, a total of 300 <pb facs="5418478_1_1395.jpg" n="2"/>votes; and for Mr. McNichols, 75 men and 34 women voted, which totals 109. In the case of all the remaining candidates in the twelfth precinct, the ballots of men and women voters were distributed as follows: Mr. Kabat, Republican, 9 men and 6 women; Mr. Bilek, Independent, 14 men and 8 women; Mr. Vodak, Socialist, 26 men and 14 women. In the fourteenth precinct Mr. Kabat received votes from 2 men and 1 women; Mr. Bilek, the votes of 10 men and 3 women; Mr. Vodak, 21 men and 9 women. As is evident, the splitting of Bohemian votes did not amount to a great deal, but nevertheless the interests of the only Bohemian candidate who had a chance to be elected were hurt considerably by this split.</p>
   <p>The stand taken by the Bohemian Catholic daily, Narod (Nation), in this campaign, is one of the causes which brought about the defeat of Mr. Cermak. Although Mr. Cermak is the manager of a building where Catholic societies meet, the popular Cesko-Slovanska Katholicka Sin, (Bohemian Slavonic Catholic Hall), and he himself is a Catholic and a member of Catholic societies, <pb facs="5418478_1_1396.jpg" n="3"/>nevertheless the daily Narod proclaimed at every opportunity that the motto of the Bohemian Catholics should always be "Svujk Svemu" (Ours to Ourselves), and they did not show the slightest consideration for a Bohemian Catholic. To be sure the manager of Narod is a German, Father Kohlbeck, and therefore it is not surprising that that newspaper took the stand that it did; that it opposed a Bohemian Catholic and helped to defeat him.</p>
   <p>The Twelfth Ward will be represented by Mr. Rudolf Mulac, who sought the election in the Republican ranks. For his election he is indebted principally to the women, although the men also let it be known that he is popular among them.</p>
   <p>We, as a Democratic newspaper, stood faithfully by Mr. Novak, but did not allow a single attack upon the good name of Mr. Mulac to appear in our <pb facs="5418478_1_1397.jpg" n="4"/>columns for we know he has a clean slate.</p>
   <p>In the future the Twelfth Ward will be represented by two Bohemians, who, we are sure, will work with all their might and to the best of their ability for the ward's advancement.</p>
   <p>In the Twentieth Ward there was as lively a campaign as that ward has ever experienced, and if the present reports are correct, our countryman, Alderman Hugo L. Pitte, has been re-elected on the Independent Democratic ticket.</p>
   <p>Alderman John Toman was re-elected, although Mr. Bert Smith showed extraordinary strength. The result of this election is positive proof that Mr. Toman must pay more attention to the south end of the ward, which is the most Bohemian and most Democratic, and upon which he may lean only after he becomes convinced that he is as interested in the south end of the ward as he <pb facs="5418478_1_1398.jpg" n="5"/>is in the north, where non-Bohemians and non-Democrats are heavily represented.</p>
