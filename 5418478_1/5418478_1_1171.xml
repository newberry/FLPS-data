   <p>P. 4 -- The misery caused by the tailors' strike is tremendous, and thousands of Bohemian families are affected by it. Every compatriot of ours who can possibly do so should contribute to the benefit fund. Moreover, those who were not enthusiastically in favor of the strike should be just as generous as those who approved of it unconditionally and still continue to do so. The fact is that thousands of our countrymen of all ages and of both sexes are in distress and they should receive prompt and adequate relief. We firmly believe that they will receive it.</p>
   <p>Bohemian tailors have always contributed willingly and generously to all appeals which have been made among us, whether they were for benevolent or national purposes. Now, however, they are in need themselves. They are in the midst of a battle for the improvement of their working and living conditions; and if they succeed in winning the fight, they will repay the public for anything that it does to aid them in these hard times. Whatever our public does for our striking tailors will bring it rich returns, and will have done itself a good turn by contributing.</p>
