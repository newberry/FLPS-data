<title level="a">UNEMPLOYMENT CONFERENCE</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A conference called by the President for the purpose of finding the causes of unemployment and a means to combat it, has been sitting in Washington now for three weeks. It has a number of subcommittees, and their reports, recommendations, and proposals are not exactly encouraging to the belief that the committee will find a way in which the United States can make a quick and safe return to prosperity.</p>
   <p>The way in which many of the men sitting in that conference are looking upon unemployment may be seen from the report of the subcommittee on factory work which has recently been published. It shows that this subcommittee proposes to "cure" unemployment by three principal "remedies": Lowering of wages, lowering of freight rates, and Government subsidies to railway companies. Those who have recommended these remedies have clearly demonstrated that they are absolutely lacking in understanding of the causes of unemployment, and that they are looking on everything <pb facs="5418478_1_1197.jpg" n="2"/>from the standpoint of employers, capitalists.</p>
   <p>Unemployment in itself is a condition which shows that there is something wrong in the social machinery, that something is amiss in that machinery and must be remedied if the machinery is to resume its normal work. President Harding declared in the speech by which he opened the conference and in which he outlined the principal issues which the conference will discuss, that there is nothing fundamentally wrong in the United States, either in industrial or in political respects, and therefore a way should be found by which the return to normal conditions could be made. But it is immediately apparent that neither labor--either organized or unorganized--nor capital, no matter in which manner represented on the conference, is in a position to recommend something which they are sure would work. If any way could be found, if the problem were so easy to solve, something would have been done a long time ago, and it would be unnecessary to try to look for a remedy in an elaborate conference. Capital is idle and labor unemployed because production has been lowered and this--because there is <pb facs="5418478_1_1198.jpg" n="3"/>no market.</p>
   <p>The thing to do then, is to find a market for goods before expecting any improvement in business activity. It is necessary to increase the purchasing power of the farmer and the workingman at home, and to find new markets overseas. The unemployment in the United States has been caused partly by the drop in the prices of farm products so that the farmers have had to discontinue the buying of machinery, furniture, clothes, and other commodities, as well as household goods, limiting themselves to the barest necessities; and partly by the drop of foreign currencies as against the dollar so that foreign countries are unable to buy our manufactured and other goods. These are the two principal causes of unemployment, and these must be removed if an improvement is to take place.</p>
   <p>If the capitalists lower the wages they pay to the workingman, they only aggravate the situation because they still further impair the purchasing power of labor. It is certain that many younger people, particularly <pb facs="5418478_1_1199.jpg" n="4"/>veterans, do not work because they are being offered wages which are not sufficiently high to permit them to properly support those who depend on them. Generally speaking, the American workingman is not so down and out that he is obliged to agree to any wage and working conditions offered to him. Almost every one of them has some savings, permitting him to wait for better offers. In addition to this, the average American worker, whether he be employed in cotton mills or in a shoe factory, as miner or steel-mill man, is a master of his trade and knows how to defend himself and family against abuse and injustice. It may be true --as President Harding stated--that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with this country, but it is certainly true that there is something wrong with our economic conditions.</p>
   <p>It is certainly wrong when a workingman is required to live below his accustomed standard.</p>
   <p>America has always been proud of the fact that her workingmen live better <pb facs="5418478_1_1200.jpg" n="5"/>and have better homes than their comrades in other countries, and that, indeed, is a great achievement. Now, all of a sudden, they are to be deprived of their accomplishments, of what they are accustomed to, of what they are entitled to. If there is to be an improvement, if conditions are to be remedied, it must never be done at the price of workingman's sacrifice of living like a human being. It would be a terrible price and never could compensate for what it cost.</p>
   <p>Nobody can say that the American workingman is profiteering, that he asks more for his work that he deserves. His principal objective is decent living for himself and family and the accumulation of small savings which he can fall back upon in case of sickness or unemployment, since his government, unlike that of almost all European countries, makes no provision for him in such emergencies. If the Washington conference will do as much for him as is done in European countries, he will be fully satisfied. That means, he will agree to work for lower wages provided there will be lower living expenses, rent, light, heating, foodstuffs, clothes, etc., will <pb facs="5418478_1_1201.jpg" n="6"/>be cheaper, and he and his family will be able to live like human beings and put something aside for a rainy day. True enough, prices have gone down during the past year, but in no proportion whatever to the drop in wages proposed by the employers.</p>
   <p>American workingmen are also apprehensive because they suspect that many employers will want to use the present industrial idleness and unemployment for a weakening, or destroying, if possible of labor organization.</p>
   <p>If there is to be a substantial and permanent betterment of conditions, everything that serves to create social unrest must be removed. The employers, therefore, are on the wrong road if they expect labor to pay for the remedies they suggest.</p>
