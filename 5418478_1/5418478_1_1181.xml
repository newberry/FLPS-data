   <p>Bohemian Workers in protest against "Pinkertons' Bohemian Workers Educational Club" called a mass meeting yesterday afternoon, in "National Hall", for the purpose of protesting the use of "Pinkerton Murderers" against the workingman of Homestead, Pa., and at the same time to offer their warmest sympathies for the locked out steel mill workers of Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>Is it justice, when a capitalist is allowed to defend his supposed interests with the aid of a gun, while a worker is denied the right to even raise his voice in protest, lest he be labeled an anarchist, or villain, of the biggest sort? Is that any kind of freedom, when every rich cut-throat can have us shot whenever he takes a notion to do so?</p>
   <p>Resolved, that we Bohemian Workingmen gathered here in National Hall in Chicago, protest in the name of all Bohemian Workers of Chicago against the legality of the hiring of murderers by the capitalist, for use against their workingmen, whenever they see fit. Further, we protest <pb facs="5418478_1_1182.jpg" n="2"/>against the support of the capitalist by the Government of Pennsylvania. The laboring men there are being oppressed and driven to deeds of desperation in order that the workers may be accused of all unrest. Finally, it is resolved to express our full sympathy with the strikers, and to encourage further opposition against the superior force of capitalist, who are making every effort to destroy all trade unions and to secure the ruling power.</p>
   <p>We condemn all such forms of procedure, and call on all organized labor in America to raise its voice in behalf of the oppressed workers of Homestead, Pa.</p>
   <p>This resolution was unanimously adopted and the meeting was then adjourned.</p>
