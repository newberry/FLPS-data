   <p>A great multitude of citizens and enthusiastic Democrats who believe that the Democratic party is the most sincere in its relations with the American people and at the same time the most favorable to the Bohemians, gathered last night in Pilsen Sokol hall on Ashland Avenue. Speakers, both Bohemian and American, addressed the gathering. Mayor Harrison, in his speech, talked on national questions, criticizing President Roosevelt's action against the trusts. Harrison declared that there are seven hundred trusts in the United States, of which only one was publicly prosecuted. Surely, the promises of the President and other leaders of the Republican party that they would see to it that the trusts would cease fattening off the American people were not satisfactorily carried out. The Mayor charged that the Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Labor, Cortelyou, made use of his office in order to compel large corporations to contribute gigantic sums to the Republican campaign fund. He also criticized the government's Philippine politics. The <pb facs="5418478_1_1442.jpg" n="2"/>Philippine Islands will bring us nothing except to force us to maintain a large standing army, which will take our young men and sap their vital powers. Then, when they become invalids because of the unhealthy climate of the islands, they will be returned to their parents and their native land. The rest of the speakers ardently requested the Bohemian Democrats to stand firmly by the party which has always not only favored the Bohemians but also recognized them. This year they include two Bohemians in the slate. Mr. Charles J. Vopicka is running for Congress, and Mr. Adolph J. Sabath for the office of Recorder. Both are capable, respected by everyone, and will surely be elected if Bohemians will do their duty.</p>
