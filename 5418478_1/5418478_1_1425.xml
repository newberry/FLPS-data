   <p>Bohemians in the Sixth Congressional District will be the deciding factor in the coming election, which will place a successor in the senatorial seat vacated by William Lorimer. The Sixth District comprises primarily the Twenty-fourth Ward, in which alone there are over four thousand Bohemian voters; but some towns and townships also belong to this district, which is thickly populated by Czechs. They are Berwyn, Hawthorne, Morton Park, Oak Park, Lyons and Riverside; they amount at least to another thousand Czech voters. For this reason it is expected that victory will come to him who can gain these votes. Every indication points to the [victory of the] Republican candidate, William Moxley. Of the four candidates appearing in the primary he is the ablest and, to us, the most agreeable. He is no professional politician. Setting out as a poor devil, he worked himself up by his own endeavors until he became wealthy, and he is now one of the most prominent businessmen of the city. For the populace of our West Side he has a genuine attachment and a deep interest; he is a staunch <pb facs="5418478_1_1426.jpg" n="2"/>supporter of every action beneficial to our district.</p>
   <p>He knows us Czechs and respects us as law-abiding citizens of this country and as the most meritorious element on the West Side. Mr. Moxley did not covet the nomination, for he had to be urged to enter the contest. In the convention, the Republican leaders arrived at the conviction that no man more popular and better qualified could be found in their ranks; they nominated him and begged him to accept. It was, above all, the present United-States Senator Lorimer, formerly Congressman for the district, who did everything to see Mr. Moxley nominated and to make him accept. Mr. Lorimer's efforts were directed toward the election of a man who would help him to push the measure for the development of the deep waterways and other important projects. If men of the influence and capability of Mr. Lorimer and Mr. Moxley support an enterprise, it is bound to meet with success; this applies to major issues and to minor local improvements as well. The certainty that the Sixth district will find in Mr. Moxley an efficient and reliable representative constitutes the backbone of his popularity among the Czech voters.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1427.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Democrats gave their nomination to Mr. Ryan. He is the one whom we know to satiety, who uttered the statement that he holds the votes of the Twenty-fourth Ward in his pocket, and that he can buy the Czechs for a keg of beer; it was he, as head of the machine in the ward, who saw to it that our unforgettable Alderman Josef Kohout was shoved aside with no hope for a new Democratic nomination, and that he was completely driven out of political life. The tragic consequences of all this are known to us. If now our countrymen take a stand against Ryan, they will thus give a sound lesson to the entire Democratic machine, which has, through its lack of appreciation and its ingratitude, driven one of our best countrymen into despair and suicide.</p>
   <p>The other candidates for the election on November 23 are worth no consideration, since none of them has the faintest chance to win. Every vote given to them is wasted. We Czechs have only one aim in mind: to beat Ryan and to teach the Democratic machine how to respect us and our representatives. We shall therefore vote for Moxley.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1428.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There will be a meeting in Kafka's Hall at 26th Street and Avers Avenue this afternoon, in which the situation in the Sixth District will be explained by able speakers to the Czech voters, and our countrymen will hear what they can expect of Mr. Moxley and also how to put the activities of his opponents under the limelight. The gathering should prove an instructive one for every citizen, whether Democrat or Republican. It is therefore advisable for voters to appear in as large numbers as possible. Among the speakers announced are Senator Lorimer, Otto R. Fuerst, Joseph A. Smejkal, and Edward E. Hrdlicka. They certainly know how to arrest your attention and convince you. Attend in great numbers!</p>
