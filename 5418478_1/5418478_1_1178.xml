   <p>p.1 - We were not mistaken in our people. We knew that they would not deny their support to working men oppressed by powerful capital and that they would provide effective aid to countrymen in dire need. As soon as the coal miners plea for aid appeared in our paper, contributions began to pour in, and the longer it lasts, the more satisfactory the collection becomes. Collections are being made everywhere at entertainments, during lodge meetings, in factories; the unfortunates who undertook the battle against the trusts are being remembered everywhere.</p>
   <p>This fight will probably be ended soon now. Pot-bellied capital has been frightened by the harmonious agreement of the people; politicians and the government have been forced to step in and the coal-barons have expressed their willingness to arbitrate, a process they didn't want to hear a thing about a few days ago. In this victory our Bohemian people has a dignified share. They stood as one on the side of right and justice and did not begrudge any material generosity.</p>
