   <p>There is a rumor in our Czech districts that agitators are trying to split the vote in favor of Mayor William Hale Thompson, who is a candidate for the office of United States senator for the State of Illinois. How far this propaganda has penetrated into our element cannot be ascertained, but it is known that Alderman Cullerton of the Eleventh Ward has taken steps to check it.....</p>
   <p>We are convinced that there is not a Czech in our districts who would vote for Thompson, and weaken our position, for every vote is needed to help our regular Democratic candidates, Anton J. Cermak and John A. Cervenka. Their victory in the primary election next Wednesday will not only be a personal victory, but a triumph for the Czechoslovaks of Cook county. They will have won a representation in the government of Cook county such as they have never had before; they will point with pride to the offices to which their fellow countrymen have been elected in our Czechoslovak metropolis in America, <pb facs="5418478_1_1364.jpg" n="2"/>and in the county. This victory will be the result of vigorous action by our voters.</p>
   <p>Extensive preparations for campaign parades were in progress when it became known that the Democratic candidates did not wish to take part. Our Czech-American candidates, Messrs. John A. Cervenka and Anton J. Cermak, were among the first to decline the honor. This was because of the Federal regulations in effect on account of the war, and which have to be observed. These concern the conserving of gasoline by restricting the use of automobiles, but apply to Sundays only. The two candidates wish to co-operate with the Government to the fullest extent, and so the parades were canceled.</p>
