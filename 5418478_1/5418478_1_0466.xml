<title level="a">CZECH BRANCH UNITED SOCIETIES' MEETING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A meeting of the Czech branch of the United Societies was opened last night by its president John A. Cervenka; the place was the home of the Sokol Chicago. There was a large number of women in the gathering. Anton J. Čermák, secretary of the organization, gave a report concerning the Barbour Proposal on the prohibition of liquor, which is to be voted on in the Illinois Legislature.</p>
   <p>The essentials of the proposed law are known in their outline. They demand, briefly, that alcoholic beverages be barred from premises where four or more people assemble for dancing. The fine for violation is fixed at $200. The bill has reached the stage of the second reading. All the bills concerning the United Societies will be voted on by them in a meeting next Wednesday.</p>
   <p>Mr. Čermák called further attention to the harassing to which a representative of the United Societies, who is a member of the Legislature, was subjected to <pb facs="5418478_1_0467.jpg" n="2"/>last Sunday, when two hundred, or more, men and women with children demonstrated in front of his residence warning him in a threatening tone to vote for the Barbour Bill and for the referendum for the establishment of prohibition.</p>
   <p>"Some members of the Legislature and the city council are liberal minded and opposed to blue laws," Mr. Čermák said, "but they often indulge in passing unpremeditated remarks as, 'they might vote for prohibition,' and by using them as a sort of threat, they blur and confuse the whole issue. Our newspapers ought to keep an eye on these men and submit their actions to severe criticism, in due time."</p>
   <p>Mr. Červenka introduced Mr. Kramer, president of the United Societies, who related his interviews with several members of the Legislature, each of whom declined to prognosticate the outcome of the voting on the blue bill but produced, in lieu of a promise, circulars in which resolutions, recommending laws by which our state would be hurled into an abyss of fanaticism, were published. These <pb facs="5418478_1_0468.jpg" n="3"/>circulars were passed with the aid of boys and girls of sectarian churches and schools. Mr. Kramer hopes, however, that just as in the State of Missouri the rural vote was overwhelmed by the vote of St. Louis, Chicago will manage to beat the country districts, three-quarters of whose votes are for prohibition.</p>
   <p>In taking the floor, Mr. Cervenka viewed with alarm the extent to which prohibition has gained a dominant position in the various states (twenty-five to date), and how almost one-half of Congress is for prohibition, where only two-thirds are necessary to make the blue bill a law. "The situation in Illinois is so extremely critical," the speaker stated, "that the brewers are afraid to invest in their business, apprehending eventualities. A constitutional convention, in these portenteous times, may bring a constitution worse than the present one. Within one year Chicago will have to vote on prohibition and will have to face the issue," predicted the speaker.</p>
   <p>Mr. R. Svoboda observed that this country has ceased to be a land of liberty <pb facs="5418478_1_0469.jpg" n="4"/>but has become one of usurpation and fanaticism.</p>
   <p>Alderman [Otto] Kerner announced, in mentioning Home Rule, that he has worked out an ordinance, which, if passed by the city council, would then go to the Legislature; it is designed to secure authority for the city council to regulate the liquor trade. He was to submit the proposed ordinance on the day of the present meeting. The referendum will be voted on by the public. The speaker felt sure of the success of his ordinance, notwithstanding the fact that some aldermen seem to have changed their minds to the detriment of the proposed ordinance.</p>
   <p>Mr. Červenka called for vigorous participation in the work of the delegates who are to be sent to Springfield. Mr. Frank Mašek and Alderman Novák regretted that the tavern keepers lag in interest for the anti-prohibition movement, although they are the first to be hit by the adverse laws proposed. "Many of them," they said, "do not even belong to the United Societies."</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0470.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>In defense of the liquor men rose Mrs. Šístek and Mr. Čermák, both of whom described the tavern keeper as a forgotten man, who has no one who would come to his support. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
