   <p>Mayor Harrison has caused his special organ to retract the statement previously credited to him, to the effect that the police could not disarm the Bohemian Sharpshooters because the Constitution guarantees to every man the right to bear arms. The Tribune cannot undertake to follow up all the mistakes of Mayor Harrison's special organ, but draws attention to this case because it was misled into a criticism of the Mayor for what he now asserts he did not say, and because it is anxious to believs that he is not inclined to take the communistic view of the statute which goes into effect the first of next month and forbids the organization and parade of just such military companies as the Bohemian Sharpshooters.</p>
   <p>The constitutional principle is very clearly defined by the language employed, which guarantees the right to bear arms because a well-organized militia is necessary to the security of a free State; but the new law forbidding the organization of independent and irresponsible military companies and punishing citizens who belong to such organizations, is one that should <pb facs="5418478_1_0971.jpg" n="2"/>have no place among the statutes from the very organization of the State. There would then have been no question about the right to disarm the Bohemian Sharpshooters; in fact, there would have been no such organization, and consequently no such riotous proceedings as occured on last Sunday.</p>
