   <p>Chicago reformers are preparing for another crusade against dance halls. A woman reformer made a survey of dance halls and published a report which contains nothing but the ancient complaint against dances where alcoholic liquors play a part. She claims that the young people become intoxicated, that indecent dances are allowed, and that dancing entertainments are detrimental, on the whole, to youth. All of this is not news to anybody, but it furnishes the professional prohibitionist with means for experiments aiming at the abolition of drinking liquor at entertainments. Some of the drys intend to protest to the city council and, because they know they might not meet with success there, they threaten to urge the state legislature to pass a law prohibiting any kind of liquor in dance halls. If such proposal becomes a law it would <pb facs="5418478_1_0473.jpg" n="2"/>again mean a restriction upon decent societies who could not arrange entertainments without liquor and would thus be deprived of a little money, the larger part of which is usually diverted into the treasuries of charitable organizations.</p>
   <p>With due consideration of all circumstances, it must be admitted that the main complaints against dance halls are justified, but the fault lies in blaming all of the entertainments, with no discrimination between dances given by respectable societies and those arranged by private individuals. There are halls in Chicago where there is a dance almost every night, where the worst rabble gather and police tolerate them, as was shown during the recent investigation in the "black belt" in the Second Ward and others. The investigators observe the debauching in certain halls and then throw all of them into one and the same basket. It is time to finally do away with the dens and to <pb facs="5418478_1_0474.jpg" n="3"/>leave decent entertainments unmolested, which are conducted more properly than private dances given by the Chicago aristocracy in big hotels, objects of the recent investigation by police.</p>
