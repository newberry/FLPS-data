   <p>There was a meeting yesterday afternoon, at 99 W. Randolph Street of the delegates of the Socialist Party the purpose of which was the selection of candidates to replace the ticket decided on two weeks ago, which met with such general disapproval. Mr. J. B. Belohradsy, the candidate nominated for clerk of the Superior Court two weeks ago withdrew his candidacy and in his place the name of Mr. Bowler was placed on the ticket.</p>
   <p>The men selected for county commissioners candidacies were for the North side Alex Eilert; for the West side Leo Meilbek; for the South side James White. The candidate selected for the Superior Court Judgeship was H. Rubens. In order that the Bohemian people might also be represented on the party's ticket our Mr. Meilbek accepted the nomination for County Commissioner.</p>
   <p>It is expected that not only Mr. Meilbek but all the other candidates will receive the support of our countrymen, the majority of whom approve the principles of the Socialist Party. We urge every friend of the workingmen's party to honesty and conscientiously work for the election of all our candidates.</p>
