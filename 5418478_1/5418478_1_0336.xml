   <p>The petition for the teaching of Bohemian in the "Throop" Public School was finally delivered to the Board of Education yesterday. Superintendent of Schools Curran moved that the request of the Bohemian people of that district be complied with. Gen. Stiles, asked that the petition be referred to the Committee on German. Supt. Stone urged that the petition be treated with every attention and that he does not wish it to be suppressed. The entire petition was referred to the committee on books and education after a short discussion. Therefore, our petition nears a favorable judgment and it seems more than likely that it will be favorably acted upon and our countrymen will be satisfied. It now depends on the committee to which the petition was referred, to give its opinion in favor of the petition and to recommend favorable action there on to the present assembly of the School Board.</p>
   <p>It would be fitting, yes, and even urgent, that some of our better qualified countrymen, the more the better, cell on the above committee in order to explain the entire matter and enlighten it on the need for the teaching of the Bohemian Language in the Throop School, the truth of which was proven by the petition. When the proper times comes for this visit we will announce it in this paper.</p>
