<title level="a">MAYOR HARRISON FAILS TO RECOGNIZE BOHEMIANS NOT A SINGLE COUNTRYMAN APPOINTED TO HIS CABINET</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Last night, Mayor Carter H. Harrison sent to the City Council a list of thirteen appointments for confirmation. All of them were confirmed by the Council. Two Bohemians are among the appointees, both of them well-known. Mr. Frank Sima, one of the most deserving Bohemian Democrats, who has been active in political life for many years, was appointed a member of the Board of Local Improvements. Mr. Joseph O. Kostner, a young man, twenty-nine years of age, became assistant Commissioner of Public Works. Mr. Kostner is already recognized in Democratic circles, in spite of his youth. In this year's primaries, he sought the nomination for alderman of the 34th Ward, and although the regular organization was against him, he very nearly won. He is well informed, and a member of several Bohemian lodges. He is a lawyer, and lives at 1404 Independence Boulevard with his mother and five sisters.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1626.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>That Mr. Sima is a good Bohemian, and an active member of Bohemian societies, need not even be mentioned. There probably is not one Bohemian in Pilsen, on the near South Side, or in Bohemian California, who does not know him. Those who know him, know what an excellent Bohemian, and man he is.</p>
   <p>Therefore, although we sincerely wish the above named gentlemen well upon their appointments, we cannot say that we are entirely satisfied with the recognition given the Bohemians by Mayor Harrison. For that inclination, which the Bohemians have always shown toward the Democratic party, and toward Mayor Harrison in particular, they are deserving to have their representatives in the City's highest offices, in the so-called Mayor's Cabinet. Where did the Mayor find out that Bohemian in politics live off of crumbs?</p>
