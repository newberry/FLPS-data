   <p>The definite disposal of the question of liquor licenses in connection with dances and social entertainments of various associations, clubs, etc., took place in yesterday's meeting of the Municipal Council. Although this matter had apparently been decided sometime ago, when, after long public investigations, both sides selected representatives to draft rules for entertainments having permission to draw and serve alcoholic beverages, the notorious aldermen Merriam and McCormick kept on dipping into the matter until they were definitely put in their place yesterday.</p>
   <p>To Alderman John Toman, as the chairman of the licensing committee, goes a great deal of credit for this victory. He had been working on the committee for a sensible ordinance regulating the use of beer and other alcoholic beverages in public dances, but when McCormick and Merriam presented their <pb facs="5418478_1_0661.jpg" n="2"/>minority reports yesterday, one of them prohibiting the serving of beer after one o'clock in the morning, the other prohibiting it altogether, Alderman Toman got up and pinned down the hypocrisy of these apostles of temperance who would not permit the people to take a glass of beer in a public entertainment, but at the same time did nothing to prevent the drugstores in their own neighborhood from selling whisky to minors. The final vote showed forty-three aldermen for the liberal ordinance and only twenty-five against it.</p>
   <p>Alderman Toman caused another defeat of Merriam when he beat him to any new steps by proposing the formation of a committee composed of six aldermen and three private citizens to investigate the conditions in the restaurant and saloon business in order to determine whether or not the continuous attacks against that business are justified. Merriam came up limping with another proposal, to form a committee composed of seven aldermen, and make the nomination of that committee the special object of the coming meeting of the Council. Upon Toman's motion the Council disapproved Merriam's proposal, and both proposals were passed on to the licensing committee for report.</p>
