<title level="a">THE BANKRUPTCY OF ROBERT PITTE &amp; SON</title></bibl>

   <p>Not since the time of the Kozel defalcation and the closing of the Tuma bank, have the Chicago-Czech depositors been gripped by the terror of impending poverty now that the magnitude and far-reaching consequences of the bankruptcy of the house of Robert Pitte &amp; Son are being divulged before the eyes of the public with utter hopelessness and despair in their trial. Most of the assets of the firm which formerly were classified as solid have proved to be worthless, and the real estate is heavily encumbered. As a result of the regulations in bankruptcy proceedings, the winding up of the affairs is calculated to take at least one year with pay of $500 weekly for the receiver, and many an outlay for overhead in addition. This gives a conception of how much the depositors may fairly expect to rescue from the wreck.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0990.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>From the evidence uncovered at the present time, it is obvious that dishonesty played the major part in the actions of the Pittes, who concealed their duplicity behind the business of "Notary Public." Their practises in the mortgage business may well be likened to the artistry of a criminal prestidigitator, some, however, shone by their very simplicity. The Pittes received monies to pay off mortgages, which they failed to do. Now, hundreds of the people who had trusted the wrong party are awakening to the startling reality that they shall have to pay their full debt to the last penny. It was the sister of the elder Pitte, who lived in his house, to whom he accorded the most despicable treatment. She gave a mortgage valued at $2000 in trust to her brother, who resold it without her knowledge, and without having paid a single cent of interest. His other blood relatives did not fare much better.</p>
   <p>The Pittes are in hiding now, but their apprehension is considered to be only a matter of days.</p>
