   <p>p. 3--The meetings of the executive committee of the "Matice Vyššího Vzdĕlání" Association for Higher Education) are growing more and more interesting. At the meeting of March 16, 1906, the application of a Czech student was approved; he is ambitious to continue his studies at the University of Iowa. The applicant has produced all his preliminary examination papers and other references.</p>
   <p>A gift of $50 by the widow of Jos. Dusil for the "Dusil Fund" was accepted with gratification. At the meeting of May 4, 1906, opened by Professor Simek, there was proposed the printing of a "National Stamp," the money yielded by the sale to be directed into the proper channels for the advancement of national pursuits. The respective motion made by W. F. Severa will be discussed at a later meeting.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0377.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Jan. Havlasa, Czech writer, who was in Chicago at the time, suggested a plan for the levying of a "National Excise" for national purposes, in the form of a stamp of negligibly small denomination. This excellent proposition evoked no more response than a few articles in newspapers and comments by correspondents.</p>
   <p>Mr. Vaclav Snajdr offered the same idea in the paper Dennik Novoveku, but nobody paid any attention. Dr. Jaroslav E. Vojan contributed to the formation of a plan for the introduction of the stamp and its use for the national work to be done. Mr. Severa, feeling that the idea should not be abandoned, considered all that had been said in favor of it, and resolved to come to the Association for Higher Education with a compact proposition in order to realize Havlasa's original idea.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0378.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Severa offered to pay for one full year all initial expenses connected with the introduction of the stamp, under the condition, in accord with Dr. Vojan, that one half of the money gathered in this way would be given to the Association for Higher Education, one quarter to Czech schools, and one quarter for charitable and humanitarian purposes.</p>
   <p>Within one year it should be apparent whether the stamp has proved a paying proposition, and if so, further expenses can be payed from the income.</p>
   <p>The division of the second part of the yield, for school and charitable purposes, should be placed in the care of a committee of newspapermen who have taken a friendly attitude toward the Association for Higher Education. The collections from the sale of stamps are to be deposited in a bank, and be kept under the control of the Association of Higher Education and distributed once a year.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_0379.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The creation of a stamp should prove of great benefit for the Bohemian people in America, and should become a fact after the executive committee has passed favorably on the idea.</p>
   <p>All of the Czech painters are invited to submit sketches of drawings which could be used as a basis for the design of the stamp. Further information about the shape and size of the stamp, the use of the name,etc. may be obtained from W. F. Severa, Box 569, Cedar Rapids, Ia. Specific information on the use and propagation of the stamp shall be published in the near future.</p>
