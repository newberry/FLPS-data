   <p>.....It is truly remarkable to see what active interest is displayed by our Czechoslovak societies and unions in the forthcoming elections. One typical symptom of that interest was a resolution passed by the Grand Lodge of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Union) to support the Democratic ticket, and advising the entire membership of the Jednota to vote for the candidates on that ticket on November 7, 1922. During the past week the Grand Lodge held another meeting which was presided over by Mrs. Anna Brychta, with Mrs. Alzbeta Lisy occupying the secretary's chair. In this meeting the ladies of the Grand Lodge discussed seriously the importance of the November election, and decided to recommend the Democratic candidates most warmly to all the members of the Jednota who are living in Cook County. The ladies have shown a most lively interest in the election of Mr. Anton J. Cermak as president of the Cook county Board of Commissioners; they were also interested in electing Mr. Josef A. Mendl as member of the said Board, and all of the Czechoslovak candidates generally. Irrespective of what the political adherences of these ladies may be, they <pb facs="5418478_1_1279.jpg" n="2"/>will all vote for these [Czechoslovak] candidates.....</p>
