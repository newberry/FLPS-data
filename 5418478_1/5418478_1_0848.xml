   <p>Bohemian-Polish co-operation, brotherly agreement, and unity of effort are indispensable requirements in these days, and those among us who have accepted the responsibility of taking the necessary steps toward the fulfillment of our national desires--steps that the leaders of our nation in the old country are unable to take under the prevailing conditions--should never forget this. It will perhaps be easier at the present time to reach an understanding with our brother Poles than it has been in the past, when all attempts of this kind failed because of indifference on both sides. In those days, only matters of inferior importance were at stake, such as common local political action, or the question of so-called recognition by the political parties. Today, however, it is a question of the most important interests of both brother nations, the question of their existence and their liberty. At the present time, the idea <pb facs="5418478_1_0849.jpg" n="2"/>of Bohemian-Polish co-operation in America should certainly find a greater measure of understanding and meet with a much more friendly reception. The development of a program of action based on that idea would be something our own leaders and the Polish leaders would have to do.</p>
   <p>It would be decidedly to our benefit if we Bohemians should pay closer attention to what the local Poles are doing. We should find that much of it we could emulate to great advantage. If nothing else, their generous unselfishness and enthusiastic devotion to their old country are well worth emulating.</p>
