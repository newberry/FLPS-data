   <p>Yesterday Chicago experienced the first day of its biggest strike on street-car lines and elevated railways. The weather was bad, and the people had to walk long distances and use all kinds of primitive means of transportation, but everybody was in a good mood.....</p>
   <p>The strikers and those who sympathize with them deserve a great deal of credit for not permitting themselves to be provoked to violence. Only one little riot was reported throughout the day, when a crowd of people, sympathizers with the strikers, bombarded an elevated railway train with rocks, which caused an injury to a detective sergeant who was aboard the train as a guard, and who was slightly cut by shattered glass.</p>
   <p>The good spirits of all those concerned and all those hundreds of thousands of <pb facs="5418478_1_1133.jpg" n="2"/>people to whom the strike causes a great deal of inconvenience, would indicate that the strike may be soon settled, although the statement issued by the officers of the companies last night leads one to the belief that they are ready to start operating cars by scabs quite soon, an action which is likely to cause a dangerous crisis.....</p>
   <p>Concerning the described session of the Municipal Council, it should be added that the Socialist Rodriguez, Alderman of the Fifteenth Ward, offered a resolution that the Mayor take over all the strike-affected railways on behalf of the city and that the city start normal transportation on them, pay the employees out of current receipts, and keep on in that way until the officials of the companies are ready to guarantee satisfactory service to the public. This resolution seemed too radical to the overwhelming majority of our city fathers, and, except for the two Socialists, Rodriguez and Kennedy, only two of <pb facs="5418478_1_1134.jpg" n="3"/>our countrymen, Aldermen John Toman and Blaha had courage enough to vote for it.</p>
