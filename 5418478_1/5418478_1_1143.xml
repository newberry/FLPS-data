   <p>William D. Haywood, the well known socialist labor leader, whom Spravedlnost, which shouts to the world that it is a socialist and labor paper, falsely announced as a speaker in Cream City Park several years ago so they could collect admissions on the strength of his name, had an opportunity yesterday to find out what kind of people are behind that paper. The Czechs' meanest enemy could not have picked a more evil collection of hoodlums than those Spravedlnost sent to the meeting. We are ashamed <pb facs="5418478_1_1144.jpg" n="2"/>of the fact, that Czechs who claim to be progressive in labor movement, showed themselves in that light. Although there were about two hundred respectable people at the meeting, about fifty so-called sluggers appeared, hired by persons who were to be judged by the assemblage. These sluggers caused such disorder and used such vile language that respectable women and girls were forced to leave the building.</p>
   <p>Many intelligent working-men made preparations to attend the meeting in order to hear Haywood, however, when it became known that sluggers would appear to cause disturbances and start fights, many of them stayed at home and consequently there were only about 200 respectable people present.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1145.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The proceedings of the meeting were concerned with the lessons of the recent tailor's strike.</p>
   <p>The principal speaker of the evening was William D. Haywood, well known labor leader of Boise, Idaho. He attempted to win over the betrayed tailors, for a new organization, based on the socialistic principles of the Industrial Workers of the World. This attempt was unsuccessful, because the meeting was demoralized by the 50 disciples of a Bohemian "socialist" paper, who appeared in the meeting and acted as if they were insane. It was said, that they were engaged by their leaders for the purpose of creating disturbances and unfortunately there was not a policeman in the hall. Nevertheless, they did not accomplish all of their aims. They succeeded by force in preventing the foundation of a new organization. At the same time, they gave the listeners a terrifying <pb facs="5418478_1_1146.jpg" n="4"/>example of fanaticism as sponsored by the socialistic newspaper on Loomis street, for the way the disturbers carried on, did not harmonize with common sense or sound reasoning. Not only did they shout and threaten when a speaker appeared on the stage and had the audacity to tell the truth, but they swore vulgarly, using disgusting expressions. This took place in a meeting where women and girls were present. We must give credit to the reporter from Spravedlnost, who was so ashamed of the actions of his servants that he had to caution them.</p>
   <p>It would almost drive one to tears, when one compared Haywood and those Bohemian Socialists of ours who read Spravedlnost. In Haywood, we saw intelligence and knowledge, in the others common vulgarity. Whereas, Haywood spoke in an intelligent manner on the national economic questions concerning the working-man, the others <pb facs="5418478_1_1147.jpg" n="5"/>roared uselessly.</p>
   <p>With the exception of Haywood, who threw hot coals on the heads of the gang from Spravedlnost, all the other advocates of his principles were shouted down, so that the listeners were unable to derive any benefit from their speeches. Haywood gained attention only because he is a distinguished speaker and knows how to compel even the most antagonistic fanatic to think over his every word. Another reason, the comrades were forced to listen to him is that he is respected as a socialist leader throughout America, and Spravedlnost in its day, praised him to the heavens. Otherwise, it is a possibility, that the comrades from Spravedlnost, whom his words burned so frightfully, probably would have lynched him.</p>
   <p>Although Haywood stands behind the organization of the Industrial <pb facs="5418478_1_1148.jpg" n="6"/>Workers of the World, the "sluggers" sent by Spravedlnost, prevented the organization of Bohemian workers on sound principles. The Bohemian leaders were forced to admit, however, that their present labor organization was rotten and corrupt, and that they did not agree with it from the beginning.</p>
   <p>Haywood said, that he warned the tailors against the strike, before he went to Europe, telling them that they did not have the strength nor the means to carry on a strike. He advised them to organize first. When he returned from Europe, he found he had been right. He also called attention to how stupidly the strike had been lead. When the workers had been on strike fourteen weeks, they still did not know if they were striking for shorter hours, for higher wages or a closed shop.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1149.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Haywood declared that those persons who made the agreement with the first firm were either crazy or well paid. How union officials deal with the bosses, behind the backs of the workers, he showed by reading some of their letters written during other strikes.</p>
   <p>In answer to a question by one of the hecklers, as to why he criticized Balvin, he said: "Anyone could have conducted the strike better than Balvin. All he did was to moan and during a struggle you don't cry about it, you fight, and everyone who works publicly is subject to criticism."</p>
   <p>The speaker recommended the Industrial Workers of the World as the best labor organization now existing, and urged those present <pb facs="5418478_1_1150.jpg" n="8"/>to take steps to join that organization. However, when the Socialists from Spravedlnost, created a disturbance, the audience dispersed to escape becoming victims of the violence which reigned among them.</p>
   <p>Those are the kind of people supported by the Spravedlnost. People capable of looking at everything in only one way; capable of nothing else, except what their bosses command.</p>
   <p>We must add, that in this meeting much abuse was rampant and directed at this reporter. Base insults, and language full of vulgarity, was used although it had no bearing on the subject under consideration, nor upon the people who attended the meeting. It was a sad portrait of Socialist education by the Spravedlnost.</p>
