   <p>Our readers will remember that in the year 1912 we received the good news from the Board of Education that permission had been granted to allow the teaching of the Bohemian language in our high schools. Those readers who remember this event will also recollect how some of our leaders accepted the "credit" for this "hard" work, claiming that it was their efforts in behalf of Bohemianism in America that saved the day. Our readers will also remember how we laid our plans for this; how we intended to place some Bohemian teachers in those schools, assuming that this would be sufficient. But since that time, no one has paid the slightest attention to these classes in Bohemian. The same fate which befell Polish, Swedish, and other foreign language instruction will also befall the teaching of Bohemian, because the former superintendent of schools, Mrs. Ella Flagg-Young, issued an order that any foreign language instruction may be included in the curriculum provided that there are enough students to enroll in such classes.</p>
   <p>Our problem now is: Shall we let our classes in the Bohemian language die <pb facs="5418478_1_0216.jpg" n="2"/>because of lack of interest? Such classes were organized in the Harrison High School and were attended by a large number of students of Bohemian origin. The [total] enrollment in these classes was never very large, that is, as large as we had expected it to be, but about seven classes were organized. It is, indeed, very sad when one considers how many hundreds of students are enrolled in Spanish and in French classes, while in the Bohemian ones there are about ten or twenty!</p>
   <p>Why is it that children of Bohemian origin prefer Spanish and French instruction to Bohemain? Are they ashamed to know the language of their ancestors? I do not wish to believe that. There are, of course, parents who reason that it is more practical and more important to know those languages which are spoken by a greater number of people, and for that reason perhaps they have their children enroll in a Spanish class; why the whole of South America speaks Spanish! But what percentage of our young people will go to South America on business or for pleasure? It is rather to be expected that they <pb facs="5418478_1_0217.jpg" n="3"/>will have contact and will do business with Bohemians.</p>
   <p>Everyone must recognize that from a practical standpoint, a knowledge of the Bohemian language is very important for our young people. From the cultural point of view, all languages are of equal value; our literature is as beautiful as that of other nations.</p>
   <p>This week marks the beginning of the new semester, and your children may enroll in classes in the Harrison High School. At present there is only one teacher of Bohemian in a school where there ought to be two or even three, as one finds in classes of Spanish or French. It is hoped that a large number of students will enroll in the Bohemian classes. Our slogan must be: A Czech child belongs in a Czech class.</p>
