   <p>At a meeting held last night in the "Tel. Jed. Sokol" (Gymnastic Union Sokol) hall in protest against the unjust decision of the School Board in regards to the teaching of the Bohemian Language in the Throop School the following resolution was adopted:-</p>
   <p>1. We Bohemians, of the City of Chicago, citizens of the United States, law-abiding taxpayers of this county and city, in mass meeting this 29th day of February have resolved that we consider the action of our Chicago School Board in rejecting the petition of 258 Bohemian parents, citizens and taxpayers of the 6th Ward, who are sending their children to this school, and who requested the School Board in accordance with their previous decision in allowing the teaching of the German Language, as unjust, a slight to our sense of citizenship and as depriving the rights of one class while upholding another.</p>
   <p>2. That the argument advanced by the School Board member "Vocke" is not true, <pb facs="5418478_1_0327.jpg" n="2"/>if it was held as sufficient reason for rejecting of the petition, that even in Europe the Bohemian Language is so despised that it is taught only in two educational centers, that is Prague and Vienna, for we know that besides these the education in the Bohemian Language is carried on the following named:- The Oriental Academy of Vienna (where Prof. Burian lectured) The College of France in Paris(where Mickiewic lectured) The University of Berlin(Prof. Jagic) at the Universities of St. Petersburg and Warsaw and others in Russia, at the University of London and many other places. We know that the most eminent etymologist, the German professor Schleicher, wrote in Bohemian of the Slavic Languages: The great "Goethe" in his old age learned the Bohemian Language for its beauty and richness and translated its poetry: the eminent Herder in his work "Die Humanitaet" tells of the Bohemian nationality and its language and praises it highly: the Saxon King John, translated Bohemian poetry into the German language and Bohemian songs are known the world over for their beauty.</p>
   <p>3. That we do not desire any special privilege in our public schools, which above all we value for their utter impartiality, but realizing that the German Language would acquire an incommensurable privilege if other languages were neglected, we wish only to perform our duty, to forestall privileged legislation <pb facs="5418478_1_0328.jpg" n="3"/>and to obtain for our children the same benefits, which they are entitled to by reason of common citizenship with the Germans, requesting all other nationalities in Chicago to make use of all advantages offered by the School Board for the education of their children.</p>
   <p>4. Finally that we respectfully petition the Honorable School Board to reconsider the action taken at its previous meeting and recognize the rightful and justifiable petition of ours for the teaching of the Bohemian Language in the Throop School and allowed it to be so.</p>
