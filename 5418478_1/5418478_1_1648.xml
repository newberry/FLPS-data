   <p>The 8th ward Bohemian Democratic Club held its regular monthly meeting yesterday at the "Cesko-Angl. Svob. Skola" (Bohemian-English Liberal School). Alderman F.J. Dvorak was chairman. After the regular order of business had been completed, it was resolved to appoint a committee of five persons, who would recommend some capable Bohemian political workers, and with the help and influence of the Alderman obtain city jobs for them. It was also decided that the secretary communicate with the members of all precinct organizations, requesting them to hold a meeting and elect their own officers, then they would make reports to the ward club monthly. Bohemian Clubs are further invited to agree on some capable Bohemian Citizen who would then be recommended as a candidate for appointment to the School Board, so that Bohemians may be represented in this honorable and important body.</p>
   <p>A written resignation of vice-chairman, Mr. Slatinske, was received and accepted. Mr. Sindelar was elected in his place. One new member was accepted into the club, after which the meeting was adjourned.</p>
