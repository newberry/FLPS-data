   <p>An unsound, pernicious petition is being circulated in Washington, D. C., by the prohibitionists. In this document the "drys" frankly admit that there is only one means of introducing their reforms into the law--that is to interpolate them as part of the laws that govern the sale of food. Propositions concerning these laws are being debated in Congress now. No other way remains open to bring the issue of prohibition before the body, for it cannot be presented on its own merits.</p>
   <p>By incorporating the "dry" question with the question of pure food, the prohibitionists practically force the citizens to vote for the measure, unless they prefer to see the vote on the whole proposition delayed. That is precisely the aim of the food profiteers. Prohibition cannot be placed before Congress as a financial war measure, for its introduction would be too costly and way out of proportion with the possible savings.</p>

   <p>Prohibitionist tactics such as these are typical of the policy of the "dry" party. Congressmen and Senators who really care to see Uncle Sam succeed in his undertakings in these critical times should be aware of the implications of such tactics.</p>
