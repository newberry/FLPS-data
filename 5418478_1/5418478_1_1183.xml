<title level="a">THE LUMBER-SHOVERS' PROPOSED STRIKE.</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>If the lumber-shovers of Chicago carry out the threats they have previously made, they will strike to-morrow morning for higher wages and undertake to forcibly prevent others from taking their places, with the expectation of coercing their employees to accede to their demands. There are said to be 4,500 lumber-shovers in this city, mostly Bohemians, who were originally mostly all agricultural laborers, and who have abandoned their farm-work in the old country to undertake the harder work of lumber-shoving in Chicago. It may not be that all of them will strike; but the principles at issue are the same, whether 100 strike or the whole 4,500.</p>
   <p>There are two sides to this question, as to every other. There is no doubt that the labor of these men is very hard and toilsome. There is no doubt that their wages are low. Up to last year, they, had we believe, $1.50 per day.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1184.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In the present depressed condition of the lumber-market they receive but $1.25. They ought to get more, if possible, upon the principle that the laborer is worthy of his hire; but, if the business affords no more, and the market will furnish men who are willing to work at the current wages, then these striking Bohemians have no right to prevent them. They have the right to quit work. They have the right to ask what they please and to refuse to work until they get it; but they have no right to forcibly prevent other men from working $1.25, because they want an increase to $1.50. The settlement of this question, therefore depends on the ability of the lumber firms to obtain substitutes. If the market will not furnish men who are willing to work for the prevent wages, then the strikers will succeed in getting their advance. So far as the mere fact of striking is concerned, there is nothing censurable in their announcement. But, when they couple with it the distinct threat that they will not allow any other men to take their places, they not only transcent their rights in the premises, but, if they carry their threat into operation, immediately becomes liable to arrest and punishment under the State law of Illinois, passed last winter, affixing penalties for obstructing business.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_1_1185.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The provisions of this law are so explicit, that the lumber-shovers will have no difficulty in ascertaining its meaning. And it may be added that the businessmen of this city, after the disastrous experiences of the past 2 or 3 weeks, are not in a temper to allow interferences with their business, nor are the authorities in a temper to allow any violent proceedings upon the part of a mob to stop labor. As long as those proposed strikers refrain from interference with business, no one will interfere with them. But the moment they commence to hinder others by force from working, they violate the law and will be persecuted accordingly.</p>
