   <p>p.1.....Many states have passed laws ,and the Federal Government has well laid plans ready to put into action for a defensive warfare against "red" agitation.</p>
   <p>It is a well-known fact that there are very few native American followers of Communism. They know that living conditions and political freedom in the United States are far superior to those in Russia.</p>
   <p>The few hundred parlor-pink radicals among the Americans don't constitute a menace to the government. They are tolerated, because they are not dangerous.</p>
   <p>The situation among the foreign born is quite different. They are <pb facs="5422061_1_0444.jpg" n="2"/>given an opportunity to work and make good in this country and can take any office, except that of the President. They sin doubly against the constitution and the government, who take advantage of a guest's privileges and get mixed up in movements far below the American ideals.</p>
   <p>It is a sad fact that there are a number of our Hungarian brethren who have allied themselves with the bolshevik cause. It is not a credit to the Hungarians that so many of the bolsheviks known to the authorities, are Hungarians. It is our belief that most of them are not conscious of what they are doing, but the danger of deportation is hanging over them.</p>
   <p>The authorities know who are the subscribers of Communist publications,and also who belong to societies which spread communistic propaganda. The penalty for participating in anti-government activities in Pennsylvania, according to the new law, is jail, and after completion of the sentence, deportation. Those who subscribe to radical newspapers unknowingly, are warned that they may get themselves into serious trouble. The "red" leaders won't warn their followers, because they figure that one who is deported will become an enemy of organized society,and Moscow can always count on him.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0445.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The hungry man becomes a beast - that is what the bolsheviks want. They do not want a productive, but a rioting mass.</p>
   <p>Before it is too late, we wish to give a warning to our countrymen to desist from all contact with those circles, which will cause their downfall.</p>
