<title level="a">COMMITTEE ON IMMIGRATION LEAVING HUNGARY TO CONFER WITH PRESIDENT HARDING</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>We recently read a list of members of a Committee who are preparing to leave our homeland for America to confer with President Harding in the interest of our homeland. According to their program, aside from conferring with our President, they want to contact the Hungarians in America, so they can again fleece us of our hard earned savings.</p>
   <p>These gentlemen are allegedly coming here to request our President to consider the raw deal our homeland has received, and to use his influence toward invalidating the Versailles treaty. If this actually would be their only purpose, then, of course, it would be only natural for us Hungarians in America, and a duty we owe our homeland, to exert all our efforts to help them, thereby giving our President more cause for favorable consideration and action. Surely, it is the deep desire of every Hungarian-American that justice and peace shall come to our demolished homeland. Indeed, if this one aim is leading these self-styled gentlemen to America, then not a single Hungarian in the entire United States would hesitate to serve or sacrifice his life for the homeland.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0546.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>However, we foresee an entirely different picture of the matter. We honestly say, without fear of being criticized, that we cannot find anything else in the matter, except that it is an awkward chess move.</p>
   <p>The gentlemen from Hungary have a fixed idea that the Hungarians in America are "loaded" with dollars. Naturally, they want to lighten our burden, and take some of the "load off of our hands."</p>
   <p>Consequently, they are coming here for money. Anyone, who has carefully and constantly read the newspapers of Hungary, has read many times the expressions of opinions of the high politicians and wealthy businessmen stating that only the Hungarians in America could bring Hungary out of the financial mire, and rebuild our homeland.</p>
   <p>It is true that the Hungarians in America are not as poor as the people in our homeland, but if the people over there believe that we are "bathing in milk and butter," then they are very sadly mistaken. The larger portion of the Hungarian-Americans are nothing more than ordinary workers, <pb facs="5422061_1_0547.jpg" n="3"/>who have never earned more than sufficient to provide the necessities of life. In this way, the amount saved was small.</p>
   <p>One can easily see that the people of America have their troubles too, that they are quietly undergoing a change, financially. This change is being pushed by the laboring class, and so the Hungarians of America feel the pressure of the financial change.</p>
   <p>The Hungarians of America did have money saved up, but, today that money has been decreased considerably. Let us think of the last six months when the majority in America have either become unemployed, or are working for very small wages. Yet we must live. Living expenses and clothing still remain at a high level. In fact, there is a movement going on to raise rent prices. So it is understood, that the poor worker must of necessity reach for his meager savings. When you are continually withdrawing from a savings account without depositing regularly, it surely means that the balance always grows smaller and smaller, until the entire savings are gone.</p>
   <p>For the above reasons, it is certain that the scheme of these titled gentlemen <pb facs="5422061_1_0548.jpg" n="4"/>will not succeed. In fact, without the above reasons, their schemes would have been unsuccessful. The Hungarians of America would never have given them their money, because we do not and cannot believe in or trust their promises.</p>
   <p>Those promises which were made, as usual, were never fulfilled.</p>
   <p>Then again, these gentlemen picked a very poor time to come to America to discuss the problem of the homeland. Not only do they know, but the entire World knows that America cannot, and will not change the Versailles peace treaty. Only England and France could accomplish this, and because they are the beneficiaries of the treaty, the politicians and diplomats do not want to hear of any such actions. These wild animals, dressed up in human flesh, do not wish to come within a hair breadth's distance of their motto, "Vae Victis," (woe to the vanquished).</p>
   <p>If the titled gentlemen from Hungary were desirous of bringing our relations closer to the homeland, then they should have found a better reason. To gain our confidence with useless phrases, is impossible, for we are tired of hearing them, and do not want to hear any more of such flowery phrases.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0549.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>If our homeland desires to step into closer relationship with us, they should not send titled gentlemen to us, who throughout their lifetime, have taken advantage of the poor Hungarian working class, and have taken their last drop of blood away from them. They should send such men who fight for the poor working people, men who struggle and suffer with them. These men will not come to us with flowery phrases, but with the actual truth. We will believe and make our sacrifices for these men.</p>
   <p>When those titled gentlemen arrive, we will graciously welcome them, for they, too, are the sons of our homeland. We will also watch the parade, in fact, perhaps, we will join them, as long as it will not cost us money. We bring to the attention of the Hungarians in America, far in advance, to watch their pocket books very closely, see that they do not become empty. To empty the pocket books of the Hungarian-Americans, is the sincere desire of the titled gentlemen from Hungary.</p>
