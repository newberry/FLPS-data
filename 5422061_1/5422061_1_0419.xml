   <p>A successful protest-meeting was held Sunday afternoon at the Masonic Temple Hall. The meeting, called together at the initiative of the Chicago Branch of the Cultural Federation, with the co-operation of several Hungarian associations, was attended by a large crowd of Hungarians, who came to protest against Hitlerism and the persecution of the Jews in Germany.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the meeting was Dr. Zoltan Galambos, who told in his opening speech how Hitlerism had originated and how we could protect ourselves against it.</p>
   <p>Every one of the speakers expressed his opinion on this question and concluded that the situation is dangerous, and that something has to be done to prevent the spreading of this danger.</p>
   <p>It goes without saying that if we were to take the views of the different <pb facs="5422061_1_0420.jpg" n="2"/>speakers at face value, we would have to admit the truth of what they said. Unfortunately, they all are faithful followers of certain principles and therefore gave expression to their own convictions. We prefer not to make any comments on what was said at this meeting, or to approve or disapprove of any of the speeches--we merely want to add our own conviction, as follows: Hitlerism is nothing but a new attempt to save the present and already tottering social and economic system. In other words, its purpose is to mend already torn clothes.</p>
