   <p>On can find individuals among Hungarians who do not appreciate the freedom and liberty enjoyed by the people living in the United States. All this country expects of its residents is that they respect the laws and keep their thoughts to themselves. We will find some one every day who expresses his thoughts freely, thereby committing a crime. This is just what happened to a Hungarian man by the name of Frank Sule, who is employed by the Oliver Plow Works. He became involved in an argument with his superintendent and made some remarks which were unpatriotic and anti-American. He was immediately placed under arrest. What will happen to him is not known at this writing. His case has not been heard as yet.</p>
