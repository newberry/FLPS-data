   <p>There are many Hungarian artists in Chicago who work quietly and stay behind the curtains until they achieve something notable that brings them not only material profits but recognition.</p>
   <p>These artists--painters, sculptors, and commercial artists--are forming an organization the purpose of which is not only to get them acquainted with one another but to allow them to carry together the torch of Hungarian genius. By the light of this torch they will be known by Americans and Hungarians, and they will know and recognize each other's talents, aiding each other in every way.</p>
   <p>According to plans, this little group of artists, numbering about twelve, will exhibit their works this fall. By doing this they hope to prove to the American public that the Hungarians can compete favorably with other artists because they have ability.....</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0479.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We congratulate our Hungarian artists on their plans of organization and assure them of our unlimited support. Whenever they need the columns of this paper, they will always be open to them.</p>
