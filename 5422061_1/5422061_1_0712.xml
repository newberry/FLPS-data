   <p>Recent statements made by Girard, a Berlin representative give the American press a different interpretation of the meaning of the war. Our free American press who has proven itself non-partisian in the war now wants to prove that this world catastrophe was caused by the German Kaiser. He was the one and only one that wanted to bathe himself in blood and suppress the rest of Europe. - The Russian Czar is just a shy little lamb, the English king is as innocent as a new born child, Peter the Serbian king is a nationalistic idol and he is a true representative of democracy, the Roman and Italian kings are two peace loving kings and hate the sight of blood as much as some of our temperance promoters hate the sight of intoxicating beverages.</p>
   <p>Perhaps the American papers are right, although no one can say for sure whether they are right or wrong. The allies blame the German Kaiser solely for having caused the war, while the central Europe powers blame the Russian Czar and the English empire, while the socialists of the world blame the capitalists.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0713.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All this shifting of blame from one to another does not interest the human race. After the blame is determined it will not resurrect those that have lost their lives during the last three years of war, nor does it protect the lives of those millions who by some chance are still among the living. There is not one single American soldier who will be saved by the fact that the German Kaiser is being made the scape goat.</p>
   <p>The American press would accomplish a lot more by determining who is to blame for the continuation of the war, or who is to blame for the fact that we can not have peace.</p>
   <p>Today, after millions have lost their lives, those who are standing in the way of peace are committing a greater sin than those who three years ago promoted this war.</p>
