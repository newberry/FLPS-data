   <p>Everyone knows that a great change has taken place in the economic and social activities of Europe and the United States during the past hundred years. The working conditions of women were naturally affected by these changes. Their educational and political status also underwent great changes during this period. Up to the end of the nineteenth century, women's duties were confined to the home; they did their work the same way that they had been doing it for many hundreds of years previously. The upkeep of the home was left to the various members of the family. The care of the home, and the care of the children were the primary duties of the housewife. These duties took up most of her time. Business played a very unimportant part in man's life during this period. The necessities of life were provided for by man's own labor and by nature. Educational opportunities in those days as compared <pb facs="5422061_1_0779.jpg" n="2"/>with today were almost negligible. The girls learned their domestic knowledge at home. In those days regardless of to what social class a girl belonged, it was impossible for her to go to a university in order to prepare herself for a professional position. In most countries the women could not assume a position lawfully in government circles.</p>
   <p>The citizenship status of women was not considered any more than was that of a child. A woman could not make a contract. She could not sue anyone nor could she be sued by anyone. If she committed a crime, the husband or the father was held responsible. A wife could not own property. She had very few rights over her children. If a woman worked for a salary, the salary automatically became the property of her husband.</p>
   <p>With the opening of the present century however, a great change took place. Large factories sprang up in every field of manufacture, and machines were <pb facs="5422061_1_0780.jpg" n="3"/>invented to make working conditions easier; girls and women were hired to run these machines. Cities and small towns became industrial centers where men, women and even children made their way to work to make their own living. As industry developed, the people became specialized in certain fields of work. As this change came about, some of the women realized that they were as capable in the business world as were the men. They opened places of business and hired women for sales jobs. As women went into business, the realization developed slowly that they were highly suitable for office positions. As time went on, the younger girls were attracted to the business and factory world where they would work from the time they left school until they got married.</p>
   <p>With the opening of the era of women in industry, different countries realized that laws had to be enacted which would protect women against long hours and other hazardous conditions. As women became more and more involved in industry and business, laws were enacted which enabled them to acquire education on the same basis as men. However, in European countries cultural education among women is stressed more than anything else.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0781.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There isn't a country in the world which affords the educational opportunities to men and women that the United States does. It has been these educational opportunities which have made it possible for women to become doctors and other specialized workers.</p>
   <p>The status of women has changed legally and politically. In different countries different changes have taken place, but what we think is the most important is that women got the right to vote. Norway was the first country to grant suffrage to women. With this change came the right of women to represent the people in parliament, congress or other governmental activities.</p>
   <p>There are still countries where women have not gained the right to vote. But in these countries, the women are up in arms and are demanding their rights, which is no more than just. Women are as capable as men in most instances, and therefore they should have the same rights.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0782.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The purpose of this article is that we want our people to become acquainted with the social activities of the women of America. We want our Chicago Hungarian readers to know how the women advanced step by step. We want our women to realize the educational opportunities they have. We want them to know what opportunities await them in the business world or in the field of politics.</p>
   <p>We think that as long as these opportunities exist, women should take advantage of them.</p>
