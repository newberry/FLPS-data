   <p>The majority of our readers have been raised in a farm environment. Their parents and their ancestors for generations have tilled the soil. Therefore, it is natural that the present generation also should be fond of farming.</p>
   <p>When a Hungarian has to work from morning until evening in the putrid atmosphere of a factory and has to live in the noisy and congested city, he envisions in his imagination the sunny meadows [of the countryside] and longs to breathe the pure air of the country.</p>
   <p>Today we have a proposal that coincides with the foregoing descriptive picture. The Irrigated Farms Corporation makes an offer which is very valuable to those who want to till their own farm land.</p>
   <p>From both the viewpoints of health and investment, the land in the Magic Valley, Lower Rio Grande, offered by the Company, is an extraordinary opportunity.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0791.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This Company is not a new one. For thirteen years it has been in Chicago, formerly called Rutherford and Harding, Inc. The Company can give bank references in both Chicago and Texas, and even more important, the large number of satisfied investors attest to the integrity of the firm.</p>
   <p>This is neither speculation nor a venture, but a sound investment backed by responsible businessmen. We recommend this proposal to our readers because we know that they would appreciate the climate and soil of Texas....</p>
   <p>Further information may be obtained from the Company or from the Magyar Tribune.</p>
