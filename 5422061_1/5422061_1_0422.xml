   <p>Revolutionary forces are at work in the midst of the social world....This is the result of the capitalistic crisis. We can understand this only if we look at the facts of industrial revolution. Changes have occurred in the fields of industry and agriculture. Not only machinery is responsible for this. Production, compared to pre-war conditions, grew even without technical aid. Capitalism increased work tempo to the maximum without outside help. We cite a few facts: In 1914, nine bakers working eight hours a day baked 3060 loaves of bread, or 340 loaves each. In 1927, nine bakers in a seven-hour working day baked 3570 loaves of bread, or 396.6 loaves each. Production increased 33 per cent without mechanical aid.....</p>
   <p>High-speed production machinery was replaced by machinery of even higher speed. Light machinery was made even lighter. Semi-automatic machines were improved <pb facs="5422061_1_0423.jpg" n="2"/>and became wholly automatic. Obsolete machinery was disposed of as junk. The goal: exploitation of the worker to the fullest extent, murderous work tempo, the reduction of labor's importance in production and the increase of machinery's importance.....</p>
   <p>Agriculture is not entirely untouched by the industrial revolution. The creations of the machine industry have changed agricultural production also. One of the most wonderful inventions is the harvesting-threshing machines.....It does the work of three hundred men.....</p>
   <p>These facts speak for themselves. This is a real revolution.....This revolution can't be suppressed by sword, bayonet, armored trucks, or imprisonment. The destruction of machinery is also futile....</p>
   <p>The capitalistic production method at its peak appears to be without reason. While on one hand it utilizes man-power to the utmost, on the other hand it <pb facs="5422061_1_0424.jpg" n="3"/>can't employ millions of idle people. While it fills its warehouses speedily with its mass production, millions can't buy the most necessary industrial or agricultural products. On one side it amasses everything that man's creative power made possible, and on the other it allows the army of those who are condemned to death by starvation to become bigger day by day.....</p>
   <p>There is no other solution than the rationalization of production and the equal distribution of that production. Sane production can be arrived at only on a Socialist basis.....This method is the best for the interests of humanity..... The industrial revolution may yet be the beginning of a new era.....It is worth while for the workers to struggle toward this end.</p>
