   <p>(The publishers of the Magyar Tribune do not accept responsibility for this article.)</p>
   <p>Attention, Chicago Hungarians! The Hungarian members of the I. W. W. (Industrial Workers of the World) and the United Protective League presented a moving picture on October 16 of the revolution in Hungary. The great number of spectators watched the performance with undivided attention.....</p>
   <p>Slight changes were made in the advertised program. The so-called Chicago Hungarian (Workers') Communist Choral Society notified us a few days before the presentation that they would not appear on the program. They stated.... that they did not desire to apper at a benefit performance for the aid of the victims of class war. This decision deprives them of the right to be <pb facs="5422061_1_0431.jpg" n="2"/>called workers. They disowned the victims of class war and for this act of Judas, we disown them. The Industrial Workers of the World and the Hungarian members of the Protective League have decided to boycott the Chicago Hungarian Workers' Choral Society and at the same time ask all respectable Hungarian organizations to aid us in this boycott.....</p>
   <p>Instead of the advertised Hungarian chorus, the Finnish I. W. W. Chorus sang on the program.</p>
   <p>The historical film of the Hungarian revolution was not in the best condition. In the past eleven years (since the Hungarian revolution) it dried out and parts had to be cut out, but this circumstance did not alter the continuity of the film.....</p>
   <p>After the showing of the film, Sandor Vincze stepped on to the stage and <pb facs="5422061_1_0432.jpg" n="3"/>explained to the audience that the communists tried for weeks to stop the presentation of the film. Great disorder met his assertion, caused by communists among the audience....Someone, probably one of the communists, called in the police, who threw out the disorderly ones...</p>
   <p>We have a few words to say to Chicago Hungarians and especially to those who witnessed the scandalous disorder. The management did everything in their power to make this film performance successful, so that in this way (by the proceeds) the victims of class war may be aided. Before knowing that the communists would turn against us, a committee was sent out to ask their co-operation which they refused.....They knew that by their subversive activities they would ruin the performance. It is a terrible thing when workers turn against workers and take the bread out of the mouths of the victims of class war. Today, when millions are out of work and are hungry, these wolves in communist clothing turn on them.....</p>
