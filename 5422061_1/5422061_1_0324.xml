   <p>The editorial staff of this newspaper can never be accused of siding with the big capitalists, nor can we be charged with ever asking them for help of any kind.</p>
   <p>We have always claimed that the big capitalists, whether they were industrialists, manufacturers, or landowners, could be of service to mankind only if they paid their workers a living wage, or a wage that would provide the worker with the same luxuries possessed by the capitalists themselves.</p>
   <p>As long as the capitalistic system is in existence, the worker will never <pb facs="5422061_1_0325.jpg" n="2"/>receive the full amount that he has earned for the capitalists. Even when industry slows down and people are out of work, nothing is done by the capitalists to provide a living for the unfortunate. In our estimation, the least they could do would be to set aside, for just such emergencies, a part of the enormous profits that they make.</p>
   <p>If we compare the European, especially the Hungarian, capitalists with the American capitalists, we find a great deal of difference. In Hungary, the priests, the aristocrats, and the gentry never try to aid the poor in any way; even when they [the priests, etc.] die, they do not leave any part of their fortune to public institutions so that the general public might benefit therefrom. Every once in a while, it happens that a sum of money is left to a school for tuition purposes, but if this does occur, the only ones that benefit from these funds are those who are related to the donor.</p>
   <p>In America, if a person becomes wealthy, he tries to do something to benefit <pb facs="5422061_1_0326.jpg" n="3"/>everyone. Regardless of what motives induce him to donate a part of his fortune to the public, the donor realizes that some part of his fortune belongs to those people that helped him acquire his great wealth. He knows that his success is largely due to the support of the public.</p>
   <p>There are wealthier men in the United States than Julius Rosenwald, but there are very few that have donated as much money for the public welfare as he has. The donations by Rosenwald amount to millions [of dollars], and when he contributes a sum, he makes no distinction regarding race, color, creed, or nationality.</p>
   <p>He has made many notable donations, but we think that his latest is the best. We know that other nationalities will derive as much benefit from it as the American people. Julius Rosenwald has contributed the sum of three million dollars toward the rebuilding of the Fine Arts building in Jackson Park. The <pb facs="5422061_1_0327.jpg" n="4"/>three million dollars is to be used to establish an industrial museum in the Fine Arts building.</p>
   <p>This museum is of interest to all. But we Hungarian-Americans should be especially interested in it because most of our people are engaged in industry here in this country. The museum will be of special interest to the young people because the sight of these miniature machines in operation will develop many inventive geniuses. At the same time, the exhibits will be an educational topic of conversation.</p>
   <p>The idea of this industrial museum was born to him while he was traveling in Hungary, when he and his little son visited an industrial museum in Becs, Hungary. As he was about to leave the museum, his son became so interested in the different mechanical exhibits that he [Rosenwald] had to take the youngster back several times before the latter would consent to visit other places. Rosenwald decided that a museum such as this would be interesting to young and old alike, and so we in Chicago are fortunate.</p>
