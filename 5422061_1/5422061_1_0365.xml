   <p>p.1. The flowers are still blooming and the poor can bask in the sunshine, but the coming cold winter is heralded by winds and makes our thoughts turn to the future. This future does not promise anything good. Nobody believes in the fairy story of "prosperity is just around the corner"; but for years the public labored under this delusion. Social organizations are now debating the advisability of giving at least crumbs to the army of unemployed, if it is not possible to give them a whole loaf of bread.</p>
   <p>To us in America it is of no solace to know that in Europe conditions are still worse. That we are living in the world's richest country does not appease our hunger. A slice of bread in Europe may be smaller, but more proportionate and the government takes care of its citizens and does not let them starve.</p>
   <p>In the United States charity is practiced by private organizations and social institutions. The best known charity organization is the Community Chest, kept up by public contributions.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0366.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Federal government at the suggestion of President Hoover is still hesitating to give official relief. More and more congressmen and senators have raised their voices in the matter. Dr. Wm. I. Snovich, Democratic congressman, who is an Hungarian by birth has recently asked Congress for aid for seven million unemployed.</p>
   <p>We consider it very important that Chicago Hungarian organizations follow the American organizations' example and unite in a charity drive. It is a well-known fact that the foreigners are the less favored ones in receiving aid from public charities.</p>
   <p>The Saint Stephen Society has recognized the urgent need of the people and has already arranged a benefit affair for the aid of the unemployed. We have heard that the Burnside Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Hungary is also contemplating a benefit party. Their efforts deserve our commendation, but we think that individual attempts at alleviating the suffering are futile. The only way to help our needy countrymen is to unite all Chicago Hungarian organizations in this effort.</p>
