   <p>Around election time the newspapers and the air too, is filled with the promises which emanate from the different platforms, rostrums, and soap-boxes, in which the aspirants promise to do everything in the interest of the electors in case they be elected.</p>
   <p>It seems the average American will always swallow this nonsense, without giving proper thought, even if the same candidate gave proof of it, that he never kept his promises once he was elected. And the newspapers will bring the photograph of the candidates usually shown in fighting pose, with fist clinched for boxing, even if the stature is such that the onlooker would rightly think a child could lick him in a real fight.</p>
   <p>After the candidates are elected, the greater number of them entirely forget their promises, which after all is not to be wondered at as they have to try to get <pb facs="5422061_1_0604.jpg" n="2"/>money for expenses and to save enough money for the next election campaign.</p>
   <p>The public's money becomes something of a free loot, only those leave it alone, who do not want to take it and those are mighty few. Almost every day we read that this or that public official did embezzle so and so much money, or let himself be bribed, but we can very seldom read something about some such unfaithful official having been punished.</p>
   <p>It is still in vivid remembrance the Whooppe-era of the Sanitary District which stole out of the taxpayers pockets more than ten million dollars. After that Sweitzer went with about half a million, and so forth. In the last few weeks the newspapers did not lack material in publishing new scandals. </p>
   <p>In Springfield the two factions of the Democratic party came to a battle in which one representative struck the fac of another representative on the premises of the Assembly House. The fight broke out about F. Lynden Smith, who in the election campaign was the campaign manager of Gov. Horner, and for these services was now awarded a job as Chief of State Public Works with a pay of $7,000.00 annually. He <pb facs="5422061_1_0605.jpg" n="3"/>spoke somehow unkindly about theoverlord of the other faction, Patrick J. Nash. Now the accusation was made that Smith rented an apartment, and that instead of paying the usual monthly $125.00 rent, he pays only fifty, and for the balance he secured a state job for Lawrence Koehn the son of the landlord, which job pays $125.00 monthly and that this Lawrence Koehn still is holding that state job.</p>
   <p>In the State Senate the motion of Gov. Horner for a drivers-license law, fell through. The whole thing is only a camouflage by which new jobs would be created and it is only the question of who should have the right to dispose of these jobs which started the quarrel and which caused the motion to fall through.</p>
   <p>In the case of Zintak, a juror testified that a federal official by the name of McKinley had promised him a position with a salary of $10,000.00 if he would mend the Zintak jury undecided, which this juror succeeded in doing. When it came to the fullfillment of the given promise, McKinley offered him only $25.00 in cash, instead of the $10,000.00 job. So the juror sued McKinley and the jury declared him not guilty, but now the judge ordered the state attorney to prosecute the ex-juror for perjury.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0606.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Malone, Chairman of the Illinois Tax Commission is now under inquiry, to show how he came in possession of his $700,000.00 cash money.</p>
   <p>In Joliet a politician had quite a number of slot-machines all over the town which brought him a considerable income. As the operation of slot-machines is against the law, the police started to raid those places, where they were operating. Now a bosom-friend of the above politician, Judge Wilson issued an injunction, in which he forbids the police to interfere with the operation of the slot-machines, in other words it did not allow the police to do its duty prescribed by law. At the sight of such gross lawlessness some of the more conscientious members of the legislature asked for impeachment of Judge Wilson, but the House on the proposition of Repr. Frank Ryan from Chicago, voted 63:61 against the starting of the inquiry and there will be no impeachment process against Judge Wilson.</p>
   <p>It would be well to remember these facts at the next election.</p>
