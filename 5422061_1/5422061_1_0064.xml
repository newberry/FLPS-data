   <p>p.3.... This fall the schools of Chicago will be open again to those who wish to educate themselves further. There is no country which offers more opportunity for education to the population than America and especially the city of Chicago. Aside from the day classes where six or seven hundred thousand children are being educated,evening classes for adults are conducted so that they may have the chance to learn what they may have missed in their childhood. These classes are especially helpful to those of our countrymen who have not been in this country long. They can learn the language and customs of their newly adopted country.</p>
   <p>The 1924-1925 classes are divided into two courses. The fall course of twelve weeks begins September 12 and closes December 4. The winter course begins January 5 and ends March 12.</p>
   <p>You can register for these evening classes in schools all over Chicago.</p>

   <p>Further information may be had in our editorial offices.</p>
   <p>We are calling the attention of those people to these classes, who are preparing themselves to become naturalized citizens of the United States. The teachers at these evening schools will be able to give them timely coaching.</p>
