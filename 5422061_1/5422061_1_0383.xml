   <p>We think with horror of the Black Plague that swept over Europe and took two hundred thousand victims. Worse than any epidemic, the World War destroyed millions of civilized people--yet, the danger of the world economic crisis surpasses even the horrors of the World War. The number of people supported by charity--not because they are infirm in any way but because they are unemployed--reached the staggering number of fifty million in civilized countries. Fifty million persons who would like to work but cannot find employment are compelled to beg. What will the outcome of this be? In a year, if conditions do not improve, the number of unemployed may reach one hundred million, and many who are aiding others today will be beggars tomorrow. After the World War each nation tried to place the blame for the war on some other nation. Today, when no war threatens the world, no one brings up the question of who is responsible for the world economic crisis.</p>

   <p>In the eyes of the public, overproduction is the cause of the world economic crisis.....</p>
   <p>But doesn't it occur to anyone to ask that if the world economic crisis is a result of overproduction, who brought about overproduction?</p>
   <p>Shouldn't those persons be put on trial who for ten years loudly advocated mass production as beneficial to mankind?</p>
   <p>In spite of the fact that lack of balance between production and consumption may mean catastrophe, leading statesmen--the German Rathenau, the Frenchman Millerand, and our own Hoover--said that production must be increased.....</p>
   <p>It must be admitted and never forgotten that just as cold can only be counteracted with heat, so overproduction can only be balanced by increased consumption. The sooner this is clear to our statesmen, the sooner the number of unemployed will diminish. The country that realizes this the soonest will be the first one to recuperate.</p>
