   <p>The story of Chicago Hungarians has found a place in American literature. Edna Ferber, a very popular American author, has chosen a few interesting Hungarians as characters [in her stories].</p>
   <p>A new book was published this season by this author, the title of which is Mother Knows Best. In this book of short stories, the story entitled "Consider the Lilies" deals with the Hungarians of Chicago.</p>
   <p>She selects her characters from the neighborhood of Clybourn Avenue, Halsted Street, and North Avenue, Later, she moves them to Burnside. The action in the story is slight, because Edna Ferber is not concerned with <pb facs="5422061_1_0241.jpg" n="2"/>dramatic moments, but captivates her readers, the American public, with her colorful, spontaneous style.</p>
   <p>Her short story contains a few episodes that are typically Hungarian. They are not very thrilling, but neither is the life of Hungarians in Chicago. We were interested primarily in the personalities and circumstances of our entry into the realm of American literature.</p>
   <p>And these were dealt with fairly honestly. The truth, even though it is unpleasant to hear, is palatable because it is the truth. We know well that the Hungarians of Chicago dance and make merry on the corner of Halsted Street and North Avenue, and this is where the Hungarian girl of gypsy blood and "Antal Sebok," the leading characters of the story, get acquainted. This is not the phantasy of the author. Edna Ferber writes the truth.</p>
   <p>The main social event of the Chicago Hungarians is usually a dance in season. We are aware of this and so are the Americans. In Budapest, we can brag <pb facs="5422061_1_0242.jpg" n="3"/>about our cultural superiority, much to the disgust of the Balkan nations, because there is sufficient ground for it. But here in Chicago we cannot boast, because without the support of famous names from across the ocean such boasting sounds fantastic.....</p>
   <p>Those Hungarians who are members of church or other organized social groups should find a solution for the cultural needs of our countrymen.</p>
   <p>Naturally there are doubting Thomases who say that the majority of the Hungarians in America have no cultural needs. If there is any basis to this serious accusation, the responsibility rests, not with the poor, uneducated workers, but with those who call themselves the leaders of American-Hungarians..... These educated Hungarians, who, through schooling, have outgrown the general run of our compatriots, are the ones who should start an educational campaign.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0243.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The tragedy of the American-Hungarians is that the masses are at a low intellectual level. It is futile to say at this date that the feudal system of Hungary is responsible for this condition. At best this will ease our consciences only temporarily. There is only one way to correct matters. We have to lift them the Hungarian-Americans] out of the mire of ignorance with the implements of education.</p>
   <p>The cultured Hungarians must not continue in the false idea of feudal countries that knowledge is sinful.</p>
   <p>There should be a general movement in our public life to educate our ambitious but ignorant brethren. If this will be done, then Edna Ferber and other American authors will not write of the barren spiritual life, of auto rides and dancing, when they wish to portray the lives of Chicago Hungarians to their readers.</p>
