   <p>They used to say that there are as many forms of anarchy as there are anarchists. In other words anarchy is interpreted differently throughout the world. [Eventually a great struggle will revolve around the interpretation of this word.]</p>
   <p>But this fact is true of every organization that has principles and ideals. Naturally these are seen only by those who are within the organization; we who are not acquainted with the situation are not aware of them. Democracy is a question which offers a fertile field for [arguments pro and con].</p>
   <p>America is known as the nation of political democracy. Democracy in the United States is a reflection [of the political life of the people]. We wonder sometimes how many people [understand the democratic concept].</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0455.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>How many people really know its true value, how many know its meaning, and understand the principles of democracy?</p>
   <p>There are many people who are or call themselves democrats, but in reality are afraid of democracy. Why? Because they believe their cultural activities cannot find a satisfactory outlet within the realms of a democracy. They [believe that the principles of democracy] are raw and undeveloped [and that life under such a system is difficult].</p>
   <p>Are these people right?</p>
   <p>No, they are not right, because democracy's most sacred principle is the cultural development of the people in order that they may govern themselves.</p>
   <p>This concept of democracy leads us to the belief that the [destiny] of man is not an illusion or a dream, but is a reality, or at least a potential reality. [Therefore the true democrat believes that love for <pb facs="5422061_1_0456.jpg" n="3"/>mankind is not an illusion, but a profound conviction]. This is the well into which our humanitarian apostles have dipped--those of Greece and Rome, those of the middle ages, as well as those of more recent times, Jefferson and Lincoln.</p>
   <p>We can't be democratic [simply by intellectual conviction].</p>
   <p>Democracy is a practical philosophy because it recognizes the value and rights of everyone.</p>
   <p>Those people who [quarrel about]democracy either do not know this, or else their own philosophy of life [rejects this principle]. Is this important? Will it hurt the sun if the blind deny the fact that it is shining?</p>
   <p>Democracy throughout the world [favors no class]and this is [the explanation <pb facs="5422061_1_0457.jpg" n="4"/>for the struggle against feudalism in seventeenth-century England where class lines were sharply drawn--a struggle which resulted in the granting of]political freedom. This movement had something to do with democracy although it was far removed.</p>
   <p>This explains the fact that some people may be politically democratic [although disagreeing with the basic principles]of democracy. The only person who is a true democrat is he who feels co-operatively toward his fellow man. This is the explanation for our statement: "We can't be democratic simply by intellectual conviction." We must listen to our hearts, [to the emotions which arise therefrom and determine our attitudes] towards those things that are good and fine in our fellow man. We can't be democratic according to a prescribed program.</p>
   <p>The character of a man is not decided by his attire. This applies to democracy as well, it is not the people who are connected with it or economic conditions, which necessitates the democratic system--it is the <pb facs="5422061_1_0458.jpg" n="5"/>collective feeling [of all]which with the support of democracy's strength gives humanity something worth living for.</p>
