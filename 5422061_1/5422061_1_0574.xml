   <p>The results of the primaries were surprising to those who doubted Big Bill Thompson's popularity, and prophesied that Litsinger would be nominated for mayor on the Republican ticket.</p>
   <p>The primaries proved that the wish of the people was to see Thompson in the mayor's chair and that is the reason he received such a tremendous majority of the votes.</p>
   <p>In spite of the underhanded methods of Thompson's enemies and in spite of the stand of the American newspapers that favored Litsinger, he carried all the wards except one (49)--which gave him a 180,039 majority over his opponent.</p>
   <p>This election offers a lesson to the American politicians, and that is that the foreign-born American citizens have a decisive influence on the outcome of <pb facs="5422061_1_0575.jpg" n="2"/>elections, and if a politician wants results, he has to take this into consideration.</p>
   <p>The great majority of votes for Thompson in the primaries, leads one to conjecture that he will emerge victorious in the regular April election for mayor of Chicago.</p>
