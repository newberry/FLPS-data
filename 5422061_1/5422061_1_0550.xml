   </div>

  <body>
   <p>There will be a great political fight this Spring and Fall because the State, County and City elections are coming up.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian-American citizens do not want to lose the opportunity to aid the election of the man of their choice.</p>
   <p>Therefore, we can mention the factors necessary for starting a political organization.</p>
   <p>We know that the Hungarian-American citizens have favored the Democratic party.</p>
   <p>It was back in 1905 that there was an organization under the title of <pb facs="5422061_1_0551.jpg" n="2"/>"The Hungarian-American Democracy," which society was granted a charter. It was in this organization that the Chicago Hungarian-Americans gained recognition as Democrats.</p>
   <p>The organizing committee consists of such prominent men as Joseph Fekete, prominent Hungarian lawyer, Dr. Ernest Lovenger, and Louis Zidrou.</p>
   <p>This organization intends to take an active part in the present primary elections, but it is more important to become organized and take active interest in the Fall elections. By doing this, this organization can develope into an organization of influence keeping future elections in mind.</p>
   <p>The main objective of this organization will be to familiarize the <pb facs="5422061_1_0552.jpg" n="3"/>Hungarian-American citizens with their rights as citizens of this country, in order that these people may be able to take part in the political history of this country.</p>
   <p>It would be a great achievement to see the Hungarians go to the polls to vote in great masses. They should take a big part in the decision of important questions which would be in the interest of their fellow American citizens, as well as in the interest of the country from which we came.</p>
