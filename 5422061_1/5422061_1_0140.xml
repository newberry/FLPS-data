   <p>The St. Peter and St. Paul Hungarian Greek Catholic Church of Chicago has decided to take some definite and serious steps. The members of the congregation have finally decided that their wants must be satisfied. They have decided to build their own church, where they can pray in their own tongue and glorify God in their own way.</p>
   <p>A great deal of credit is due the following people: Rev. Joseph Feczko, Andrew Tanci, Andrew Lukacs, Joseph Dobay, Charles Jeney, Mike Punyko, Stephen Szilvagyi, John Zelenak, Mike Danko, Antone Koleszar, Stephen Kis, Joseph Polyak, George Kovacs, and Mrs. Joseph Zelenak; these people have worked tirelessly to make the building of this church possible.</p>
   <p>The South Side Hungarians can be mighty proud of themselves, because they are continually bringing respect and recognition upon themselves in the eyes <pb facs="5422061_1_0141.jpg" n="2"/>of the other national groups.</p>
   <p>Joseph Kocsis, well-known Hungarian contractor, was selected to erect the church building. Joseph Kocsis is really deserving of this honor because he has taken a very active part in all church and society affairs.</p>
   <p>This church will not only be a big [boost to] the name of the Chicago Hungarians, but it will mean that the Hungarians of the South Side will be active in promoting cultural activities.</p>
   <p>The plans were drawn up by Ignatz Izsak.</p>
   <p>We urge all Hungarians to co-operate, and to contribute to the fund, in order that the South Side Hungarians may add another feather of glory to their hats.</p>
