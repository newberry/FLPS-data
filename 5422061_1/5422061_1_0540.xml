   <p>The Cook County Hungarian Republican Club gave a luncheon last Saturday noon in honor of Mayor Thompson. This luncheon took place at the Hungarian Cafe which is managed and owned by Alex Schwartz. That Mayor Thompson is a well-liked and popular man among the Hungarian people was proven by the fact that the Cafe was packed with Hungarian people.</p>
   <p>Before the guest of honor arrived there were many short speeches from other Republican candidates.</p>
   <p>After these political speeches there followed a Hungarian-American concert and song program. The American part of the program was directed by Mr. Weil of the Herald and Examiner radio station, and the Hungarian part of program was handled by Stephen Toth, who presented the Hungarian opera singers, Mary Kondor and Elizabeth Biro. The audience was overwhelmed with <pb facs="5422061_1_0541.jpg" n="2"/>the operatic and folk songs that were sung by these two outstanding Hungarian singers.</p>
   <p>After the musical part of the program Mayor Thompson took the floor and in a three-quarter hour speech made it very clear that the Hungarian people had played a very important part in the development of Chicago in the past seventy-five years.</p>
   <p>After this very notable speech by the Mayor, Ignac Izsak read a letter which was sent to him by Frank L. Smith, the Republican Senatorial candidate. Smith said that if he were elected he would do everything in his power to put the Hungarian name in the limelight.</p>
