   <p>The question of who shall be Mayor is a question which interests Chicago's young and old alike.</p>
   <p>This is the question which prompted Chicago's Hungarian citizens to confer with their ward committeemen and to decide unanimously that they will endorse William Hale Thompson for Mayor. They concluded that Thompson is the best qualified of all contenders for the mayoralty of this metropolis of three and a half million population.</p>
   <p>Thompson proved his fitness for this high position during his four years in office.....</p>
   <p>His present program includes providing work opportunities. This is of interest to our Hungarian workers. In addition, Thompson is a good friend of the Hungarians. At the present time there are more Hungarian-American citizens on <pb facs="5422061_1_0487.jpg" n="2"/>the city pay roll than ever before.</p>
   <p>It was decided that there will be a Hungarian mass meeting at the Burnside Magyar Home.</p>
   <p>The 43rd Ward's Republican Club of the State of Illinois,which is going to give a big banquet for the needy families of the unemployed, will discuss the question of employment. All Hungarians will be invited.</p>
   <p>The primaries will be held on February 24, 1931. No Hungarian-American voter should forget to exercise his right to vote.</p>
