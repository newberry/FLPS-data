   <p>The problem of unemployment is causing much worry to federal and state governments. In view of the increasing number of the unemployed, the question arises: How will America take care of its impoverished, ragged, and physically and mentally exhausted army of unemployed that make up the bread lines?</p>
   <p>Since it is an undeniable fact that this so-called industrial depression found this country unprepared, the gigantic task of solving the problem of unemployment confronted the nation out of a clear sky. Even in normal times there is misery and poverty among some people of a great country, and there are many institutions and agencies which are busy taking care of these. However, the present crisis found social and governmental organizations totally unprepared to cope with the problem.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0381.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>America is beginning to realize the gravity of the situation and is trying to ease the misery with every method at its command.</p>
   <p>We will know how the government will co-operate when Congress convenes. Aside from proposals by President Hoover, there is Senator Wagner's plan, which calls for a public works program and also the founding of a prosperity fund.....</p>
   <p>In the state of Illinois, forty-five industrialists, bankers, and labor leaders formed a committee to work out a program whereby work would be insured to the unemployed for the duration of the winter. Shortening the working hours and the working week, as well as lowering food prices, was proposed.</p>
   <p>In view of the fact that in most instances the American citizen is given preference over the foreign-born in gaining employment or at public works, <pb facs="5422061_1_0382.jpg" n="3"/>the immigrants feel the weight of the industrial depression in even a greater degree. Many foreign-language organizations realized this and have tried to keep their unemployed members, but unfortunately few foreign-language organizations are in a postion to remedy the distress of the immigrants. The Foreign Language Information Service advises that the foreign-language organizations should work together hand in hand with American organizations. To this effect the F. L. I. S. sent out three hundred circular letters to foreign-language organizations, in which it asks for data about their financial status, methods, and possible co-operation with American organizations. The F. L. I. S. also wishes to ascertain the number of immigrants discharged from employment because of their nationality or lack of naturalization papers, and the number of unemployed members in each organization. By securing such data, the F. L. I. S. hopes to bring action in behalf of the foreign-speaking and foreign-born population.</p>
