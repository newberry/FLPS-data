  <body>
   <p>During the last few weeks we have been writing articles concerning starvation among Hungarians in Europe. We have tried to arouse the feeling of the Chicago-Hungarians in every way possible. We have employed all the editorial schemes a newspaper is permitted to use in order to picture the terrible conditions abroad, and have explained the methods to relieve the conditions. To a certain extent, we have been successful. We have heard from a number of patriotic Hungarians who are willing to do their part in this behalf. We are trying to organize a society that will be in harmony with and conform to its ideals as has been done in other cities. At this time we are about ready to launch such an organization. Information has come to us that even those Hungarians who are not numbered among our readers have advised us of their intention <pb facs="5422061_1_0305.jpg" n="2"/>to help feed the thousands of little children in Hungary in order that they may be saved. This fact has given us great encouragement. There is, however, one discouraging feature connected with this worthy movement. These prospective helpers will support our society providing we concede to some of their wishes. If they can be the leaders and we are the followers, if we are the contributors, and they are the donors, then all will be well. These people have been connected with organizations of this kind before, but this being a free and democratic country, and the majority of Hungarians being a democratic and freedom-loving people, such organizations have always failed.</p>
   <p>These self-styled leaders may think what ever they please of our group as a class. Today, this class is not a bunch of sheep following a bellwether. We are very particular whom we follow and whom we choose <pb facs="5422061_1_0306.jpg" n="3"/>to represent us, and, in our opinion, this class of people has always been the backbone of all Hungarian organizations.</p>
   <p>As we understand it, the heart of every Hungarian has been deeply touched by the plight of those starving Hungarian children, but his heart will respond only if he can be the collector, if he can be the leader, if he can be the boss, and we, the working Hungarians become the contributors, and his obedient servants.</p>
   <p>Let us say right here and now that we have no objections to the character, integrity and ability of Mr. Joseph Byfield and to his associates. They may be conscientious men. We are glad to have them associated with us and take an interest in the affairs of the Hungarian community. But we do <pb facs="5422061_1_0307.jpg" n="4"/>object to the un-American methods Mr. Byfield and his associates are using to obtain leadership and control of legitimate Hungarian movements in Chicago. We want to remind our readers that it was Mr. Byfield and his friends who took charge of The Hungarian Patriotic Association which, after operating a short time, was forced to disband. "Too many midwives, and the baby will die," says an old Hungarian proverb. There are no successful organizations in which everyone is a leader, but Mr. Byfield and his friends want to be nothing short of officials in all Hungarian movements. We sincerely admire their ambitions!</p>
   <p>It is quite an honor to be a leader of such a noble race as the Hungarians. We admire these men because they wish to be affiliated with our race, despite <pb facs="5422061_1_0308.jpg" n="5"/>the fact these men rank very high socially in American society. What hurts us is that when these distinguished Hungarian gentlemen become heads or are officers of our organizations, about 45,000 Hungarians in Chicago become estranged from that very movement. This is not our personal opinion, but are the facts obtained from past experiences which have led us to form this deplorable conclusion and honest conviction.</p>
   <p>Our interest in this movement, as well as in any Hungarian movement, which will benefit the Hungarians of Chicago, is impartial. We feel that it is our duty as public servants to voice our opinion against these cliques whose methods are of a disadvantage to Hungarian traditions and public life.</p>
   <p>We hope Mr. Byfield and his friends have the 100,000 distressed Hungarian children in mind rather than the publicity that they might get out of the <pb facs="5422061_1_0309.jpg" n="6"/>movement. We want them to be generous this time, not for our sake, not for the sake of democracy, but for the sake of the future Hungarian generation, whose fate rests with all of us.</p>
   <p>Let the Hungarian people of Chicago elect leaders whom they believe will lead them to the greatest success. We feel that the Chicago-Hungarians are intelligent enough to pick desirable and worthy men and women as their representatives.</p>
   <p>This has been done in all cities and localities where Hungarians live. If this is done the right way, the work and the responsibility is shouldered equally by all. We believe that every one is aware of the fact that we live in a democratic country, and so we want to follow the principles of <pb facs="5422061_1_0310.jpg" n="7"/>that form of government.</p>
   <p>We hope that no one is offended by this article, that is not our intention. We also hope that it will not close the pocketbooks of those who are willing and able to contribute towards this noble cause. We repeat, we are ready to support this movement with all our power, but we do not want to sacrifice the great principle for which we have been fighting so earnestly and that which almost upset the whole world in the past five years. That great principle is this; no one has a monopoly over the Hungarians. No one can dictate to us. The people have their rights and we are for the rights of the people.</p>
   <p>Let the people Rule!</p>
