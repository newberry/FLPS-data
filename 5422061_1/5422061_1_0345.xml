   <p>Dear Editor:</p>
   <p>Recently, your paper published an article regarding the Cooperative Society of America and its functions. In reply to this, I would like to make some additions.</p>
   <p>Since its organization two years ago, we have waged battles against price increases in such a manner as to make purchases directly from the growers. In this way, we avoided the profits of the middleman and other charges. Six thousand members with one hundred twenty-three businesses enjoy the better quality of goods at cheaper prices received through the society. After all, the consumers should be satisfied. The consumer is as much entitled to the savings as he is to quality.</p>
   <p>If all things, such as labor and taxes, are taken into consideration prices should be lower, because as allied growers, all their products are produced on their own grounds. As a matter of fact, the steel mills manufacture their <pb facs="5422061_1_0346.jpg" n="2"/>requirements on their own grounds, and they do not try to cut down taxes. They try to please the workers, and therefore, get better results.</p>
   <p>To help business conditions in Chicago, five million dollars was offered as a loan for building construction. Steps are being taken to accept this offer.</p>
   <p>In other words, the Society is always on the lookout to provide work and decent homes in Chicago. Action is most important, and not too much talk.</p>
   <p>If you wish to know of more details, Mr. Editor, or any reader, please forward your inquiries with complete confidence to the Foreign department, Room 928, Consumer's Building, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Respectfully yours,</p>
   <p>Nagy Lajos.</p>
