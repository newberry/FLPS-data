<title level="a">SUCCESSFUL PARADE IN BURNSIDE</title></bibl>

   <p>The Burnside Branch of the Magyar Republican Club of Illinois is taking active part in the present elections, especially the mayoralty campaign. We believe that the parade of February 19, sponsored by the club will never be forgotten by the Hungarian voters of Burnside. The parade was in honor of William Hale Thompson, mayor elect. More than thirty-eight automobiles, decorated with Thompson signs, filled with Hungarians, and a truck in which the Hungarian Brass Band rode, started the parade through the seventh, eighth, and tenth wards to the hall in South Chicago. Mr. E. Braun, committeeman, reserved 200 seats for the Hungarians, but they were not enough.</p>
   <p>Mr. William Hale Thompson was very favorably impressed when he was greeted by the beautiful music of the Hungarian Brass Band.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Thompson concluded his lengthy address, the chairman called upon <pb facs="5422061_1_0539.jpg" n="2"/>Kalman Balogh, president of the Burnside Branch to speak. In a few words he expressed the sentiments of the Hungarians regarding the mayoralty campaign.</p>
   <p>The Burnside Club is preparing for held work before the election of April 5, and we have heard that they will hold a mass meeting at the K. P. Hall in the near future, when Thompson is scheduled to be the principal speaker.</p>
