   <p>There is to be another Liberty Loan this Fall. Another test of the patriotism, thrift, and self-sacrificing qualities of the Hungarian-Americans. But is it fair to call it a test? Have not the Hungarian-Americans, during the months just gone by, since their entry into the War, demonstrated to all the world that they can deny themselves luxuries, forego comforts, and shoulder unwonted burdens in the cause of liberation?</p>
   <p>There may be some among us who are shortsighted, little realizing the magnitude of the task that lies ahead, who permit themselves to think, but they will not say that they are tired of loaning.</p>
   <p>But the mothers, wives, and sweethearts of America have not grown weary of giving up their men. Every day, from every port, sail regiments of men, who <pb facs="5422061_1_0693.jpg" n="2"/>are the gifts of American womanhood to the nation. Deep below the face of the earth, men are pitting their strength against the elements of nature in order to supply the Allies with coal and metal. There is no slackening there.</p>
   <p>In the shipyards, where the new armadas are being built, and a myriad of hammers are beating out a tune of death to the Germans, the workers there do not say that they are tired. Here, in the circle of the home, where every nationality has found opportunity and security, while the young men representing this country on the battlefields of France, are dying heroically for the ideal of international justice, there is not much talk of resting.</p>
   <p>The call of the Fourth Liberty Loan will upon the ears of one hundred ten million persons in the United States.</p>
   <p>From whatever land these millions hail, whatever traditions and usages may <pb facs="5422061_1_0694.jpg" n="3"/>have influenced them in the past, they all meet on common ground when they subscribe to the Fourth Liberty Loan, which is to be largest in the history of the country. The order of the day is economy, and the wise husbanding of resources.</p>
