   <p>Day after day, we read news of what is happening on the different battlefields of this great war. We have become so accustomed to these war items that we now regard them casually, without stopping to consider the millions of lives now involved in this War.</p>
   <p>We do not take this attitude of the War because our feeling or interest in civilization is dying, nor is it because we are not concerned with the outcome of the War. The outcome of the War does matter, as the fate of the suppressed nations depends on the outcome of this War.</p>
   <p>We do not think we are wrong in saying that this indifference is due to the fact that we can only read about it in the newspapers, and judge from what <pb facs="5422061_1_0696.jpg" n="2"/>they say about the War concerning the millions of men fighting each other, and the thousands dying daily. All we do is read about these things. We do not realize, nor are we able to see the horrors that exist on the battlefields. We can not hear the exploding cannons and shells, nor see the constant fire of machine guns, nor do we fear the attack of battleships.</p>
   <p>This is the reason why we talk so unconcernedly of War, this is the reason why we do not do anything to help end this great War. This is why we do not show more patriotism toward the country in which we live.</p>
   <p>The committee of Public Information, in conjunction with the State Council of Defense, has decided to show the people of the United States the horrors of War. To do this, they have decided to hold a gigantic Military Show in Grant Park from September 2 to September 15.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0697.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The committee of Public Information has extended invitations to all editors of foreign newspapers to attend a meeting to be held August 13. This newspaper was represented at this meeting by Mr. Martin Benedek, and the other Hungarian newspaper, The Figyelo, was represented by Mr. Stephen Fay.</p>
   <p>The editors of all the foreign newspapers received the idea very favorably. It looked as though all the nationalities had been planning for just such a thing. The Slavic editors had already designated the time for the exclusive use of their people.</p>
   <p>It is up to us now, Chicago-Hungarians. We must not get lost behind the rest of the nationalities. We must not bring shame on the Hungarian name. We are Americans also, and good loyal Americans. It is for our own good that we take part in this affair just as all the other nationalities have done.</p>
