  <body>
   <p>We have received many letters from our readers, commenting unfavorably on the article, which appeared in Jeno Endrey's little newspaper on October 15.</p>
   <p>At first we intended to ignore this article of reactionary propaganda in view of its unimportant origin. But it seems that the seeds we have sown nine years ago among Chicago Hungarians have grown to greater proportions than we realized.</p>
   <p>The slightest malicious reactionary Hungarian propaganda stirs thousands of Chicago Hungarians to action against the spreaders.</p>
   <p>It is needless to say that we are happy in the knowledge that there are <pb facs="5422061_1_0236.jpg" n="2"/>others among the Hungarians of Chicago, besides us, who follow events attentively. Therefore, it is not an easy matter to contaminate their souls.</p>
   <p>The writer of the article, whose name has not been made public, although everybody knows his identity, is not a responsible individual, and for that reason we do not think it worth while to refute certain details.</p>
   <p>We would not believe him on oath, let alone give credence to his views and opinion.</p>
   <p>It would be different if we were confronted by a worthy opponent.</p>
   <p>Not wishing to make the same mistakes as the "awakened" Hungarians, we will consider Jeno Endrey, actor and theatrical director, separately from Endrey, the left-handed editor.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0237.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The artist may be excellent as an artist, even though his political views may be in error, his religion not in order [Translator's note:-- When one's religion is Jewish, the Hungarians say it is not in order], his character wavering, and his word unreliable.</p>
   <p>Jeno Endrey, as actor and director, is sympathetic, energetic, talented, and full of ambition. He deserves our support, because in these adverse times he is doing his best.</p>
   <p>We hope that the Hungarians of Chicago will be able to differentiate the actor from the editor.</p>
   <p>It is even more important to do this now, because there will be keen competition in the theatrical field this season. We hope that the competitive spirit will bring better productions by all the companies and won't take the form of belittling and political wrangling.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0238.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>It should be borne in mind that we do not support the Hungarian theaters because the actors must eat, but because they amuse, educate, and keep alive Hungarian culture.</p>
   <p>As long as the theater is free of political partisanship, it is needless and perhaps destructive to air the political views of the audience in connection with it.</p>
   <p>We must all admit that while the majority of Chicago Hungarians are against reactionary politics, there are some conservative, impartial Hungarians. It is wisest, therefore, to separate the Hungarian theater, the home of culture, from politics.</p>
   <p>We hope that the actors, too, will abstain from discussions.</p>
   <p>Our readers may rest assured that we are true to our convictions.....</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0239.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>We are not hesitating, bargaining, or retreating. From time to time we may change our tactics, methods, or means, but our aim is unchangeable. We strive to give support to the weak, fight for the rights of the Hungarians of Chicago, attack reactionary movements, and bring about the progress and enlightenment of our countrymen.</p>
