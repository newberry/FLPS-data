   <p>America is truly the rich land that one reads about in fairy tales, which is thought of in Europe as a land of milk and honey, and we are proud to admit the realities of the riches of this land.</p>
   <p>Is there any wonder that everyone who now lives in broken down Europe, exerts every effort to come to these United States?</p>
   <p>Nothing should surprise us now, since an unfortunate law was enacted closing the doors of the United States to millions of starving people. These people of Europe will use every method, regardless of the law, to gain admittance to the "Promised Land," the United States.</p>
   <p>Naturally everyone will attempt to come here in accordance with the circumstance he or she might be involved in. All feel that they are trading starvation, unemployment, and oppression, for life-giving independence and a right to live.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0756.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These people feel that they can secure this, one way or the other.</p>
   <p>What will the price be?</p>
   <p>Of late two very sorrowful facts shed light on this subject when someone speaks of the alarmed parents, and how they can help themselves, as well as give help to their children.</p>
   <p>One sorrowful fact is that the alarmed parents here in rich America are offering their children for sale, and many of these children have been sold in order to insure a future for the child in the hands of people who are better financially fixed than they are. The other fact is that they will relieve themselves of financial responsibility for the time being at least.</p>
   <p>The psychologist might look for other motives but we doubt whether he will find any, or try to offer an explanation for this terrible situation by tracing back to find out what leads up to this horrible situation that exists in modern civilization. Regardless what their explanation is, it will be wrong.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0757.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>This situation is not brought about by natural causes, but by an empty stomach, and especially where children are involved.</p>
   <p>Parents such as those mentioned above, should be, or are branded and condemned as incompetent parents, but at the same time they should be pitied.</p>
   <p>The people who do such pitiful things, certainly have no outlook for the future, or else they would find some other means by which they could solve this problem. This is absolutely the last straw for which the parent can reach in order to save the child from starvation and other hardships, but while the parents are doing this, they are also profiting themselves with the money received from the sale.</p>
   <p>Wealth!</p>
   <p>A nation with a hundred million (Sic) and wealth without limit.</p>
   <p>The bank of the world literally throwing its money away in order to take advantage of a less fortunate nation, and then later collecting interest on its investment, <pb facs="5422061_1_0758.jpg" n="4"/>thereby not only creating a vast amount of wealth, but also engendering a great amount of jealousy in the hearts of other nations.</p>
   <p>These riches are used only for the accumulation of more wealth.</p>
   <p>No one seems to care how the children of this country might be saved from the hardships they are suffering, because the parent who sold the child was supposed to be able to take care of his children; at least that is what society claims. He was supposed to rear this child so that in later life, it would become a good citizen of that nation which has such a great amount of wealth, but whose wealth is not used for lightening the burdens of poverty and suffering among the youth of the coming generations. This wealth is not used for the purpose of relieving those parents who bring children into this world and make good citizens for this nation.</p>
