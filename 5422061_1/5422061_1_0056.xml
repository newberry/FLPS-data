   <p>One of the essential and vital requirements of our Hungarian church and social life is the education of our youth and children. Until now only the Hungarian churches felt it their duty to instruct the second generation in the ways of their fathers, even though we all know that the future of Hungarian organizations depends upon such activity.</p>
   <p>Our churches and their pastors are the only elements in our Hungarian circle, who toil so tirelessly and unselfishly to create a future public for the Hungarian theater, members for the fraternal organizations and readers for the Hungarian newspapers. Without their work, Hungarian activities would have been doomed to extinction long ago. And, because we know this to be true, we are exerting our efforts to continue this educational program.</p>

   <p>The Chicago Burnside Hungarian Reformed church will again open its summer classes in Chicago and West Pullman. In both places registration begins on July 5. Hours in Burnside are from nine until noon, and in West Pullman, from one until three thirty. Children of members of the church will pay no tuition, only the cost of books and school supplies. Children, whose parents are not members, will pay two dollars for the term.</p>
