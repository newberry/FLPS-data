   <p>A decision is up before the congress of the United States with regards to entering the war. This decision is giving the German people of this country considerable worry and this situation has also caused the Hungarian people to be worried to some extent. Since this country broke relationship with Germany, the German people in a couple of cities in the United States have become worried, and have taken all their savings out of the bank.</p>
   <p>Therefore the President of the United States has seen fit to make an announcement, that even if this country does go to war with a foreign power, the wealth of foreigners in this country will be safe.</p>
   <p>The President of the United States has learned that there has been a rumor among the foreign population of the United States that if war breaks out with any <pb facs="5422061_1_0723.jpg" n="2"/>particular nation, the people of that nation living in this country will have their property and savings in the banks confiscated by the government. Therefore the President has authorized the Secretary of State to make an announcement that these rumors are false and that there is no cause for the people to worry.</p>
   <p>The government of the United States under no circumstances will use the war situation as a reason for confiscating wealth in this country. The government will protect foreign property in this country just as it will protect the property of the citizens of this country.</p>
   <p>This means that property and bank savings of Hungarians living in the United States are and will be just as safe in time of war as they were in time of peace.</p>
   <p>This announcement will cause a better feeling towards the government by both the citizens of this country and non citizens.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0724.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We ask that you do not listen to anyone, who is spreading fear and dissatisfaction. No one should rush the banks or leave his present place of employment.</p>
   <p>No one should get excited over the present situation and everyone must feel that the situation will be cleared up to the satisfaction of everyone.</p>
