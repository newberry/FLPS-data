   <p>For the past few weeks, one of our newspapers, printed in Hungarian, but directed by the Kremlin, in Soviet Russia, has been publishing articles spurring the Hungarians to unite in one front.</p>
   <p>The often repeated call for unity comes from that group which has no sincere purpose or intention towards the people of the Royal Hungarian crown.</p>
   <p>It has made us wonder why they are opening their arms so suddenly <pb facs="5422061_1_0410.jpg" n="2"/>for the Hungarian embrace.</p>
   <p>At the Hungarian Day celebration at the World's Fair, it was evident that the communists do not wish to unite, but on the contrary, they wish to disrupt the existing tranquility among our people.</p>
   <p>Last year our countrymen refused to allow these malcontents to take an active part in the leadership of the Hungarian Day celebration.</p>
   <p>They are again trying their successful method of "boring from within." Their vanity has suffered because of their unsuccessful attempts last year, and now they are trying to paint their bruises <pb facs="5422061_1_0411.jpg" n="3"/>with a national color.</p>
   <p>They are very crafty in their newspaper writings, but their intent is very apparent.</p>
   <p>Will there be a Hungarian Day this year at the World's Fair? We do not know yet. We do not know who the leaders will be, or if there will be any. However, we will be on the lookout to see that those persons who are too friendly with our enemies will not be among them.</p>
