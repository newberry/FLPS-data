   <p>Last Sunday the Hungarian Cultural and Singing Club presented an operetta before a full house. Not so long ago, Laci Racz, too [with his Gypsy Band], gave a concert before a large crowd--all of which goes to show that the Hungarians like the theater and can afford to have it regardless of the depression.</p>
   <p>We are not discussing the performance here--that has already been done elsewhere in this issue. We just want to point out that there seems to be some improvement along the whole line [of our economic life]. It would hurt nobody if, instead of complaining, we would be willing to admit that the situation already shows signs of recovery. Business is better, earnings are rising, and we can afford more for everything. The theater is the best barometer in this regard. If playhouses are full, it means that the people have more <pb facs="5422061_1_0137.jpg" n="2"/>money. Just look at the large American movies and other shows--one can hardly find a vacant seat in them. If the Americanswould abandon their continuous complaining and would rather rejoice at the fact that everything is all right, their attitude would in turn spread to other nations, putting an end to this whining epidemic, which eats the body even long after the disease is gone.</p>
   <p>True, it feels good to complain, but please let us quit this accursed habit of whining and sighing, and start enjoying the things Providence has given us.</p>
   <p>With the power of suggestion we may even bring about some real improvement, in which case the complaining, too, will become superfluous.</p>
