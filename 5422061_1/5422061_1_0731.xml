   <p>William Randolph Hearst, America's leading publisher has joined the ranks of the miracle doctors of economics who have discovered sure cures to end the depression. Hearst, who owns twenty American newspapers and is a multi-millionaire broadcast his theories on the Columbia Network.</p>
   <p>Hearst says that the depression is due to over capitalization and furthermore that Big Business didn't give enough of their earnings during prosperity to the working class.</p>
   <p>To remedy this situation he advises the Federal Government to take the leading role and hasten the return of prosperity by beginning huge public works, because the only way to restore confidence is to give work to the army of unemployed.</p>
   <p>The working hours must be shortened, because more men can thus be employed. If the wages would have kept pace with the modern machinery, not only the machinery, <pb facs="5422061_1_0732.jpg" n="2"/>not only the manufacturers, but the wage earners would have benefited. This would have meant prosperty and more buying power.</p>
   <p>Hearst's theories contain many good points, which would affect us all, if it were put to practice. We think it important to entertain these thoughts favorably.</p>
