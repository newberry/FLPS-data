   <p>The Hungarians have good traits, but they also have faults. One of our mistakes is that when we meet individuals, who are seen only occasionally at Hungarian gatherings, we are taken in by their honeyed words.</p>
   <p>We notice this fact especially when one of our organizations plans a particularly important affair or wants to create something noble. Our "gentry" always ferret out these bits of news and endeavor to induce a few officers of the society, by honeyed words or empty promises, to befriend them. The saddest part is that some of these officers can be deluded, and then realize too late that all is not gold that glitters, because the "gentry" are selfish and do not consider the welfare of any organization as more important than their own objectives. When it happens that an officer or a committee member dares to disclose this fact, these "gentry" do all in their power to silence him by calling him ignorant and disorderly.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0248.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But often these so-called ignorant persons are the ones who would save the society excessive expenditures and also preserve the reputation of the Hungarians.</p>
   <p>In the course of some twenty-five or thirty years, methods of conducting the business of societies have changed considerably. Today there are trained and educated men in every Hungarian organization who have had business experience and whose ability and integrity are known to the Hungarians. It is evident, therefore, that there is no need for the obtrusive "gentry" in the life of any Hungarian society. My advice is that these persons should be forbidden to attend meetings.</p>
