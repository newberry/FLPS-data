   <p>Few American problems interest the Hungarian-Americans more than Prohibition. We are also aware of the fact that most of the Hungarian-Americans have a biased opinion of the character and political eminence of the late President Woodrow Wilson.....</p>
   <p>In 1919, Wilson vetoed the proposed prohibition bill, but both houses of Congress passed it over his veto.....</p>
   <p>We concede the fact that Wilson did not have the interests of Hungary at heart when he failed to announce the protest of the United States against the mutilation of Hungary by the Trianon Treaty.....</p>
   <p>However, today we know that Wilson was as disappointed in the execution of the terms of the Peace Treaty as we were.....</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0636.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>And, while we Hungarians judge the results of the war from a purely Hungarian point of view, Wilson's high ideals soared high above the limited boundaries of small nations and aimed for world peace and the happiness of all humans.</p>
   <p>Those who are moved by the interests of their own race alone can never understand or follow Wilson's idealistic philosophy.....</p>
   <p>We Hungarian-Americans, too, feel and see the injustice of the Treaty of the Trianon. We cannot but talk deprecatingly of the tragic outcome of the World War, yet we should see Wilson for what he was--one of the greatest Presidents of the United States.</p>
   <p>The purpose of this article is to show Wilson in a new light to the Hungarians.....</p>
