   <p>The battle of election is primarily being fought around the ideas of the League of Nations. Cox has come out openly and has declared himself for the League of Nations. Harding, on the other hand, does not approve of Wilson's ideas of the League, but he is for some sort of international organization.</p>
   <p>This does not settle the League of Nations question.</p>
   <p>The more progressive members of the Republican party, headed by Johnson and Borah, have campaigned against our having anything to do with any foreign entanglements just as the policy of the United States has been in the past.</p>
   <p>At times, Harding expresses himself as being for the association of the <pb facs="5422061_1_0659.jpg" n="2"/>different nationalities, and at other times, he seems to take the same stand that Johnson and Borah take.</p>
   <p>The more prominent men of the Republican party, including Taft, Hughes, Root, Hoover, and Wickersham, have expressed themselves as being for the League.</p>
   <p>Since these men are all faithful Republicans, and understand politics, they recommend that the plans for the League of Nations be revised from the way Wilson advocates, but they approve of the idea itself.</p>
   <p>There are some people who claim that the Wilson plan for a League answers all requirements, but if the Republicans accept this plan, they will be playing their cards right into the hands of the Democrats, and then there will <pb facs="5422061_1_0660.jpg" n="3"/>be no disagreements during the election campaign with reference to the League.</p>
   <p>There are certain people who would like to change certain ideas of this League pact. This probably would not be a bad idea.</p>
   <p>The activities of the League of Nations at the present time are being followed very closely. The League may prove to be very useful, but again, it is liable to be absolutely useless. At the present time, these facts remain to be proved. One thing we do know is, that it is imperative to know all about this very important matter.</p>
   <p>The Constitution of the United States is not absolutely perfect, so, consequently, they are continually modifying or adding to it. It has been amended nineteen times up to date. And, if necessary, it will be modified again. This is the process of development.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0661.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>In Europe, there is no controversy about the League of Nations. Each nation can see the necessity of such an organization, in fact, they are looking forward to its activities with high hopes, as an organization being capable of preventing a recurrence of another bloody war such as we have just gone through, and one that has upset Europe and the entire world.</p>
   <p>The nations that lost the war, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey, are the only nations of Europe who cannot be members at the present time, due to the fact that the other nations do not want them to have anything to do with the conferences of the League, and this revolutionary move. This is considered as a punishment to the above named nations.</p>
   <p>In a very short time these nations will also be admitted as members of the League. Russia is not a member yet, either, because Russia seems to be preparing for war against the whole world, though it is only a matter of time <pb facs="5422061_1_0662.jpg" n="5"/>before Russia will join the League, even though its political views will be entirely different from the rest of the world.</p>
   <p>It is here the controversy lies. Maybe, it is because there is nothing else to discuss, or on which the Republicans and Democrats can argue, maybe, it is because if America joins the League it will mean radical changes in America's foreign and domestic policies.</p>
   <p>The United States has kept away from serious disagreements that have come up between European countries, but the World War thrust us into European politics. Due to industrial and economic conditions, the United States can no longer remain isolated from Europe.</p>
   <p>Europe needs America, and America needs Europe. Products of the United States <pb facs="5422061_1_0663.jpg" n="6"/>are constantly being exchanged for products manufactured in Europe, thereby cementing the tie between the two continents.</p>
   <p>The entire world has made great advances in the field of contacting one another, since the invention of the steam locomotive, steam boat, and telephone. These inventions have brought the entire world closer together, and new ideas have developed.</p>
   <p>So now the nations throughout the world are beginning to feel as though they should all unite into one solid organization, which will insure the world of everlasting peace, without interference from any one particular nation. This is the idea that gave birth to the League of Nations.</p>
   <p>There are some who doubt whether the League will live up to these expectations <pb facs="5422061_1_0664.jpg" n="7"/>of wiping war from the face of the earth. Of course, this is all guess work, but the idea seems like a good one and we believe it is worth trying.</p>
   <p>The way it looks now, we think Harding, if elected, may sign with the League, while Cox, if elected, would enter without a doubt.</p>
   <p>Therefore, it seems that there is no question as to the United States joining the League of Nations.</p>
   <p>The most important question that will have to be answered is, will it bring about the expected everlasting peace.</p>
   <p>There will be a League. But will there be cooperation, and will all nations work together for one cause, Peace? Only a prophet could answer the above question, and we are not prophets.</p>
