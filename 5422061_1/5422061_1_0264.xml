   <p>The United States is one of the leading agricultural countries in the world. So it is only natural that tillers of the soil of Europe should be attracted here.</p>
   <p>The majority of Hungarian immigrants who came to this country were either people who owned farms or people who were employed on them, so one would think that it would be only natural for these people to seek employment in the field of agriculture. This is not so. The majority of these immigrants settled in the industrial centers of the United States.</p>
   <p>Immigration from Hungary is practically at a standstill, so we can't urge immigrants to take to the soil.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0265.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>But we will endeavor to convince those Hungarians who have been in the United States for some time to take a part of their savings and invest it in a farm of some kind. The opportunities on a farm are limitless.</p>
   <p>For instance the sugar beet farmers of Michigan collected $13,500,000 from this one product alone.</p>
   <p>There are a few Hungarians who have seen this opportunity and are taking advantage of it.</p>
   <p>Hungarian readers, our advice is that you should invest your money in the soil, for the tillers of the soil become financially independent, and while they work hard, they work for themselves and their families; they do not take orders from some capitalist who drives his workers to the limit so that his profits will be larger. Hungarians, we hope you have heard this piece of advice.</p>
