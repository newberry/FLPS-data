   <p>That old American saying, "I told you so", will have to be repeated by us at this time. The election in Illinois is an indication of how the people feel about America becoming involved in any foreign entanglements.</p>
   <p>The selection of a man to fill an important position in Illinois politics provides a very good indication of the attitude of the people of the United States toward the World Court. To be quite frank about the matter, we think that Colonel Smith would never have had a chance against McKinley if the latter, had not admitted that he favored the World Court idea.</p>
   <p>Thompson faction defeated the Deneen-Lundin group......</p>
   <p>The Chicago Hungarians lined up with the victors many weeks before the election took place. The Hungarian people were well-organized for this election, and <pb facs="5422061_1_0500.jpg" n="2"/>therefore played a very important part in it.</p>
   <p>The Hungarians must remain organized in one political party in order that they may gain recognition and some day play a leading role in politics--something that has not yet been achieved.</p>
