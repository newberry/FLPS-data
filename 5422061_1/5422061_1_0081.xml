   <p>Recently, there have been published numerous articles for and against the use of alcoholic beverages.</p>
   <p>There has been a countless number of people who have attempted to write articles about the evils of drink in a very dramatic manner. They are trying to prove that the hereditary ills, such as insanity, and many other hardships of life, are due to alcoholism. They tell us that alcohol cuts down a man's ambition, and his capacity to work, at the same time slowly destroying the spiritual and physical capacity of man.</p>
   <p>We will admit these facts, but at the same time we think that these are exceptions. The evils of alcohol are apparent only where individuals <pb facs="5422061_1_0082.jpg" n="2"/>use or drink to excess. The enemies of alcohol are using these facts to win the majority on their side. These facts should not make an argument strong enough to convince an intelligent people to swing with those forces that are against alcoholic beverages, and deprive the majority of their civil liberties.</p>
   <p>Prohibition of alcohol is nothing more or less than the minority forcing something against the will of the majority. These troubles of alcoholism are natural, and cannot be rectified by the enactment of laws prohibiting the use of alcohol.</p>
   <p>The weakness of man can only be corrected by teaching and proper leadership.</p>
   <p>Those who indulge in alcoholic beverages to excess are not criminals, and are not detrimental to society of today, nor are they detrimental <pb facs="5422061_1_0083.jpg" n="3"/>to the laws of today. Therefore, no one has a right to deprive these people of their individual liberties.</p>
   <p>There are daily attacks against individual liberty. These attacks are not forced on the people by armed forces, but by the enactment of laws made by people who are against individual liberty.</p>
   <p>The intelligent voter should not allow himself to be stripped of a liberty, because a few people are so strongly opposed to alcohol. Temperance is a golden path, and the intelligent man or woman voter will know what is required of them on April first when they make this very important decision. We, the lovers of freedom, must answer these fanatic reformers.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0084.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>These fanatics want to bring about absolute prohibition, and they want to declare it a criminal offense for anyone in indulge in the drinking of light wines and beer.</p>
   <p>We must protect our homes against these invaders and confiscators of personal liberty.</p>
   <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we urge, you to vote against Prohibition.</p>
