   <p>Brother Members:</p>
   <p>The time has come when we have to put aside all our petty differences and come together to debate on our problems and find some solution to our common troubles.</p>
   <p>For four years our members have been suffering the ravages of the crisis. Like all other immigrant groups, we, too, are stricken by universal unemployment, lack of money, loss of our homes, farms, and savings and have to face the sinister ogre of a prospectless future,and a sad old age.</p>
   <p>This crisis has shaken up the foundations of even the biggest institutions. It was only the generous help extended by the government which averted the <pb facs="5422061_1_0349.jpg" n="2"/>collapse of several insurance companies. If these giants with their hundreds of millions have been shaken, it is no wonder if the smaller associations find themselves thrown about like so many shells on the stormy sea of the present crisis.</p>
   <p>The devaluation of bonds, the loss of savings, the advance in years of our members, not to mention unemployment, are setting almost unsolvable problems before our associations.</p>
   <p>In spite of loans and of postponements granted our members to pay their dues, the number of those who have ceased to be our members or who are about to lose their membership amounts to several thousands. As there exists no other social security, these members lose their sole support in case of sickness or death. What will become of our associations, whose future was already gloomy enough in consequence of the closing of immigration? Is there any solution in this crisis, is there any other outlet besides the one of striking <pb facs="5422061_1_0350.jpg" n="3"/>unemployed members off our rolls?</p>
   <p>Yes, there is, if we all look together for it. Just as the small home owners and farmers, so can the members of our associations expect help from the government, provided a mass movement is set in motion to support this action. Just as the members of the associations of other nationalities, so have we Hungarians the right and duty to combine to protect our interests.</p>
   <p>We have the right to expect from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which has aided the insurance companies and American lodges with hundreds of millions, to come to the aid of our Hungarian associations too. This, together with the foundation of branches for joint medical care, hospitalization, sanatoriums, and through creation of unemployment funds in our associations, besides other needed steps, will enable us to keep all our members and thus save our associations from disaster.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0351.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>At the same time we have to take a stand on the question of social security by the State. It is the duty of society, in the first place, to care for the unemployed and for those who are unable to support themselves on account of old age, physical disability, or any other reason. The Hungarian associations too, have to demand aid for the poor, the distribution thereof to be made through them.</p>
   <p>Besides the ever increasing misery, there is another dark cloud hanging over us--the swiftly approaching cloud of war. With cries for new markets and for and against revision of treaties, war is getting under way--a war of which the workers and the little man will be the victims again, just as in 1914-18. With war will come the rise of Fascism and other isms. Hitler and the Fascists are shedding the blood of those who refuse to bend before them-- the workers, the people of the middle class, and the Jews. We have to do something against the ever increasing danger of war and Fascism.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0352.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>These conditions are not exclusively European. We the immigrants have felt them heavily here in America too. Discrimination against immigrants is found in the shop, in the distribution of relief, and in proposals of patriotic organizations and politicans of America, that demand their registration, fingerprinting, and deportation.</p>
   <p>Is there any way to defend ourselves against all this? Certainly, there is! If we get organized and join forces with the American workers, farmers, and little man, then we, too, can expect results. It is high time for our hundreds of thousands of Hungarians to unite for the defense of their common interests. Let us put aside our petty old differences and, with joined forces, seek a way out.</p>
   <p>The undersigned Hungarian-Americans, though belonging to different organizations are ready to act jointly, and are calling all leaders of societies--sick benefit, church, workers', cultural, sport, singing, amateur, etc., as well as inter-association committees and national and district leaders--to send their delegates <pb facs="5422061_1_0353.jpg" n="6"/>to the meetings of the Hungarian-American Associations to be held on June 23, 24, and 25 at the Hungarian Home in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The meeting will begin Friday, June 23, at three o'clock in the afternoon. The meeting on Friday evening will be open to the public. Saturday evening is reserved for the guests to see the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>Come to Chicago for those days to seek salvation for our institutions and to join our forces for that purpose. Those wishing to participate should report their intention to the Central Bureau of the Committee for Preparation, 458 West North Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
