   <p>The United States is preparing for the coming presidential election, and it seems to me that the Hungarians should start preparations for it also.</p>
   <p>I did not find it difficult to locate someone who had enlightening information about politics in the United States. There is only one real Hungarian politician in Chicago. There are many so-called "curb-stone" politicians, who do a lot of talking without accomplishing anything, but there is one Hungarian who is very active and influential in the political life of this country. He is Dr. Adolf Weiner, a lawyer. Therefore, I decided to visit Dr. Weiner, who is located on the fifth floor of the Cook County Building. Dr. Weiner greeted me very cordially, guessing immediately that I was the editor of a Hungarian newspaper, and that I was about to ask for an interview. Dr. Weiner asked me what I wanted, and I immediately answered that I was looking for political information, and that I would like to hear his views on the presidential election.</p>
   <pb facs="5422061_1_0598.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"I will tell you in advance", said Dr. Weiner, "that I am a Democrat, but regardless of this fact my belief is that Cox has the best chance of being elected."</p>
   <p>Dr. Weiner then went on to speak of the platforms of the two political parties, pointing out the advantages of the Democratic platform as compared with the Republican. He explained that the tariff question was the important issue of the campaign. He expressed himself also on the Volstead Act, stating that, in his opinion, Cox was liberal enough to see the uselessness of this law.</p>
   <p>I then asked him which party he thought would help Hungary, and the Hungarians of America, the most. As he answered this question, a sad look came over his face, but he gave me his honest opinion. "As far as Hungary is concerned," he said, "it does not make very much difference who becomes president of the United States." He stated that the only ways in which conditions could be remedied in Hungary would be by the enactment of new laws, by more conscientious work on the part of the Hungarian government itself, and by the co-operation <pb facs="5422061_1_0599.jpg" n="3"/>of the people for a better government.</p>
   <p>Dr. Weiner told me that the part of Hungary from which he originally came was now Czechoslovakian territory. He said that he was still Hungarian in heart and soul, even though he has been a resident of this country for the past twenty-seven years. I might mention here that Dr. Weiner received his education in the city of Vienna, and for the past twenty-five years has been one of the most prominent lawyers in Chicago.</p>
   <p>The last question I asked Dr. Weiner was whether he thought it possible to form a political organization among the Hungarian people of Chicago, and, if such an organization were formed, which party it should support.</p>
   <p>"Organizing Hungarian-Americans", Dr. Weiner answered, "is a very hard job. The Republicans always vote for the Republican candidate, and the Democrats <pb facs="5422061_1_0600.jpg" n="4"/>for the Democratic candidate, but if Hungarians were to organize, each member would want to be the leader of his organization. This is the worst fault of the Hungarians. If there were four thousand members, there would be four thousand leaders. The Hungarian-Americans have not learned the principles of co-operation, and would rather vote for a Slav or an Irishman than for a Hungarian. This is the reason Hungarian politicians do not get anywhere; if they do get a public office, they obtain it without the aid of their brother Hungarians."</p>
   <p>Dr. Weiner advised us that Cox, the Democratic presidential candidate, if elected, would probably do more for Hungary than any of the other candidates, because the Democrats have a more liberal platform with reference to foreign policy and immigration. The Republicans have always taken a harsh stand against immigration.</p>
   <p>The Hungarian-Americans are mostly industrial workers, and the Democratic party is a workers' party. Candidate Cox has been governor of Ohio for <pb facs="5422061_1_0601.jpg" n="5"/>three terms, each time being elected by the vote of the great number of industrial workers of Ohio. Therefore, it is clear that, if the Hungarian workers are to cast their votes to the best advantage, they must vote Democratic.</p>
   <p>I now left Dr. Weiner, fully satisfied that I had been right in going to see him, because I feel sure that Dr. Weiner understands the social problems of America. I am grateful that he talked with me, neglecting other and more important people who were waiting to see him. Furthermore, he told me that he would be glad to discuss the political question again at any time with any representative of the Magyar Tribune.</p>
