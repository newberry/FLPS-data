   <p>Wong Chin Foo, a Chinaman not unknown to fame as an itinerant lecturer on subjects connected with the land which gave him birth, is to debate the Chinese question with Mr. William E. Lewis, of this city, this evening in the West End Opera-House. W. C. F., according to the bills, is "a native aristocratic Chinaman," who attempted once upon a time to lead an insurrection against the Tartar usurpers of his country, but was forced to flee for his live, the Emperor setting the perhaps extravagant price of $1,500 on his pig-tail. Since he came to this country he has removed the hirsute braid, dresses like a white man, and gives the boys "taffy" as good as they send, and has found that the platform pays a little better than the next thing. The debate will probably be an interesting one.</p>
