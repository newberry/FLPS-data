  <body>
   <p>On-Leong school commencement service took place yesterday at 12 P.M. at the school auditorium.</p>
   <p>The auditorium was decorated very pleasantly with our national flag up in front and beautiful flowers, which were presented by the On-Leong Chinese Merchants Association.</p>
   <p>The service was participated not only by the entire student body and teachers but also by a number of Chinese business leaders.</p>
   <p>The program began with the principal, Mr. Moy leading the body to salute the national flag three times, and was followed with the singing of the National anthem.</p>
   <p>Mr. Moy then reported progresses made by the school. And was followed <pb facs="5418479_0171.jpg" n="2"/>by Mr. K. L. Li, president of Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association; Mr. Y. C. Moy, president of On-Leong Chinese Merchant Association; and Mr. W. K. Li, a trustee. The guest speakers, all suggested the fact that to a Chinese, the Chinese language is by far more important than English. And students should utilize the opportunity of learning to acquire higher education, thus, preparing themselves for service to the country and society.</p>
   <p>The program was concluded with refreshments.</p>
