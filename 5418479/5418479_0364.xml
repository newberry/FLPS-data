   <p>It has been virtually a duty of every Chinese, since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war, to sacrifice our all in co-operation with our national government. Many of our fellow countrymen are giving their lives on the front for our country, and many more if not all are living a life of momentary horror and affliction. But we, who live abroad can contribute only materially to the support of our government, which is,indeed, a meager bit in contrast to what our fellowmen are sacrificing yet, we are greatly surprised to learn that, there are such cold blooded creatures who care not, even, to give a fraction of what they possess. Such creatures can be classed as renegades.</p>
   <p>We are all aware of the compulsory contribution rules of the Emergency Relief Society which were made to guide us rather than to force as to contribute. So far, the results have been excellent. Unfortunately, a would-be perfect record was marred by a certain employed young Chinese whose name is Liang-Kwang.</p>
   <p>It was during the regular visit of the solicitor, who was engaged in conversation with a would-be contributor, that Liang-Kwang hid himself in a lavatory to avoid contributing. To make matters worse he even used profane language in addressing the solicitor. This cold blooded character and his attitude angered the public <pb facs="5418479_0365.jpg" n="2"/>immensely.</p>
   <p>Yesterday Liang-Kwang was spotted in Chinatown by the investigating squad which, after confirming Liang-Kwang's identity and his attitude, decided upon immediate action against the violator. So Liang-Kwang was ordered to stand on a street corner with a sign on his back. On it was written, "A cold blooded individual who refused to contribute towards the war fund against Japan."</p>
   <p>Many witnessed the embarrassing exhibition and they all agreed that it was Liang-Kwang's own fault. He was not released until the prescribed fine was paid.</p>
