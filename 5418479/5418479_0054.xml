   <p>A meeting of Board of Directors of the Vocal Chinese Christian Association was held yesterday. They have decided upon establishing a Chinese School, engaging Mr. H. P. Chiao as teacher-principal, and Miss H. F. Wang as teacher. Both Miss Wang and Mr. Chicao have had many years of teaching experience in San Francisco.</p>
   <p>Friday, October 1st, is set as the opening date of the school.</p>
   <p>We urge therefore, that all fathers of our fellow countrymen who are interested in their children's education to come in and register this week. The hours of registration will be six to eight P.M. every day. The address of the school is The Chinese Church, located at 23rd and Wentworth Avenue.</p>
