   <p>Edwin C. Hill, a news commentator on the Lucky Strike Cigarette Program, is well known to radio listeners. He is undoubtedly popular but may I say, he is rather untactful as a radio news commentator of a neutral country.</p>
   <p>The bombing of the Shanghai International Settlement on the 23rd of this month, an incident fatal to a number of Americans, was unquestionably an important matter. All the newspapers and radio news reporters made known the fact that the Japanese were responsible for the bombing. Commentator Edwin C. Hill was the only one who insisted that the bombing was done by our side. He also remarked that, it was just as easy for the Japanese to war against the Chinese as "cutting butter with a red hot knife." Such unreasonable and uncalled for remarks on a public radio program is, indeed, more than I, a Chinese, can bear.</p>
   <p>For the benefit of my fellow countrymen I am asking the San Min News to publish this letter. I am suggesting, also, that some individual or organization should represent us in complaining to the Lucky Strike Cigarette Company for its commentator's unjust attitude, and to warn Mr. Hill that hereafter all his broadcasts on Sino-Japanese situations should be impartial. And if he should continue his partial <pb facs="5418479_0078.jpg" n="2"/>attitude persistently, the step we, as Chinese, must take, then, is to refuse to smoke Lucky Strike Cigarettes.</p>
