  <body>
   <p>He was born in Canton, China sixty-six year ago. At the time of his death he was the foreign secretary of the On-Leong Association, Director of Chinese Club, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Middle-Western Chinese War-Fund Association of Chicago and Dean of Social Affairs, etc.</p>
   <p>Mr. Moy came to the United States at the age of eighteen and has always been a successful business man. Towards the latter part of his life, he devoted his time to serving the society. He was the leader of humanitarium affairs. Shortly before his death he started a "save-our-country movement", which aims to express our patriotism and spirit of sacrifice for our country. Now that he has passed to eternal death, we as fellowmen wish it were possible to express more than deep sympathy. His death certainly was a great loss to all of us and especially to the "Save-our-country movements."</p>
