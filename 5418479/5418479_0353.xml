   <p>Mr. Moy, as director of the Board of the Middle-West Chinese War-Fund Association of Chicago, did take an unusually active part in soliciting war-funds to save our country since the beginning of the Japanese Invasion.</p>
   <p>He labored day and night persuading his fellow-men for contributions to its association.</p>
   <p>The remarkable success achieved by the association in such a short period, is largely due to the steadfast efforts of Mr. Moy's excellent direction.</p>
   <p>Last night ( 16th) at 8 P.M., while persuading the contributors at the Gee Gee and Company, he suffered a sudden attack due to over work and <pb facs="5418479_0354.jpg" n="2"/>excitement. His fellowmen at the store, immediately sent him to a hospital after the doctor's examination. He was pronounced hopeless, due to apoplexy. Mr. Moy has long sufferred from high blood pressure and with this additional exertion, it was more than his physical body could bear. He passed away at 6 A.M. yesterday morning, September 17th, 1937.</p>
