<title level="a">THE SIXTH PATRIOTIC MASS MEETING SPONSORED BY THE CHINESE EMERGENCY RELIEF SOCIETY</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The sixth patriotic mass meeting was held at 7:30 p.m. yesterday (Sunday) at the Chinese Emergency Relief Society auditorium.</p>
   <p>Mr. C. S. Mah assistant chairman of the propaganda department was the presiding chairman. Mr. Mah introduced the general director of the Chinese Emergency Relief Society, Mr. C. H. Yu, to the audience. The latter in turn introduced the first speaker of the evening Miss Y. T. Yu.</p>
   <p>Miss Yu's topic was "The problem of China and Japan." She emphasized that the Japanese cabinet is attempting to combine imperialism and fascism having invasion and aggression as its goal. The present Japanese premier is especially anxious to dominate Asia with such isms. He has, as a matter of fact, succeeded in concluding a pact with the dictators Mussolini of Italy and Hitler of Germany.</p>

   <p>It is apparent that their aim is to invade the helpless republic.</p>
   <p>In Europe, there is the Spanish revolution and in Asia there is the Japanese invasion of our country which demand our attention. We, citizens of a republican country, should realize that we must present a united front in our fight against fascism and imperialism. When and if we can achieve such unity then ultimate victory will be ours.</p>
   <p>Mr. W. C. Wei then spoke on "The China of Today."</p>
   <p>Mr. Wei has just recently arrived here from Canton. He gave a brief description of the havoc wrought by the Japanese bombing our cities and centers of civilization, and their inhuman and merciless murdering of our civilians.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wei also reported the existing unsurpassed spirit of unity in the whole country.</p>
   <pb facs="5418479_0344.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>He is very optimistic concerning our ultimate victory, because of the wonderful patriotic activities of the people and their efforts in resisting the Japanese invasion. According to Mr. Wei, a prolonged war will eventually cause an economic collapse of Japan. Their defeat is sure to follow. Mr. Wei hopes that all of us will continue our patriotic work and back our government financially.</p>
   <p>Mr. C. Tang, Vice-president of the Relief Society, concluded the evening program by telling the audience that $350,000, have been contributed so far by the Chicago Chinese community. Mr. Tang also encouraged his fellow countrymen to continue contributing generously and to put forth more efforts in propaganda work. For we must realize that we are fighting for the existence and the glory of our republic.</p>
