  <body>
   <p>The Chinese Nationalist Party of Chicago entertained Mr. Li at a banquet yesterday on the occasion of his departure for China.</p>
   <p>Mr. Li is a well known nationalist pioneer who has done much for the development of the Chicago Nationalist Party. His popularity in our Chinese community has been great because of his resourceful financial assistance to Chinese students who were in financial difficulties.</p>
   <p>All the leading Nationalist members, including the editor Mr. Jin Liang - Fu, were present at the banquet. Every speaker praised Mr. Li for his untiring patriotic activities, his generous assistance to the needy students and his devoted interest in the development of our Chinese community in Chicago.</p>
   <p>We understand that Mr. Li will leave for China by way of San Francisco.</p>
