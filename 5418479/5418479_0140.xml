<title level="a">THE FUNERAL SERVICE OF MR. FRANK MOY, GENERAL DIRECTOR OF THE CHICAGO CHINESE EMERGENCY RELIEF SOCIETY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Mr. Frank Moy, general director of the Chicago Chinese Emergency Relief Society, died from over-exertion in patriotic activities. What touched our hearts was the fact that Mr. Moy was one person who actually gave his life for his country. He breathed his last while persuading his fellow countrymen to contribute towards the defense and relief funds.</p>
   <p>These are the reporter's impressions of yesterday's memorable funeral of Mr. Frank Moy:</p>
   <p>1. The patriotic spirit of the Chinese public was apparent in their expression of deep sorrow and sympathy.</p>
   <p>2. The spirit of organizational and individual unity has never been greater in the history of the Chicago Chinese community.</p>
   <p>3. The combination of love for fellow countrymen and of patriotism gives the reporter a greater assurance of our ultimate victory in war against Japan.</p>
   <pb facs="5418479_0141.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The following is the reporter's account of yesterday's unforgettable funeral:</p>
   <p>Funeral services took place in the Chinese Christian Church on Wentworth Avenue. The bier was placed in front of the pulpit and a picture of the deceased directly above it. The entire rostrum was covered with fresh flowers and wreaths. The Church Chamber was adorned from end to end with more than four hundred pairs of elegiac scrolls.</p>
   <p>The following is the program of the service:</p>
   <p>1. Announcement by Rev. T. Y. Lee. 2. Funeral songs. 3. Reading of scriptures. 4. Hymns. 5. Relation of a brief biography of the deceased by Mr. Y. T. Moy, president of the On-Leong Chinese Merchants' Association. 6. Prayer by Rev. Lee followed with meditation. 7. Mr. S. A. Lee, vice-president of the On-Leong Chinese Merchants' Association,expressed his gratitude to all those who paid their last homage to the great Chinese leader. 8. Relatives and friends then passed the bier to pay their last homage to their deceased leader.</p>
   <p>Besides the relatives and friends, all Chinese organizations in Chicago were represented <pb facs="5418479_0142.jpg" n="3"/>at the funeral service.</p>
   <p>The funeral procession was thus arranged: 1. Police patrol. 2. Memorial tributes. 3. Band (Western music). 4. Floral car with Mr. Moy's picture. 5. Elegiac scroll bearers. 6. Flowers and wreaths. 7. Memorial tributes. 8. Band. 9. Elegiac scroll bearers. 10. Flowers and wreaths. 11. Floral car. 12. Hearse. 13. Immediate relatives. 14.

Committee members. 23. Memorial tributes by Moy's Benevolent Association. 24. Band. 25. Elegiac scroll bearers. 26. Flowers and wreaths. 27.

   <pb facs="5418479_0143.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>There were more than three hundred automobiles and more than a thousand mourners participated in the funeral procession. Then, of course, there were thousands of on-lookers and by-standers.</p>
   <p>Traffic in Chinatown was tied up for hours. The normal order was not restored until the procession reached the cemetery where thousands more had gathered to witness one of the most spectacular funerals in the history of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Due to the limited available space, your reporter has given you just a brief outline of the great funeral procession. As a matter of fact, there are no available words to express such solemnity, lavishness, and patriotic spirit.</p>
