   <p>Chinatown kept open house yesterday. It was the Chinese New Year as well as the Emperor's birthday, and South Clark Street was the scene of Celestial festivities. Every Chinaman was a host, and rice wine, cigars, and bon bons were free to all.</p>
   <p>The gifts were in the form of cash. Every one intending to call provided himself with a supply of silver coins - quarters, halves and dollars - and did them up neatly in red paper. When rice wine, cigars, and dainties were served he quietly deposited in the center of the table his gift of cash. It was a day of incessant eating, drinking, and handshaking.</p>
