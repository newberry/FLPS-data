   <p>In observing the 25th anniversary of the Republic of China there will be a mass meeting following the National Day Parade. During the mass meeting a resolution will be pledged by all fellow-countrymen to reiterate our determination to resist to the end the illegal and unjustified invasion of China by Japan. We will pledge our lives, properties and everything we have to strengthen our defense against further Japanese invasion on the one hand and to build up China safe for democracy and insure peace in the Far East on the other hand.</p>
   <p>Japan's invasion of China is a flagrant violation of the elementary rules of international law, Nine-Power Treaty, Kellog-Briand Pact and the League of Nations Covenant. By ruthless killings of civilians in Manchuria and possibly throughout China, including women and children and by wanton destruction of property, Japan has discarded law, order and moral standards on which rests the Peace of the World. In a word. Japan's unprovoked aggression jeopardizes the rights of lives and security of these peace loving people of the World.</p>
   <pb facs="5418479_0214.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In view of the fact that the foundation of human civilization has been threatened by Japan, who thus places himself as the common foe of Peace and and humanity, we therefore resolve:</p>
   <p>1. That we request our American friends, for the sake of humanity and peace, to curb Japan's ability to make war by instituting personal economic sanctions against her;</p>
   <p>2. That we urge our American friends to support our struggle for our national existence by every and all practical methods possible;</p>
   <p>3. That we call to the attention of our American friends the disastrous effects of a possible Neutrality Act on China when and if formally invoked.</p>
