  <body>
   <p>The American government has been extremely interested in the warfare between China and Japan.</p>
   <p>President Roosevelt, Secretary of State, Hull, and the rest of the cabinet members have from day to day listened with silence to the latest news of the Far Eastern War, and are investigating carefully the latest development as to its influence in the United States, of America. This will enable them to decide the steps and attitude the American government should take toward the Far-Eastern situation.</p>
   <p>There is an extremely close relationship between the United States of America and the Far-Eastern situation. American properties and rights in China are enormous. They are surpassed only by Great Britain.</p>
   <pb facs="5418479_0112.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We can readily see why the American government should be so concerned with the Far-Eastern situation.</p>
   <p>There are a number of factors which must be considered in the course of investigation.</p>
   <p>First, the extent of damages suffered by the Unites States during the period of war between China and Japan, and the problem of protecting their property, citizens and rights in China according to the treaty.</p>
   <p>Second, the problem of "who" is going to be the victor of the war and"whose victory" will benefit United States most.</p>
   <p>Third, America was the leader of the nine power peace pact. The pact was to <pb facs="5418479_0113.jpg" n="3"/>maintain the independent rights and integrity of China. Now that the pact has been violated by Japan, the problem is: should the United States of America do its duty as a signer of the peace pact or should it keep the pact in mind gazing with folded arms as an on-looker?</p>
   <p>As for the answer to the first problem the writer's conjecture is, let the American government protect her nations rights and the property of American citizens in China. This is merely her duty according to the treaty.</p>
   <p>But protection in times of war is not empty talk or verbal gestures. It requires "action". And if the United States should take such a course as "protection" with "action", then it will contradict the present war-scare psychology of the American public.</p>
   <p>Therefore, since the Sino-Japenese war, the American government has never taken a definite step. Time and again it has sent out dispatches or bulletins as to <pb facs="5418479_0114.jpg" n="4"/>her government's position and policy, but always contradicts itself.</p>
   <p>At first the government had the intention of protecting her national rights and the property of her citizens in China with full power, in accordance with the Treaty, also to send war ships to China to exhibit its naval power. But in view of the fact that the war had already endangered the lives and properties of the American citizens, and fearing that this might lead the United States into war, Rosevelt ordered all Americans in China to leave the war-zone, or stay there at their own risk.</p>
   <p>Roosevats order was met with disapproval by the Americans in Shanghai. Secretary of State, Hull, then explained that the policy of the American government in protecting its national rights and properties, would stand as always, and the uncertainty and cowardly position taken by the government would likewise stand; thus, the first problem remains to be solved.</p>
