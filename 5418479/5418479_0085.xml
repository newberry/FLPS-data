   <p>The Reverend J. W. Icenberg, from the Committee on Home Missions, read the following report:</p>
   <p>We recognize with gratitude what God has done through our Home Mission Society during the past years of its history, and we recognize the obligations and responsibilities resting upon us as we enter the new century of our country's history, to press forward to the realization of our motto, "North America for Christ".</p>
   <p>THE CHINESE</p>
   <p>The Reverend R. R. Coon, offered the following resolutions:</p>
   <p>Whereas, In the immigration of the Chinese to this country the way has been opened for a free social and intellectual intercourse between them and the people of the United States, calculated to develop free and fraternal relations between the two nations; and, <pb facs="5418479_0086.jpg" n="2"/>Whereas, There has been fostered and organized a strong opposition to this movement, especially along the Pacific Coast, contrary, as we believe, to the plighted faith of this Republic; therefore,</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we hail the present opening as particularly affording a grand and auspicious opportunity to the Christian people of this country for the evangelization of the Mongolian race in our own country.</p>
   <p>Resolved, That it is peculiarly fitting for us as a denomination- identified as we are, in spirit and history, with the free institutions of this nation-to give full and distinct utterance to the sentiment of a common brotherhood in regard to the Chinese, by welcoming them to our land, our charities, and our sanctuaries.</p>
   <p>Resolved, That we recognize in this movement a solemn call, addressed to us in the Providence of God to consider well our Christian obligations to the Chinese, and if possible, in cooperation with our brethren, early to inaugurate some plan to bring them under the influence of the Gospel.</p>
