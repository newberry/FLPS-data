  <body>
   <p>In regards to the election of delegates to the Chinese National Convention, the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in Chicago has been in charge of the registration for voters. Many have registered, but for the benefit of those who have not as yet registered the registration office will be open from the 5th to the 7th inclusive. Hours will be 1-3 p. m. and 7-9 p. m.</p>
   <p>We are hoping that all fellow countrymen will register during the hours indicated. It is a matter of election privilege end rights of a citizen which all of us should enjoy and we are hoping that none will forfeit such a citizenry qualification.</p>
   <p>(A) Qualification of a voter - All voters must be over twenty years of age and having taken the public oath. His voting rights will be forfeited if he fails in the following classifications.</p>

   <p>1. Those who have rebelled against the National government.</p>
   <p>2. Those who have been in the public service and were convicted for unbecoming conducts.</p>
   <p>3. Those who have exercised public authority illegally.</p>
   <p>4. Those who have submitted their properties for confiscation (communistic element.)</p>
   <p>5. Those who have mental diseases.</p>
   <p>6. Users of opium and other narcotics.</p>
   <p>(B) Determining the voter's age through birth certificate and other substantial and reliable evidences.</p>
   <p>(C) Form of registration.</p>
   <p>Voter's - 1. Name</p>
   <p>2. Age</p>
