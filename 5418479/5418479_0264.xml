   <p>The following items were decided on September 4th:</p>
   <p>1. Expressions of gratitude to: J. Chin; T. S. Mah; S. L. Tsuo; J. Y. Yee; and C. H. Lou for their two years of unselfish service to the Student Association.</p>
   <p>2. All Chinese Consulates and Chinese leaders for their contribution and support towards our activities.</p>
   <p>3. Miss C. F. Chen for her excellent work on The Committee of Investigation, during the last two years and Mr. T. V. Tung, President of Harvard Chinese Student Association, for his services in this Association.</p>
   <p>Due to the increasing national crisis The Student Association feels that it is its duty to urge student organizations throughout North America to participate in the expansion of our patriotic activities. The following are the contemplated steps:</p>
   <pb facs="5418479_0265.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>1. The Executive Department of the North American Chinese Student Association will be divided into 7 sub-departments. They are:</p>

   <p>d. Exhortation.</p>
   <p>e. Research Studies Department.</p>

   <p>2. Each sub-department will be given the sole authority in organizing and executing its work.</p>
   <p>3. In order to encourage all Chinese students in this country to participate in its patriotic activities, we have decided that the election should be based on schools or districts.</p>
   <pb facs="5418479_0266.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>4. The above contemplated methods are subject to only one year's experimentation. The Third North American Chinese Student Conference will be held in New York on the first of September.</p>
   <p>5. During the one year period of experimentation, an investigation committee of five should also be elected. This will mean a committee of 5 schools from 5 different districts.</p>

   <p>b. New York Chinese Students Association - General Business Department.</p>

   <p>f. Michigan Chinese Student Association-Research Studies Department.</p>

   <p>At 6:30 P.M., Mr. G. S. Wong, the Chinese Consul, and all the Chinese leaders were entertained at the Hwa-Yin Restaurant in Chinatown. Mr. C. S. Mah, was the temporary chairman who represented the entire Chinese student body of the the association.</p>
   <p>The speakers on this occasion included Consul Wong, Y.T. Moy, President of The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, and Y.C. Moy, President, and W.P. Lee and T. Tang, Vice-Presidents of The Chinese Emergency Relief Society. Remarks of all speakers were brief but concise.</p>
   <p>Finally, Mr. J. Chin, Chairman of this student conference expressed his gratitude to all who have participated in the four-day program of the conference, and urged that all student delegates return to their schools with the determination of securing more and better cooperation from Chinese merchants of their own localities in patriotic activities.</p>
   <p>After the banquet a picture was taken by the famous photographer, Mr. K. T. Hsu.</p>
