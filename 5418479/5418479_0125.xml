   <p>In view of the ever increasing number of Chinese Restaurants in Chicago, which have no organization or union whatsoever for this trade, the Chinese Association has decided upon the possibility of organizing a Chinese Restaurateurs Union in Chicago.</p>
   <p>This will afford all restaurateurs to meet such problems as the increasing prices in groceries, rent and other expenses. But with no balanced increase in business for most restaurateurs.</p>
   <p>This is due to the maintainence of the same stand standard selling price for meals while the restaurateurs are paying more and more every <pb facs="5418479_0126.jpg" n="2"/>day for edibles.</p>
   <p>We see, therefore, a gradual decrease in Chinese Restaurant business.</p>
   <p>The first meeting of fellow-restaurateurs was called on Sept. 19th, at the Chinese Association. But very few attended. There were not enough present to form a union. Therefore, during the meeting, except for some exchange of opinions by those present, very little was accomplished. However, those present elected a temporary committee of eleven, to discuss the organization of a Chicago Chinese Restaurateurs' Union and to bring about two essential items;</p>
   <p>1. An increase in meal rates.</p>
   <p>2. An improvement of the interiors of Chinese restaurants</p>
   <p>The committee has selected Oct. 11th (Monday) at 1:P.M. as the day <pb facs="5418479_0127.jpg" n="3"/>for the second mass meeting of the Chinese Restaurateurs at the Chinese Association. We know that all restaurants operated by the westerners, because of organization and unionism, are enjoying an ever increasing business. On the other hand we see our fellow restauratears, due to lack of organization and unionism, suffering a daily decrease in business. However, they pay the same increased cost.</p>
   <p>The Westerns meal rates have all been raised but the Chinese restaurateurs still maintain the original low rates. Many have lost all, by doing so, and we do think this is indeed a suicidal attempt. If we continue to act so blindly, surely there is no future. We implore, therefore, all our fellowmen to stop and think of the crisis ahead of us. We must realize that to endure and achieve success there must be organization, and to save ourselves as a moral duty, we must co-operate.</p>
   <p>We hope, then, that all of you will try your best to attend the mass-meeting <pb facs="5418479_0128.jpg" n="4"/>on Oct. 11th, ( one delegate for each restaurant) and we shall all participate in the discussion.</p>
   <p>The Temporary Committee of</p>
   <p>The Chicago Chinese Restaurateur's Union</p>
   <p>Oct. 4, 1938.</p>
