  <body>
   <p>The consulate office has been notified by the Chinese Embassy at Washington D.C., to make arrangements immediately for the election of a delegate.</p>
   <p>We shall begin with members and officers of all Chinese associations and clubs for registration. We hope all such organizations will enforce the following rules for registration. When an association or a club has completed registration of members and officers, then the registration list should be forwarded immediately to this office, to be sent to the Embassy for final election and investigation.</p>
   <p>This is an extremely important matter, which concerns the future participation by all over-sea Chinese in our National politics. We hope, then, that all Chinese organizations and their members will pay strict attention to the following rules.</p>
   <p>(A) Any association or club organized prior to May 14, 1936, and which, is under the following classifications will be eligible to vote.</p>
   <pb facs="5418479_0400.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>1. Agricultural organizations 2. Industrial organizations 3. Commerical organizations 4. Educational organizations 5. Medical organizations 6. Newspaper and Writers organizations 7. Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Associations and various branches 8. Chinese Nationalist Associations and libraries.</p>
   <p>(B) Contents of registration list. (book)</p>
   <p>1. At the beginning of the registration book, there must be the list of all organizations with their histories and conditions.</p>
   <p>2. Then the list of names of all members and present officers of their respective organizations, with their individual age, birth-place, address and duty as an officer.</p>
   <p>(C) The rights of organization members and officers.</p>
   <p>According to the election law for the over-seas Chinese, only members of the above classfied organizations are qualified for candidacy, and only present officers of the classified organizations are qualified to nominate candidates. Out of nine candidates three will finally be elected as delegates or representatives of the over-seas Chinese, at the Nationalist Convention.</p>
   <p>All over-seas Chinese organizations and members, therefore, should think seriously and respectively of such individual rights in their own National affairs. And remember to register as soon as possible to insure individual right to vote</p>
