<title level="a">NORTH-AMERICAN CHINESE STUDENT DELEGATE CONFERENCE</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The North-American Chinese Student Association had its second Delegate Conference at the Chicago International House on September 1. Delegates represented at the conference number over fifty.</p>
   <p>The conference began at 9 A.M. Mr. J. Chin, president of the North-American Chinese Student Association announced the purposes of this conference or meeting. He, then, related the accomplishments of this association and also the co-operation rendered by this association to the overseas Chinese in patriotic activities.</p>
   <p>Mr. Chin was, subsequently, elected presiding chairman of the conference, Mr. M. K. Chiang, Chinese secretary, and Mr. C. H. Lou, English secretary. A brief discussion followed the election of temporary officers.</p>
   <p>It was decided that all problems that are to be taken up by this meeting should be classified into two separate divisions. One division to discuss problems and works in China, and another to take up problems and works abroad, such as our patriotic activities in the war against Japan, etc. The first division is headed by Mr. F. Y. Yee and the second, Mr. S. M. Fong.</p>
   <pb facs="5418479_0273.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>A committee of investigation was then formed. It consists of Mr. M. K. Chiang, (representing Western U. S.), Mr. C. L. Koo, (representing Eastern U. S.), Mr. L. C. Lee, (representing Canada), Mr. Y. S. Moy, (representing Central U. S.), and Mr. S. Y. Wu, (representing Southern U. S.) The work of the committee was to investigate the accomplishments of the two years old Student Association, which will be a foundation upon which to build future plans.</p>
   <p>The delegates voted unanimously in sending a telegram to the Central Government to encourage them in maintaining a prolonged war against Japan.</p>
   <p>A picture of the delegates was taken after lunch. After that the entire body visited the Chicago airport.</p>
   <p>At 8 o'clock in the evening a refreshment party was held at the International House. During the party, the Chicago Chinese consul Mr. K. S. Wong, Dr. Palace and Mrs. P. C. Hwang made extemporaneous speeches.</p>
   <p>So ended the first of the four-day Chinese Student Conference.</p>
