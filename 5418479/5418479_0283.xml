   <p>All Chinese businessmen in the United States are handicapped due to the lack of proper knowledge of the English language. Those who are interested in learning English have accomplished little, due to lack of time.</p>
   <p>So for the benefit of the Chinese countrymen, the churches have established the Chinese Sunday Schools. Many have grasped the opportunity and consequently they have benefited by them. There are nine Chinese Sunday Schools in the various Chicago Churches and they are for the Chinese.</p>
   <p>According to Rev. T. Y. Li of the Chinese Christian Church, all Chinese Sunday Schools will begin classes on Sept. 13th- Sunday afternoon.</p>
   <p>All classes will be taught by Americans. And the text books are prepared <pb facs="5418479_0284.jpg" n="2"/>by Rev. T. Y. Li.</p>
   <p>Aside from the Sunday School lessons there will be classes in English conversation, composition and grammar, etc. All lessons have both English and Chinese definitions.</p>
   <p>We wish all Chinese countrymen will utilize their precious moments to better themselves by attending one of the nine schools.</p>
   <p>Remember, its free to all and for further information, please write to the Chinese Christian Church on 22nd and Wentworth Avenue.</p>
