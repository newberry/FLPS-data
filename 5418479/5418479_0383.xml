   <p>The barbarous aggression of Japan with her wanton bombardments of Chine's noncombatants in defenseless cities is horrifying civilized nations all over the world. Laws are established in every civilized country for the purpose of safeguarding society from demolition by crime. In the same way international laws are established in attempt to make war more "civilized," if such a term can be applied to needless slaughter. But the world today seems to have forgotten this fundamental principle by allowing murderous Japan to indulge in her desire to, perhaps wipe out the peace-loving people of China.</p>
   <p>We as Chinese citizens abroad must convince the rest of the citizens of the world that justice must be done and no greater peaceful weapon can we use than the method which we call "boycott."</p>
   <p>Japan was never a self sufficient country. She boys raw materials from other countries and works them with her cheep labor to compete in world's markets.</p>
   <pb facs="5418479_0384.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Her national budget has been heavily in the red, and her international trade balance is unfavorable. With these facts in mind, we see how our boycott against Japan will be an effective check upon her war-thirsty militarists.</p>
   <p>In boycotting Japan, would we be accused of violating the law of neutrality? (a law which the United States of America is contemplating of enforcing in case of further Japanese attacks upon our land.) No! The refusal of the United States to render economic assistance to the Japanese war machine would be obeying the spirit of the neutrality law which, while intending to keep America out of war by not sending war materials to either nation, is daily violated as the American people continue to aid Japanese imperialism by their buying of Japanese goods. Would this boycott of Japan endanger the lives of innocent Japanese people who are also victims of the warlord's greed? Again No! The boycott would not starve Japanese non-combatants because Japan is virtually self-sufficient in food products.</p>
   <p>The organization of a boycott against Japan is not as complicated a task as one may think.</p>
   <pb facs="5418479_0385.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Consumers would be more satisfied with home-made goods which are considerably better than any of the cheap Japanese imitations. Consumers get what they pay for and are not getting more by paying less. If the American consumers realize that their purchasing of Japanese goods is directly financing Japan's bombardments of China, they will conscientously inspect labels or goods and emphatically refuse any article marked "Made in Japan."</p>
   <p>Let us all, fellow countrymen, use our friendly and honest influence in winning our friendly Americans' approval to teach Japan and all other aggressive nations that treaties are not just "scraps of paper." Let us jointly, show the callous imperialists that the civilized people of the world will not remain passive, while a nation "solves" her economic problems with the blood and flesh of innocent women and children.</p>
   <p>Let us all resolve to stop "buying Japanese" - so determinedly that a peoples' fist of united condemnation thrust into the face of Japanese imperialists will bring terror into eyes already bloating on the prospect of a vanquished China, which may be doomed to exploitation on account of her hatred for war and love for peace.</p>
