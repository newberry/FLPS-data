  <body>
   <p>A reception was held at the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association soon after the arrival of Dr. Tao, yesterday. The meeting was attended by many, including the acting Consul, Mr. Wong.</p>
   <p>Dr. Tao, was introduced at the meeting by Mr. Moy Yu-Chok, President of the Chinese Emergency Relief Society.</p>
   <p>Dr. Tao began his speech by paying tribute to the excellent patriotic work done, and still being done, by the Chicago Chinese. He emphasized the fact that the success was largely due to the spirit of cooperation which is truly admirable.</p>
   <p>Dr. Tao, then, related briefly, his travel and experiences in Mexico. He believes that the Mexican people are extremely sympathetic toward China since the beginning of the Sino- Japanese conflict.</p>
   <p>He, then, presented the 3 important ways to defend our country:</p>
   <pb facs="5418479_0339.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>1. Unification of the whole country for a prolonged war. A determined effort to organize the people, to militarize the people, and to train the people.</p>
   <p>2. Study the enemy's conditions. The Japanese people (civilians) do not want war, they are under the militaristic thumb and have been forced to yield to the desires of the militarists. Knowing the psychological situation, we should, therefore, popularize and centralize the work of propaganda amongst the Japanese civilians. In due time, this will provoke an internal revolt in Japan against the militaristic rule.</p>
   <p>3. Use pressure on the league of nations through propaganda so as to have the world powers boycott Japan economically. If we are successful in this measure, then the overthrowing of Japanese imperial ism is almost a certainty.</p>
   <p>Dr. Tao spoke for more than an hour in Mandarin dialect. The speech was repeated in Cantonese dialect by Mr. Mah Chu-Shun. After Dr. Tao's speech, Mr. C. W. Chu, president of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association offered his thanks for the stirring and patriotic speech in behalf of the audience.</p>

   <p>Acting Consul Wong, was then introduces. Mr. Wong emphasized that Dr. Tao's suggested 3 methods were indeed important, especially our propaganda work amongst the foreigners. He also stated that the local Emergency Relief Society, has organized a separate department doing such propaganda work.</p>
