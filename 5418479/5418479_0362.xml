  <body>
   <p>The Women's Solicitation Group of the Chicago Chinese Emergency Relief Society started out yesterday to solicit from the women contributors of Chicago. The group consisted of Mrs. P. Chen, the leader, Mrs. A. F. Wu, Mrs. K. L. Liu and Mrs. C. Y. Tang.</p>
   <p>The women solicitors were welcomed heartily by all fellow Chinese women who were visited by the group. Obviously, the reaction on the part of all women contributors was more patriotic then ever before. They all seem to realize that the fate of our future government is at stake, and that they are gravely concerned with protecting our national integrity and striving to maintain the peoples' respectability and pride. They feel that the heavy responsibility should not rest upon the men alone but upon the women as well. They are determined to give, even if it may deprive them of their clothes and food-- and that is the extent of patriotism of our women. We wonder what effect will this have upon the misers who love their money more than their lives.</p>
   <p>Here is an unusual case of a boy who contributed all of his savings - yes, pennies and dimes he has saved - toward the war fund. Such is the patriotism of this <pb facs="5418479_0363.jpg" n="2"/>little boy. Consequently, the Women's Solicitation Group collected over $4000 -on a single day's work. The contribution ranging from $5 to $1000 - per contributor.</p>
   <p>Indeed, the active patriotic part being played by our women deserves much admiration.</p>
