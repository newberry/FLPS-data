   <p>p. 1- About 2,500 persons were assembled yesterday at the Festival Hall and were Welshmen direct from North Wales, South Wales and all parts of the United States attended.</p>
   <p>Then came duet competitions for a prize of $20.00 and a badge of honor offered by the Seattle Cymrodorion. It was to be a duet of bass and tenor, and the selection was the Welsh song “Where the Caveri Ripples”.</p>
   <p>The judges William Courtney, John Thomas and Dr. J. M. Gower, awarded first prize to J. T. Watkins and D. Stevens of Scranton, Pa.</p>
   <p>The warmest interest centered around the contralto solo competition. For a prize a medal was given. The selection was Gluck’s “Life Without My Eurydice”. The first prize was awarded to Miss Evans.</p>
   <p>Everyone waited for the great event of the afternoon, the choral competition for male voices, each choir to number not less than fifty nor more than sixty <pb facs="03512_0014.jpg" n="2"/>voices. The first prize is to be $1,000.00, the second $500.00, with gold medals to successful conductors. The results will not be announced until Friday evening.</p>
