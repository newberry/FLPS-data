   <p>p. 4 – Senseless tumult on the Fourth of July has passed the stage of patriotism and hysterical frenzy aroused by many football games, does not consitutte sport. This opinion was handed down by Jenkin Lloyd Jones at the “Eisteddord” in Abraham Lincoln Center last evening.</p>
   <p>His opinion followed a short address, in which he spoke on the fashion in which the Welsh had preserved their national unity, and how just such “Eisteddfords”, or literary and musical entertainments, had contributed to it. He contrasted the effect with modern celebrations. The affair of last evening was under the auspices of the Kymry Society and Lincoln Center, and it is planned to make it a yearly event.</p>
   <p>Dr. D. Charles Harries acted as president and Rev. John C. Jones as conductor. <pb facs="03512_0029.jpg" n="2"/>Prizes for the soprano solo were divided between Miss Sally Hughes and Miss Alice Shaw. Robert Kent Thomas and J. Louis Jones divided honors in the essay comptetition. The prize for a poem was won by “David Evans”, who turned out to be Miss Evans. Miss Elizabeth C. Jones won the prize for a piano solo. W. D. Jones was the sole competitor in the Welsh reading competition and his rendition of “Gwylad y Palmwdd,” or Land of the Palms was roundly applauded.</p>
