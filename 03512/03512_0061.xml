   <p>P. 5 â€“ As the name implies, Ernest W. J. Hughes is of Welsh ancestry, altho he has spent the greater part of his life in Chicago. He is at the head of the firm of Ernest W. J. Hughes &amp; Co., dealers in quality first mortgage real estate bonds at 10 S. La Salle St., and now regarded as one of the leading investment houses in this city.</p>
   <p>Practically every descendant of purely Welsh parentage who has distinguished himself in Chicago, began his career as a poor boy with nothing in the way of assets except the noble ideas instilled into his mind by parents to whom the golden rule in life is always sacred; and Ernest W. J. Hughes is no exception.</p>
   <p>For more than thirty years, Mr. Hughes has been dealing in first mortgage investments in Chicago, and with him the business has reached the dignity of a science. He knows the requirements for sound investments and never offers his clients securities until they have stood every acid test which a due regard for safety can apply.</p>
   <pb facs="03512_0062.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There are thousands of investigators in Chicago who ask nothing more than a recommendation from Ernest W. J. Hughes before they make a bond or mortgage investment. To them that is enough.</p>
   <p>Like other educated business men, Mr. Hughes, is fond of music and art. His personality is most pleasing and once his customer always a customer, for it is soon discovered that his securities are of a high class.</p>
