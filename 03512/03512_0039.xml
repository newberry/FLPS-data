   <p>Welsh services were held in Chicago as early as 1844 mainly in private homes.</p>
   <p>In the spring of 1850 a room was rented for services at corner of Randolph and Canal Streets. In 1851 a church was built.</p>
   <p>P. 4 – From ’55 to ’60 the church was kept up mainly by young women in service. After 1864 it could again afford a pastor.</p>
   <p>P. 5 – “The Wisconsin Synod held at Hebron, Wisconsin, October 19-21, 1900, passed a resolution inviting the church to send its pastor to all its churches to plead for financial help”. In 1902 the new church was completed. At the same time Sardis Congregational Church dissolved and join Hebron as did many members of Bethany Welsh M. E. Church.</p>
   <p>P. 6 – In 1909 the mortgage to the church was burned at a public meeting while the Cymric Club finished ice cream and cake.</p>

   <p>P. 12 – A large dish was placed on the pulpit and three widows of former deacons burned three cancelled notes before the congregation.</p>
