   <p>p. 5. No man is doing more to perpetuate the Welsh love of music and song in Chicago than A. J. Llewellyn, Vice-President and Manager of Sherwood Music School, one of America’s notable musical institutions.</p>
   <p>Mr. Llewellyn is typically Welsh, having been born at Rhoos, near Cardiff, in 1865. After leaving Wales he settled in Canada for a short time.</p>
   <p>After coming to the States he graduated from Brown University, Providence, R. I. He came to Chicago in 1898 and entered the publishing business.</p>
   <p>Later Mr. Llewellyn joined the Sherwood Music School, founded by Wm. H. Sherwood in 1895. His interest in music and in the school management soon advanced him to a position of responsibility, and upon the death of Sherwood in 1911 he was chosen Vice-President and General Manager.</p>
   <p>Mrs. E. A. Llewellyn was a pupil of Wm. H. Sherwood, and since the latter’s death has assisted her husband in the management of the school. Both Mr. and Mrs. Llewellyn have been associated with music and musicians all their lives, <pb facs="03512_0067.jpg" n="2"/>and under their able management the Sherwood Music School has become one of the most popular music schools in America.</p>
   <p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Llewellyn are ardent lovers of music and have the happy faculty of being able to inspire young people in musical endeavors.</p>
