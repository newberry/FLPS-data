   <p>P. 5 – The first even of the afternoon was the contest for the prize offered for the best handbook in Welsh or English of short biographical sketches of Welsh poets with criticisms upon their poems. The prize was not bestowed, but Erasmus W. Jones was mentioned as the most worthy competitor, and Conductor Edwards spoke in commendation of his work.</p>
   <p>The soprano singers, six in number, came on next, which was won by little Miss May Jones declared the winner by John Thomas.</p>
   <p>In the adjudication on the operatic libretto only one libretto was submitted, but on account of its manifest excellence the prize was awarded to its author, who contested over the nom de plume “Sir Harri Ddu”; but even this did not prejudice him in the minds of the adjudicators, and the author who turned out to be R. D. Williams, received the prize which was hung around his neck by Mrs. Ben Davis.</p>
   <p>William Morgan of Caerphili, Wales won the Harp solo contest. <pb facs="03512_0009.jpg" n="2"/>The audience of the afternoon was not only the largest of the Eisteddfod season, but it was by far the biggest that Festival Hall has ever been called on to accommodate.</p>
