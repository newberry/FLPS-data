   <p>W. E. Powell is actively interested in the success of the International Cymrodorion Association, the Welsh society which proposes giving a musical and literary festival in this city the last week of August, 1893. Speaking of the current rumors that there is discord among the Welshmen in relation to the formation of the international festival, Mr. Powell said yesterday: â€œWe have been successful thus far in securing the cooperation of the best musical and literary talent among our people. We have distributed over 10,000 pamphlets throughout Great Britain within the last month, to which the most encouraging replies have been received. The National Association now in session at Swansea, Wales, has officially recognized our efforts and will send a deputation of the Gorsedd here at the time agreed upon. There are something over 2,500,000 Welshmen in this country, nine-tenths of whom will indirectly, at least, contribute to the success of the distinctively characteristic festival. There is no discord and there will be none beyond the discord which may arise from a friendly difference of opinion as to the best methods to be adopted. True there might be and doubtless there are some personal jealousies, but those jealousies will not and can not materially abridge the scope and success of the great enterprise.</p>

   <p>Every Welsh society of the United States will actively cooperate in the festival.</p>
