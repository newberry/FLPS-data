<title level="a">CZECH NATIONAL ALLIANCE ANSWERS THE MAYOR</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A declaration by the Czech National Alliance was published which protested against Mayor Thompson's contention that he spoke in the name of the Chicago citizenry when he refused a reception to General Joffre, of the French Army, and other visiting delegates of the Allies. The Mayor spoke his mind in the following words: "Chicago is the sixth largest German city, the third Czech, and the second Polish, Swedish, and Norwegian. I suppose that if a mayor extended an official welcome to representatives of some of the nations participating in the war, he would be arrogating too much power in assuming that the entire population agreed with the welcome."</p>
   <p>The Czech National Alliance replied as follows: "We hasten to assure you, Mr. Mayor, that you are very much at fault if you harbor any doubts about the <pb facs="5418478_2_0974.jpg" n="2"/>reception to be accorded the guests of the American people by the citizens of Czech descent. The French and the British commissioners are not only men of personal distinction, but they also represent nations with which we are united and upon whom we rely in our struggle against German despotism. When the guests of the government decide to come to Chicago, the people of Czech blood will appear in full force, to the last man, to welcome them." The declaration is signed by Dr. L. J. Fisher, chairman, and J. S. Smetanka, secretary, of the Czech National Alliance.</p>
   <p>The Slavonic Alliance, in which are represented, besides the Czechs, the Slovaks, Serbians, Croats, Slovenians, Russians, and Ukrainians also sent a declaration: "Mayor Thompson did not voice the sentiments of the Chicago Slavonic peoples when he declined to welcome the delegates of the French and the British governments. As far as the Slavonic peoples are concerned he should not hesitate, for they are wholeheartedly with America, and in doubting this, the Mayor insulted them grossly." The Polish National Alliance issued a similar protest.</p>
