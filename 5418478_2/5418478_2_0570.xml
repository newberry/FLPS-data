   <p>Wherever there were Bohemian immigrants in every state of the Union, an organized effort was made to line up everyone for the Liberty Loan. The Bohemian newspapers were full of reports of Bohemian Liberty Loan meetings and Bohemian Liberty Loan organizations from Hoboken to Seattle. Every local branch of the Bohemian National Alliance resolved itself into a loan organization. But the greatest effort of all was made in Chicago. The Bohemian branch of the Foreign Language Division had its own press representative who filled the columns of the four local Bohemian dailies every day with the right appeal. While the final figures will not be available for some time, Felix Streyckmans, Director of the Foreign Language Division, gave out the following figures on the last day of the campaign:</p>
   <table>
    <row>
     <cell>Germans</cell>
     <cell>$2,959,650.00</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Bohemians</cell>
     <cell>2,859,500.00</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Italians</cell>
     <cell>2,700,000.00</cell>
    </row>
    <row>
     <cell>Jews</cell>
     <cell>2,400,000.00</cell>
    </row>
   </table>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0571.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Bohemians seem to have landed in the second place, though it is likely that the final figures will show them to be first. But it should be remembered that there are more than three times as many Germans in Chicago as Bohemians and that while there are many millionaires among the Germans, there are none among the Bohemians. The record of the Bohemian branch reflects much credit on the excellence of its organization and on the patriotism of its people.</p>
