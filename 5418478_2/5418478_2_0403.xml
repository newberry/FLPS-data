   <p>Victory cannot be attained on the battlefield unless our people win the fight at home. We are now engaged in the fourth battle at home, upon which the victory for our sons and brothers at the front depends. This is the Fourth Liberty War Loan. In this we must be victors! In order to make this conquest complete. President Wilson has designated October 12, next Saturday, a national holiday for the entire American people. They should manifest on that day their firm determination to persist in the pursuit of victory, and to extend to the government their support toward a victorious ending of the war.</p>
   <p>It is known that Germany has recently attempted to make lurid peace proposals. She has done this in the hope of accomplishing by trickery what she was unable to do by force. According to her, she is preparing for another Brest-Litovsk peace conference, and has begun to spread reports of an approaching armistice. This is intended to mar the success of the Fourth Liberty Loan.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0404.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Czechoslovak people will not allow themselves to be deluded by friends of Germany and Austria-Hungary. No one can break the spirit of the Czechoslovaks, any more than they can that of the American people.</p>
   <p>There is the real purpose: To break the will to resist peace overtures by attempts at peace. To instill into the minds of our people the same spirit with which the Russian people were inocculated, and which brought about disaster for that nation. Germany may be retreating now, yet she has never given up dreaming of world domination. For this reason, the Czechoslovak people will close its ears to any peace proposals, unless they conform with the solution advised by President Wilson: Unconditional surrender.</p>
   <p>It is necessary to realize what the failure of the Fourth Liberty Loan would mean to the Czechoslovak people. We want to prove to ourselves and to the world that we have grasped the significance of the Loan, and that we intend to fulfill our duty. The Czechoslovak people of Chicago must not fail, and we are certain that they will not. It is our duty as Americans and as <pb facs="5418478_2_0405.jpg" n="3"/>Czechoslovaks!</p>
   <p>The government has arranged for a solemn parade which will march through the streets of downtown Chicago, October 12. It will serve to demonstrate the sentiment of the residents. It will be a straight answer to the Germans. We must answer in such a manner that they will be assured that we Czechoslovaks stand like a rock behind the principles promulgated by President Wilson.</p>
   <p>The Czech National Alliance, the National Allaince of Czech Catholics in America, and the Slovak League have, for four years, been standing at your side in the fight for the independence of our nation--these organizations are requesting the entire Czechoslovak people of Chicago to do as follows: Take part in very large numbers in the solemn parade next Saturday. Don't allow yourselves to be outdone by some other nationality. Show your readiness, and give your support to the government, particularly at this moment. This will demonstrate to the world that our government does not rely upon bayonets as much as upon the strength of its determined people. May the Czechoslovak <pb facs="5418478_2_0406.jpg" n="4"/>people attest to its sound political judgment. The day of October 12 will be a holiday as proclaimed by President Wilson. The stores will be closed, and all work stopped.</p>
   <p>This is the occasion for a great manifestation. It will be a pertinent answer to Germany. Czechoslovaks! Come to this parade. We are calling on you, and we entreat you anew, to do all in your power for the Fourth Liberty Loan. It must not happen that our share in the Fourth Liberty Loan shall be smaller than it was in the Third Liberty Loan. We are urging our fraternal orders, and individuals as well, to subscribe with zeal and enthusiasm. Subscribe to insure your own and your children's share in future peace and happiness.</p>
   <p>Let Czechoslovak ranks be the thickest in the parade on Saturday. We shall show that we are fully aware of the magnitude of the great cause for which millions are dying, and that we are ready to contribute our bit in the great <pb facs="5418478_2_0407.jpg" n="5"/>struggle.</p>
   <p>Signed: Dr. L. J. Fisher, Reverend Ino Kestl, A. Schustek.</p>
