   <p>The Germans started the war just three years ago. They did it for two reasons: first, to Germanize entire Central Europe, and second, to open trade routes to Asia. German nationalism and capitalism alike immediately started out with a terrible massacre, the end of which is not yet in sight. The Germans made a wrong guess, for they shall not reach either of their two goals. The war has awakened the national sentiments of the Slavonic people in Austria, even of those who had seemed resigned and beaten down. The Germans and the Hungarians are now attempting to keep the system of their unsound rule intact, a vain effort even if Austria should survive. Mammon, the idol of the Germans, will also be poorly served, for most countries have assumed a hostile attitude toward the Germans on account of the atrocities committed. It will take a long time for the hostile countries to enter into friendly business relations with the Germans again. The doors of all countries will be closed to the Germans, and their goods will be boycotted. German offers shall be rejected, even <pb facs="5418478_2_0868.jpg" n="2"/>if their articles are thrown on the market at prices lower than a coolie would ask. The German businessman was once welcome; after our experiences in the war, however, he shall be looked down upon as a spy, and every means shall be employed to get rid of him.</p>
   <p>During this war, the Allied countries have learned the methods by which German industry gained possession of the world's markets; they will be in a position successfully to compete after peace has been declared. German culture. German science--all this has lost its value during the war, for it has been found to be nothing but gold foil covering the worst barbarism.</p>
   <p>Taking all this into consideration, Germany is sure to lose the war even if her militarism should save her from utter defeat. Instead of power, glory, and wealth, the Germans shall reap only disdain and sufferings.</p>
