   <p>Over one thousand human lives perished in the horrible catastrophe of the "Eastland". They drowned in the immediate vicinity of the downtown district, close to the most crowded streets, right close to the shore full of people, and next to large and small craft of all descriptions. Nobody ever thought that anything like that could happen, but here it is, a catastrophe on water perhaps without equal in its magnitude, one that surpasses the worst catastrophes that ever happened in open seas far from any human help. How is it possible? How could it happen?</p>
   <p>Somebody, or some people, somehwere, must have done something that literally cries for vengeance. It may have been a case of criminal negligence, it may have been a case of paid omission in the performance of duties. State's Attorney Maclay Hoyn, a man who has had so many sad experiences with Chicago policemen, the man who prosecutes them for being on the pay rolls of criminals <pb facs="5418478_2_0344.jpg" n="2"/>who pay them for protection against the law and justice, has said that in the case of the "Eastland," also, it was bribery, graft, and inordinate desire for profits that caused, or was responsible for, the terrible catastrophe.</p>
   <p>In several places investigations have been started in order to find the real criminals and bring them to justice. The Chicago public will not be satisfied this time with superficial measures which, in the end, result in whitewashing the whole affair. The public is determined to demand a detailed, thorough investigation that will spare no one whether rich or poor, powerful or insignificant, who was in any way responsible for the disaster, and it is determined upon relentless prosecution of the guilty and responsible persons until they receive the proper punishment. The public demands this partly as a matter of plain justice, partly as an atonement for the death of the multitude of young people, and partly in order that the customary taking of chances with human lives because it means larger profits to promoters of business, owners of questionable enterprises, and dishonest, grafting public officials, may cease. If the death of all those who perished in the catastrophe should bring about an end to inefficiency, graft, profiteering, and dishonesty, their lives will <pb facs="5418478_2_0345.jpg" n="3"/>not have been lost entirely in vain.</p>
   <p>Said Chief of Police Healy about the catastrophe: "No doubt it was due to criminal negligence. Documents recovered by First Assistant Commissioner Schuetter are of the greatest importance." It is understood that these documents show that about one fourth of the people aboard the ship should, according to the ship captain's license, never have been admitted.</p>
   <p>Facts known so far would indicate that there are several groups of men who are responsible, to a greater or lesser degree, for the existence of conditions which resulted in the heartbreaking catastrophe.</p>
   <p>The catastrophe has brought sorrow and despair into hundreds of families, and our authorities must proceed impartially, without any regard whatever to whom they may find guilty. It is their duty to investigate all those concerned, from the ones high up to the humblest employee. No matter whether the investigation affects the prestige of one or the pocketbook of another, the truth must <pb facs="5418478_2_0346.jpg" n="4"/>be found, and must be made known to the public, and used as the basis of relentless accounting with the guilty parties, and just as relentless punishment.</p>
