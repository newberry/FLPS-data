   <p>Although there were very few candidates and the vote was proportionally light in yesterday's elections, nevertheless, the results were not made public until late last night.....</p>
   <p>Of all our Bohemian wards, only the Tenth Ward had a contest which aroused attention. Alderman Frank Klause had an opponent in the other alderman of the Tenth Ward, Mr. James McNichols, who, in spite of the fact that he is to serve another year of his old term, was running for the office of alderman against Alderman Klaus. The struggle was close and exciting. Both political machines, Democratic and Republican, supported Alderman McNichols. Alderman Klaus was supported only by Bohemian citizens who wished to secure representation for the old Bohemian bulwark in the City <pb facs="5418478_2_0070.jpg" n="2"/>Council. But they were defeated. There were about 1,700 votes cast for Alderman Klaus, and about 3,300 votes cast for Alderman McNichols. Thus, a ward which for more than thirty years has been represented by at least one Bohemian alderman, will have only one representative in the new City Council, and an Irishman at that.....</p>
   <p>In the Twelfth Ward, Alderman Anton J. Cermak was re-elected.</p>
   <p>In the Thirty-fourth Ward, Alderman Joseph O. Kostner gained a brilliant victory over his two opponents.....</p>
