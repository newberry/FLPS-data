   <p>Notwithstanding the cold weather the enlightened Bohemians from Chicago, and even from suburbs, attended in large masses yesterday's meeting, called for the purpose of enforcing the nomination of a Bohemian justice of peace. One could see distinctly the interest paid by everybody to the cause, so dear and important to the Bohemian citizens. There were present the most prominent old Bohemian settlers of Chicago and the meeting, with a few exceptions of expressed sarcasm, could be seen as a really exemplary meeting.</p>
   <p>The meeting was held in the Sokol's Hall and opened by Joseph F. Kohout. L. W. Kadlec was called to the presidential chair and started as follows: "Gentlemen, you are all conscious of the fact that the Cook County judges, in spite of the general demand of the Bohemians in Chicago to recommend our countryman to the bench of justice of peace, did the opposite. We are assembled, today, not with the purpose of condemning the judges of Cook County for their disregard of our nationality, nor to slander them, but in case there should be some changes in the candidates, to recommend for the vacancy of the justice <pb facs="5418478_2_0144.jpg" n="2"/>of peace - to take into consideration today's resolutions, and to grant us again a Bohemian justice of peace and show that favor to the large Bohemian population of Chicago."</p>
   <p>Then Mr. Pragler took the speaker's platform and said that it was our own fault, that our candidate was omitted from the list. We are not active enough in politics and that this predicted a bad future. The German journal, Illinois Staats Zeitung, wrote again and badly, about us Bohemians. It commended as a very praiseworthy idea that Mr. Fisher was not recommended for the justice of peace. Why? Only because he is a Bohemian. This Bohemian-hating newspaper is intruding everywhere without being invited. Judge Fisher is an equally good juror and perhaps better than the new candidate in his place.</p>
   <p>After a few insignificant speeches, Em. Legro announced that the resolutions were already elaborated and ready to be read to the audience.</p>
   <p>Resolution</p>
   <p>Accepted in the general meeting of the Bohemian people in Sokol Hall, March 18, 1883.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0145.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Whereas, there are about 60,000 Slavs, the majority of whom neither speak nor understand English, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, in the last years there has been an attempt to persuade the circuit judges of the necessity to have on the West Side a Slav-speaking and understanding justice of peace, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, the judges accepted this proposition and recommended, last year, to Gov. Cullom, E. A. Fisher, a prominent lawyer and a member of the Bar Association, as a worthy jurist to replace the deceased judge, Ammund Miller, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, that Judge Fisher performed his duties honestly, conforming not only with the limits of the jurisdiction of the justice of peace, but taking into consideration the ideals of humanity and proving, at every point, his ability and competence to stay in the same office, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, we have proved to the judges in every possible way, by our own efforts and with the help of our honest and kind friends of other nationalities, that the benefit obtained from the continuance in office of the same justice of peace cannot be over-rated and, taking into consideration that Judge Fisher <pb facs="5418478_2_0146.jpg" n="4"/>had sacrificed his own growing and large practice as a lawyer - that he should be nominated to this office for the next whole term, after the unfinished term of the deceased Judge Miller, and other candidates should not be taken into consideration, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, it is known to everybody that nothing substantial can be shown against his reappointment, but, that in spite of the approval of all elements which he represented, the circuit judges have found it good and justifiable to leave out his name from the list of the proposed justices of peace for the West Side, and they did it on account of the causes known only to them and to nobody else, and</p>
   <p>Whereas, this elimination of the candidacy of Judge Fisher not only is depriving us of many benefits and of due representation, but is casting an undeserved suspicion on our present just of peace and beloved countryman - this could have the undesirable consequence that in present conditions his profession is likely to be injured. On the other side our interests in the eyes of publicity can be damaged.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0147.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Therefore It Is Resolved, that we American citizens of Bohemian extraction in Chicago, present at the national meeting, express our deep sorrow on account of the decision of the judges, acknowledged by them as right and good; and hereby we appeal to those gentlemen that they take their decision relation to this matter under full consideration and pronounce a new decision, favorable and advantageous to us. That means to reappoint our present judge, E. A. Fisher, in the same office for the next term.</p>
   <p>Independently of this it is resolved that the copies of this resolution be delivered to every judge.</p>
   <p>Signed by the Committee: E. A. Legross, J. F. Kohout, F. Fucik, K. Drabek.</p>
   <p>The resolution was unanimously accepted.</p>
   <p>P. Hudek proposed to appoint few delegates, which would seek an audience with the senators here in Chicago or in Springfield; would deliver and explain to them the resolutions of today. The motion was accepted; seven delegates, prominent Bohemians, were elected and authorized to visit the state senators and circuit judges.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0148.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>After this the meeting adjourned.</p>
   <p>Right after the meeting the elected seven delegates had a private conference. They had already fulfilled the commission yesterday. The senators promised complete cooperation in the reappointment of a Bohemian justice of peace. It left nothing more than to wait for the decision of the senate in this matter.</p>
