   <p>The coming elections - National, State and County are highly important for every citizen, but especially for immigrants.</p>
   <p>The most important questions, which will be decided by the electorate in November are as follows:</p>
   <p>1. The Civil Service Reform.</p>
   <p>2. The protection of the citizens of this country on the other side of the boundary.</p>
   <p>3. The personal liberty.</p>
   <p>Everybody should take notice of these elections and here is the reason why:</p>
   <p>1. We know that at present this country is governed with incredible speed. We know that millions of dollars, extorted from the people, will be mostly used for the purpose of enriching the capitalists.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0139.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We know that hundreds of millions of acres of the best territories and soil were given up to the extorting companies.</p>
   <p>We know that the legislature is shameless and corrupted.</p>
   <p>We know that the untouchable electoral box was opened and interfered with to the advantage of the party, which was in power.</p>
   <p>We know that the biggest frauds committed on the people were unpunished, therefore we wish to have changes!</p>
   <p>2. Everybody know that many citizens of this great Republic are moaning incessantly because they are being jailed by others in power.</p>
   <p>We know also that the Republican Administration, while Blaine was Secretary, never resisted the foreign powers, except for small political tricks with countries not worth mentioning.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0140.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In dealing with major foreign powers he never moved a finger to the advantage of one threatened.</p>
   <p>We know exactly that the Democratic party has always protected and splendidly defended the rights of the American citizens each time the agricultural question was at stake; it always has protected the complete equal rights among American born and immigrated citizens.</p>
   <p>Whereas: We wish a change!</p>
   <p>A change to the Democratic principles of today and a liberal law of liberty for every citizen.</p>
   <p>3. We are convinced that the efforts of the Republican party are concentrated on the limiting of the personal liberty of the citizens.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0141.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We are convinced that the Republican party is taking pains, with every effort, to yoke us under tyrannic laws, originated by the fanatic Puritans a century ago, whereas we protest as strongly as possible against the jurisdiction of such social laws for free and educated people and we demand the changes!</p>
   <p>We ourselves denounce with fullest determination any law that limits personal liberty and is in direct opposition to the knowledge and idea of the Constitution of this country. We express our acknowledgment to the country, which fully defends and protects our interests and the interests of the people.</p>
   <p>Knowing that the Democratic party and its candidates, Cleveland and Hendricks, are worthy of confidence in the matter of reforms, and being convinced that the Democratic party always has protected the personal liberty and honor of American citizens, we consider it our duty to organize ourselves to insure victory in the election of honest men to office.</p>
   <p>Based on this principle we appeal to all the Bohemian Democrats, especially <pb facs="5418478_2_0142.jpg" n="5"/>to those who are enthusiastic about personal liberty and social honor, to take part in the general advisory meeting, Friday, September 19, at 8 P. M. in the hall of the "Sokol Society" gymnasium on Taylor Street. The purpose of the meeting is to found a "Bohemian club," that will support Cleveland, Hendricks and Harrison.</p>
   <p>As sponsors we have the signatures of nineteen prominent Bohemian business men.......(Names omitted)</p>
