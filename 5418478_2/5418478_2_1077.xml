   <p>The Bohemian National Alliance has sent the following communication to the American press in order to define the attitude of the Czech people in the present War: "The Bohemian National Alliance of America, which numbers eighty thousand members, and is the principal organization of Bohemian speaking people in the United States, addressed to its membership the following appeal which was given prominent space in some fifty Bohemian newspapers:</p>
   <p>"No one in America is keen for the War, not even our people who had so many reasons to desire the destruction of the German and Austrian system of military, absolutist rule. Our President, for more than two years, bore with insults and injuries offered by Germany, knowing that the people were not yet ready for War. But the gods make blind those whom they want to punish. The Kaiser, and the clique of courtiers and generals which today rule Germany and <pb facs="5418478_2_1078.jpg" n="2"/>its vassal, Austria-Hungary, went too far in their contempt of the American people and their President. The tremendous resources in wealth and manhood of the world's greatest republic will now be thrown into the scale against Germany and make absolutely certain the victory of the democratic nations. The system under which we lived formerly as Austrian subjects is doomed.</p>
   <p>"We want to impress upon all members of the Bohemian National Alliance the duties which war lays upon all citizens of the country. Above all, it is your duty to fight for the land you made your own, to which most of you swore allegiance, the land which is dedicated to the eternal principle of justice and rule by the people. The President asks for volunteers. Prove to him that the Bohemian immigrant yields to no one in his devotion to the starry banner of America. Many of our younger members are already in Canada, ready to go to the trenches in France. Now a more imperious voice calls upon us to offer the supreme sacrifice: Fight for the cause we believe in and for the land to which we owe allegiance!</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1079.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"All of us, young and old, men and women, should conduct ourselves as citizens of the country which is at war with a powerful, unscrupulous antagonist. Forget all differences, especially of politics, stand firmly behind the President and the constituted authorities. Say little, keep your eyes and ears open for hostile or disloyal acts, practice economy in family and personal outgo, buy government bonds, and do your share without grudge to make our cause victorious.</p>
   <p>"When the fighting is over and the diplomats come together to settle the affairs of all humanity by means of a just and lasting peace, we know that the voice of America, now one of the arbiters of the world's destinies, will be heard in favor of liberty for Bohemia, freedom for our brothers upon whom the hated German rule rested so heavily. For we ask for Bohemia the very thing which America has always championed: 'rule of the people, for the people and by the people'."</p>
