  <body>
   <p>Some twenty years ago when there were a few Bohemian policemen and a few other Bohemian employees--they could be counted on your fingers--on the pay roll of the City of Chicago, we used to be proud of it and considered it proof that the Bohemian element in Chicago is receiving some recognition.</p>
   <p>Today there are so many Bohemian employees in the City Hall that there is no department in which you could not find somebody with whom to transact business in your own Bohemian language. Counting all elective city officers, all appointive officers, craftsmen, and workingmen in the various departments, we find a total of 408 countrymen in the City's service, some of whom, we all know, hold very high positions. This number differs from time to time, since it also includes Bohemians employed as street cleaners, and in this category <pb facs="5418478_2_0173.jpg" n="2"/>the number of employees changes with weather, season, and other circumstances.</p>
   <p>Of considerable interest is the total amount of money drawn by Bohemian employees of the City of Chicago. We doubt that anybody could make a close guess at that amount, and most of us will be surprised to learn that Bohemian city officials and other employees receive a total of $37,243.40 a month from the City. This amount, however, does not include public schools or the public library, where many of our countrymen are employed in one capacity or another. These two departments, although maintained by funds obtained from Chicago taxpayers, are not under the direct control of the City treasurer as far as the payment of wages is concerned. If these were included, the amount of the City's money flowing yearly into Bohemian pocketbooks would certainly exceed one-half million dollars.</p>
   <p>Among elective officials we have seven aldermen, two judges, and the chief <pb facs="5418478_2_0174.jpg" n="3"/>bailiff of the Municipal Court. Others hold important appointive offices, such as our member of the Commission on Improvements, Mr. Sima, the Assistant Commissioner of Public works, Mr. Kostner, and the City Architect, Mr. Kalal.</p>
   <p>The following is a complete list of Bohemian City employees:</p>

   <p>This list is of considerable interest not only because it shows the number of City employees of Bohemian descent and the amount of money they receive every month, but also because it is a document proving the progress made by our countrymen in politics during recent years.</p>
