   </div>

  <body>
   <p>The parade of woman voters which takes place tomorrow, May 2, will be the greatest ever seen in Chicago.</p>
   <p>In order to demonstrate their belief in the equality of the sexes, men of all classes and nationalities will take part in the parade.</p>
   <p>Should our Bohemian nation be left behind? Certainly not! We do not know what interest the women of other wards will take, but the Twelfth Ward wants to do its duty.</p>
   <p>With that thought in mind we appeal to all women without regard to their political affiliations to take part in this parade.</p>
   <p>Our Twelfth Ward will meet 2 P.M. Saturday at 22nd Street and Marshall Boulevard. From there we shall go by streetcars to our point of assembly at 20th Street and <pb facs="5418478_2_1647.jpg" n="2"/>Indiana Avenue, where we shall join the fourth division at 4:10 P.M.</p>
   <p>The marchers must wear the suffragette caps and carry the American flag. The caps are for sale at Mrs. Hahn's, 3105 West 22nd Street, or at the point of assembly from which the parade starts. It was also agreed that all Bohemians will be decorated with a red and white band, by which the Bohemian nationality will be distinguishable. Dress as you please, but white is preferable.</p>
   <p>The marchers will be group by wards, and every ward will be designated by a banner. The parade will march on Michigan Avenue to Randolph Street, and thence to Grant Park.</p>
   <p>Come all who can, because it is going to be a memorable demonstration for women suffrage, and similar demonstrations will take place all over the United States.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: In this precession the Bohemian women marched as had been arranged.]</p>
