   <p>The fourth campaign for the sale of Liberty bonds will open at an early date. It will be shorter than those which preceded it, yet a much higher amount, $250,000,000, is the quota for Chicago. In the last campaign $128,000,000 was subscribed. The campaign is scheduled to begin in September and close in October.</p>
   <p>The main campaign committee for the Seventh Federal Reserve District has been named. Its chairman is Anton J. Cermak, who, at the same time, is head of the Czech campaign section. This committee met in the La Salle Hotel the day before yesterday in the presence of Mr. Charles H. Sweep, federal director of the Seventh District campaign, and Mr. J. B. McDougal, federal governor for the campaign in the district. After the latter had outlined the campaign, Mr. Cermak assured those present that the Czechoslovaks will do everything in their power to support the United States on its road to victory.</p>

   <p>"Our boys were the first to join the Army, and are giving an excellent account of themselves which is attracting the attention of the public. The Czechoslovaks have excelled others in patriotic sacrifice, and I am certain I speak from every Czechoslovak's heart when I assure you that our people will not disappoint the Government now. Our slogan is, 'Everything for victory!'"</p>
