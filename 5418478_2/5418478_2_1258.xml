   <p>No matter what the record of the united States may be in this war, it never can be accused of having shown a lack of leniency and patience with Germany, a country which has been guilty of acts against this country during the conflict, in comparison to which the sinking of the battleship "Maine" was a mere misunderstanding. Of course, an occurrence such as the sinking of the "Maine" in the Havana harbor would not be likely to cause a war in these days, because the public is somewhat skeptical as to the genuineness of such "incidents"--it has never been proved that the Spaniards were guilty of the sinking--and because the sentiment against war as a means of settling disputes between countries has grown too strong to permit of a declaration of war at the first provocation. But the Germans have been guilty of so many provocative acts against the United States that an armed conflict has been avoided so far only because the Presidential chair is occupied by a man of Woodrow Wilson's <pb facs="5418478_2_1259.jpg" n="2"/>perspicacity, wisdom, and moderation. Nobody can doubt that by now we should have been at war with Germany if our President had been, let us say, Roosevelt. That extreme exponent of aggressive policies never fails to admit this fact himself. But now it seems that even President Wilson will be obliged to change his tactics, in spite of all the hesitation, the reasons for which we do not want to see in the fear of the great power of the large and honest German constituency in the United States.</p>
   <p>Yesterday's reports from Washington's most reliable sources indicate that diplomatic relations between Germany and the United States will be discontinued in case the administration should come to the conclusion that the sinking of the "Arabic" was a "deliberate unfriendly act" on the part or Germany, and that this rupture will come about without any further delays. Germany will be given no further opportunity to continue its disgusting diplomatic game or to explain the attack on the "Arabic" from her own point of view, because President Wilson has decided to enter no more arguments about "principles". It is only facts that will be dealt with. The story about the sinking of <pb facs="5418478_2_1260.jpg" n="3"/>the "Arabic" will have to read quite differently from the official reports and the news coming from London from Ambassador Page, and the German government will have to disavow the deed of the commander of the German submarine, if the break between the united States and Germany is to be averted.</p>
   <p>All information so far secured by the Department of State confirms the belief that the Steamship "Arabic," which sailed into a foreign port unarmed and unaccompanied by a convoy of battleships, was sunk by a German submarine just at the moment when it was getting ready to come to the rescue of another ship, the "Dunsley," which itself had been torpedoed by the same submarine. The submarine commander cannot offer as an excuse that the captain of the "Arabic" had tried to sin his ship, because not even the periscope of the submarine had been observed by the people aboard the steamer. It is quite impossible to doubt that the "Arabic" was destroyed by a submarine, although Berlin has been making desperate, though clumsy, attempts to spread the belief that it could have been a mine that caused the explosion. All this comes somewhat late, now when the German public is alarmed by the report that the <pb facs="5418478_2_1261.jpg" n="4"/>sinking has cost American lives, while just a few hours ago, when news was published that all passengers had been saved, there was an immense jubilation over this new "success" of German kulturtraegers (bearers of culture).</p>
   <p>All the President wants from Germany is the official report from the submarine which fired the fateful torpedo. Nothing else. Therefore our Ambassador Gerard has been instructed to secure from the German admiralty a copy of that report and send it to Washington. Of course it may be a week or two before the report will be available, because the pirate trips of German exploits are sometimes rather prolonged. From many sides, the President has been sharply criticized for his apparent weakness concerning German infringements of international laws and of the rights of the United States as a neutral power. Now, however, an assurance comes from circles close to the President that the President has been acting fully in accordance with the principles governing his policies toward Germany and her submarine campaign, and that the Government, if it does not want to abandon its principles as expressed in its notes to Berlin, has only one alternative left <pb facs="5418478_2_1262.jpg" n="5"/>--that is, one besides the severing of diplomatic relations. That alternative is war.</p>
   <p>Although the President sincerely desires to avoid a war with Germany, in comparison to which the war with Spain was a mere picnic, he has taken a stand in his recent note which will not leave him any other alternative. Hereafter, a lack of energetic action on the part of the United States will be considered by the Germans an indication of absolute impotence and of determination not to undertake anything serious even in cases of crassest provocation, and will probably cause Germany to commit additional and still greater crimes against the citizens of the United States. The President is of the opinion that by severing diplomatic relations he will convince Germany that our country is determined to back up her words by adequate deeds, and that Germany will shortly be compelled to revise her conceptions of international law, and that this revision will make Ambassador Gerard's return to Berlin possible. But those who have been following the development of the mutual relations between the two countries cannot but feel that the President's expectations are too <pb facs="5418478_2_1263.jpg" n="6"/>optimistic.</p>
   <p>The crisis in the American-German relations has been maturing slowly but surely. The first deed to cause estrangement was the invasion of Belgium, whose neutrality had been guaranteed by the united States as well as by other nations. Even at that time the President was being urged to protest, but he did not do so, to our great disadvantage and loss of prestige. Then came the infringements of international laws on the occasions of attacks against the ships "William P. Frye," "Falaba," "Cushing," "Lusitania," and finally the "Arabic," which was the straw that broke the camel's back. The discovery of intrigues and machinations by German agents in this country, which just barely missed compromising the President most seriously, has not lessened the tension between the two countries. The situation is critical, there is no doubt about it; in the next few days, the last neutral country among the great powers may be joining the foes of the Central Powers, which have put might above right.</p>
