   <p>Czech banks and offices were swamped with patriotic fellow countrymen, all of whom wanted to be among the first to buy Liberty bonds of the third issue and so demonstrate that they are fully conscious of the duty which they owe their new homeland, and that they are ready and willing to perform all sacrifices which the United States demands of every loyal citizen. Yesterday was the opening day of the bond campaign, and during the very first hour the members of our community exhibited a lively response.</p>
   <p>Czech districts of Chicago and suburbs were richly decorated with American colors yesterday, for it was the anniversary of our entrance into the war. At this time our countrymen wanted openly to proclaim their allegiance to and agreement with the Government in these portentous times; they showed their sentiment by taking vigorous steps in the bond campaign.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0606.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We have no detailed reports on the extent and intensity of subscriptions. The American State Bank took in $12,000, and the Kašpar bank received $10,000 for bonds during the forenoon. This, however, was only the beginning. We presume that the various offices will send lists to the Czech central committee with the names of subscribers, so that the Czech public will be kept informed on every phase of the progress of the drive.</p>
   <p>The office of the Czech branch of the drive was opened shortly before 9 A. M. Messrs. Anton J. Čermák, chairman of the Czech branch; J. J. Salat, secretary; John A. Cervenka; Jos. Bolek; and others delivered a few appropriate remarks.</p>
   <p>The Czech branch office is located at 3347 West 26th Street. It was resolved to publish all the names of Czech subscribers in the newspapers under the heading Roll of Honor. We are flooded with an avalanche of names of subscribers and are unable, therefore, to publish all of them in today's issue. The tentative list is as follows: Václav Jelínek, $5,000; Anton J. Čermák, $2,500; Adolph Haver, $1,000; Fr. Kostka, $1,000; Judge Joseph Uhlíř, $1,000; Alderman <pb facs="5418478_2_0607.jpg" n="3"/>John Toman, $1,000; Martin Taraba, $100; Jan Kadlec, $200; Clara Pelikán, $50; J. Sirovatka $50; etc.</p>
