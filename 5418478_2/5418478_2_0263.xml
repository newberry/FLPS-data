<title level="a">CZECH CANDIDATES IN COMING ELECTION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Great efforts are being made in the campaign of the coming election in behalf of Josef Siman, who is a candidate on the Republican ticket for the office of city clerk, which had been held by his brother, now deceased. Mr. Siman was appointed by Mayor Thompson to hold the office after his brother's death to election time. By the election of Mr. Siman the Czechs would be represented in a high office. Every Czech voter ought to be aware of this, and vote for Mr. Siman, regardless of his own political affiliations.</p>
   <p>The Czech voters are almost sure that they will be represented in the Twelfth Ward by Alderman Otto Kerner. The candidate will succeed himself in an office in which he has done much good not only for his Czech fellow-countrymen, but also for the population of the entire city.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0264.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Czech voters should not forget to devote all their energies to the election of Mr. Josef O. Kostner who is the Regular Democratic candidate for alderman of the Thirty-Fourth Ward. He is the most efficient and best qualified of the candidates, and his election will be considered a boon to the Thirty-Fourth Ward, as well as to the Czech-American community of our city.</p>
