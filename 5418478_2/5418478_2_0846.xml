   <p>"We can say today with absolute certainty that the magnificent movement for Czech independence which has spread through all strata of the Czech people and has dealt a telling blow to Austria-Hungary would not have been possible if the Czechoslovak Council led by Prof. T. G. Masaryk and aided effectively by the confidence, work, and sacrifices of Czech and Slovak immigrants had not, in that memorable note of January 10, 1917, won the solemn promise from the Allies--the promise of the liberation of Czech lands.".....</p>
   <p>The question of what we can do to bring victory within our reach is answered in the words of Doctor Kramář who was imprisoned by Austria for his patriotic <pb facs="5418478_2_0847.jpg" n="2"/>convictions: "We must sacrifice our peace and our lives for our principles." Professor Masaryk said recently, "Our duty demands the recruiting of as many Czechoslovak soldiers and as big an army as possible."....</p>
