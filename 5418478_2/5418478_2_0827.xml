   <p>The Czechoslovak nation in our old homeland has made the step from manifestations and declarations to direct action. Up to the present the Czechoslovaks have shown armed resistance only beyond the borders of the Dual Monarchy. They have been fighting in units or individually on various fronts on the side of the Allied nations. They were stationed on all fronts where war was being waged and fought under foreign command.</p>
   <p>There were uprisings in Czechoslovak lands last August which united all strata of the people, especially the working class. The Czechoslovak brigade fought for the Allies. All of these elements will now be directed by the Cesko-Slovenska Narodni Rada (Czechoslovak National Council), thus forming one great body with which to confront the Austro-German coalition.</p>
   <p>All Czechoslovaks, whether in Europe, in America, or various colonies all over the world, have become convinced that our people must be recognized as an <pb facs="5418478_2_0828.jpg" n="2"/>independent people with the same rights as others have. Only then will we win the necessary position before the forum of the world at the time when the powers begin to discuss the conditions of peace and the question of the independence of our old homeland.</p>
   <p>Until that moment Czechoslovaks must show that they have always been ready to sacrifice their property and their lives for the cause.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak National Council has issued a proclamation for a general mobilization of all our people. The duties of the Czechoslovak people are before us, clear and obvious!</p>
   <p>There was a mass meeting of the Czechoslovaks in New York at which the mayor of that city, the representative of the French government, Franklin Bouillon, and Dr. Milan R. Stefanik [a Slovak], representative of the Czechoslovak National Council, spoke. It is up to Czechoslovak Chicago to attest to its loyalty to the cause of the old homeland. The Czechoslovak Committee (representatives of the Czech <pb facs="5418478_2_0829.jpg" n="3"/>National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics, and the Slovak League) and the Czech and Slovak Sokol societies are calling on all true Czechs and Slovaks to appear at the mass meeting which will be held on October 14, 1917, in the auditorium of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs, 2619 South Lawn-dale Avenue. Dr. Milan Rastislav Stefanik, Slovak commander of an aeronautic division of the French army and vice-president of the Czechoslovak National Council, will speak. Other speakers will be: Dr. Ludwing J. Fisher, chairman of the executive committee of the Czech National Alliance; Karel Pergler, vice-chairman of the central committee of the Czech National Alliance and director of the Slav Press Bureau in New York; Joseph Tvrzicky, secretary of the central committee of the Czech National Alliance. They will speak on the struggle for independence of Czechoslovak lands; on the Czech army in France; and on the duties of the Czechs and Slovaks of America.</p>
   <p>Czechs and Slovaks! The decisive moment for the liberation of Czech and Slovak lands is drawing near. Our people, groaning under century-old bondage, have taken up arms to fight together with other enslaved small nations who <pb facs="5418478_2_0830.jpg" n="4"/>are struggling for liberation from German-Hungarian tyranny. They will stand shoulder to shoulder with the Allies, loyal, undaunted fighters for their rights and for democracy and justice.</p>
   <p>This must become a fight to the bitter end! It must be carried on determinedly and courageously. Let our mass meeting show that all Czechs and Slovaks stand up loyally for the principle of democracy. Let this meeting show that the maturity attained by political education of the Czechoslovaks in the United States, will warrant the protection which our liberated nation will secure for democracy, and that Czecho-Moravia and Slovakia will be the staunchest strong-holds of democracy!</p>
   <p>Therefore, let the meeting become a telling proof of our devotion to the cause of a united Czechoslovak nation. Let the meeting show that Czechoslovak Chicago is the largest trans-oceanic colony, not only in number, but in sentiment as well!</p>
