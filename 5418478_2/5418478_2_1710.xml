   <p>In Chicago the foundation for the organization of the "American Association of Czechoslovak Engineers" was laid recently. Its main sections are - Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Architecture, Forestry and Agriculture, Industrial Relations.</p>
   <p>Other sections will be added as the occasion requires. Membership is limited to those who are actually engaged in the lines enumerated along technical lines without regard to previous education. In other words, the association will be strictly democratic and the barrier of educational standards will prevent no one interested from joining. However, a probationary period of six months will be insisted on, during which the candidate must submit a thesis on one of the subjects mentioned.</p>
   <p>There are three classes of members - active, residents of Chicago, corresponding members, those residing anywhere within the United States, and honorary and advisory members who shall be chosen for their interest in the Association.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1711.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Officers of the club are:</p>
   <p>F. J. Vodicka, President; F. J. Pohman, Secretary; and F. Tvrzicky, Treasurer.</p>
   <p>The Executive Committee, in addition to the officers, is composed of C. Teplan, V. Svagr and J. Fischer.</p>
   <p>While in the past we have discouraged numberless clubs formed just simply to create titles so that we could parade the streets with them, we feel that the "Czechoslovak Engineers" are serious because of the men affiliated with the organization. Much good is expected from the movement.</p>
   <p>All those interested should write to F. J. Vodicka, President, 108 South LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
