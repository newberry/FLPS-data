   <p>The United States Government has designated the period from September 28 to October 15, 1918, for the sale of bonds of the Fourth Liberty Loan. Pressure will be exerted upon financial institutions to participate in the purchase of these bonds in proportion to their financial situation. Aid societies, like many others, will have to participate, if they wish to enjoy the privileges and advantages granted to them by the Government.</p>
   <p>These conditions were thoroughly discussed in a joint meeting of the Ceske Sdruzeni Vypomocnych Spolku (Czech Association of Aid Societies), held on September 1, 1918. It was decided to advise our brotherhoods to subscribe for bonds to the amount of at least one per cent of their capital, so that each brother hood will have purchased a predetermined amount.</p>
   <p>During the sale of bonds of the third issue our work of supervising <pb facs="5418478_2_0468.jpg" n="2"/>subscriptions was not centralized in one location. As a result of this, we do not know to this day exactly how much our aid societies subscribed. To prevent a recurrence of this situation, our brotherhoods are requested to let our committee know the amount immediately after they have subscribed. This will enable us to give information promptly and accurately, whenever it is so desired by authorized sources. A committee of fourteen has been appointed to call on each of our Czech aid organizations, to counsel and enlighten them on the importance of purchasing these bonds. Mr. Joseph A. Brabec, 1428 West 18th Street, is secretary of the committee. The latter is going to supply the various brotherhoods with subscription lists.</p>
   <p>Our United Aid Societies will be represented at the State convention of aid societies, which is to be held in Streator, Illinois, from October 9 to October 11. As many delegates as possible should attend to demonstrate the strength of Czech aid societies.</p>

   <p>For the Czech Association of Aid Societies:</p>
   <p>John L. Novak, chairman,</p>
   <p>Joseph L. Voborsky, secretary.</p>
