   <p>The question of public ownership of utilities formed on of the main subjects of discussion of politico-economic problems some time ago; the populace of Chicago took a lively interest in it, the ownership of the street car lines receiving first consideration. The issue, however, lost much of its resiliency, by and by, and public opinion finally settled down upon the conviction that Chicago will be served best if said part of the traffic is left in the care of private concerns.</p>
   <p>Our street car transportation has improved considerably, indeed, within the past ten years. There is and immense difference between the system to-day and the regime under Yerkes of sad repute. This amelioration of conditions took place, however, automatically, so to speak, compelled by the categorical <pb facs="5418478_2_1569.jpg" n="2"/>imperative of the mighty growth of our metropolis. There is little credit coming to the traction magnates themselves, for, by improving service they did something for themselves, and everybody will believe that this "something" has not rendered them distitute.</p>
   <p>All this conceded, there is still no valid reason why the advantages offered by public ownership should not be seized. There is, in this respect, an excellent example on hand in the administration of the city of Glasgow, Scotland: The city has been operating the street car lines for over twenty years. It renders service better than any privately owned line, and for lower prices at that. It has accumulated a surplus, ample enough to accommodate the British government with a war loan of ten million. (Exchange not given.)</p>
   <p>What are specific instances needed for anyway? Were the Chicago street <pb facs="5418478_2_1570.jpg" n="3"/>car lines not a veritable gold mine, New York capital would not be trying so eagerly to monopolize them for an entire half century in advance, as they are doing at this moment.</p>
