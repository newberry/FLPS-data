   <p>The name of the Kostner family is surely known to every one of our fellow-countrymen of Chicago. The elder Mr. Kostner who died sometime ago belonged in the class of the oldest settlers of this city, having come to this city when a boy, and became well-known as a successful and enterprising man of business, and as one of the most ardent workers for our national cause. His wife, Mrs. Josephine Kostner also belongs to the foremost circles of our society, and through her amiable character has won great popularity.</p>
   <p>Joseph O. Kostner, their son, was born in Chicago thirty-five years ago. He received an excellent education beginning with the public schools, finishing at Northwestern University, and the Illinois college of law. He had at first intended to devote himself to the career of a lawyer, but he later decided, however, to enter his father's business, and became <pb facs="5418478_2_0256.jpg" n="2"/>partner in the Scully, Kostner Coal Company, of which his father had been a member. He then became engaged in the real estate and insurance business with steadily growing success.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kostner became active in public life at an early period, joining societies and organizations, in each of which his personality won a prominent place for him. It was only natural that his friends began to urge him to enter political life. As a candidate for alderman of the Thirty-fourth Ward, he lost by a small number of votes, but the experiences gained lifted him upon a pedestal high in the counsel of the Democratic party organization. Proof of this is his appointment by Mayor Harrison to the office as assistant to the commissioner of Public Works. During the four years of his tenure of office, the Czechs have gained in representation in political life as never before. There is no doubt that Kostner had contributed a lien's share to this influence in political life, and also that he had helped great numbers of our fellow-countrymen to obtain <pb facs="5418478_2_0257.jpg" n="3"/>work in the city, so that his office became a favorite gathering place for Czechs, and their language dominated almost continually. In the office of the commissioner of Public Works, he had ample opportunity to see that consideration was given to Czech contractors; he never forgot his duties toward his fellow-countrymen.</p>
   <p>After the change of administration, Kostner left the affairs of his office in the best of order. State auditor James J. Brady appointed him state bank examiner, for which office he was excellently qualified by his knowledge and experience. In 1916, Mr. Kostner was appointed secretary of the deep Waterways commission. This office he is holding to this day. Nevertheless he acceeded to the demands of his fellow-countrymen to compete for the office of alderman of the Thirty-fourth Ward, which needed two efficient aldermen, who would take care of the interests of the inhabitants against the arbitrary methods of the present administration. Both Mr. Kostner and Alderman John Toman are candidates for the offices <pb facs="5418478_2_0258.jpg" n="4"/>of alderman on the Democratic ticket. There is no doubt they Will emerge winners if the Czech voters do their duty. The political standing of Mr. Kostner may be judged from the fact that he has been Democratic committeeman for the Thirty-fourth Ward since the year 1911, and a member of the Democratic executive committee of Cook County for the same length of time. He is treasurer of the Slavia, member of the Ceska Beseda, Sokol Tabor Slovenske Lipy, Illinois Athletic Club, Chicago Athletic Association, Iroquois Club. C. S. B. S. (Czechcslovak Benevolent Society), Knights of Pythias, Odd Fellows, Royal League, Royal Accanum, B. P. O. Elks, and National Union. He is a thirty-second degree free mason, Knight Templar, and Shriner. He has been a member of the Chicago Real Estate board for many years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kostner is single, and lives with his widowed mother and five sisters at 1404 Independence Boulevard. Of Mr. Kostner can be said that he is one of the most prominent Czech-Americans. He is efficient, energetic and popular, besides being an ardent lover of the land of his forebears.</p>
