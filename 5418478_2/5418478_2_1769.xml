   <p>P.1--The name of Mr. Jaroslav Zmrhal is well known to the citizens of "Bohemian California," for every one knows that this energetic compatriot of ours served as teacher in the Farragut School on Spaulding Avenue and by his conscientiousness and zeal gained the respect not only of his pupils and their parents, but of his superiors and the general public. The result of his work was such striking evidence of his merit that the young man was noticed by the women's organization from the University Settlement, and he received a scholarship at the University of Chicago.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zmrhal made good use of this scholarship to study and yesterday completed his course, receiving the degree of bachelor of philosophy after less than half a year's study. This surely indicates exceptional talent and diligence. He set out to distinguish himself and succeeded, for he is blessed with a firm will.</p>
   <p>Mr. Zmrhal ought to serve as example to our fellow-countrymen, especially to those born here, who have a much better chance than immigrants to distinguish themselves in study and in other ways but seldom do so.</p>

   <p>Mr. Zmrhal, who now lives at 1350 Homan Avenue, came to America as a young man a few years ago.</p>
