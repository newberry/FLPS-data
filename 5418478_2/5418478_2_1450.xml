   <p>The recent meeting of the České Národní Sdružení V Americe (Bohemian National Alliance in America), held under the chairmanship of president, Dr. Ludvík Fisher, on the premises of the American State Bank, dealt with the communication of Paris Bohemians whom the French authorities recognized not as Austrians, but as members of the Bohemian nation, a nation friendly to Russia and France. This event, revealing the fundamental attitude of official France, is of extraordinary political importance for the consideration of the Bohemian question in general. The České Národní Sdružení in Chicago, with its branches in other American cities, has taken advantage of this opportunity to express its thanks to the President of the French Republic, to the French premier, and to the mayor of the City of Paris, as representatives of the French nation, for having taken this attitude, and to renew its assurance of <pb facs="5418478_2_1451.jpg" n="2"/>the most friendly feelings of Bohemian-America--a full eighth of the whole Bohemian nation--toward France. This expression is contained in a communication, of which copies will be delivered to the French Consulate in Chicago by a special delegation. These communications also express the hope that at the proper time, the desires and just claims of the Bohemian nation will be remembered.</p>
   <p>Mr. James Štépina reported on the contents of a letter from Mr. Thomas Čapek of New York. Mr. Capek advises that our "New York countrymen are willing to co-operate, but money collected in New York will remain there, and only New Yorkers will have the right to make dispositions concerning its use." In the discussion following this announcement, the point was stressed that the České Národní Sdružení in Chicago has always been of the opinion that collections made in various cities should be reported separately, and dispositions concerning their use should be made after an agreement has been reached among all the Bohemian communities concerned. The political action, however, <pb facs="5418478_2_1452.jpg" n="3"/>brings Bohemian-America into the international forum, and we must have one and only one form of leadership. Contributions in the way of informative articles, as well as other means of acquainting the public with the Bohemian question, are always welcome; but even those should be conceived from one single point of view and along previously agreed-upon lines.</p>
   <p>The Sdružení received with appreciation the report on Professor Jaroslav Zmrhal's lecture before the Chicago Press Club. The lecture was very well attended by the representatives of the American press and met with such success that it was published verbatim in the Club's official organ, which is sent to the editorial offices of all American newspapers. The Sdružení decided to purchase a substantial number of copies of the issue and send them to influential individuals for information about the Bohemian nation.</p>
