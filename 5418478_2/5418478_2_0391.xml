   <p>In the convention held by the League of Aid Societies of the State of Illinois, Mr. John L. Novak, president of the Czech section, made a speech which gives an accurate account of the activities of our aid societies.</p>
   <p>There are 130 Czech aid societies, 108 of which are League members. They pay their dues quite regularly. Very few of the societies are requesting loans, as there is not much money available. Most of the surplus is being invested in Liberty bonds. The Czechoslovaks have done their duty in this respect, and are going to continue to do so. They have also contributed most liberally to the Red Cross.....</p>
   <p>An outline of Czech history follows. The splendid successes of the Czechoslovak Army in France and Russia and on the Italian front are given due prominence.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0392.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Czechoslovaks in the United States subscribed $50,000,000 to the first three Liberty loans. This amount will be substantially increased in the campaign for the Fourth Liberty Loan. The Czechoslovak aid societies have subscribed $300,000 to the Liberty Loans to date, and have bought War Savings Stamps with great zeal.</p>
