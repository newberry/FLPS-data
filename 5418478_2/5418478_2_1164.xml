  <body>
   <p>Wishing to be entirely impartial in the sad affair of Dr. Iska, the publisher of Vesmir, and A. G. Melichar, we published reports which were both favorable and unfavorable.</p>
   <p>As we are convinced that further dissemination of reports of this affair would for the present be aimless, we decided to stop publication of all reports until some action is started against the newspaper, the Providence Journal. The starting of a lawsuit against this newspaper is the logical thing to do in this case.</p>
   <p>The accused, Dr. Iska, made a statement not only in this newspaper, but also in others, that he would make the trip to Providence, Rhode Island, Sunday night or Monday morning. Because Dr. Iska, at the Sunday meeting of the <pb facs="5418478_2_1165.jpg" n="2"/>Svobodna Obec (Congregation of Freethinkers), remarked that for the present he would not make the trip, and that he would await an answer from the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni (Bohemian National Alliance), we are convinced that any more writing on the subject would be purposeless.</p>
   <p>We wish to inform our readers that we are motivated by a desire to be impartial, and that in this decision they should seek no ulterior motive.</p>
