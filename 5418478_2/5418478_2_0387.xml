   <p>It seems that at last citizens of Bohemian origin are beginning to be interested in a question which is the most important one of the whole present political campaign. They are trying to learn the truth about the League of Nations, they want to know all about the Versailles Treaty, and they wish to find out definitely which is right, the Democrat who favors the League, or the Republican who repudiates it.</p>
   <p>That the interest in this question, which is of such importance, especially for us Czechoslovaks, is growing, was proved last evening at a consultation meeting held at the Pilsen Park pavilion for the purpose of arousing interest in the League of Nations. The meeting was well attended and sincere enthusiasm prevailed. Ambassador Karel Vopicka presided. The speakers were Congressman Adolph J. Sabath, State Representative Joseph Placek, Reverend Frantisek Jedlicka, Mr. Joseph Kralicek, Mr. Felix Janovsky, and Alderman Anton J. Cermak. All the speakers demonstrated why the Czechoslovak voters, either as American <pb facs="5418478_2_0388.jpg" n="2"/>citizens or as sons and daughters of the Czechoslovak nation, should make every effort to bring about ratification of the League of Nations by the United States, so that the League can begin performing its useful function. No special interest in it was evident among us up to the present time, but the indifference is rapidly disappearing.</p>
   <p>That our people are fully awakened, and that they know where their place is and where their interests lie, will be proved tomorrow evening. At the meeting to be held tomorrow at 8 P. M. in the Bohemian-American Hall, competent speakers will explain what the League of Nations is, what the enactments of the Versailles Treaty are in regard to the League of Nations, the benefits derived from it, and the inevitable consequences if the League is not ratified by America, and cannot perform its function properly.</p>
   <p>Mr. Karel Vopicka, Congressman A. J. Sabath, Reverend Jedlicka, Mr. Frana Klepal, and Mr. Andrej Sustek will be the speakers.</p>
