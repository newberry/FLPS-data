   <p>Novak elected by a large majority. Foucek, also, is alderman of the 10th ward.</p>
   <p>Bohemians in the 12th ward are rejoicing because Mr. Gervenka was elected. Cervenka, April-fooled Svornost and Narod.</p>
   <p>Rhode, the enemy of Bohemian people was decisively defeated in the 11th ward.</p>
   <p>The results of yesterday's election positively did not surprise us, we expected it to turn out just as it did. We were acquainted with the intentions of the voters in the Bohemian wards. We knew how all honorable citizens condemned the unprecedented mud-slinging resorted to by certain individuals and two Bohemian newspapers, for purely personal reasons. We knew how Rhode was hated among honorable citizens and we also knew very well, that our countrymen and all <pb facs="5418478_2_0296.jpg" n="2"/>democrats in the 12th ward would uphold Cervenka. The thing that pleases us most, however, is the fact, that Bohemians thoroughly destroyed the plans of Mahoney, Cusack and Burke, and in that manner, assured themselves respect and recognition from the leaders of the political parties. No one will dare to attempt to invite a quarrel among us again, in the hope of profiting by our disagreement. Yesterday's happening, will be a reminder, and a warning to all tricksters for a long time.</p>
   <p>Voters throughout the city have condemned these malicious reformers of the municipal league. These people wanted to become dictators of our voters, they wanted to designate for whom they should vote and for whom they should not. They proclaimed every one a scoundrel, who would not sign up with them. Their chief officers grafted and tried to get control of public property.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0297.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Narod and Svornost, papers of much varying tendencies, during the last campaign, vied one with the other in heaping abuse upon Bohemian candidates. In this way they aroused resistance not only towards themselves, but against the candidates whom they appointed. So perhaps they will take it as a lesson for the future and will not try to destroy some countryman, who does not want to whistle according to their notes.</p>
   <p>The Chicago voters have shown considerable interest in the question of public ownership of street railways, gas and electric plants, was also a pleasing indication in yesterday's election. The people are for the referendum, they want to take legislative powers into their own hands, they want radical reforms in public management and showed this in yesterday's election.</p>
   <p>Political parties, if they wish to continue to exist, surely will take notice and endeavor to remain in favor by doing the will of the people.</p>
