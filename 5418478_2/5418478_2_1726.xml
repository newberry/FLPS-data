   <p>We always welcome the news that one of our fellow countrymen has become known for special achievements, or has attained a position of significance in American society or in other nationalities. We always give space in our paper to such achievements. It gives us particular pleasure today, because we are reporting about a young man who has won distinction in a field not usually chosen by our people.</p>
   <p>Mr. George Jenista has been appointed regular professor of electrical engineering at Northwestern University, one of the leading seats of higher learning, prominent not only in Chicago, but in the entire United States. The professor, who is only thirty-seven years of age, hails from Caledonia, Wisconsin. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin, he was employed in Chicago by the Chicago Telephone Company, and also lectured on mathematics at DePaul University for seven years.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jenista is the first Czech to occupy a professor's chair at Northwestern <pb facs="5418478_2_1727.jpg" n="2"/>University. He is a son-in-law of the Reverend Dr. V. Vanek of Chicago, and is widely known in our circles.</p>
