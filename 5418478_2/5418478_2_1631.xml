   <p>The Chicago American, which is published and owned by Mr. Hearst, of unsavory repute, has been printing a series of articles headed, "Our Little Daughters," as an initiation of a crusade against certain halls in which dancing and other entertainment are offered to the patrons. These halls are offhand branded as places where the body and mind of young girls are exposed to moral corruption, where drunkenness is in order, and which lead directly to the police courts. The avowed purpose of the articles is a hint for the authorities to close these halls and disrupt any kind of pleasure that may be derived from them. There are some good points in the movement, if only those propagating it would clear up the issue, begin at the right place, and use discrimination.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1632.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Because good judgment is not found in the articles, we object to them; their survey does not extend only to places where an orgy is indulged in every evening - these articles invade our immigrant dance halls; they attack our places of decent recreation.</p>
   <p>The venom of the reports is especially directed against two of our halls; one article turned against the hall of the Sokol Chicago, the other against the Pilsen Auditorium. The female writer of the articles visited the Sokol Chicago Hall on the occasion of an entertainment given by the "Ynot Club," and the Pilsen Auditorium during an evening arranged by the "Moon Glide Club." We shall not dwell upon the qualities of these two clubs, as we are not acquainted with them. However, we are concerned with the insinuations cast upon the two Halls, as we consider them as our own.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1633.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>We are ready to concede the fact that much of the entertainment of our dance halls needs moderation, but we shall not admit that conditions are such as described in the articles. If their writer had gathered better information she would have learned that our own entertainments, as well as others, provided by some non-Czech associations, move within the narrow limit of what is permissible. It is not the hall or the owner, but the arrangements committee that is to be held responsible for the excessive emanations of hilarity and temperament.</p>
   <p>The Sokol Chicago Hall is owned by the Sokol Chicago Gymnastic Society, which celebrated its twenty-fifth birthday only a few days ago. The ideals <pb facs="5418478_2_1634.jpg" n="4"/>of the association are well known; they are national and cultural. They lie entirely outside the realm of judgment as passed in the article mentioned, and beyond the range of the magnifying glass used by the authoress of "Our Little Daughters."</p>
   <p>We take exception against similar attacks because they are indirectly aimed at our girls of whom it cannot be generally contended that they drink immoderately, permit improper familiarity to the men in their company, or conduct themselves publicly in a manner not fit for decent women. Our Czech girls frequent, as far as our knowledge goes, orderly entertainments only, which they can enjoy without detriment to their reputation. They are usually chaperoned by both parents, or at least by <pb facs="5418478_2_1635.jpg" n="5"/>their mothers, who certainly are their best guardians. The girls from our middle class and from the laboring strata do not need any one to control their behavior. Their bearing decidedly does not call for any of the diverse morals commissions, not to mention the supervision of the Chicago American. They have enough judgment to regulate their own deportment.</p>
   <p>We have already admitted that there are exceptions. They are, however, scarce. They are to be looked for in clubs and club affairs, which are in no way connected with the owners of the places. Our halls should be stricken from the list of objectionables. More so, as there are many others available for sound criticism, particularly those of the so-called better American societies, some of which could be pointed at as the very hotbeds of sin, ill behavior, and scandalous revelry. These places are not even <pb facs="5418478_2_1636.jpg" n="6"/>remotely considered for an entertainment by our girls, who would blush for shame and recoil on their threshold.</p>
   <p>Are places such as these unknown to the Chicago American? Is that paper ignorant of their existence in some fashionable hotels within the Loop, where the midnight closing hour initiated veritable orgies to which the attention of the police had to be called? How about the cabarets in some downtown hotels where the Merriam Commission uncovered debauchery that defies description? Does the Chicago American know nothing of the club rooms of the wealthy, the "creme of society," the unbridled carousals which remind one of the one time "Red Light District," where ladies in gorgeous attire imbibe until they sink into a <pb facs="5418478_2_1637.jpg" n="7"/>drunken stupor and are then brought home by gentlemen in dress suits and patent leather pumps, equally paralyzed, and who are not necessarily their husbands. Were the Chicago American an honest sheet, it would expose these places before all others as those for which an institution like the morals court has been established. This court would, however, prove utterly inadequate if all that mire should be brought before it. Immorality and scandalous behavior are not rampant among the immigrant population, for that privilege has always been enjoyed by the upper and rich classes, simply because these latter have a monopoly on immunity.</p>
   <p>After all, we would not worry about the whole issue if it were not for the probability that the Chicago American, after an aggression against <pb facs="5418478_2_1638.jpg" n="8"/>one hall, will proceed against all of our own halls. Bearing this in mind we rise in protest in behalf of the Czech halls. we know too well how much sacrifice and toil was the price of the creation of our halls. We know equally as well, how much these localities have contributed to our national, economic, and social life and do not, therefore, intend to silently stand aside and endure what a Pharisaic paper, foreign to our tongue, has to say about our places of assembly.</p>
   <p>It surprises us that it is Florence Patton who supplies this spurious news about our Czech halls to the Chicago American, whose readers have to depend upon the English language for information. She is the sister of Alice Patek, well-known actress who scored a marked success in the play "Help <pb facs="5418478_2_1639.jpg" n="9"/>Wanted," and the daughter of Mr. Patek, publisher of an English language paper in Denver. The family is of Czech descent, and Florence Patek works for the Chicago American under the name of Florence Patton. It grieves us to meet with the name on this occasion, and, at the same time, with indignation, because the young lady would do much better if she cleaned the doors of the high-class American society of the clotted mire and fecal garbage accumulated there instead of seeking to sweep some dust from the doors of people upon whose morality she will find fewer stains - we mean our Czech immigrants.</p>
