   <p>The Bohemian National Alliance and the Czech Sokol Community are making strenuous efforts to fulfill their promises to recruit Czech and Slovak able-bodied men for service in a Czecho-Slovak regiment. Their endeavor is bearing noticeable fruit. The announcement of the great agitation meeting which is to be held today in the hall of Sokol Havlicek Tyrs has resulted in many enlistments already.</p>
   <p>It was stipulated with the authorities that the connection between the Czecho-Slovak regiment and the United States Army is calculated for the duration of the War only; also that the volunteers will not be kept in reserve after the War, but will be free to pursue their civilian occupations.</p>
   <p>One distinct advantage is offered to the volunteers if they tender their <pb facs="5418478_2_1063.jpg" n="2"/>services without compulsion: They will be in a preferred status for advancement, to the ranks of non-commissioned and commissioned officers. As the Army grows, so progresses the advancement.</p>
   <p>The establishment of the Czecho-Slovak regiment is practically assured. The vital point is the rate at which men sign up. (Follows list of Czech recruits.)</p>
