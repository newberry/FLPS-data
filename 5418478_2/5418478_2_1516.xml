   <p>The American newspapers seem to be so very keenly interested in the question of who is going to be the successor of the assassinated Archduke and successor to the Austrian throne, what he may and may not do, how conditions will develop in Austria, as if everything; were good, rosy, and beautiful in this country and we in American had nothing to worry about. However, we are of the opinion that the American newspapers should be more deeply interested in matters which touch us much more directly than the Austrian succession. To correct our own conditions would require all the attention of our journals, and much more. Thus their too great interest is definitely misplaced. It does not do us any more good than showing interest in conditions of the Moon.</p>
