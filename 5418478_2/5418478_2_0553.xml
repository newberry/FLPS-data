   <p>The question of licenses for the sale of alcoholic beverages in places of entertainment and at gatherings of various sociable organizations appears to have been definitely settled. News recently came from Washington, D. C. to the effect that, after conferences with Secretary of the Navy Daniels, the Federal Government has decided to prohibit the issuance of licenses, at least for the duration of the war. This is a war measure. The government wishes that it be complied with, as it is considered essential and necessary for the successful prosecution of the war. It is, therefore, imperative that every good citizen heed the order.</p>
   <p>Many clubs, associations, etc., will, no doubt, be hard hit by the measure. With high expenses connected with the arrangement of entertainments, the very continuance of social affairs seems out of the question. Deficits will be frequent. The natural result will be a marked decrease in the number of <pb facs="5418478_2_0554.jpg" n="2"/>entertainments, and a consequent curtailment of social activities. The taboo on the sale of alcoholic beverages does not come as a surprise, for it was rumored for weeks that the end of the bar license was in sight.</p>
   <p>The decision of the Government is evidently the result of pressure exacted by prohibition elements. It cannot be denied, however, that those in charge of arrangements of entertainments are often to blame. Decent clubs have always conducted their affairs within the confines of the law; they are not the guilty parties. The blame is with diverse, undercover, and justly suspicioned clubs that sold liquor to soldiers and navymen, well knowing what they were doing. Police authorities should have used discrimination in issuing licences to shady elements. Orderly organizations have to suffer with others who shun the limelight, and who should, indeed, be put out of existence.</p>
   <p>The Cesko-Slovanska Podporujici Spolecnost (Czecho-Slavonic Aid Society) discussed a motion that the Society pay all dues for its members now enlisted in <pb facs="5418478_2_0555.jpg" n="3"/>military service. The origin of this proposal was a letter from Captain Fierlinger, representative of the military committee of the Czechoslovak National Council, asking that this privilege be granted to the volunteers of the Czechoslovak Army. The Narodni Hlavni Rad (National Main Order) publishes the following announcement in regard to the request:</p>
   <p>"The National Main Order of the C.S.P.S. recommends the proposition to the consideration of the various orders, urging them to grant the benefit to all members who have enlisted as volunteers in the Czechoslovak Army or in the United States Army or Navy, and also to draftees. The main Order of the C.S.P.S. itself has no funds out of which it could pay these dues; it also cannot impose special dues upon members out of which these benefits would be paid. The various orders of the C.S.P.S. should take this burden upon themselves. They will be able to discharge this patriotic duty without seriously straining their purses. We are asking the orders to pay for soldiers wherever necessary. We also ask them to take special care of our boys in the Czechoslovak Army, and also care for their families.</p>
