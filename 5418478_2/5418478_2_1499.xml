   <p>These days, when the most terrible, most bloody war the world has ever seen is raging in Europe; where things are happening that will forever remain in man's memory; and where, in fact, new history is being made, will show the amount of vital energy a nation has, will show how courageous, brave, and self-sacrificing a son it has given. And its fate will be in accord with the nation's merits.</p>
   <p>Our country's fate is the one principally involved in this war. Great nations cannot easily be destroyed. But a small nation, especially when it is so unfortunately situated as ours is, may easily become a prey of which the victor can dispose as he pleases. This war will bring to the Bohemian nation either complete liberty and a new, happy life, or a bondage greater than the present one, and the victor will use all possible means for its annihilation.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1500.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All its sons, all good Bohemian men and women, must put forth every effort in order that our nation may be strong, keen, full of energy, and capable of vigorous life in these fateful times. This applies also to us, the American Bohemians. We cannot bleed for our native land, but we can help mitigate the terrible effects of the war and instill new hope and strength in the hearts of our brothers and sisters, so that they may not lose faith in themselves and faith in the future of the whole nation.</p>
   <p>Conditions in Bohemia and Moravia must be terrible. All men capable of military service have been called to arms and are forced to fight in a war that, to each true Bohemian, is a criminal one. But there was no way out. The farmers had to leave their crops, most of which are rotting in the fields because there are no people and teams, horses, or oxen to harvest them; workingmen had to leaven the shops and factories which are now closed; women, old men, and children have been left in a situation which is growing more desperate from day to day. But the full horror of the situation will not be revealed until the winter. Whether the war is over by that time or whether it is still <pb facs="5418478_2_1501.jpg" n="3"/>going on, there will be greater misery in our country than there has been from time immemorial.</p>
   <p>Hence, we happier ones who live in this free country, a country which is not a victim of war madness, must be ready to extend our help. It will have to be great help, enormous help, because it will have to meet a great, enormous need. We must try to take the place, at least to some extent, of the husbands, fathers, and supporters of the widows and orphans of fallen Bohemian soldiers. We must protect them from hunger; we must help in healing the wounds of our brothers who will be returning crippled from the battlefields; we will have to give all we have so that our dear ones over the sea, in our unfortunate native land, may not perish from misery and despair.</p>
   <p>Let us forget all discord, all dissentions, all differences! Let us all get together in this great national--charitable--work. Let us be nothing but Bohemians, all sons of one and the same mother who is calling on us for help. He who refuses now will never have the right to call himself her son.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1502.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>We are convinced that our action to help, our collections for the suffering families of those who have given their lives on the battlefields, for families of poor Bohemian soldiers, for the sick, the wounded, and the crippled, for everyone who needs and deserves help, will unite all of us into one great family, whose members will vie with each other in generosity, charity, and sacrifice.</p>
   <p>When this happens, we shall have the happy satisfaction of a duty well done; we shall be able to approach our brothers with a clear conscience; and when the wounds inflicted by the war are healed, we shall be happy in the knowledge that they have been healed with our help.</p>
   <p>Whatever we give to our brothers and sisters in the old country, we give to ourselves. Therefore, let us give; let us give quickly; and let us give all we can!</p>
