<title level="a">THE FIRST CZECH JUDGE OF THE HIGHER COURTS</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>One of the best known public officials is unquestionably our fellow-countryman, Joseph Sabath, who worked himself up from comparatively small circumstances to the position of a judge of the Superior Court of Cook County. The career of Mr. Sabath is identified with assiduousness, energy, and perseverance, three characteristics which many immigrants have contributed to the upbuilding of this great republic. What Mr. Sabath is today, he has become by his own efforts, and he may well be proud of his success which placed him in one of the highest offices.</p>
   <p>Judge Sabath was born March 2, 1870 in the little village of Zabor, Bohemia, the son of poor people, and his youth was not bedded with roses. He started out in the village school, and came to the United States when a boy of fifteen. Here he had to go through hard times, typical of the average immigrant life, working in various factories and establishments. However, he did not fail to observe that this was a country of great opportunities for him who does not become discouraged by initial difficulties and disappointments. He began to study the English language very diligently, and made <pb facs="5418478_2_1735.jpg" n="2"/>remarkable progress while studying other subjects evenings, and during his spare time. Of the plain country lad had become a persevering student, who after twelve years of hard work, graduated from Northwestern University to become a lawyer and a typical American self-made man.</p>
   <p>Many sincere friends came to the aid of the young lawyer, who, in his profession, became propserous. Sabath, the lawyer, gave each case his undivided attention, and gained the fullest confidence of his clients; his thorough knowledge of the law became a byword.</p>
   <p>One of the most intricate cases of his practice was the defense of Marie Sladek, accused of murder perpetrated on her parents by poisoning them with arsenic. A brilliant plea brought about a verdict of not guilty.</p>
   <p>The telling successes in his profession made Sabath eligible for a candidate on the judge's bench, he being the favorite of the Czech element. The election in 1910 brought Sabath a number of votes such as no candidate for <pb facs="5418478_2_1736.jpg" n="3"/>the Municipal Court bench had ever received. Our fellow-countrymen were, of course, most active in his election, a fact which the Judge never forgot.</p>
   <p>He was a man quite extraordinarily fitted for the Municipal bench, having eleven languages at his command, he was able to conduct the business of the court in any of them, depending on the language of the parties before him. In the Court of Domestic Relations, where a large percentage of the immigrant element seeks redress, his linguistic accomplishments were especially appreciated.</p>
   <p>The Judge remained on the Municipal bench for six years. He resigned to take the place of Richard E. Burke, Judge of the Superior Court of Cook County, who died in 1916, just a few days after his re-election.</p>
   <p>Judge Sabath was appointed by Governor Edward F. Deneen, who decided upon him as the best qualified among many aspirants. He was again placed on the <pb facs="5418478_2_1737.jpg" n="4"/>Superior bench in this year's election. The Czechs will thus have one of their own in a highly responsible office.</p>
   <p>The esteem in which Judge Sabath was held by his profession manifested itself in the degree of Master of Laws conferred upon him by the Chicago Law School, an honor of which but very few can boast. Judge Sabath is at present a member of the faculty of that school, lecturing on the theory and practice of law. He is very popular among students of the school, and similarly among the litigants of his court.</p>
   <p>Judge Sabath is also active in social life. He is a member of the Chicago and State of Illinois Bar Associations, chairman of the Citizens' Traffic &amp; Safety Commission of Chicago, a Mason, Elk, Moose, and a member of a large number of benevolent, philanthropic and charitable organizations. He belongs to the Democratic party.</p>
   <p>The matrimony into which Mr. Sabath entered with Miss Regina Mayer in 1888 <pb facs="5418478_2_1738.jpg" n="5"/>is a very happy one; three children issued from it: Albert, legal representative of the Chicago Bonding and Insurance Company, Milton J. Sabath, and Mrs. Stella Grollman. The residence of the Judge and his wife is on 5046 Grand Boulevard.</p>
