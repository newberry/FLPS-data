   <p>The sham battle which was staged in Lincoln Park a few days ago did not have for its purpose the entertainment of the public as it seemed to some. The military display did not do anything like depicting actual combat, in fact, it fell short by a long way of achieving this end. It created in the minds of many the misconception that War is mere play.</p>
   <p>What the exhibition should have accomplished was the realization that the United States is actually at War. It is high time to awaken the people to the fact that there is no room for toying, and that we are fighting a great military power ....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0965.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Even Theodore Roosevelt, the famous Rough Rider, still believes that all that is left to do is to drum up one or two divisions, and send them to Europe, where they are to cut everything to pieces.</p>
   <p>Lord Northcliffe recently pointed out that we see the War in a rosy light, thinking that a few ten thousand soldiers will do for Europe.....</p>
   <p>It seems that the American people have not warmed up for the occasion until compulsory service is introduced.....Up to this time, most of the patriots have been wont to soothe their conscience by shouting phrases, flashing the colors, and assuring the President of their loyalty, while the fulfillment of the military duty is accommodatingly conceded by them to others. Now it will be everybody's inning who is able-bodied to bear arms. If all could start as commissioned officers, no compulsion might be needed. Incidentally, Uncle Sam wants more rookies than officers, and so no one will escape, if he is able-bodied and not over the age limit.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0966.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>After this has been accomplished, there will be only two kinds of patriots here: those who follow the Star Spangled Banner into the fight, and those who stay at home to cultivate their home gardens or farms and harvest foodstuffs in abundance so that the United States will not be in the same predicament as are the European countries. The latter kind of patriots is equally important as the former, if the United States is to emerge from the War victoriously.</p>
