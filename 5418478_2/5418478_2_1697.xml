   <p>I</p>
   <p>The Sanitary Board of Chicago has yielded to the pressure of a few women and has agreed to recommend to the State Legislature the adoption of a eugenic law which provides that a prospective bride and groom will have to supply proof that neither is afflicted with an infectious or communicable disease before they are granted a marriage license.</p>
   <p>It would seem that the State Legislature should require the Board, and the women under whose pressure the Board is acting, to submit proof of their own--sanity.</p>
   <p>II</p>
   <p>It has become customary for Chicago politicians to run for a new and higher <pb facs="5418478_2_1698.jpg" n="2"/>office to which they have been elected by the people. In those cases in which they get the new office, the taxpayers are put to an additional expense because an election must be held to fill the office they have left; and such an election costs quite a few thousands of dollars, at the very least.</p>
   <p>There should be a law compelling such men either to finish the term of office they are holding, or to resign before they start their political campaign for a new office--not after the election, when they are assured a fat job, whether they have been elected or not.</p>
   <p>Such men show a desire for higher office which can be called nothing else than vanity--vanity and utter disregard of the trust placed in them by the people who have elected them. Such men should never be elected to a new office, or re-elected to their old one.</p>

   <p>III</p>
   <p>Among the guests of honor at the ball of our Spolek Ceskych Hostinskych (Association of Bohemian Innkeepers) was Mayor Harrison. What a pity he did not bring along a handful of the die-hard reformers who see progress for humanity in absolute prohibition, or, if that cannot be achieved, in partial prohibition, such as that contemplated in the proposed ordinance requiring bars to close at one o'clock in the morning, when beer is served in connection with social affairs, dances, and other quite innocent and proper occasions. They would have seen, as the mayor did, that a decent bar which remains open after one o'clock in connection with a social affair has absolutely nothing immoral about it, and that efforts for reform in this respect are without a basis, and are completely out of place.</p>
