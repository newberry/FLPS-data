   <p>President Wilson said: "We do not want to reduce or change the Austrian monarchy in the least." These words will no doubt be greeted with extreme satisfaction in Vienna as well as in Budapest. The question remains as to how these words are compatible with the principle for which the World War is being prosecuted by us.</p>
   <p>The aim of the War is the liberation of all the nations, which, of course, includes the smaller ones as well. We tremble with terror when we think of the President's words "....it does not concern us how the Austrians arrange their own living."</p>
   <p>Who is meant by Austrians? They are Germans and Magyars who have been ruling in Austria for more than half a century. Whose lives will they try to regulate?</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0738.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Not only their own, but those of the subjugated nations as well--the Czechs, Poles, Jugoslavs, Italians, Rumanians, and others. We believe that the President's words have a meaning different from this.</p>
   <p>The words must have a different meaning--we firmly believe! President Wilson is too progressive a man, indeed, to permit a thing such as this.</p>
