<title level="a">THE BOHEMIAN ACTION IN PARIS</title><title level="a" type="sub">(By the Bohemian-American Press Bureau)</title></bibl>

   <p>That the action of our countrymen residing in the capital of France is serious, indeed, is proved by the fact that they are publishing a newspaper, the Na Zdar, which is printed in the French language. A few copies of this paper have been received by the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau). This publication, printed on two pages of the large newspaper size, carries not only timely articles, speculative essays, and news items written by capable and well-informed countrymen, but also contributions of men whose names are well known throughout the French nation, one of whom is Mr. J. Sansbouf, for many years president of the French Gymnastic Federation; another, Writer J. Denis; then J. Garat, deputy and member of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs; such authors as Henry Goujon, the Alsatian patriot, Regamy; and many others. The two principal men among the Bohemian contributors are the editor of the paper, Mr. J. Hoffman-Kratky, and the noted painter, Mr. Frantisek Krupka.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1454.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The twelve columns of reading matter offered to the French public by the paper are a compilation of facts, speculations, and opinions exclusively concerning the Bohemian nation and its indisputable right to independence. The paper also contains the texts of official manifestations by which the Bohemian colony in Paris advised the president of the French Republic, Mr. Poincare, the French Minister of War, and the Russian Ambassador to France, Izvolsky, of the formation of the League of Bohemian Volunteers who are now fighting side by side with the French, Belgians, and English against the archenemy of Slavdom. Also, the official communication of the Paris Municipal Council to the Bohemian colony is an exceedingly interesting document. Not a single Bohemian living outside of the old country should neglect to secure the issues of the Na Zdar. These will become important historical documents of the war of the civilized world against German imperialism.</p>
   <p>The paper reminds the French nation that the Bohemian Diet expressed the Bohemian nation's sincere sympathy to the defeated French nation when the German army surrounded Paris with a ring of cannon and bayonets in 1870.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1455.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Elsewhere we read that two of the Bohemians who helped defend Paris on that occasion and fought on its bastions, our countrymen Vyhnalek and Mila, still live in Paris. The history of Bohemia's oppression under the Austrian yoke is presented in a short but very excellent article by the historian, Professor J. Denis, himself. This is the way his article ends: "The measure is full. The Bohemians now have repudiated the contract made in days of delusion with the Hapsburgs, who have been violating it from the very beginning. The Bohemians existed before Austria and will exist after it. The hour of their national freedom has come. The contract between the Hapsburgs and the Austrian Slavs is torn to pieces. A new life is beginning for the oppressed Slovaks, Moravians, Bohemians, and Silesians. The day of glory for the scions of Zizka's comrades is here. The independent 'Cechia' [personification of the lands of the Bohemians, Cechs] will group around itself all her sons scattered from the slopes of the Tatra Mountains to the foothills of the Rudohori [German: Erzgebirge, a mountain chain forming the north-east border of Bohemia]. She will resume her seat among independent nations, will again take up her mission, which demands that she be the connecting <pb facs="5418478_2_1456.jpg" n="4"/>link between the western and eastern European civilizations. She will again become the apostle of the gospel of liberty, justice, and humanity which her Peter Chelcicky taught in the fifteenth century.</p>
   <p>"Francis Joseph has lived just long enough to pay a just price for his faults and crimes. A stupid legend has lately been spun around the atrocious oldster who ascended the throne with bloody hands and is ending his rule with a horrible orgy of murders. This vile knight has not had enough self-esteem to remember his degrading humiliation and has agreed to become the tail end (sic) [stooge] of the Hohenzollerns who have raped his capital. This Catholic lord has sent his regiments to help those who are burning cathedrals. His private life has been without dignity, his public life without honor. He has betrayed his most devoted servants, violated his most sacred vows. A husband without kindness, a father without heart, petty pietist without faith, king without virtue, nobleman without nobleness, he is a fitting end to the Hapsburg dynasty which has not produced a single great ruler, a single honest man. With him goes Austria, about whom Gladstone used to say that it has done <pb facs="5418478_2_1457.jpg" n="5"/>nothing but evil. There is no place for it in that Europe which now is being born. Let the gravediggers haul away its cadaver! May a world of peace, liberty, and brotherhood take its place! Make room for the Bohemian nation!"</p>
   <p>These are the words of farewell to Austria from a man who, next to Luetzow and Leger, has done most to make the wide world acquainted with the Bohemian nation.</p>
   <p>In another article, the brothers J. and F. Regamy compare Bohemia to Alsace. Painter Frantisek Krupka discusses the future form of the Bohemian State in an article entitled "La Boheme". The deputy and expert in international law, J. Garat, contributes a long article, "Les Tcheques," in which he translates stirring stanzas of Kolar's "Slavy Dcera" (Daughter of Glory). Henry Goujon has addressed sincere words of thanks to the Bohemians for their friendship toward France and to the four hundred Bohemian volunteers who have entered into the service of the French Republic.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1458.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>The paper also contains news from Bohemia which, however, came from Paris to America; and finally the text of the proclamation of the political committee to the French press and French authorities explaining the relationship and attitude of the Bohemians and other Slavs toward the warring powers.</p>
   <p>This, the first issue of the paper containing so many French contributions of the highest quality, written by prominent Frenchmen, is sufficient proof that the action of our Paris countrymen is serious, seriously conducted, and that it deserves the support of Bohemians in America. It is only fitting that we should recommend that our countrymen here help to support the paper Na Zdar so that its publication will not have to be discontinued. This may be done by subscribing for it. The paper will always have a considerable value, even for those who do not know the French language. For those who read French, it will be a reminder of these stirring times in which the fate of the Bohemian nation is being decided. In future years, it will be of great historical value.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1459.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>All those who can afford to do it and believe that it is necessary to keep informing the world about the cultural level, the desires, and the rights of the Bohemian nation should send us their contributions for the political action of our Paris countrymen. Even if it should not succeed in all its efforts, it can never fail in one: It will be calling the attention of influential people to our nation. True enough, we in America have actions of our own, particularly the war relief and the no less important local political action which will be a great publicity campaign, if nothing else. We think, however, that there are enough countrymen here in America who can afford generous contributions to our local activities and also substantially support the work of our Paris countrymen.</p>
   <p>The subscription price of Na Zdar, which will appear fortnightly during the war, is five French francs, or one dollar. This may be sent, together with any other contributions you may want to make, to the treasurer of the Ceske Narodni Sdruzeni V Americe (Bohemian National Alliance in America), Mr. James F. Stepina, 1825 Blue Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
