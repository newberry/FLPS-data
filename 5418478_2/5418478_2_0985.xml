   <p>Milan Lusk, violin virtuoso and son of a well-known Chicago-Czech lawyer, was forced to fight in the War on the side of Austria. During the time spent there, he gave many concerts for the benefit of the Austrian Red Cross. This eased his enforced sojourn in that country where Czech-Americans were known as staunch friends of the Allies. The Austrian government presented him with a cross. That token of recognition bears the inscription "Gott Strafe England!" (May the Lord punish England!), which was one of the field cries of the Central Powers. Mr. Lusk keeps it as a sad souvenir of the conditions he had observed, and of the hardships he had to undergo before he finally succeeded in returning to his native Chicago.</p>
   <p>During his travels through Allied countries he continued his humanitarian activities by giving concerts to aid the Allied Red Cross. For this noble <pb facs="5418478_2_0986.jpg" n="2"/>work, he was awarded a distinction in the form of a cross, which he treasures as a keepsake.</p>
   <p>As already reported, Mr. Lusk has returned to American only recently. He will appear before the Chicago public in a concert May 6.</p>
