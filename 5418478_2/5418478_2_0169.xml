<title level="a">BOHEMIAN COMMITTEE CALLS ON MAYOR THOMPSON</title></bibl>
   </div>

  <body>
   <p>Yesterday Mayor Thompson received in his office a committee consisting of representatives of the Straz Osvojenych (Guard of the Liberated), the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Association of Bohemian Free Thought Schools), and other organizations under the leadership of the Alderman of the Twelfth Ward. The Mayor listened with interest to the story of the incident that caused the committee to seek the Mayor's help and intervention. He was informed that the resolution, submitted by the Bohemians to the Chicago Board of Education, protesting an article contained in a textbook used by our public schools, which eulogizes the German Kaiser and depresses and discourages the republican spirit in our youth, was not even read in the meeting of the Board's committee on school management--while the resolution of German associations which, in fact, was the reply to and defense against the Bohemian resolution, was given full attention and the request contained therein granted. After learning all the particulars of the incident, the Mayor realized and admitted that the <pb facs="5418478_2_0170.jpg" n="2"/>Bohemians were not treated justly and properly. He gave the committee a letter to the president of the School Board expressing his regret that a public body, such as the Chicago Board of Education or its committee on school management, has shown citizens, coming before it with a complaint and a request, so unsatisfactory and disparaging a treatment, and requesting the president to see to it that the matter be taken again into proper and thorough consideration. The committee will deliver the letter this afternoon at four o'clock when the Board holds a meeting.</p>
