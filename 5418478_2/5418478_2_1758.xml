   <p>Assistant City Prosecutor, Jerry Viterna, well-known attorney, is being relieved by Attorney Otto Kerner, from his manifold activities with Czech clients in Chicago courts, especially as an attorney for parties with claims against various benevolent associations. Mr. Viterna has been in office since the last municipal elections. The city attorney's office is losing a conscientious and strict prosecutor of notorious violators of the law, but at the same time an official who showed indulgence where the case merited leniency. Mr. Viterna was given the choice by authoritative circles between the office of attorney in the department for special taxation and that of an assistant corporation counsel. He chose the latter, which pays $2,800 per year.</p>
   <p>We hope that his successor will enjoy the same confidence of the public, and that he will do all in his power to employ equity in the cases of our fellow-citizens deserving of it.</p>
