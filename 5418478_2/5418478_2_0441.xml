   <p>At the recent conference of Secretaries of the American Socialist Party at Chicago, a memorandum was presented by the Czechoslovak branch of the party; signed, also by the Serbian and Slovenian sections. The memorandum demands that the American Socialist Party change its antiwar attitude for one supporting the war.</p>
   <p>The three following paragraphs best express the trend of the memorandum:</p>
   <p>"The war and peace program of President Wilson, which today is timely and acute in all decisive respects, is absolutely democratic and expresses those principles which international socialism always has proclaimed. And these principles remain such principles regardless of the fact as to who enunciated them. What we have considered good and demanded, we cannot declare evil or condemn, because of its coming from somebody else.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0442.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The real mission of the Socialist Party in America now is consciously and firmly to support the war and the principles laid down by President Wilson. And if the Party now takes this attitude in such a fashion that unsocialistic pacifists and camouflage idolizing the German regime will be unable to use it as a cloak, then it will have the next duty of seeing that the principles of President Wilson remain the real American principles until the very end, and that they receive appreciation in places where, heretofore, they have not been sanctioned.</p>
   <p>"If the steps hereinbefore enunciated are not taken, the situation so created will force us to act upon our convictions to the limit."</p>
