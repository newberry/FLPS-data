   <p>Frequent appeals from overseas directed to Czech and Slovak America have been left unheeded. They urged our Sokols (gymnastic organizations) to take active part in the struggle for the independence of Bohemia and Slovakia. Newspapers of Paris, France have been suggesting the formation of a Czech-American division which could be used at a moment's notice for the trenches over there. The Austrian Foreign Minister, Czernin, has received a report in which one of the Austrian consuls claims to have thwarted the sending of 20,000 Czech-American <pb facs="5418478_2_0990.jpg" n="2"/>Sokols to Canada from whence they were to be transported by English ships to the front in France.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kupka, who has been in the French trenches for the past two years, sent us a telegram: "Follow our example!" Our leader, Professor Thomas G. Masaryk, addressed us from across the sea with a slogan: "Az Do Tech Hrdel A Statku!" ( Go to the limit! )</p>
   <p>The first so answer the call were members of the Czech National Alliance in Michel, Alta., Canada. They are in England today. The first in the United States were our brave boys who are going aboard ship with the 223rd Canadian Battalion bound for abroad.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0991.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>There is a goodly number of them, and though they did not succeed in forming a full company, they have done their duty.</p>
   <p>The last days before their departure the volunteers spent in the garrison of Portage La Prairie. There a red and white banner, the gift of the Czech National Alliance in America, was presented to them. Two representatives of the central committee of the Czech National Alliance came by train from Winnipeg. They were J. Tvrzicky, secretary, and J. V. Votava, both from Chicago. The same train brought high government and military officials, and a group from the branch of the Czech National Alliance in Winnipeg.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0992.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The railway depot was the scene of a glorious ovation for the volunteers. The farewell ceremonies were opened by Captain Hanneson, commander of the contingent under whom drills were held. Mr. Votava then delivered a letter from Doctor L. J. Fischer, president Czech National Alliance in America, to Captain Hanneson. In it assurance is given that the Czech volunteers in the Canadian Army will do their best to be worthy of their Czech comrades in other bodies of the Allied Armies. Captain Hanneson thanked them, and gave words of high praise to the Czech people.</p>
   <p>The following day the Czech volunteers performed drills before General Hughes, who pronounced them to be in excellent condition. In the <pb facs="5418478_2_0993.jpg" n="5"/>afternoon, Mr. J. Tvrzicky delivered an address which moved many to tears. The red and white banner was presented by Mr. J. V. Votava, and was received by Sokol Frana Klepal, color sergeant, who knelt down, kissed the banner and vowed to bring it back victorious. The ladies distributed souvenirs. The anthem "Kde Domov Muj" (Where is my Homeland?) was sung with fervor.</p>
   <p>Today the volunteers are on the ocean. Our most cherished hopes and longings accompany them.</p>
