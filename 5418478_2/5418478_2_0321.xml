<title level="a">[COURT INVESTIGATION OF ANTON J. CERMÁK]</title><title level="a" type="sub">(Summary)</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Many investigations into the activities of public officials are started and soon abandoned. The cast in the most recent one includes William N. Gemmill, associate judge of the municipal court who is ambitious to become chief justice, and Anton J. Cermák, chief bailiff of that court.</p>
   <p>Deputy bailiffs pay fifty cents per month to the Bailiffs' Mutual Benefit Association; Judge Gemmill objects to that. He further complains about a collection which demanded five dollars from each deputy bailiff for the purchase of a diamond star for Chief Bailiff Cermák.</p>
   <p>It is a known fact that Harry Olson, chief justice of the municipal court, will soon have to run for his office again. Judge Gemmill is being <pb facs="5418478_2_0322.jpg" n="2"/>pushed by Mayor Thompson and the prohibitionist element, a fact which fiercely antagonizes Mr. Cermák, secretary of the United Societies for many years.Mr. Olson and Judge Gemmill are the ones who started the investigation which is now being conducted before Judges Stelk and Hayes with numerous deputy bailiffs as witnesses.</p>
   <p>In rebuttal to the charges, Mr. Cermák declares that a collection for the purchase of a diamond star was started by the deputies two years ago while he was out of town. Upon his return he immediately ordered the money collected to be refunded. "I was presented with a diamond star when I became an alderman, and I do not see any reason why I should wear one star on each side of my waistcoat," he declared.</p>
   <p>As for the Bailiffs' Mutual Benefit Association, Mr. Cermák states that the fifty cents paid by the deputies are dues, and that the money is being spent in the most judicious manner. An annual picnic yields from <pb facs="5418478_2_0323.jpg" n="3"/>one to two thousand dollars. The Association's treasury extends its help to many people in distress, particularly in cases of eviction. Liberty bonds for five hundred dollars were bought, and two thousand dollars was contributed to the Red Cross; there is five thousand dollars left in the treasury.</p>
   <p>"When I heard of the accusations, I, myself, invited an investigation. We supported Judge Gemmill in his campaign because his personal bailiff assured us of Gemmill's sympathies with the principles of the United Societies. In that we were deceived."</p>
