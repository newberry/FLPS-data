   <p>The well known Bohemian Democrat, L. W. Kadlec, was elected a delegate to the national convention which will meet in our city in June. This is the first time, that a Bohemian is being sent bya major political party in Illinois, to a convention at which it is to be decided who is to be nominated for the office of President.</p>
   <p>We do not look upon the election of Mr. Kadlec as an individual distinction, but as an acknowledgment given to the Bohemian element by this great political party. No personal gain will be derived by Mr. Kadlec through his election, but, Bohemian Democrats may be proud of the success they have achieved. They can point with pride to the fact, that the Democrats of the Second Congressional District, which is known as a Democratic stronghold, called upon a Bohemian to represent them at the National Convention. We believe that Mr. Kadlec, who has been honored by the party, will not remain satisfied with his present success, but that we shall be able, in a short time, to bring reports of his further advancement.</p>
