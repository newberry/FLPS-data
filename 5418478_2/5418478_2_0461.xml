<title level="a">REGISTRATION OF CZECHOSLOVAKS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Our readers have been informed in earlier issues that, according to the committee on public information, the Government permits registration of Czechs and Slovaks as "Czechoslovaks claimed as subjects of Austria-Hungary," and born in Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, or Slovakia. This manner of registration is not only a point of honor for true Czechoslovaks, but is explicitly recommended by the Government itself.</p>
   <p>Many Czechs and Slovaks could not, however, follow this advice, because in many stations this kind of registration was refused to them. It has happened, in fact, that some of our Czechoslovak registrants were told in some stations that there is no Czechoslovak nation, and that there is no such state, whereas Austria and Hungary are states in existence, to which the registrants belong. Our men were then registered against their will as Austrians or Hungarians. Our own office, and our newspapers are in receipt of many such complaints.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0462.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We have good reason to surmise that such cases are happening not only in Chicago, and we urge our men to report to us immediately whenever their rights to register as Czechoslovaks are denied. This concerns, of course, only noncitizens.</p>
   <p>As a result of inquiries about what our men should do when refused registration as Czechoslovaks, we were told by the Federal authorities in Chicago that within a short time all of our registered men will be called before a commission, where they will have an opportunity to answer all important questions concerning their status and other circumstances, and to declare themselves as "Czechoslovaks claimed as subjects of Austria-Hungary". There will be no such thing as a refusal again.</p>
   <p>Friends! Don't fail to repeat what you have tried before! Do not forget to send us the location of the registration commission, and the names of Czechoslovaks who were not allowed to register as Czechoslovaks!</p>
   <p>The Czech National Alliance, Chicago.</p>
