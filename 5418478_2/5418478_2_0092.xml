   <p>The Bohemian citizens of Berwyn are calling another meeting for next Sunday, in which action is to be taken on, the proposal that the Bohemian wards become part of Cicero.</p>
   <p>One meeting was held last Sunday at the south end of the Bohemian colony, so the second one is now called to give the citizens living at the north end of Berwyn a chance to present their views about this very weighty problem.</p>
   <p>Our countrymen in Berwyn justly complain that they do not receive the benefits to which they are entitled as taxpayers. The two wards in which they live have four representatives in the town council as compared to six for the south end. Consequently the residents in the fourth and fifth wards, who are chiefly Bohemian, while they still have to pay taxes, do not have the representation to which they are entitled. These wards receive such improvements as the <pb facs="5418478_2_0093.jpg" n="2"/>majority of the aldermen decide to give them.</p>
   <p>Here is a little sample of the treatment the citizens of the fourth and fifth wards receive. The Bohemian alderman of the fourth ward asked that the crossings at 26th Street be somewhat improved, so that people could cross the street, and that the mud be removed from the sidewalks.</p>
   <p>It took all of four months to have this done, and a committee, consisting of two aldermen from "Old" Berwyn and one from the fifth ward, had to be sent before permission was granted to dump several wagonloads of cinders.</p>
   <p>This is just one instance of the treatment the citiznes of the fourth and fifth wards receive from the politicians in "Old" Berwyn. One can easily understand that there is general dissatisfaction, and the citizens are loudly proclaiming that only by joining with Cicero, which has a more liberal administration, can better treatment be secured.</p>
   <p>The citizens voiced their discontent with the prevailing conditions at a well <pb facs="5418478_2_0094.jpg" n="3"/>attended meeting last Sunday in Sokol Berwyn Hall; and next Sunday, January 30, at 1:30 P.M. a meeting will be held at the Auditorium on Twelfth Street.</p>
   <p>Bohemian citizens, both men and women, should attend this meeting if at all possible. This will prove that our countrymen take a decidedly active interest in a matter so important to us. It will be necessary to have everyone's cooperation to achieve the purpose which we so much desire.</p>
