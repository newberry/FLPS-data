   <p>"The English language papers recently published statements on the war by men of public prominence, in which they spoke of the exalted position of the Germans and the necessity for their dominating the world. These utterances represent something novel for the Chicago public and put the Germans upon a pedestal where hardly anybody has ever seen them. These characteristic depictions of German traits are, of course, nothing new to us Czechs. We have, by century-old contact with the Germans, gained experiences which have taught us too well what the Germans are and of what they are capable. This concoction of statements which at this moment horrifies the American public, appears interesting to us just the same."</p>
   <p>William Archer composed a collection of "Pearls of German Thinking," among which we find the following amazing examples: Bernhardi proclaims, "Might is <pb facs="5418478_2_0906.jpg" n="2"/>the highest of rights"....The Chicago Tribune says that to the Germans this war is a holy war, a gigantic missionary undertaking and quotes Lange: "The nations around us Germans are overripe fruits which the next storm is going to shake down to the ground...."</p>
   <p>The Germans are men of blood and iron; they are no doves of peace.....</p>
   <p>It is a holy war, but not for the Germans. It is a holy war for those who are discerning just what danger the Teutons represent. These peoples are determined to do something about it. The Germans will not listen to words; therefore we will use the sword....</p>
