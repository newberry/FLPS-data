<title level="a">BOHEMIAN CONGRESSMAN A. J. SABATH VS. FED.JUDGE P. S. GROSSCUP. WASHINGTON D. C. MAR. 31, 1910</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>P.3. Col. 3--Congressman A. J. Sabath has proposed a resolution today, which if passed may have a far reaching affect. It is believed to be aimed at Federal Judge P. S. Grosscup and his associates.</p>
   <p>The resolution requests investigation and the following information.</p>
   <p>1. The full amount, which has been paid to, judges, clerks, lawyers and other Federal employees, in addition to their regular salary, during the past four years.</p>
   <p>2. Giving the names and amounts individually.</p>
   <p>3. Also the names of all persons who were appointed by the Federal Court to act as Public Administrators during the same period.</p>
   <p>It is said that this resolution was first suggested to, or requested of Mr. Sabath by the labor unions, who knew him to be the proper man to see, if their resolution was to get the proper support in Congress. It is also <pb facs="5418478_2_0356.jpg" n="2"/>known that Federal Judge Grosscup is an enemy of the labor unions.</p>
   <p>This resolution refers chiefly to the affairs of the Chicago Street Railways and the fact that Judge Grosscup has taken over the full control of the Company's claim of bankruptcy including all other dealings involving it.</p>
   <p>Further it states that the Receiver of the Company, Mr. Sampsell, is related to Judge Grosscup and is also his business associate in various business enterprises.</p>
   <p>The Street Railway Co. has a capital of more than one hundred million dollars in receivership and Mr. Sampsell could have easily appropriated, by graft, enormous sums of money. The investigation of the proposed resolution would uncover all these unlawful dealings and the outcome in turn would play an important part in the coming congressional campaign.</p>
   <p>This resolution has long been under consideration and may soon become a law, whereby the Federal Judges, will lose the authority in this particular phase of business.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0357.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The labor unions are supporting this resolution and promise to do their utmost toward its becoming a law.</p>
   <p>President Taft has tried to pass a similiar resolution in this session of Congress but as yet has been unsuccessful.</p>
