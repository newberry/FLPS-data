   <p>Last Saturday's election for the school district No. 99, which comprises all of the Town of Cicero, resulted in a victory for Jan F. Slapak, who competed for the office of school-board president against his fellow countryman, Frank D. Matousek, and against C. E. Carlson, who ran for that office in last year's election.</p>
   <p>Slapak and Matousek received almost the same number of votes. Czech votes were split, and there was a danger that the third candidate might win.</p>
   <p>Three members of the school board were also elected. No Czech is among them, because Czechs did not concentrate their votes properly. Mr. Blazek, one of the Czech candidates, lost by only two votes, just because of lack of political co-ordination on the part of his fellow countrymen. The three elected members have held their offices before. Their terms run for three years, while the president, according to the law, is elected for one year only.</p>
