   <p>Mrs. Pankhurst has deeply disappointed her enthusiastic friends. She was expected to turn everything upside down in America, but so far very little has been heard about her. The reason for this is easy to understand. All Mrs. Pankhurst knows how to do is to make a lot of noise. All she is good at is uttering invective and vituperation and plotting intrigues. But being just a guest here, she cannot indulge in such business in the United States. She was given to understand that she had better behave, or else she would be sent back.</p>
   <p>Therefore, her speeches are tame and--good for nothing. As soon as Mrs. Pankhurst starts speaking seriously, her orations ooze emptiness and prove that she herself is good for nothing.</p>
