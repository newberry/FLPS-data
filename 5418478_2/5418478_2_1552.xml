   <p>Yesterday noon there was held a big meeting in the main hall of Pilsen Falcon, for the purpose of demonstrating our great sympathy for the fighting Boers. We state with joy that the large crowd which attended this meeting made our nationality proud of it, and the whole course of the celebration was accompanied with dignity, which made a very deep impression on all Bohemians present. Shortly before 2 P:M Mr. Frank Zajicek opened the meeting and, in a few words stated the purpose of the meeting. The Bohemian Singing Club offered the "Marseilaise", and then the first speaker, Mr. F. Hlavacek, was introduced to the audience. He made a very sincere and warm speech, pointing out, chiefly, that England is conducting a very unjust fight against all rules of humanity. The present war is one of the most disgraceful and infamous events which the world has seen, and is condemned by the whole civilized world. Mr. Hlavacek's speech was from his deep heart and was received by his hearers with fullest applause. The second speaker, Dr. Jan Habenicht, glowed with indignation recounting all the misery of the little poor community of Boers. He illustrated the cultural and political history of the Boers with such enthusiastic and rich phrases that the audience followed in deepest silence all his words. The last speaker, Mr. Wilhelm Krouzilek, compared the morally abject and vile war in South Africa with the <pb facs="5418478_2_1553.jpg" n="2"/>fight that our Bohemian people are conducting for many centuries, and ascribed both cases to the particular event that Bohemians and Boers are suffering from the atrocities committed by the German race.</p>
   <p>The meeting was ended and Mr. Zajicek read the resolution, which all present adopted.</p>
   <p>The Resolution</p>
   <p>We, the true sons of Bohemia and citizens of the United States, without distinction of religious or political differences, assembled in an important meeting in the Hall of Pilsen Falcon, the 25th of March, 1900, in the cause of the unequal war of the South African Republics with the great British Empire, we unanimously agree that -</p>
   <p>I. - We admire the determination, bravery, and endurance of the Boer community, fighting for their independence against the large British forces.</p>
   <p>II. - Being the sons of a nation ever glorious, but for centuries repressed, we <pb facs="5418478_2_1554.jpg" n="3"/>feel the highest sympathy for the Boers, a people numerically weak but desiring to be their own masters.</p>
   <p>III. - Being a peace-loving nation and always concerned in the rights of other nations, we are sincerely sorry that the alleged culture of the great ruling nations of the world is mainly concentrated in the desire that the smaller nations, shall be absorbed entirely and their mother tongue and natural existence destroyed.</p>
   <p>I V. - We call this unequal war between the Boers and England a ridiculous comedy, in the light of the international peace conference held recently for the purpose, as we all know, that in the future all disputes and dissonances between nations shall be adjusted peacefully and without bloodshed.</p>
   <p>V. - Adhering to the traditions inherited from the heroic sons of Bohemia, the Bohemian people in Europe wage a fierce fight for their rights, and will fight until the pure Bohemian blood shall flow in the veins of their Bohemian descendants.</p>
   <p>VI. - Being citizens of the United States of North America, we hereby appeal to the honorable government of said United States to use its powerful influence to <pb facs="5418478_2_1555.jpg" n="4"/>stop this unequal war and cruel bloodshed in South Africa.</p>
   <p>The chairman, Mr. Habenicht, after the reading of this resolution, expressed his thankfulness to the large audience and introduced a representative of the South African Community, Mr. Masman, who voiced his thanks to all Bohemians who participated and helped in the success of the celebration, and who sympathize with the repressed Boers.</p>
