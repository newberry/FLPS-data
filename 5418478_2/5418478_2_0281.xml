   <p>Alderman Anton J. Cermák who is a candidate for the office of bailiff of the municipal court was elected to the so-called "Committee on Committees" by the City Council. He was then elected chairman of that committee. This is the most important committee post ever held by a Bohemian.....</p>
   <p>A very active campaign is being carried on in the Thirty-fourth Ward where an aldermanic election is to be held next week. The Democratic party candidate, Mr. John Toman, attends many meetings every day. All of them are well attended, which proves that the Democrats, of whom there is a large majority in the Ward, recognize the capabilities of their candidate and are determined to aid him in attaining a victory. Mr. Toman is a young, energetic, capable man who will surely be the best representative in the City Council for his ward. This will be possible for him, because he is an adherent of the faction which dominates the City Council at present.</p>
