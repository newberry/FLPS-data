   <p>There is no doubt that our activities within the sphere of the Red Cross will bring good results. In the beginning, the female members of the Sokol gymnastic societies were those who enlisted. Other influential organizations followed their example. Business men, bankers, and others took heed also. The number of men and women of our stock who have enlisted runs into the thousands. Many concerns announced themselves as members, and so did all their employees.</p>
   <p>Schools for Red Cross service are being conducted in the halls of the Plzeňský Sokol (Pilsen district Sokol gymnastic society) where Doctor Rudiš Jiciňský teaches; in the Sokol Chicago, with Doctor A. Mueller lecturing, and in the Sokol Havliček Tyrš under the direction of Doctor L. Fisher.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0937.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Although great interest on the part of our people is evident, there are many places yet to be filled.</p>
   <p>In order to make the number of Czech members of the Red Cross properly conspicuous, we advise and urge all future members to register at the Czech branch. The more Czech members we can muster the better our Czech cause will be served. Slips declaring intention to join will be received by Mr. Hajicek at the Lawndale State Bank, where the headquarters of our Czech branch are located. By proving that we are doing our duty we will win the support of the Americans.</p>
