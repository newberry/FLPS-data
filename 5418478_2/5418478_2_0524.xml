  <body>
   <p>Almost from the very beginning of the war, all public bodies, innumerable patriotic organizations, and individuals began to bend their energies toward the Americanization of immigrants. As long as these efforts do not transgress certain limits, no objection could be raised against them. Anyone must admit that it is the duty of every immigrant to obtain his citizenship papers as soon as possible. The citizenship will grant him the right to enjoy what citizenship has to offer, but it also imposes all the duties upon him that go with his adherence to this country. In these times, even more than before, it is imperative that the citizen be loyal to his country, that he gladly support the government, and make any sacrifice demanded by the emergency of war time.</p>
   <p>It must be admitted that at least some of the immigrants are mindful of these obligations. They are, in the first place, the Czechs, Slovaks, Jugoslavs, Poles, <pb facs="5418478_2_0525.jpg" n="2"/>and other Slavonic nations. These peoples are always eager to show their patriotism on every occasion; their faithfulness can be fully relied on. This cannot, however, be said of the American Germans, and particularly not of the German-American press. This is the reason lying at the bottom of the antagonism shown toward the immigrants, and of the attempts made to Americanize them instantly.</p>
   <p>Without this German disloyalty no injustice would be done to others. For instance: Governor Harding, of Iowa, recently gave orders that no language other than English may be used in churches, schools, meetings, and other public places. This order is, no doubt, aimed at the Germans, but it is kept in force also in regard to other nationalities, including the Slavonic nationalities.</p>
   <p>Similar orders have been passed by local governments, and the sad fact remains that they hit some of the most loyal and patriotic immigrants. Patriotic organizations and many individuals approve of these severe measures, simply because <pb facs="5418478_2_0526.jpg" n="3"/>they lack sufficient insight, discrimination, and cool judgement. It is fortunate, indeed, that not all people think alike, that the agitation has not become general, that many have been amenable to cool reasoning, and are ready to accept proofs. These people know that Americanization overnight is an impossibility. Among the latter belong the delegates in the recent convention of the National Federation of Settlements--men who have been working among immigrants for a long time and know them better than do the people who want to make Americans out of immigrants in the wink of an eye, instead of allowing the process to become completed by natural development, and thereby producing the desired results.</p>
   <p>Graham Taylor, well-known Chicago sociologist, wrote on this problem in one of the recent numbers of the Chicago Daily News.....Mr. Graham's article certainly deserves the closest attention of many Americans, especially those of Governor Harding's caliber, who are slow to acknowledge the patriotism of Czechs and other Slav nationalities in the United States, and do not discriminate <pb facs="5418478_2_0527.jpg" n="4"/>between loyal citizens and Germans or other alien enemies.</p>
