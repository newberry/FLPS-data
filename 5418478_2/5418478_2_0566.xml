  <body>
   <p>Some people sit on the Chicago School Board who are either fanatics or extremely dull-minded. Be that as it may, there is certainly no room for them in that body. Regardless of their degree of literacy, and their general mental level, one might fairly well expect, at least, that they would show a trace of loyalty. If our City Council were composed of really sincere Americans, they would not haggle in their meetings about the propriety of removing from a public building the name of Bismarck, that beast in human shape, whose entire life is stained with blood, and marked with oppression and injustice.</p>
   <p>An issue such as this should be understood, at least in a country whose flower of manhood is being sent before the mouths of Prussian cannons.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0567.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Some of the members of the School Board have a thick hide in this respect. Instead of heeding public opinion, these servants of the Kaiser resort to farfetched arguments. They say that if they should take action in the case of Bismarck, they might do the same with Kosciusko or Komensky, because these names are also not American names.</p>
   <p>This attitude demonstrates not merely a limited horizon, but downright stupidity, or unexampled hypocrisy. Bismarck is known among cultured people as the "most successful criminal of the last century," while Komensky was the teacher of the nations, and Kosciusko was a Polish patriot who rendered valuable service to this republic. He who cannot see the difference, but is capable of likening Bismarck to them, is hopelessly near losing his reason. Such a man should be put in a strait jacket, instead of the school board of the second largest metropolis on the map of the United States.</p>
   <p>We have had our fill of people whom political favoritism has shoved into responsible offices, true enough, but this case--why, it is beyond any limit.</p>
