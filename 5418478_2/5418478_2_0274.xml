   <p>Perhaps never before has the Pilsen Park pavilion been so crowded with an enthusiastic public as it was last night. The large hall could not accommodate all those who came, and several hundred people had to be turned away. Everybody was anxious to hear the principal Democratic candidates for county and state offices, and of particular interest is the fact that there were many ladies in the audience.....</p>
   <p>Each speaker was given a roaring welcome, particularly such Democratic leaders as Governor Dunne, Mayor Harrison, etc....but the welcome for other men, other candidates, and particularly the Bohemian candidates, was no less enthusiastic.....</p>
   <p>The candidate for the United States Senate, Mr. Roger C. Sullivan....recommended the re-election of the Bohemian Congressman, Adolph J. Sabath.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0275.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He was followed by the candidate for the State Senate, Mr. Jos. Placek.....</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison endorsed our candidates, Mr. John A. Cervenka and Mr. Walldeck, most highly.....</p>
   <p>The third speaker was Governor Dunne....who stressed the fact that by electing the whole Democratic ticket, the people will give their approval to the wonderful work that has been done by the Congress and by President Wilson.....</p>
   <p>The meeting was very successful, and its success is the best indication of a splendid victory at the polls on November 3.....</p>
