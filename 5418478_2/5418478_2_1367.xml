   <p>Former President Roosevelt's actions prove how dangerous he would be if he were sitting in the White House in these days. He never misses an opportunity to attack President Wilson, and if he could have anything to say about matters, it is very likely that the United States would be in war by now. According to his old custom, he makes speeches whenever there is the slightest excuse, and in these speeches he tries to make "political capital" for himself. The much more dignified former President Taft urges the citizens to stay behind the President and, for the time being, forget all political differences. This shows the great difference between the two men. One is proving his patriotism and common sense, while the other proves nothing but his well-known belief in his own importance, which would, in his opinion, be that much greater if he succeeded in putting us into the war.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1368.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The American people have all reasons to be proud of having entrusted the Ship of State to Wilson instead of Roosevelt. That election may become the only thing that will save us from the results of the danger by which we have been threatened because of the sinking of the "Lusitania".</p>
