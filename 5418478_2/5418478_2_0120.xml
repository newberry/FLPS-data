<title level="a">MEETING OF THE TAXPAYERS CLUB OF THE ELEVENTH WARD HELD ON OCTOBER 19</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>After the presentation of reports by the committees appointed in the last meeting, the discussion again was on the location of a small park between Wood, Lincoln, 18th and 19th Streets. According to a report received, the Park Commission is negotiating for a parcel of land further south. The Club resolved to send a committee to the Park Commission with a request to have the park located at 18th Street, because according to reliable information, part of the needed land can be purchased from the Union Lime Company much cheaper, and this location would have a great influence on the final removal of the limekiln.</p>
   <p>The meeting was attended by Mr. Petru, as representative of the Union Lime Company, and he assured the Club that all damages caused by blasting would be adjusted. He was informed at this time of the protest resolution adopted in the last meeting relative to the sidewalks. The secretary was instructed <pb facs="5418478_2_0121.jpg" n="2"/>to make a report to the Department of Streets about the obstruction in the sewer on 18th Street, between Robey and Lincoln Streets. To the committee which is to call on the Park Commission were elected Messrs. Vavra, Svoboda, and Novobelsky. It was also resolved to send letters to members encouraging them to try to secure new members.</p>
   <p>Because the secretary resigned on account of lack of time, Mr. Vavra was elected to take the place, and the meeting was then adjourned. The next meeting will be held on the third Thursday in November.</p>
