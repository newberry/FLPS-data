   <p>The United States General Staff has worked out a plan for the participation of the United States which, if followed out, would result in certain defeat of the Allies, for it would completely shut them off from the supplies which are still being sent. The plan calls for the creation of a United States Army of two million men. The work needed for the training and fitting out of such an organization would require, as admitted by army experts, at least two years. This plan is scheduled to be submitted by Major General Scott, its originator, to the committees for military affairs in both the Senate and the House.</p>
   <p>This plan is as impractical as it is unworkable. It is based on compulsory service for our men who are wont to enter into matrimony soon after they have reached the age of twenty. They would have to be steeled for the strenuous, <pb facs="5418478_2_1088.jpg" n="2"/>nerve wracking service which would require more than two years. Registration and recruiting would take up too much time.</p>
   <p>The "expert" of the Chicago Daily Tribune is working assiduously on this foolish plan. This very fact should open the eyes of all those who see in universal service the only panacea for conquering Prussian autocracy. The Tribune was, from the beginning of the World War, an ardent advocate of the Kaiser, just as were Mr. Hearst's sheets, which are just good enough for wrapping cheese. These papers do not work for an Allied victory. On the contrary, they would like to see the United States under a mettle similar to Prussianism, which keeps the people of Germany in thralldom. They demand a big army. This army would be utterly useless in Europe, if we waited two years. In two years, either the Allies may be defeated, or, if they win, Germany and Austria will be republics. These papers propose a big army to be used right here in the United States. For, in our country also, many signs are visible, similar to those which preceded the fall of the Romanoffs. We have no Romanoffs here, true enough, but we have Rockefellers and Morgans <pb facs="5418478_2_1089.jpg" n="3"/>We have worse autocrats than ever held the Russian people in subjugation.</p>
   <p>It is easy to foretell what an army of two million men for the United States would mean. All the workers now engaged in the production of war materials for the Allies would have to leave their jobs and begin to work on supplies for our army at home. The Allies would have to send volunteer aviators back to the United States as trainers for our air force. There are at least one hundred such men on the Western front now. Between fifty thousand and one hundred thousand men from the United States serve as volunteers for the Allies on the various fronts. These would have to be released for the training of our own recruits. They would not be advanced to the rank of officers, for our General staff objects on the ground of their lack of military schooling, as given at the institutes approved by the military authorities.</p>
   <p>The Allies themselves know best how the United States can be of help to them, and they are continually and definitely indicating how it could be done. Our <pb facs="5418478_2_1090.jpg" n="4"/>General staff, however, does not heed the advices. The Allies need our credit, food, and war supplies delivered by our navy. An efficient stroke would be the confiscation of the German ships interned in this country, and their employment as carriers of war material and food supplies, not of soldiers, for transportation of men is risky. With the English channel, of only twenty miles of width, all infested with submarines which have already sunk transports, how could America succeed in getting its men over the ocean?</p>
   <p>There is no time for America to toy with a plan for the creation of an army of two million men. The proposition made by the General staff might as well have been conceived in Berlin for the purpose of defeating the Allies.</p>
