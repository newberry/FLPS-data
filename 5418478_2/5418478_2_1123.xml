   <p>We Czechs and Slovaks are a mighty contingent of this country. During decenniums we have settled in the big cities and formed our centers there; we have founded pure Czech communities in the rural districts; we have prospered in industry, commerce, and various other walks of life as in the realm of art; but it appears that this is not sufficient as yet. Formerly the American public did not know us and the American press did not care about us. Our national manifestations have in most instances been handled in the newspaper columns as only occasional affairs to be forgotten in the wink of an eye. In this respect, however, many changes have taken place.</p>
   <p>Within the past two and a half years more has been written about us, and in a more sincere vein, than in all the decenniums preceding. The reason <pb facs="5418478_2_1124.jpg" n="2"/>for this is obvious. We have been able to convince the English language papers and their readers that we not only love our old homeland but that we are good citizens of this country, which has given us a new home. We tended to express our feelings in various meeting, e.g., the unforgettable one in June, last year, in the Coliseum. Many proclamations issued by the Czech Sokols testify to our sentiments, by offering the Czech manhood to the United States for service in case of war. The patriotic meetings cannot fail to make a lasting impression upon the American mind, in consideration of the behavior of the Germans in these momentous times. Our honest point of view, our love for the Star Spangled Banner, and our enthusiasm for the interest of all sincere Americans, demonstrated at the proper time, have proved their value. We are taking cognizance of this without any attempt at flattering ourselves.</p>
