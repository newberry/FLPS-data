   <p>The American public has at present a double duty: first to watch the Germans of this city, and second to watch those, who for gain, lend themselves as willing tools for their activities. The latter consist of United States congressmen and senators who need the German votes in order to make political headway. American politics have always been dirty, true enough, but it must be called an arrogance that cries up to heaven, when some, who have succeeded in climbing political heights, have the cheek to cross the plans of our president and impede his actions in every way and at every opportunity; all this just so they can return to their German constituents and show that they have made good. What is the difference between a fellow like La Follette of Wisconsin or Stone of Missouri, and a Benedict Arnold of colonial times? They do not get into <pb facs="5418478_2_1126.jpg" n="2"/>the limelight, their work cannot be exposed, and they themselves cannot be punished, yet their subversive activities go on nevertheless, and the part they play is that of contemptible traitors. Arnold betrayed the American revolutionists for money. Stone and La Follette work against the interests of the American people for political advancement; otherwise the three men resemble each other like one egg does another. Every traitor should be finally taken to account.</p>
