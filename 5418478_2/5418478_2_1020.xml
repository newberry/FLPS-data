  <body>
   <p>Czech-America has always taken pride in their Sokol organizations, for they have always been in the forefront of their people's public life, but now we revel at the sight of the young Sokols who do not hesitate to offer their services, and even their lives, to their new homeland and at the same time for the liberation of their old motherland. The Czech Legion consists predominantly of former members of Sokol societies; the men surely will gain an honorable standing among all the volunteers.</p>
   <p>It is not the men alone, however, who rally behind the Star Spangled Banner - the girl Sokols, members of the gymnastic societies, have gladly enrolled in the Red Cross by creating a Czech branch; the membership in the latter will not be limited to members of Sokol societies.</p>
   <p>We want to reiterate the success with which the Sokol members met at the <pb facs="5418478_2_1021.jpg" n="2"/>medical examinations; there, the results of Sokol gymnastic training became quite conspicuous. Not one of the Sokol recruits were rejected at the final examinations at Jefferson Barracks, Mo. Parents should take notice and send their children to Sokol drills.</p>
