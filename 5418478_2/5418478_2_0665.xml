   <p>A Serbian delegation led by Dr. Vesnic will come to Chicago within the next few days. We do not have to emphasize the fact that it is the duty of the Czechoslovak branch in America to receive them in the most sincere manner, in token of the brotherhood which links us to the valiant Serbian nation and to the entire Yugoslav people. We have in common the sufferings, the aim to destroy Austria, and the desire to liberate the Czechoslovak and the Yugoslav peoples. Let us hope for victory; it will unite us inseparably!</p>
   <p>From the very beginning of the War, the Czechoslovaks and Yugoslavs have been appearing together before the forum of the world. They have been fighting shoulder to shoulder on the Balkan peninsula, in the Dobrudja. They are preparing today to send their Czechoslovak and Yugoslav soldiers from America to the battlefields of France.</p>
   <p>Like our representatives in the Austrian parliament, we represent one thought, <pb facs="5418478_2_0666.jpg" n="2"/>one ideal, one aim.</p>
   <p>We have welcomed all the delegates of the Allied nations with enthusiasm and brotherly love. We are under a still greater obligation to those who are nearest to us, because theirs is the same fate and future as ours.</p>
   <p>The Serbian mission will be welcomed next Sunday in the Auditorium, South Michigan Avenue. This will be the occasion of a great mass meeting. All Czechs and Slovaks are expected to appear in large numbers. Dr. Jaroslav Smetanka, our orator, will speak in the English language. We should demonstrate our loyalty to our own cause and that of the Yugoslav people. There never was a moment more appropriate to affirm our sentiment and ideals. America is going to be host to the Serbian mission. The international situation calls for a concerted demonstration on the part of the Slav nations that are under the yoke of the Austro-Hungarian oligarchy. Let us show the required unity by a magnificent attendance next Sunday!</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0667.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Serbian mission is composed of Dr. Vesnic, Professor Loaznic, General Rasic, and Lieutenant-Colonel Nenadovic. In the meeting many native American friends of our nation and the Serbian nation will be present. Tickets are obtainable in the offices of the Czech National Alliance, the National Alliance of Czech Catholics in America, the Czech newspapers, the American State Bank, Lawndale National and State Bank, and the following drugstores: Foucek, Honsik, Pelikan, and Jehlik.</p>
   <p>Begin today to make preparations for the Sunday meeting in the Auditorium!</p>
