   <p>A meeting of Czechoslovak women voters of Democratic persuasion took place in Mr. Placek's hall on Kedzie Avenue last night. The attendance was so large that the hall was overcrowded. Under the chairmanship of Mrs. Josefa Sedlacek the ladies discussed the ensuing primaries, assuring us that as far as their families and friends are concerned every member of them will do his or her utmost to support our Czechoslovak candidates. The ladies were later addressed by several invited speakers of whom Mr. Otto R. Fuerst delivered a speech full of humor and satire.</p>
   <p>Tonight there will be several precinct meetings in the Twelfth Ward, and it is desirable that all our Czechoslovak voters attend them. An excellent piece of propaganda is being performed by the members of the Lawndale Automobile Club, and, as is well known, this club consists almost exclusively of members of the Bohemian colony known as the Bohemian California district. Most of them are wealthy citizens, and they number about three hundred. All of them <pb facs="5418478_2_0068.jpg" n="2"/>send letters to their friends and acquaintances, calling attention to the primaries, and urging everybody to go to the polls. All this will, of course, add much to the victory of Mr. Anton J. Cermak and Mr. Josef Mendl.</p>
