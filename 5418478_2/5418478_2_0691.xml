   <p>Yesterday, in our office, we received Vojta Beneš, ardent, patriotic worker, and organizer of the Czech National Alliance. With him was a group of strong young men, all bubbling over with vigor, whom he introduced as enthusiasts who had just enlisted in the Czechoslovak Army. They were an additional contingent to the Czechoslovak Army which has been acknowledged by the French government, and which was granted the status of a compact military unit to fight as such with the Allied Armies. Most of them came from Omaha, Nebraska, where they had gathered from various districts, and had been organized by Mr. Tuma. These volunteers, twelve in number, were escorted to Chicago by Cenek Kostelník, where they will be joined by men from other districts. Thirty other volunteers who preceded them left Chicago yesterday.</p>
   <p>The men did not stay here long, but left last night at 11 P. M. Others will meet them in New York, and the expedition, the largest up to today, will sail <pb facs="5418478_2_0692.jpg" n="2"/>abroad to do military service under the command of the French government, and to help win victory for democracy.</p>
   <p>We wish to see them return in the same health and spirit.</p>
