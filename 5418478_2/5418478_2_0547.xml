   <p>The great success with which the Third Liberty Loan campaign met in the Chicago Tenth Ward is not merely a local achievement--it is a telling demonstration of the loyalty of the Czech populace and will cause the name of the Czech nation to be forever linked with the history of the United States.</p>
   <p>But let us not use words; let us talk in figures. Today, after the Third Liberty Loan campaign, we know that the Tenth Ward has subscribed for a million and a half dollars' [worth of bonds].</p>
   <p>Mr. Otto Kaspar, vice-chairman of the board of directors of the Kaspar State Bank, was chairman of the committee which conducted the campaign in the Tenth Ward. He did not have much time to prepare for his work. Yet the activity developed by him and his committee made the Liberty Loan drive a veritable contest, and the places of bond sale were constantly besieged by eager buyers. No less <pb facs="5418478_2_0548.jpg" n="2"/>than 8599 people bought their Third Issue bonds at the Kaspar State Bank itself!....</p>
