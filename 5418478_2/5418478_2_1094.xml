   <p>As to preparedness, we believe that the United States should not have started just a few months ago. It should have begun a few decades sooner. Only a nation physically healthy and strong can manage to be well prepared, for all the economic and industrial potential energy is of no use if the nation is not backed by physical fitness. The United States has had its own peculiar experiences in the past, which are popping up again. This can be best seen in the recruiting stations.</p>
   <p>We do not imply that the American people are a sickly one, but the great number of men rejected by the examining authorities sets one thinking. The militaristic countries do not accept for service any one person at random, true enough, but those rejected form rather an exception, whereas <pb facs="5418478_2_1095.jpg" n="2"/>in the United States they are dangerously near being the rule.</p>
   <p>Such are the results of our mode of living, which saps the strength of man, and exhausts his physical resources more than is the case anywhere in the world. A compulsory military training might have a beneficial effect, but real reforms should no doubt begin somewhere else.</p>
