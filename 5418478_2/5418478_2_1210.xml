   <p>Automobile manufacturer Ford is ready to donate $10,000,000 to bring about peace. Mr. Ford may be superb as a businessman, in matters which he understands, but as soon as he begins to get mixed up with things about which he has not the slightest notion, be is bound to lose his money, be laughed at by the public, and disgrace himself generally. If a few million dollars could bring about peace, Germany would have put up several times ten million dollars in order to get peace now, when it is in a position to dictate its conditions. But it is up to no individual to bring about peace at this time. The storm, although started by individuals, has reached the proportions of a terrible cyclone that can be stopped by nothing and has to spend itself. Ford's millions and Bryan's eloquence are equally impotent in this respect.</p>
