   <p>There is hardly a family in Chicago that would not buy war savings stamps. Even the poorest are in a position to support the Government in its efforts to bring this war to a victorious ending. The war savings stamps have been issued particularly for families of limited means. However, there are still many who have not bought a sufficient amount as yet. Some people may think that if they have bought one or two so-called certificates, they have already discharged themselves of their obligation. Their reasoning is, of course, wrong, and the War Savings Stamps Week will serve to set them right, and to explain how the Government relies on the support of the citizens of this country in every respect and, therefore, also in the sale of stamps.</p>
   <p>Women will volunteer for the campaign. They will urge people to do their duty at this critical time and either to buy now, or promise to buy one or two certificates per month up to the end of this year. The Stamp Week in this city <pb facs="5418478_2_0489.jpg" n="2"/>is to begin August 15. But the Czech settlement does not wait. It is beginning to work right away today.</p>
   <p>The "Czech California" district will be tackled first, according to information given by Mr. Wm. K. Pflaum, one of the most ardent workers in this department. We have mentioned the "California" district repeatedly and pointed to the vigorous activities of our ladies. They have again offered their services and have organized in meetings held in Shedd Park, Lawndale Avenue and 23rd Street. Mr. O'Connell, superintendent of the Hawthorne Post Office, gave detailed information on the work which they are to do. Several ladies have begun canvassing today, selling certificates, which can, however, also be bought from mail carriers. Buyers without ready money may sign pledge cards.</p>
   <p>A five-dollar certificate will entitle the purchaser to a badge, and a picture of General Pershing to be displayed in a window. The ladies will repeat their calls to any house which has not displayed the picture. Those who hold a book with an incomplete number of stamps may buy the supplementary number, pay an <pb facs="5418478_2_0490.jpg" n="3"/>additional nineteen cents, and so obtain the picture of General Pershing.</p>
   <p>Those who do not like to be called on by the ladies may buy the certificates in a bank, or in the Czech Bureau, 3342 West 26th Street, and at the following other places.....</p>
