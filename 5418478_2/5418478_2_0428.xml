   <p>Almost two million American boys are fighting in France, Italy, and far-away Siberia for the freedom of our nation and of the whole world.</p>
   <p>A hundred million of American people may hasten their victory, save thousands of their lives, and speed up the victorious return of our warriors, if they will buy Liberty bonds.</p>
   <p>Joyful news from the Western front, the capitulation of Bulgaria, and the approaching subversion of lands of the Central powers, point to an early and victorious end of the war.</p>
   <p>You can hasten a happy ending of the world struggle by opening your hearts <pb facs="5418478_2_0429.jpg" n="2"/>and pocketbooks. The Fourth Liberty Loan bonds are the safest investment of money, because they bear good interest, and your debtor is Uncle Sam, whose credit is the best in the world.</p>
   <p>The dollars you lend to the government will bear not only financial, but much more valuable interest, for they will save the lives of thousands of our young men who are fighting at the front.</p>
   <p>Do not postpone the purchase of bonds; buy as many as you can. Buy in Czech banks and Czech business houses, buy from authorized agents of bond committees, and in the following ward offices: 4th Ward: 555 West 31st Street--10th Ward: 1423 West 18th Street, and at the Kaspar bank--11th Ward: 1808 South Ashland Avenue--12th Ward: 3342 West 26th Street--15th Ward: 916 North Western Avenue--27th Ward: 4564 North Crawford Avenue--29th Ward: 1824 West 47th Street--34th Ward: 3521 West 12th Street--Cicero: Kirchman State bank 22nd Street and 56th Avenue--Main campaign office: 3342 West 26th Street--offices <pb facs="5418478_2_0430.jpg" n="3"/>of the Czech National Alliance.</p>
