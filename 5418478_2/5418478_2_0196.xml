  <body>
   <p>Will the Republican mayor respect us as his Democratic predecessors did?</p>
   <p>Among Bohemians the question of representation of the Bohemian elements in the school board is again being discussed. As far as we know, at present no one is seeking this honorable office.</p>
   <p>Even Dr. Jirka has not sought reappointment. However, it is certain that Bohemian Republicans should at this time remind the mayor that he must provide Bohemians with a place on the school board, if the supposition that his party is unfavorable to the Bohemian element is to be overcome.</p>
   <p>It is known of course that a member of the school board cannot look after the interests of his own nationality to the exclusion of others.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0197.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He must respect the interests of all for the benefit of the public schools. Everything else is secondary. Since it has become a practice, among us, that every nationality be represented in that body, surely 50,000 Bohemians have a right to request that one from among them be appointed. Bohemians are among the taxpayers. Therefore they have a right to demand representation in every department of the city administration. According to regulations, Bohemians send their children to the public schools. Therefore, they rightfully expect that a Bohemian will always be appointed a member of the school board, so that they will have some one to turn to, should they wish to make a complaint or a proposal.</p>
   <p>It is unnecessary to mince words on this question. By what method can it be accomplished, so that the mayor will give the Bohemians representation?</p>
   <p>By harmonious work, by the dropping of all political partisanship, by discarding all personal likes and uniting in support of one individual, who is looked upon by all as the best qualified for the office.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0198.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>And who should it be?</p>
   <p>If we were to go over the list of Bohemian citizens, if we were to place the question before a Democrat or a Republican, the answer would be the same. Our wish is that the present member of the board, Dr. Jirka, be reappointed.</p>
   <p>This is the best recommendation which can be given any member.</p>
   <p>One such official is and always will be, a greater satisfaction to us than twenty others, who would be mere ciphers in that body.</p>
   <p>Dr. Jirka has expressed himself on several occasions as not being a candidate, but if the Bohemian people will insist on him and succeed in having mayor Washburne appoint him, he must submit to the wishes of his countrymen.</p>
