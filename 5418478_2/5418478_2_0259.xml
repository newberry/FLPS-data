   <p>Our well-known Chicago fellow-countryman, Mr. Karel (Charles) T. Vopicka hardly had any forebodings of the big burden he was taking up on his shoulders when he accepted an appointment as United States minister to Roumania, Serbia, and Bulgaria more than three years ago. His station, primarily was to be Bucharest, and a secondary one at Belgrade. There was a vigorous protest raised against him in connection with the appointment. It emanated mainly from prohibitionist influences, and from Germanic sources. Nevertheless, President Wilson, feeling that he owed the Czech-Americans a token of recognition, insisted upon his choice, and Mr. Vopicka took the high office, which no Czech in America has ever held before, to the greatest joy of his fellow-countrymen.</p>
   <p>On his way to his high station, he first visited his place of birth, near Pribram, Bohemia. It was there he had his first experience with <pb facs="5418478_2_0260.jpg" n="2"/>Austrian officials, who, knowing already that War was approaching, did not like to see a Czech in a position which should later prove to be of great importance and of decided influence. Mr. Vopicka, however, could not be dissuaded from carrying out his intentions to serve his adopted country as best he could, at the same time never forgetting the interest of his native land. He speedily became acquainted with the agencies of his office, and many were the press reports that commended his activities.</p>
   <p>He had been in office for a short time when War began to rage and affected Serbian people first. Mr. Vopicka conducted his affairs in Belgrade as long as this was possible. Finally, when the Teutons took the Serbian capital, he restricted his activities to Sofia in Bulgaria, and Bucharest, Roumania. The Bulgarians, in the meantime, allowed themselves to be enticed by their King, Ferdinand, to enter the War on the side of the Central powers, and because of their age-old hatred of the Serbians. The activities of Mr. Vopicka ceased almost entirely, as far as Bulgaria was <pb facs="5418478_2_0261.jpg" n="3"/>concerned from that moment, for the Teutons were loath to see the representative of a neutral country in a place where their activities could so easily be observed. In due course of time, Roumania joined the Allies. The United States minister, as a Czech, certainly rejoiced over the first victories of the Roumanians, and was also very helpful in adversity, when Bucharest was taken by the Teutons. What Mr. Vopicka had to endure during the bombardment by German planes before the evacuation of the capital by Roumanian troups and their capture, only he himself can depict. He clung to his post, a protector of American interests and of human rights. This did not appeal to the Teutons, who are wont to disregard the laws of humanity. They used cunning means and drove Mr. Vopicka from his post.</p>
   <p>There came times which were as exciting as they were interesting, when Mr. Vopicka rode through Austria to Berlin where the news soon arrived that America had severed diplomatic relations with the piratical Germans.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0262.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Mr. Vopicka moved on to Copenhagen, where he was unable to find an accommodation for his return to America. In this he succeeded, however, by going to Norway, where he boarded a ship that brought him back without any serious incident.</p>
   <p>This odyssey will come to an end when he arrives in Chicago today. To welcome him, his wife and children, as well as a multitude of friends will be at the Union depot including the committee of thirty from the Beseda society. To the banquet to be given in his honor, United States Senator James Hamilton Lewis, Prof. B. Simek of Iowa City, and Prof. Samuel Harper are among those invited. A program of high artistic quality is provided, in which Mrs. Sterba, Mrs. Lajer, Mrs. Geringer, and Miss Bartusek will participate.</p>
