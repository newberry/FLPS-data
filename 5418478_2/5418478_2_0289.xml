<title level="a">BOHEMIANS COMPETE IN PRIMARY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Supreme Court of the State of Illinois adjourned last night without having passed on the validity of the new direct primary law, and the approaching primary election will therefore be governed by it. The judicial election, which will be held on April 12, will probably be subject to this law also, since the Supreme Court will not reconvene early enough to have reached a decision on this question.</p>
   <p>In all the Bohemian sections the interest in next Tuesday's primary is centered on the outcome in the Twelfth Ward, where two aldermen are to be elected, with a long list of candidates of Bohemian descent competing. First and foremost are Messrs. [Anton] Cermak and Kounovsky, who seek the office left vacant by Mr. Uhlir's election as judge of the municipal court. Each of the two candidates has a large following eager to see its favorite win in the short-term aldermanic race. The long-term office is being sought by the present incumbent, <pb facs="5418478_2_0290.jpg" n="2"/>Alderman Zimmer, whose political strength is generally admitted; his competitor is our fellow countryman B. Novak. On the Republican side Mr. Mulac is after the short-term office.</p>
   <p>In other wards also our fellow countrymen will be in the thick of the battle. Mr. Edward Klinenberg is candidate in the Twenty-ninth Ward; Mr. Ringl in the Twenty-seventh Ward opposes the Republican Cap; in the Tenth Ward Mr. Foucek is running for alderman as a Republican. In the Thirty-first Ward the Bohemians are about to put up an independent candidate, but up to this hour he has not been named.</p>
