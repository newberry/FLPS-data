   <p>The ringing voice of our President is soaring above the thunder of guns, above the storm of war. Your voice has declared war on the German-Magyar caste which rules in Central Europe, oppressing our nation and others. This caste, in Austria-Hungary, has found that it can rule over the small nations only with the aid of the German armies. Austria-Hungary has renounced its own independence and is given over to Germany in the interest of the Hohenzollern dynasty. Just as Abraham Lincoln's voice called for a government of the people, your voice is imparting strength to millions of subjugated men and women who are, however, determined to protect their ancient, inalienable rights. These millions feel encouraged by the progress of democracy, headed by the President of this great and glorious Republic.</p>
   <p>As Americans of Czech descent, we doubly feel the power in your decision, and we are convinced that the entrance of the United States into the war <pb facs="5418478_2_0740.jpg" n="2"/>against Austria-Hungary marks a propitious turning point in this tragedy of mankind. It is impossible for a democracy like America to lose a war against autocracy. Democracy is going to be victorious under your leadership, for truth, rights and justice are bound to win.</p>
   <p>We rejoice over America's entrance into the war, for we know that it means an immense strengthening of the cause of our sympathizers and allies in the heart of Europe--it means help to the Czechoslovak people in their unequal struggle against the tyrants.</p>
   <p>We welcome America's entrance into the war, because from this moment on, the cause of the liberation of small nations is won, whatever turn action on the battlefield may take.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that you, Mr. President,will accept our just request and give it your kind consideration, for you have been fair to those who were loyal to you, to the American Government, and to the sublime ideals of <pb facs="5418478_2_0741.jpg" n="3"/>democracy which guide your actions. We entreat you in the name of all citizens of Czechoslovak descent to support our request by the weight and influence of your high office. We request that Czechoslovaks who have not been able to obtain American citizenship papers, though they had the best of intentions of doing so, be given the same consideration that is accorded to them in England, France, Canada, and Russia. It was upon special request by the Czech National Alliance that these countries made an exception of Czechoslovak noncitizens.</p>
   <p>There are thousands of members of the Czech National Alliance in the United States Army now who could not become citizens, no matter how willing they are because they are not entitled to the papers yet. These very same men were among the most eager to follow your call, in which you reminded us to do our duty which we owe to this Republic and to democracy. All Czechoslovak citizens of this country join in submitting this request to you--that Czechoslovak noncitizens be classified not as "alien enemies," but as "friendly foreigners". We vouch for their loyalty and promise in their name that they <pb facs="5418478_2_0742.jpg" n="4"/>will double their efforts to prove that they are fulfilling their patriotic duties just as conscientiously as any American citizen.</p>
   <p>The Czech and Slovak immigrants have never enjoyed the protection of a consulate, and, in fact, relinquished such protection immediately at the out- break of the war. They stand alone and beg the Government of the United States and its great President to grant them shelter and security in this country.</p>
   <p>The Czech National Alliance promises that all its members will prove to be worthy of magnanimous consideration by the President of the United States. In their defensive struggle against Austria-Hungary, they are guided by the beacon symbolizing love, work, and honesty.</p>
   <p>Signed: Dr. Ludwig J. Fisher,</p>
   <p>President of the Czech National Alliance, Chicago.</p>
