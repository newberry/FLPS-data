   <p>In yesterday's meeting of the Ceskoslovansky Pomocny Vybor (Czechoslav Aid Committee) in Pilsen Sokol Hall more letters of thanks were read. They came mostly from Czech soldiers who while in the Austrian army had been taken prisoners by the Serbians. The latter released them to the Czechoslovak army, which at present is fighting shoulder to shoulder with the French and the Italians. There was one letter sent by Brother Sramek which typifies the sentiment of our boys. It shows how the aid extended to them is appreciated and the spirit in which it is received. All our soldiers are expressing satisfaction in being able to serve in France in the Czechoslovak army as volunteers under the Czechoslovak banner. Conspicuous mention is made of the special recognition of the Czechoslovak army by France.</p>
   <p>A banner was presented to it by the City of Paris, accompanied by a <pb facs="5418478_2_0474.jpg" n="2"/>document expressing appreciation of our army's service. This document is going to be published. The flag was presented by the President of the Republic himself. Unanimous resolutions toward united action were passed in the meeting.</p>
   <p>Mr. Stepina, for the Aid Committee, is to make contact with Mr. Vojta Benes, secretary of the Czech National Alliance, for the purpose of planning immediate action. New coworkers were welcomed. A great many gifts, particularly for the Red Cross ambulance to be donated, were received and acknowledged with thanks. Although action for the purchase of the ambulance has not yet officially been started, still the Aid Committee was in a position to appropriate the amount of $2,400 for the ambulance, which is to be sent to Vladivostok under the care of the American Red Cross. Authorities in Washington were notified. A staff or physicians, nurses, etc., was recommended, and further lively co-operation in every way was promised. The contributions of an ambulance each to France and <pb facs="5418478_2_0475.jpg" n="3"/>Italy will follow in the near future. It behooves us to point out that our ladies are taking on a large share of the preparations. Many women from our educational institutions are enlisting in Red Cross service, so that our campaign may be said to be in full swing.</p>
   <p>The present time calls for higher requirements in all activities of support or aid, and everything has to be done to prevent one activity's overlapping or handicapping another. This warning is emphasized in all statutes governing the care of war sufferers, widows, orphans, the maimed, or the wounded. The activities of the auxiliary bodies extend, of course, also to the support of our legionnaires in France, their widows and orphans and other surviving dependents, and not less to the aid of prisoners of war in Serbia.</p>
   <p>It is also necessary to establish funds for the support of widows in Bohemia and for widows here in America. The American Red Cross has promised to <pb facs="5418478_2_0476.jpg" n="4"/>extend a helping hand to us in this field. A new source of contributions for the work has arisen from gifts of people who instead of honoring their dead by flower offerings place the equivalent in money at the disposal of the Aid Committee. Such contributions have been received already, and they certainly are an example worthy of being followed.</p>
   <p>A committee consisting of wealthy and prominent Czechs has been formed in New York City of which the aim is to aid our suffering people and soldiers and alleviate their hardships. Mr. J. F. Stepina, chairman of the Czechoslav Aid Committee, is a member of that New York body. The longer the war lasts, the more numerous will the needy become as the result of it. There will be many more from the front in France and also from Italy, as a letter from Major E. Konrad, dated at Rome, bears witness.....</p>
