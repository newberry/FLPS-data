   <p>Doctor Ludwig Fisher, president, and Doctor Jar. Smetanka, secretary, of the Czech National Alliance, were presented to General Joffre and the other Allied delegates at a banquet in the Auditorium Hotel yesterday. An interestingly prepared address, expressive of the loyal sentiment of the Czech-Americans towards the French nation, was delivered by Minister Viviani, head of the French delegation, who gave evidence of his great pleasure, as did the other Allied delegates. The high official assured the representatives of the Czech National Alliance that he knew the Czechs well, just as he knew the other nations who are friendly toward France, and that upon his return, he will hasten to convey to his government the expression of the amicable sentiments of the Czechs.</p>
   <p>On this occasion, our representative made the acquaintance of the French <pb facs="5418478_2_0968.jpg" n="2"/>journalist, Henry Collin, of the news bureau Agence Havas. He declared that Czech hopes and exertions have a multitude of influential friends in France. He also expressed his conviction that the work done by the Czech National Alliance will not be in vain.</p>
