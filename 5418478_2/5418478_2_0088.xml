  <body>
   <p>President Wilson has taken a rational attitude concerning newspaper censorship; his reasoning is in perfect harmony with the thoughts that guide his administration. He is not adverse to sane criticism, but rather takes directions from it. This sort of collaboration of the government with public opinion can produce only favorable results. According to the President's own words, nothing could damage the cause of the United States more than the introduction of a censorship which would deny the people their inalienable right to criticize the actions of public officials. There is much truth in this. A nation, which for years has been boasting of its liberty, would scarcely be expected to stand the dictates of some farfetched Czarism. Everyone is subject to the commission of errors, and, therefore, so are the men at the helm of the state. This is obvious, e.g., <pb facs="5418478_2_0089.jpg" n="2"/>in England. The British government has made mistakes galore, and would have perpetrated still more, had not forceful and vigorous criticism from the press stepped in. Even the German government had to capitulate before censure, and it is no secret that in that state more radical articles issue from the press now than ever before the war.</p>
   <p>The results of direct action by the press during the Spanish-American War is still remembered in connection with the dirty profiteering transactions of the firms supplying the government with staple goods in the form of deodorized and embalmed foodstuffs. Again, any responsible newspaper will readily submit to censorship in matters of a purely military nature, as for instance tactical and strategic measures. This is unconditionally a necessity. But it is unthinkable that censorship should be tightened in the United States as recklessly as it is done in the autocratic countries.</p>
