   <p>The office of States Attorney Mr. Robert E. Crowe during recent days was enriched by an efficient worker. We are truly pleased that this new worker is our young and active countryman, Mr. George J. Tourek whom the States Attorney selected as one of his assistants, assigning him to that division which deals with all cases of fraudulent stocks and bonds. All our countrymen, who need information about such matters, or any counsel whatsoever which touches upon such matters, may freely consult him in his office which is located in the County Building....</p>
   <p>Mr. Tourek, who is only twenty-six years of age, was born in Chicago, and is the son of Mr. Vaclav Tourek and Mrs. Barbora Tourek. After finishing the grammar and high schools he entered the Kent College of Law from which he graduated in <pb facs="5418478_2_1713.jpg" n="2"/>1921. In the same year he passed the bar examinations and was admitted to the bar. He was, for a time, employed as a state inspector of insurance companies in the state of Illinois. The distinguished countryman served in the United States Army during the World War and is a member of the Lawndale-Crawford Post No. 98 of the American Legion. He resides with his parents at 2535 South Harding Avenue.</p>
