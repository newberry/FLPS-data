   <p>On Wednesday evening City Clerk John Siman stepped on a platform at a political meeting and told how a representative of the city administration came to him and wanted to know how it could be arranged to have the city council candidate of the Republican party in the Thirteenth Ward, G. L. Robertson, get first place on the ticket.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Siman delivered his speech, he did not mention the name of the person.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Siman entered his office yesterday, two men came in and wanted to know if he was referring to them when he delivered his address. He answered: "The name of the man who came to me with the proposal to fix things for Robertson is George A. Nye. I give you his name publicly, to ease others who may have a guilty conscience."</p>
   <p>Nye, who is superintendent of the city boiler inspectors, heard of this and went <pb facs="5418478_2_0330.jpg" n="2"/>directly to the office of City Clerk John Siman. "You lie" yelled Nye. "You are a scoundrel," answered Mr. Siman. The conflict ended in a wordy skirmish; evidently Nye was aware of the physical prowess of Sokol [Gymnast] John Siman.</p>
   <p>Superintendent Nye later told his friends that should Mr. Siman publicly mention the stated episode, he would start a suit for $100,000 for defamation of character.</p>
   <p>When Mr. Siman heard of this threat he said: "What kind of public statement does he want? Does he want me to present to him in writing that which I publicly stated in one-syllable words? "I have witnesses, and can secure sworn statements if necessary."</p>
