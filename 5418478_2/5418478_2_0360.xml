   <p>All respectable citizens realize that it is about time for new and healthier conditions to commence in our political life. It is sad when citizens go to the polls and one says to the other: "They all steal there, why then, shouldn't we send a Bohemian so that he could take something?"</p>
   <p>During the last campaign and those previous to it, this was heard many times. From this it can be seen that the citizens have had bitter experiences and expect nothing else from their representatives, other than that they will steal at every opportunity presenting itself to them. The people have become skeptical; they do not believe any promises, and the only reason why they attend elections is that they wish to express their personal nationalistic or partisan inclinations. Whether the candidate is capable of benefiting the ward or the city is something of which very few voters think. Interest in public affairs is vanishing. The citizens realize that officials in their offices think first of their own personal aims and the advancement of their personal advantages; therefore, it is not to be wondered at that the people do not believe in politics or in the politicians when they are promising something.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0361.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>It is imperative that this ill-omened condition be brought to an end. Towards this end all honorable citizens must unite. Various political leaders, regardless of party lines, must work towards this end. In our opinion, we should follow the European custom in such matters. Where our elected officials do not think of the voters, except when they again seek their votes, in Austria for instance, a representative or other elected official must from time to time render an account of his actions to the voters, listen to their requests, and endeavor to comply with them. We think that something of the kind among us would not hurt. Interest in public matters would increase, the voters would learn how to recognize the capabilities of their representatives and would, accordingly, either respect or repudiate them. Public officials would not then be looked upon as selfish destroyers of public interests, but as the actual representatives of the interests of the majority of voters.</p>
