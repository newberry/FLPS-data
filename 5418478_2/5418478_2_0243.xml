   <p>While visiting in Washington, D. C., John Toman, alderman of the Thirty-fourth Ward of Chicago and member of several aldermanic committees, wished to pay homage to President Wilson, of whom he was one of the most enthusiastic admirers. When he entered the door he was halted by a watchman. His identification card was not sufficient.</p>
   <p>"I understand that you are an alderman of Chicago, but you cannot get in without a pass." "What kind of a pass must I get?" Mr. Toman asked. "It must be issued by the War Department and the naval authorities; your photograph bearing your signature must be attached," was the answer.</p>
   <p>Hearing this, the Alderman first expressed himself in his accustomed style, using phrases of his own coinage; then he walked toward the railing of the corridor and stopped, as another guard approached him and posted himself behind the Alderman's back.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_0244.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Listen! For heaven's sake, why are those guys cleaning that auto with a duster?" the Alderman exclaimed. "They are just monkeying around and gazing at me!"</p>
   <p>"Those are detectives who are watching you," the guard explained.</p>
   <p>That was enough for the city father. He turned and moved away from the White House.</p>
