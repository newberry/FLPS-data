   <p>A telegraphic report was received from Springfield Saturday that Governor Fifer had named our well-known countryman, John Kralovec, a member of the West Parks Commissioners. A short time ago the place was vacated by the present Probate Judge Kohlsaat, and Bohemian Republicans requested that Mr. Kralovec be appointed to the vacancy.</p>
   <p>Bohemian Republicans had plenty of reason to fear that their request would not be granted at first, for there were many who tried to get the appointment, who had much influence, and as is well-known, the financial interests which contribute to each political campaign had to be considered. Lately, however, more favorable reports have been arriving, and it was because of a certain Republican politican who is in on all the secrets at the State Capitol that Mr. Kralovec, was finally named. We must congratulate our fellow-countryman.</p>
