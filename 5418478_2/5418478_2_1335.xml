  <body>
   <p>Ever since the beginning of the European war all impartial observers have been wondering how long America would endure the unheard-of bigotry and wild intolerance of local Germans who, it seems, have completely forgotten that the reason why they left Germany was precisely its militaristic system and its strict autocracy, two attributes [of the German establishment] two condemned by almost the entire world. They fled to America as to a refuge, and now they work for Germany and against American interests by all means, honest and dishonest. The fact that the ravings of the Germans were disregarded, that the Anerican people, particularly those who are American born, have shown a great deal of indifference toward it, speaks volumes for the liberality of our laws and the tolerance of our people. But everything must end sometime, and the end of German bigotry is here now. One of the foremost Chicago dailies has recently published a snappy article, entitled "Censure and <pb facs="5418478_2_1336.jpg" n="2"/>Warning," dealing in the proper manner with the ravings of the Teutons, part of which we submit to our readers translated into Bohemian. It is most significant because it shows the change in public opinion since the beginning of the war. It is characteristic because it was the American press in the Middle West and especially our own Chicago papers which heretofore took sides with the Germans and were careful not to offend their "patriotism". The Eastern newspapers have never dealt so tenderly with the German maniacs. The article reads in part as follows:</p>
   <p>"The time has come to censure the publishers of certain German-American newspapers and to offer a few friendly suggestions to the Germans in this country. That the German publishers should take sides with Germany against the Allies is only natural and proper. But they have not stopped there. They are taking sides with Germany against the United States, and that is treason. They see every issue in America through German glasses; they are trying to influence <pb facs="5418478_2_1337.jpg" n="3"/>public opinion and swing it in the Kaiser's favor; they treat the President of the United States to abuse that would land them in jail in any other country.</p>
   <p>"One of these publishers calls the American foreign policy 'un-American' and 'unjust'. 'It must be stopped, or else President Wilson must resign!' Let us just consider the stupid arrogance of such a remark. An imported publisher claiming the 'leadership of German opinion' demands the resignation of the President of the United States! Then consider the following, perhaps not so arrogant a statement but a more treasonable one.</p>
   <p>"'We are not afraid of any serious complications between this republic and Germany because its (the American) Government has followed ever since the outbreak of the war the policy of cowardice and fear.'</p>
   <p>"Thus reads the Illinois Staats-Zeitung of May 8, 1915. In other words, the <pb facs="5418478_2_1338.jpg" n="4"/>United States acts in a cowardly way because it refuses to pull the Kaiser's chestnuts out of the fire, and because it is a cowardly country, it may be abused and offended without fear of the consequences.</p>
   <p>"It is really astounding how far other writers dare to go in this 'German-American' campaign. They demand that the United States prohibit the export of arms in spite of the fact that the sale of armaments is recognized as legal, and the fact that Germany has taken advantage of [the traffic in arms] many times. (Hermann Ridder, publisher of the New-Yorker Staats-Zeitung, the principal complainant about the export of American arms to the Allies, manufactures war planes for England in his own plants.) Up to a date only four months before the outbreak of this war Germany was sending arms and ammunition to Mexico, well knowing that they would be used against American soldiers and marines.</p>
   <p>They [These German writers] have made noisy demands of America to break through <pb facs="5418478_2_1339.jpg" n="5"/>the Allies' blockade of Germany. They have tried to involve this country in a war with Japan in the hope of dragging us into the European war on the German side. They have characterized the note of President Wilson to Germany--a note of which every loyal citizen wholeheartedly approves--as 'shameless' and 'unneutral,' and they have advised the Kaiser to 'pay no attention' to that communication. They describe Germany's evasive and offensive reply as a document that should be considered by this Government as putting an end to all that controversy. They extolled every diabolical deed of the Kaiser's soldiers as proof of a higher 'kultur' and branded any criticism of such bestialities as a malicious, unjustified attack upon Germany. They glorified even the supreme horror of the sinking of the 'Lusitania.'</p>
   <p>"It is their own business how much trouble these "Teutomaniacs' pile up for themselves. If it should come to a war between Germany and the United States, <pb facs="5418478_2_1340.jpg" n="6"/>they will be lucky to escape anything worse than the suppression of their publications and the internment of their own persons. Every American citizen of German origin should most carefully see to it that his loyalty shall be to the United States, and to the United States alone. Every German association should use this opportunity to make a pledge to be American to the core. Every speaker, every writer who is trying to sow enmity to the United States Government among the German-born people of this country should be invited to remove himself and his highly treasonable [activities] to some other locality, and the invitation should be worded in such a way as to be understood even by his limited intelligence. The United States is a nation, not a collection of colonies. It will act as a nation in the crisis forced upon it by the attack on the 'Gulflight' and the murder of American men and women aboard the 'Lusitania'. It demands the support of all the country's inhabitants, no matter where they may have been born. It certainly will not tolerate much longer <pb facs="5418478_2_1341.jpg" n="7"/>the high treason of those who are eating its bread and getting rich in American money and yet in spite of all this avoid the duties of American citizens to court a Kaiser whose hands are stained with the blood of murdered women and children."</p>
   <p>Thus speaks an American daily paper of Chicago which ever since the beginning of the war has been so very careful not to offend the Germans that we have counted it among the Germanophile papers of this city. The list of sins which it puts before the eyes of American Germans is long, but it is by no means complete. To record all that our Germans have done in violation of the spirit of neutrality would require a thick volume. It is encouraging, however, to see that the American public is preparing to confine the ravings of our Germanic maniacs within proper limits. The German element in the United States is so much excited and upset by its press concerning which it is <pb facs="5418478_2_1342.jpg" n="8"/>no secret that it is subsidised by Berlin, that the United States Government would have to give serious consideration to the possibility of a civil war in this country if it should come to a war between Germany and the United States.</p>
