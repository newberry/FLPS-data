   <p>One of the most important, and in its consequences, the most far-reaching laws passed by Congress in its last session was the Harrison law, prohibiting the illicit sale of narcotic medicines, and severely punishing the seller. If this were a state law, it would be inconsequential, but federal laws are always very effective. Pharmaceutical circles report that the law has greatly reduced the sale of narcotics. They are being exported in large quantities to Europe these days, where they are badly needed on the battlefields, but even so the sale of narcotics in the United States has not increased, but has rather decreased a full third since the law went into effect. So it appears that the law has had exactly the effect that had been predicted for it when it was enacted. In spite of that, however, some physicians and hospital managers are finding that it needs some changes which will increase its effectiveness. <pb facs="5418478_2_1701.jpg" n="2"/>No doubt it will be amended in due time.</p>
