   <p>The war with Spain is over. We should now consider the gained profits, obtained commodities, also new problems and obligations, created by the result of the war. We realize that we never gained immense material profits for our country, and at the same time, our problems in the cause of development of humanity has been augmented greatly.</p>
   <p>During the four months period of the war the change in the nationalities of the immigrants, and in the political aspect of every community- was enormous. The division of the north and south as political items is smoothed over. The differences between the political parties - Democratic, Republican, northern and southern are almost forgotten. The fraternal hands were mutually extended, a grasp strengthened, and the unity of the whole nation proclaimed with word and action. This unity of the nation, obedient and strong, is enforced forever <pb facs="5418478_2_1607.jpg" n="2"/>and sealed with our own blood so powerfully, that the political disturbers will in the future not be able to divide the people into hostile camps and to incite one nationality against the other. North and South were fighting shoulder to shoulder and all nationalities, as parts of our big country, stuck one to another on the bloody battlefields. Now they realize that concord and collaboration is the only basis for construction of prosperity for our big country.</p>
   <p>As a result the different nationalities, as a part of the United States, joined in a mutual task will be much more appreciated and stabilized; European countries will be more acquainted with us and our power in unity; we will have more respect for our union.</p>
   <p>Until now the European powers were not much inclined to understand us, to know and recognize us. When the war started they expressed their belief we could not expect a success.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1608.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The war has changed it all. They were taught to consider us. Our naval victories, the irreproachable behavior of our army, which consisted of different nationalities and races, and the absence of a sense of revenge gained their respect for our nation.</p>
   <p>The facts showed Europe that we were involved in the war for entirely different purposes than vengeance or annexation. -We proved this. We sent the remnants of the Spanish navy on our own expense through the ocean, we set at liberty the high navy officers on word of honor only, we fed many Spaniards on our own account.</p>
   <p>It was stated many times that our American diplomats are not civilized enough, not polished, are too rough; maybe it is so, but European diplomacy is always postponing, delaying, that is why it is more flexible, smooth, using more hypocrisy and lies to cheat its adversaries.</p>
   <p>The European envoys never told what they were thinking about or what was the intention of their countries, our representatives were always outspoken, telling everything that was in their hearts.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1609.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>When the United States went to the last war, they believed without doubt in victory but never supposed that a complete victory would be attained so easily, so quickly, and with such little loss.</p>
   <p>Our first problem is how to govern a remote country, populated with strange nations, accustomed to another regime, habits, and culture.</p>
   <p>Fortunately, America has an example and experience in England, which succeeded in similar circumstances and reached the best results.-</p>
   <p>It is almost sure that national and individual nationalistic desire is, that the United States should keep all conquered territories, not to take into consideration the advice and alarms of some croakers who are crying to see a danger to our freedom and government by an annexation of new territories. It depends upon the people not to lose anything from the possessed goods, by not being dishonest and thoughtless. -</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_2_1610.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>To what does Cuba, Porto Rico or the Philippine Islands amount?</p>
   <p>The difficulty of managing them is not the distance from our coasts, but the enormous difference between their population and ours.</p>
   <p>Our problem should be to assure the new people a constant and good government, because the laws will not change these new citizens. The new government for the acquired territories should give them the possibility of regaining in time their liberty and self government.</p>
