   <p>According to a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, students in colleges and universities which have received financial support from the Federal Government in the form of extensive land grants for this purpose to the states in which these institutions are located, must either take the stipulated military training or leave these institutions and matriculate elsewhere.</p>
   <p>In individual institutions of higher learning obligatory military training has, especially since the World War, frequently been attacked and sharply criticized. It is maintained in these circles that this form of training instills a warlike spirit in our young people, while it would be much preferable to further the spirit of world peace.</p>
   <p>Without going into the justice or injustice of these and similar complaints, <pb facs="5418474_1_0042.jpg" n="2"/>the Supreme Court affirmed that it is the duty of every citizen to defend his country, and that the Constitution exempts no one who is physically able. So long as war is a possibility, every country must reckon with this possibility.</p>
   <p>Obviously the Court was influenced in its decision by the arguments of the Attorney General that it is in the interest of the whole country for the American youth to receive a certain amount of military training, so that in an emergency the relatively small standing army of the United States could be strengthened, and avoid being crushed by a superior force.</p>
   <p>The original law which made military training in the institutions of higher learning obligatory, even though the institutions receive only indirect support from the Federal Government, stems from the year 1862, and was enacted during Abraham Lincoln's administration.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0043.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Today there are about seventy such educational institutions in the United States, of which twenty-six are state universities. Naturally, no student can be compelled to attend one of these institutions; but if he does enroll there, he must, according to the Supreme Court's latest decision, undergo the prescribed course of military training. In accordance with the same decision, it is the duty of every citizen "to defend the country against all enemies to the best of his ability, and only Congress has the right to make exceptions for people who object to this service for religious or other reasons". The decision states explicitly that it can in no wise be considered an infringement of the constitutional rights of American citizens for students to be compelled to undergo military training if they wish to attend certain educational institutions, even if Congress had never made such a stipulation.</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances it is difficult to suppose that any success will attend the efforts being made to induce Congress to change the law and make military training at our institutions of higher learning optional instead of obligatory.</p>
