   <p>According to newspaper reports, 65 German Societies, among them most all of the Turner Societies of the Chicago Turner districts, intend to intercede in favor of distribution and use of free books in the public schools. This is not done of its own initiative, but in order to assist the passage of the bill, which the teachers have submitted to the Legislature in Springfield.</p>
   <p>Naturally, this arcused the displeasure of the clericals, who are doing everything in their power to hurry the matter. First the St Boniface Brothers began to ring the bell and immediately followed the Superior Church Community of St. Louis, and now the St. Aloysius Brothers on 12th Street begin to sound the alarm, to call all believers to arms to help fight against liberality of mind, and the restriction of their income. The initiative was taken by the St. Boniface Brothers, who declared, that such a movement, which was undertaken solely for the benefit of the people, as unnecessary and senseless, as unjust, as unpedagogical and finally as un-American and dangerous to the state. These bigots avoided an open discussion-- they have their <pb facs="5418474_1_0178.jpg" n="2"/>reasons for it... but like moles they burrow in the dark, and want to make the people believe, that they do not act for their own interests, but only for the benefit of the believing souls, but forget altogether, that thousands of unbelievers have to pay, for untaxed church properties ... The bigots talk of justice, humanity and love of liberty, but in fact they are only acting from egotistic motives... They know, that the ground under their feet is cracking; that by distributing schoolbooks free, even the children of the believers, will go to the public schools... and only for this reason do they fight against it "with tooth and nail."</p>
   <p>But because the liberal element of Chicago is not willing to stand for the insults of the bigots, and the liberals are fighting with open visors, the latter intend to hold a meeting Sunday, the 21st of this month, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, in the Aurora Turnerhalle, cor. Ashland Avenue and Division Streets, and to give the proper answer to the church fraternity, for their baseless and impertinent accusations. The well known and excellent speaker, lawyer Harry Rubens, and several other Representatives, will discuss this matter, and therefore, no liberal which is synonymous with Turner should fail to be present at this mass-meeting.</p>
