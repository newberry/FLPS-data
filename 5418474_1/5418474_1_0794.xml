   <p>The Germans of the city of New York held a great mass meeting on March 18, for the purpose of protesting against the intention of the school board of that city to ban the instruction of German from the public schools. Many good reasons for retaining the instruction of German were advanced in this meeting, and not only by Germans, but also, orally and in writing, by some members of the English Language Society. It was pointed out that studying two languages at the same time exercises the power to think; that a constant comparison of two languages not only sharpens the mind, but also increases the ability to use the mother tongue; that a knowledge of the German language aids young people to attain success in business, etc.</p>
   <p>That is all true; but we should not forget that the question is chiefly one of power. If the German citizens who are members of the German Language Society are strong enough to force recognition of themselves as a determining factor <pb facs="5418474_1_0795.jpg" n="2"/>in public affairs, the excellent reasons mentioned above, for maintaining or introducing the instruction in German, will be convincing; otherwise all efforts will be in vain.</p>
   <p>All the theories which were advanced in favor of teaching German in the public schools of the country thirty years ago, are still valid. Would anyone, however, have proposed that German be made a branch of study in public schools at that time, when Americans of English or Irish descent respected the Germans no more than the Chinese are respected in California today? At that time the Germans in the United States were utterly impotent, but now they are a power in the land. It is as such that we demand equality for the language with which we have endowed the unfinished American character. It is by that power that they will obtain recognition of this equality, wherever such recognition can be obtained.</p>
   <p>"Here I am, and here I shall stay," wrote MacMahon, after he had forced his way into the Tower of Malakoff. Thus we members of the German Language Society <pb facs="5418474_1_0796.jpg" n="3"/>declare emphatically: "Here we are, and we shall stay here. We shall preserve our German language, our German ideas, and our German customs. We appreciate, and are willing to assimilate those native habits and usages that appear to be good and sensible; but we are determined to insist upon our right to equal participation in the formation of the national American character. We are well aware that our endeavors will meet with opposition. Uniting members of various nations into a new nation was always difficult, as we can see from history, and we are prepared to meet the issue. We shall gladly face all opponents, endure their ridicule and their sneers, as German character and customs gradually assert themselves and become American national characteristics. Patience and perseverance have always been among the most noteworthy virtues of Germans; they were chiefly responsible for Germany's success in every phase of human endeavor; and they will force recognition of their right to equality, not only locally, but everywhere in America."</p>
   <p>It is argued, and not without good reason, that the study of a foreign language will prove to be useful and advantageous even to children of the members of the <pb facs="5418474_1_0797.jpg" n="4"/>English Language Society. However, the objection is raised that the study of a foreign language, even though it may be profitable, is beyond the scope and sphere of elementary schools, the purpose of which is to instruct only in the fundamentals of education, and that in the language of the country; and that the study of a foreign language should be confined to high schools or private schools.</p>
   <p>That is the opinion of the local Chicago Times. This publication points to Alsace-Lorraine, where the German Government has excluded the study of the French language from those public schools which correspond to our elementary schools. However, we do not agree with the premises on which our opponents base their argument. That is, we deny that the German language is a foreign language in America. No law of the country demands that a person who desires to become a citizen and a taxpayer, forego the privilege of using his mother tongue. The citizens who are members of the German Language Society are equally as good citizens (frequently, much better) of America, as the members of the English Language Society.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0798.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Thus the German language is one of the language of the country, and, as far as the extent of its use is concerned, is second only to the English language. For this reason, and not because it is profitable to know another language, the German Language Society demands that German be taught in our public schools, which are maintained, in part, by the taxes which are paid by German-American citizens. But the enforcement of this demand depends upon power. Good will, and the opinion of educated Anglo-Americans may be of some assistance; however, respectful consideration for the strength of German votes is the principal thing. If that is lacking, all theoretical arguments will be in vain. [Translator's note: It was very difficult to translate this article, because the author uses many self-coined compound words.]</p>
