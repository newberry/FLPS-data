   <p>Since the teaching of German has moved in the public schools from the lowest grades up to highest; since it has become obligatory for students who have once taken it up; and since it has been grouped under one departmental head, it has produced results beyond the fondest expectations. The number of children of English speaking parents enrolled in the German classes is constantly increasing and proves that the study of German is considered to be of practical and cultural value as well.</p>
   <p>The school board has until now given almost unanimous recognition to the value of the teaching of German. The bitter hatred against everything German, as it has manifested itself in the school board of the Irish-American city New York, has until now not been noticed here.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0791.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We say until now, but national hatred is an hypocritic beast, which like a snake seems to be stiff and lifeless, to strike suddenly and uncover its poisonous fangs.</p>
   <p>It is the Chicago Times which tries to awaken here this hatred against everything German, even among the English speaking members of the school board. Yes we hear, that among the English members of the school board, an opinion is taking shape to abolish the position of German departmental head.</p>
   <p>Should a majority of the school board become a tool of the infamous story of the Times, the German speaking citizens would accept the challenge. From the German members of the school board we expect a fight for the retention of the German language under the present conditions.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0792.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The well being of no other American city depends as much as Chicago on the solidarity of its citizens from different nationalities. The political party system of this city has proved that Germans look for friends preferably among the Anglo-Americans. But should the Germans be attacked from the American side, they would not hesitate to counter-attack with all their power.</p>
