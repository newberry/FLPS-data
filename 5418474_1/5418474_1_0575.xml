   <p>The following proclamation will be sent to all the clubs, lodges and associations, whose addresses are known to the committee....</p>
   <p>"The Agitation Committee for the promotion of the continuance of special branches in the public schools asks your valued association to use its full power and influence to give added pressure to our protest against the attempted curtailment of school subjects.</p>
   <p>"There is a harmful proposition on the school board's calendar which will affect our schools; German, gymnastics, singing and drawing are to be discontinued in the 3rd and 4th grades. Once started, the work of destruction will continue until the enemies of progress attain their goal. We are sending you a number of petitions, and we believe that you <pb facs="5418474_1_0576.jpg" n="2"/>will not experience any difficulty in obtaining the necessary signatures from your friends and members, especially if you announce it at a general meeting or entrust a diligent committee with the work of gathering names from all nationalities. Whatever may be done, must be accomplished quickly. Therefore, we ask you to send the signed petitions not later than March 14th, to Mr. Max Stern, 84-86 Fifth Ave. He can supply additional blanks when you need them.</p>
   <p>"We repeat, that our schools are facing a definite peril and quick, energetic help is needed. We rely on your assistance.</p>
   <p>Respectfully,</p>
   <p>The Agitation Committee."</p>
