   <p>Charles Decker has been elected again as teacher of The German language, in the Moseley School, and was proposed by Mr. Borke.</p>
   <p>With 9 votes against 4, it has been decided to approve the application for the introduction of German in the Jones and Nickersonville Schools. Bernan, Armstrong, Borke, Keith, Frankenthal, Delany, Ribzberg, Stensland and Hoyne were for English. Frake, Curran, Giles against the proposal.</p>
   <p>Borke, Frankenthal and Richberg as a Committee for the German lessons, reported about the unfavorable effect of the resolution made in the year '79 (that in each class of the free schools, the lessons in one of the non-obligatory subjects should be abandoned if there are less than 20 pupils.) This rule has done great harm especially to the German language, as the teaching of the language has been interrupted in the middle classes and it was not possible for the pupils having taken German lessons when entering High School, to participate in German lessons in advanced German <pb facs="5418474_1_0678.jpg" n="2"/>classes except in 6 schools. German lessons are given in the 8th grade and in many schools no longer in the 7th.</p>
   <p>With a frequent change of address among the population it happens that the lessons in German are instantly interrupted if the number of pupils participating, falls beneath 20, and is taken up again immediately when this number is again reached. For these reasons the Committee recommends the repeal of the former resolution. Referring to the progress, which German education has made notwithstanding these aggravating circumstances, the Committee reported very favorably. In the beginning of the year German lessons have been given in 18 Grammar Schools. In the School-year 1879-80 the number of pupils studing German rose to 3004, as compared with 2308, in the previous year.</p>
   <p>As regards the number of pupils, the Committee made several recommendations to get better results (which seem to be very necessary: Note of the Editor), and finally, recommended the introduction of German lessons, in the Marquette and Raymond School.</p>
