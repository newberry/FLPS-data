   <p>The English-American nativistic element reveals again its hatred of all foreign-born American citizens, and, in particular, the Germans of this city. Scribbling school marms and childish editors have expressed their attitude in certain papers of the English-speaking press. They have stated that they are going to fight bitterly against those branches of study in our public schools, which are highly appreciated by those American naturalized citizens, who have had the benefit of European education and culture. Their attack is directed against German instruction, in the lower grades, as a preliminary measure, and also against gymnastics, drawing, and vocal music.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0532.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Inasmuch as this attack is directed against the strong position of the Germans in public affairs, it becomes a political matter, which can not be settled at the ballot-box, because the decision rests with school board, which is not elected by the people, but is appointed by the mayor.</p>
   <p>Some of the questions to be taken into consideration in this controversy are:</p>
   <p>1. What weight have the desires of more than 40,000 men and women of all nationalities favoring the continuance of German, gymnastics, drawing, and singing, against the senseless outcry of a comparatively small part of the population?</p>
   <p>2. Of what importance is the knowledge of the German language in Chicago's industrial and commercial life?</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0533.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>3. What educational values does the study of the German language offer, according to eminent English-American educators.....and some of the most highly educated German-Americans? What authoritative value have the viewpoints of these capable, far-seeing men in comparison with the opinions of the nativistic, narrow-minded school marms and their male adherents or followers?</p>
   <p>4. What value is placed upon the estimate of parents, whose 8,934 children are now taking German lessons in the fourth grade, and, who have already passed the third grade? What do these parents think about the usefulness of German in the third and fourth grade of our public schools? If these parents were not convinced of the advantages of this subject they would have their children discontinue its study.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0534.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>5. Shall the public schools of Chicago, the metropolis of the West, be reduced to the standard of a New England village school?</p>
   <p>6. Shall not the children of the poor receive the same education in our public schools as the children of the rich, who usually receive these special instructions in the fifth and sixth grades?</p>
   <p>To say "no" to the last question would remind one of the famous saying of Vanderbilt, "The public be damned!"</p>
   <p>If the school board considers these and similar questions fairly and honestly, rejecting the narrow concepts of the nativists, it will not be able to refuse the request for the continuation of German instruction and the other studies mentioned.</p>
