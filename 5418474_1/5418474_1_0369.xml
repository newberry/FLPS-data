  <body>
   <p>A letter from Martin Schulhofer, superintendent of the German division of the Chicago school system, to the German newspapers in regard to the question as to whether instruction in the German language shall be continued or not [states that the answer] rests largely upon the opinion of German parents.</p>
   <p>The fact that German parents are being questioned as to their opinion toward the preservation of their mother tongue reflects a strong sentiment as to their guilt and of the contempt with which they are meeting in this country.</p>
   <p>That a brave school official has to beg German newspapers to remind German parents of their duties toward their children, so that they shall receive instruction in the German language free of charge, speaks volumes against these parents.</p>
   <p>If these German parents were not only German by birth but also in character, <pb facs="5418474_1_0370.jpg" n="2"/>they would force the school administration to give to their children an opportunity to learn the German language; instead of this the so-called German parents have to be begged for permission that their children shall be allowed to attend classes in which German is taught without any charge.</p>
   <p>Yet these same German parents are indignant at the hostility which they are encountering, and in defense appeal to the heroism and the cultural accomplishments of the German pioneers in America. But they forget to accuse themselves of being responsible that these great achievements have fallen into oblivion, and that the German in America is considered an outlaw.</p>
   <p>There really is no reason why the American people should remember or respect these deeds of German pioneers if they are unknown even to the children of German parents, and if German mothers do not consider it worth while to have their children educated in the German spirit.</p>
   <p>That in the first semester of the school year eighteen thousand children <pb facs="5418474_1_0371.jpg" n="3"/>received instruction in German, and that twelve thousand of these children did not belong to German parents is more than a deplorable disgrace; it is a crime.</p>
   <p>It is not a crime, to be sure, against the German spirit, which will never be stifled even when German women and German men of Chicago surrender the German language, but a crime against their own children because they withhold the German language from them and thereby rob them of the opportunity to enrich their souls with the treasures of German knowledge.</p>
   <p>Those who are apprehensive about the German cause should regard anti-German Americanism as their archenemy, but these German men and women through their contempt for the German language and their negligence of it are robbing the German cause of an important help and thereby are breeding contempt for it.</p>
