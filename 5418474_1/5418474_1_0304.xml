<title level="a">DELEGATES DEMAND REINTRODUCTION OF GERMAN LANGUAGE IN CHICAGO SCHOOLS</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>A lively debate arose yesterday at the meeting of delegates for the German day celebration at the Hotel Atlantic; in regard to the question of German lessons in the local high schools. Capt. George Weideling who will be the German speaker at the German day celebration, (William J. Bogan will be the American speaker), proposed to the 200 delegates a resolution in which the reintroduction or German Lessons in our high schools be demanded. This resolution should, according to the proposal of Capt. Weideling be presented in person to the Superintendent of schools at the German day celebration, after it has been previously read. The resolution was considered as fitting and proper, but several speakers deprived same at once of every practical success. As an argument they cited the fact, that the school commissioners declared their willingness long ago to reintroduce German lessons in the Chicago schools, therefore it is not necessary to put the request up to them again. The blame lies with the German parents, who have not shown the necessary interest, in spite, of repeated stimulus, to report their children as ready to participate in the German lessons. Especially if there could be a question of accusation the Germans themselves are to be blamed, because of their indifference towards their children's learning the mother tongue in the schools.</p>

   <p>After the meeting came to the conclusion that the German day committee has in this respect  still  to be very active to take care of the necessary propoganda among German parents to arouse their interest in regard to the German lessons, Mr. Weideling's resolution was accepted without contradiction.</p>
