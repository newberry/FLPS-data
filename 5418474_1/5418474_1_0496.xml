   <p>There is a sharp dispute between the Mayor and the City Council on account of the nominations to the school board. The committee, to whom the latter has been referred, had the impudence to demand of the nominees the written promise that they will not vote for the "Fads." As the committee was dissatisfied with the replies, an adjournment was taken without even reporting on the nominations.</p>
   <p>About this, Mr. Harrison grew justly furious. He withdrew the entire list from the City Council and immediately reproduced it in a changed form. The new list was immediately dismissed by the Council, but as it was not referred to the same committee, who did not report on the old list, it can, with a proposal for reconsideration, again be put to an immediate vote. Likely, its acceptance will occur. In any case, the Mayor gained his aims, that is, to take the matter out of the hands of the impudent committee.</p>
   <p>It is inconceivable that some Aldermen, who otherwise are sensible, permitted <pb facs="5418474_1_0497.jpg" n="2"/>themselves to be pushed into an obvious, untenable position. If the City Council should be allowed, by virtue of its right of ratification, to investigate the attitude of every candidate, so could also a Republican council refuse all Democrats who are nominated by a Democratic Mayor! In fact the City Council could prescribe all the nominations and take away entirely the power of nomination from the Mayor. Never before was the right of ratification interpreted in this way. In so far as this has any sense at all, it should stand as a bulwark against the discretion of the highest executive, or serve towards the correction of plainly visible mistakes. Had the Mayor sent in disreputable names or nominated ill-famed Ward loafers to whom he owed personal obligations, then it would be the duty of the City Council to refuse ratification. But under no circumstances is it entitled to use its right of ratification for the purpose of enforcing a certain policy upon an entirely independent body such as the school board. The candidates of the Mayor are altogether, absolutely respectable and of able judgement. They all have the desire to provide to the best of their ability for the improvement of public school affairs. Expecting of them that they in advance, even before participating in any discussion of school board affairs, should make written promises about the course they will follow, is <pb facs="5418474_1_0498.jpg" n="3"/>arrogance that cannot be tolerated.</p>
   <p>Particularly objectionable is the attitute of some German aldermen in this controversy. They may foster the honest conviction that German instruction in the lowest elementary grades is useless. But this is in no way an excuse for their collaboration with people who want to remove entirely the teaching of German and who also want to do away with instruction in gymnastics, drawing, and singing. Would there ever be an English-American, Irishman, Czech, or Pole who would give himself away to work into the hands of the enemies of his race? The German aldermen who now help the German-haters only make themselves contemptible with them. If they continue as they have begun, then they will bring it about that the Germans, who are nearly one-third of the entire population, are not represented at all upon the school board.</p>
