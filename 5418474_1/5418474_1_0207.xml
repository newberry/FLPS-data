<title level="a">GOVERNOR ALTGELD ON THE QUESTION OF COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE.</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The new leader of the State of Illinois takes the proper stand in regard to the school question. He demands not only the absolute cancellation of the Edwards statute, but insists upon the creation of a new compulsory school law which is devoid of the "Know-Nothing-ness" of the former, and he emphasizes, that the state cannot tolerate a condition, where children can be raised in ignorance and become addicted to criminality.</p>
   <p>Governor Altgeld's desire for a new improved act is justified at this particular time, as amongst various members of the victorious party, one notes attempts to abolish the Edwards statute, without passing a new compulsory school law. Such a procedure, as we shall show, would not only be unjust but it is also very impractical and stupid. The Democratic state platform has exposed the deficiencies and slyness of the Edwards law in a most masterful manner and showed how it intended to create a new act but it omitted one phase, the demand for a new statute, after abolishing the old one.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0208.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In his acceptance speech, at the time of his nomination and during his campaign, he laid particular stress upon compulsory school attendance without interference with the parental right to select schools, and he was opposed to anything which hampered private and parochial schools. This same attitude is  also expressed in his official proclamation. The idea of compulsory school attendance is typically German, and the German-Americans in this country were heartily in favor of it.</p>
   <p>How absolutely necessary it is to have a school attendance law with teeth in it, is readily shown by the problem of truancy, here in Chicago and the lax enforcement in Illinois. The Edwards law was more concerned with dominating the German parochial schools than with applying pressure to enforce a compulsory attendance.</p>
   <p>The great majority of the voters who swept the Democratic platform into office would be disappointed and painfully offended if our state should be <pb facs="5418474_1_0209.jpg" n="3"/>devoid of a powerful and just school law which would make attendance an uncompromising necessity. During the election year of 1892, and the dissension of 1890, most of the opponents of the Edwards law declared in emphatic terms, that the attendance clause in itself should and must be retained.</p>
   <p>The German precursor Mr. Raab, that excellent scholar, expressed the same sentiments. That a mere revocation of the Edwards law without a replacement by a better statute is foolish, becomes evident to everyone after a little introspection. This school problem could be satisfactorily settled and would promote peace for many years, if an adequate law were to be drafted; all parties will consider it as a definite and above all, final solution of a question which has rocked our state, just as the Bennett law in Wisconsin needed revision and was superceded.</p>
   <p>If the present Illinois legislature refrains from creating a new act, after eliminating the former, then the school question will flare up again.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0210.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Then also, there is the probability that in the future some other governor and representatives will fashion a law which is not so beneficial to our private and parochial schools as the statute which our present law-makers may pass at this session.</p>
   <p>But the stern admonition of Governor Altgeld will not fail to influence our legislature... and Illinois will have a school law in conformity with the Altgeld spirit.</p>
