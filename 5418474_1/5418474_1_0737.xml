<title level="a">A LOCAL KAFFIR WAR</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>[Translator's note: The title is a reference to the war between England and the Kaffirs, which was going on at the time.]</p>
   <p>It seems that we, too, shall have a Kaffir war in Chicago, a conflict with the nativists and water-wagon lovers. The Zulus consider their domain heaven and regard themselves as citizens of heaven; in this respect our English-speaking "Kaffirs" are on the same level.</p>
   <p>They approach in two columns. One is opposed to German instruction in the public schools; the other attacks Sunday diversions and the sale of intoxicants. A petition to the City Council, which was circulated largely among the prohibition bigots who supplied many signatures, demands a strict enforcement of the Sunday laws, particularly with regard to the closing of theaters and--all in one breath--the suppression of all taverns. How successful this request will be cannot be answered at this time.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0738.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The essential feature is that the "Kaffirs" are again trying to create dissention--attempting in a most malevolent manner to promote quarrels--between the English-speaking citizens and German-Americans. If, as some believe, (though there is no available evidence) this conflict against the Germans was inaugurated by the Democrats, the affair would be understandable, because the Democratic party can never attain leadership except by promoting enimity between Germans and Americans. But if, on the other hand, the "Kaffirs" are mostly Republicans, then it becomes evident, thereby, that they prefer to let the Democrats rule the city rather than divide leadership with the Germans.</p>
   <p>We are convinced that the Germans will act as they have in the past; that a strong and united front will prevail, creating for the Germans respect and recognition. If our adversaries think that this is an opportunity to catch the Germans unaware, then we must prove that we are watchful and prepared to defend our position irrespective of consequences.</p>
   <p>The Germans do not favor an alliance with that class which considers municipal <pb facs="5418474_1_0739.jpg" n="3"/>control a means of feeding "bummers" at public expense; but, as regrettable as it may be, the Teutons will have to yield to such an alliance if the ruling party becomes allied with the "drys" and nativits and opposes the justified German demands. In other words, the Germans seek no conflict--to the contrary; but if necessity makes it expedient, then they will cast their votes (At the impending spring election) where they will do the most good.</p>
   <p>All Republican candidates who consider Republicanism tantamount to an election should consider this. A Republican administration can maintain itself only if the adversaries of German instruction on the School Board are beaten, and if the temperance onslaught on the City Council is repulsed--not otherwise!</p>
