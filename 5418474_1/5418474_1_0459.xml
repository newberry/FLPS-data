   <p>As far as I know, the attacks upon the German instruction in public schools did not include high schools, but for the sake of the truth, I consider it my duty to write this letter in defense of German instruction in public schools. My classroom consists of 50 pupils, 33 of whom have received German instruction at intermediate schools, the rest had no knowledge of German when they entered high school at all. In order to say anything in favor of teaching German, I have to give an illustration of the two groups, and of their respective success.</p>
   <p>The larger group took up work of second year high school immediately and the smaller group commenced with first year work therefore a comparison even for the first year is out of question. Based on my six years experience I must say, that the knowledge imparted to children in intermediate schools, makes itself known even in the higher grades of high school.... The fact remains, that the earlier the instruction of a foreign language commences, the better the pupil will be able to think and express himself, in that language when speaking.... It has also been found, that pupils who study a foreign language, find less difficulty in the study of other subjects.</p>
