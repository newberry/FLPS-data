   <p>Thank heavens! At last we know what is wrong with the American school. It is not the superficial preparation of the teachers, not the superficiality of the instruction given, not the lack of mental training, not the absence of every attempt to train the pupils for independent thinking, not the scattering of the school curriculum over all possible subjects of instruction for which there should be no room in a general public school, not the playful dilettantism of so-called pedagogues, not the looseness of school discipline, nor the unjustified fostering of youthful arrogance and impudence as practiced in the unhealthy hot-house atmosphere of our modern schools, which hampers their effective functioning; no, it is merely the fact that principals and their teachers of both sexes, as well as the boys and girls, wear no uniforms! It certainly sounds unbelievable that someone should have hit upon the idea to stick all our children, together with their teachers, into <pb facs="5418474_1_0077.jpg" n="2"/>uniforms! It is all the more incredible that this "someone" should be a specialist in education, with many years of experience--none other than the Superintendent of the Chicago schools. But so many odd things happen these days that it would occasion, at best, only a mild degree of surprise to the average person if the celebrated man in the moon should, one of these days, let himself down on a rope and ask him [the man in the street] for the address of the nearest bootlegger.</p>
   <p>Why, then, shouldn't somebody make the proposal to put the youth in uniforms? That it is Mr. McAndrew who gives voice to the idea must indeed gravely offend the local patriotism of Chicagoans, for most of them have been regarding the Superintendent as a wise man. But now the archenemy of our school administration, Miss Haley of the Chicago Teachers Federation, is triumphant. Ever since his [Andrew's] return from New York, she has been pinching him with pliers of all sorts and sizes. It seems to her that he prefers the interest of the children to that of the teachers; this attitude of his displeases her. For the aim of her life is the union of women teachers, her purpose is to <pb facs="5418474_1_0078.jpg" n="3"/>make the secretary of the union a sovereign over the domain of the school. In her opinion, which is fortunately not very important, the children exist for the sake of the teachers and not the other way around. But this time she is not entirely wrong when she states that while the teachers are being put into uniforms, one should make a good job of it and simply place numbers on them so as to take away all their individuality. This is a splendid idea and should be submitted to Mr. McAndrew for serious consideration. If, in addition, he would take the trouble to provide books in which are specified all the questions that a teacher may ask her pupils, and the answers she is to expect from them, then he will have created an ideal educational plant--ideal, at least, for the purpose of the American mental level. One should not be satisfied merely with uniforms if one does not wish to be scorned by posterity for doing only half of the job. Along with the uniforms, militarization should be introduced. The Superintendent would take charge as commanding general; his assistants, the district superintendents, would function as brigadier generals; the principals of the schools would be colonels, while the teachers would be staff or subaltern officers.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0079.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The idea is not new; the land from which it stems is Czarist Russia--that is, if we do not care to go as far back as ancient Sparta. In that country [Russia], all high school boys were stuck into uniforms so that they could be more easily kept under observation and supervision. The teachers, too, wore uniforms, obviously for the same purpose, and even the university professors had them. Whether the Soviets have done away with the idea is beside the point. They probably have not; for everything that served the Czar to maintain his power, they [the Soviets] have either retained or aped. So it is likely that even today the students of higher institutions of learning in Russia have their uniforms, perhaps even new ones. But why free Americans--not only boys but even girls--should be forced into a straight-jacket during the period of their development is difficult to understand. The reason for the proposal is presumably the desire to indulge our precious American youth in one of its weak spots, its conceit and pomposity, which is also shared by most American fathers, with their love for the fool's cap and bell, for lodge uniforms and insignia, for the nightshirts of the Ku Klux Klan, and for gold-embroidered liveries, short <pb facs="5418474_1_0080.jpg" n="5"/>breeches, and similar flimflam. The fathers of the idea imagine that the children will learn more when they are put into uniforms, and are allowed proudly to parade in them from time to time through the streets. Pedagogical talent is not evident from this proposal; rather does it reveal the lack of all understanding for the causes making for backwardness in American education. One is naturally aware, in a vague way, that the youth of other countries receive a better education, but it has not been known just why less is learned in this country. Now we know; the reason is that the boys and the girls wear no uniforms!</p>
