   <p>German will be, probably, the language of millions and millions after the war as it was before the war. The thought to ignore the German language from now on may be justified, in regard to the present hostile attitude against the German Expire, but it cannot, however, be given a reasonable and satisfactory guarantee. A better knowledge of the German language probably would have enabled us to have better preparedness for this war. At least, we would have been more similar with the actual feelings and purposes of the ruling classes of Germany in regards to us. We cannot afford to give Germany any advantage, either in our death struggle with it, or in a competitive peaceful transaction. To prohibit the study and use of the German language would be similar to giving us a disadvantageous start in the struggle of competition, (which had to be continued) should the goal consist either of war victory, or the leadership or commercial enterprises. In this progressive are of the world neither the British Empire as a whole, nor any of its dominions can be permitted to be deaf and dumb in the Language of any rivals among the nations.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0354.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>For successful competition with Germany, of the world's commercial enterprises and world's diplomacy, we have to know what official Germany has to say, and what industrial and commercial Germany will head us off in the international war of commerce, which the principal nations have to right, after the great war is over.</p>
   <p>Germany hates everything that is English. However, this hatred did not cause the banishment of the study of English within the German Empire. On the contrary, in the future more Germans will be able to speak English than ever before. In spite of high tariff and strong prejudice, the Germans will incessantly strive to expand their commercial enterprises in English speaking countries and to do this they will have to speak our language fluently. To encounter the German competition in English speaking and other countries, with expectations of success, they must be in a position to rend and refute the clever commercial literature.</p>
   <p>The great scientific discoveries, which revolutionized the social and economic life of the world, and the great inventions which accomplished wonders for the improvement of human life, with the improvement of human life, with the exception of a few, are achievements of men <pb facs="5418474_1_0355.jpg" n="3"/>of other origin than German nationality.</p>
   <p>Germany will be wise enough to continues to read and exploit English books and protocols of English scientific societies.</p>
   <p>We have to retain a knowledge of the German language as a defense policy.</p>
