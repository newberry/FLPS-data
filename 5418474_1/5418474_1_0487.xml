   <p>Mr. Charles S. Thorntion, proposed yesterday to the school board committee for administrative affairs, that an investigation should be made about what real value instruction of the German languages has. It is given in the middle classes of the public schools, with an annual expense of about $125,000, and is under the supervision of the Reverend Gustav A. Zimmermann. By giving a reason for his proposal, which was accepted by the committee, the petitioner could not deny himself the pleasure of landing a sly hint against the Savings Committee, that chiefly consists of Germans. He says" it seems noteworthy that this committee never made any recommendations for savings, in the German Department, and also no reform proposals, although it is a known fact that many of the children who participate in German lessons in the 5th class, quit these later on, probably only because they can make no progress in learning the language under the present system." The Reverand Zimmerman: is expected to be able to refute these open allusions against his expert ability so splendidly, as the members of his parish as well as all others of his numerous admirers expect him to do.</p>
