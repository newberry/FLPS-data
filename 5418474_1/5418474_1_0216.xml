   <p>A number of well-known German-American pedagogues visited yesterday, upon request of the "School Reform Committee" of the North American Turner Fund, the Normal School of Cook County. - Among the visitors were: Messrs. Emil Dapprich, Director of the German-American Teachers Seminary in Milwaukee, John Tonsfeld, director of the well-known institution of the same name in St. Louis, Mrs. Clara Schmidt of Cincinnatti, Mrs.Amalia Ende of the Ende's Girl Institute in Chicago, Messrs. Fritz Paulus, Fritz Karsten and Carl Bruck of Milwaukee and the Turner's William Waterstzaat, Oscar Sputh, Henry Steinbock, Carl Plum and Albert Sauer.</p>
   <p>The Governor of the Institute Col. Parker, received the visitors in a most amiable manner, after which they went to the different schoolrooms, to see with their own eyes the methods of teaching employed. The Gentlemen were very much pleased, with what they saw and heard, and expressed their appreciation about the personnel as well as the Management. Having spent a few hours in a most pleasant way, the visitors took their leave. In the near future, the "Turn societies" will submit resolutions to the effect, that the German-American Turners are greatly interested not only in this Institution but also in the prosperity of school affairs in general.</p>
