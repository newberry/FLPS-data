   <p>A meeting of the Board of Education was held last night. A large delegation of German-American citizens, headed by Congressman-elect Goldzier, occupied one end. President McLaren announced that the question was whether or not the study of German shall be dropped at the end of the present year.</p>
   <p>Mr. Halle presented Congressman-elect Goldzier, chairman of a committee representing the recent meeting of representatives of German-American societies. With but a few words of introduction Mr. Goldzier read a memorial which had among others the following pleas for retaining German in the public schools:</p>
   <p>"The German-American citizens of Chicago, numbering over one-third of the population of this city, have learned with regret that a proposition is pending before your honorable body having for its object the abolition of the so-called special studies, namely - the study of the German language, physical culture, music, drawing and modeling, in our public schools. The proposition, in our humble opinion, is dangerous in the extreme, and inimical to the best interests of our public school system.</p>
   <p>"We think that the time when a knowledge of the renowned three "R's" was considered a sufficient education has passed, and we believe that the <pb facs="5418474_1_0206.jpg" n="2"/>children of this generation are entitled in the schools of the people to all such instruction necessary for their future careers, and to all such instruction as tends to make better men of them.</p>
   <p>"We think that instruction in our public schools should be so ample as to dispense absolutely with the necessity of private schools. Economy which curtails the amount of instruction to which our children are entitled seems to us to be of the wrong kind, and we suggest that a prosperous city like ours should not be deterred by monetary consideration from giving to our youth its due in the matter of a proper education."</p>
   <p>The delegation of German-American citizens present applauded Mr. Goldzier heartily. For three hours the members of the Board of Education wrestled vainly with the problem. At the end of that time they sent the whole subject of fads back to the committee on School Management, from whence it had come.</p>
