   <p>The tail attempts to wag the dog! The entire teaching staff of the Public Schools of Chicago is making a vigorous attempt to run the schools after its own fashion, and in the manner which best suits the underlying purpose, contrary to the plan of instruction devised by the Board of Education and the School Board. This may, however, not signify their attitude toward other studies included in the teaching plan, but it has been proven in the case of one of the important educational subjects; namely, the study of the German language. According to the advice from the Board of Education, a list of queries should have been issued to every pupil of Elementary Schools pertaining to the instruction of German in Public Schools. However, authentic information has reached us according to which this request has been disregarded in a number of schools up to Tuesday September 19. The Board of Education has issued an advice to principals and teachers to refrain from an attempt <pb facs="5418474_1_0382.jpg" n="2"/>of influencing either in favor of the German instruction, or otherwise. Although this is one of the general rules, Mrs. Young, the Superintendent of Schools, has put a special emphasis upon it last year, repeating the warning this year too. But it is still not done. Moreover, the fact has been revealed that principals, co-operating with the teachers, are discouraging the study of German by means of threats of demoting those students to a lower grade who express the wish to study German. What does this mean? What is it all about? Our willingness to become reconciled to the lamentable few exceptions is out of question, because offenses committed are much too numerous to be overlooked. Here is an illustration of their audacity. In three schools located in districts largely populated by the German element, teachers have resorted to methods of intimidation, regardless of the population constituting the district. Is it not then that exceptions have become the rule? Teachers in corpore, are opposed to German instruction, and are agitating against it, contrary to the advice of the Board of Education, availing themselves of the method of persuasion, intimidation, and various other infamous means, in expectation of the final achievement of their aim. Theirs' is a shameless conduct since they are disregarding the decision of the Board of Education.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0383.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is almost incomprehensible that this condition actually exists. Is the Board of Education honestly attempting to enforce the subordination of teachers in the matter of the German language? This question is undoubtedly in the mind of many persons. If the Board of Education would not be willing to sanction this misdemeanor, ways would be found, in the opinion of those who doubt the endeavor, to discipline the offenders and restore normal conditions by ending the disgraceful agitation. Righteously, however, none is justified to draw this conclusion, at least, not yet. The problems of the Board of Education are manifold, especially during the first weeks of a new school year. The numerous schools and large army of teachers require frequent watching, and time may not have permitted to find out. Consequently, correct the mistake. While it is the duty of the authorities to discipline teachers who agitate against the instruction of the German language, it is just as much the duty of the individual to report every case of insubordination to the proper authorities. Thus, we can assist in the maintenance and enforcement of strict rules....The tail attempts to wag the dog! As numorous as this is, <pb facs="5418474_1_0384.jpg" n="4"/>it is too serious to evoke laughter. If the attempt of hostilities against the German language does not come to an end, it will most likely develop into a successful movement by restricting the attendance of German classes. This would not in any way add to the glory of Chicago's citizens, especially the German element. Moreover, reflection would be cast upon the Board of Education, and Chicago would most assuredly become an object of ridicule. This pernicious activity of the teachers against the German language must be stopped. The public is requested, therefore, to report every offense against the rules to the Board of Education, either to Mr. Huttman, a member of the School Board, or to the Abendpost.</p>
   <p>The teacher's hostile activity must be interpreted as crediting the Germans with an excess of good nature, or on the other hand, consider them as sleepy heads, whose patience is not easily exhausted. Then again, they feel justified to a certain extent to oppose the German language in schools on the ground that with regard to their numerical strength the Germans demand special political privileges, and want the golden goose for themselves, by insisting upon the continuance of <pb facs="5418474_1_0385.jpg" n="5"/>improvement in the study of German in Public Schools. If this assumption would be based upon the truth, the anti-German attitude would be explainable. But there is not a particle of truth in this belief, rather, the German instruction is persistently advocated because of its educational merits, and because the knowledge of German offers greater opportunities to every individual. We consider it, therefore, our sacred duty to acquaint the general public with these facts. And because it is basically untrue, Germanism in Chicago would be regarded as weak and meaningless if this newspaper would not give its utmost support in the battle, which is now forced upon us. And we will fight, unconditionally, to the end.</p>
   <p>Attacking is not a specially cultivated virtue of the Germans, but they are persistent in counter attacks. The more numerous the enemy, the higher their fighting spirit: Now, more than ever.</p>
   <p>In case of discovery that the tail receives secret support, our motto must be: "Forward, in spite of them!"</p>
