   <p>The enemies of German teaching succeeded in yesterday's meeting of the School Board to win a victory after a hard fight. At the expiration of this school-year there will be no more teaching of German in the primary grades. This resolution was accepted at last night's meeting by a vote of eleven against seven. The only possibility to frustrate the execution of this decision now lies in the hands of Mayor Harrison who has to appoint seven more board members this year. If these members support the German teaching, there is still hope that the subject could be retained in the primary grades. Yesterday's meeting of the School Board was a very stormy one and rich in lively debates. Step by step, the enemies of the German teaching and the other special instructions had to win their victory and only the energetic resistance of Messrs. Halle, Trude, Bluthardt, Boldemweck, Cusack, Duggan, and Keane can be thanked that <pb facs="5418474_1_0527.jpg" n="2"/>the German teaching has not been altogether abolished. All board members were present with the exception of Messrs. Brieman, Goetz, and Rosenthal. When the question of teaching German was raised, two reports were submitted by the Committee on School Management, a majority and a minority report. The first one, signed by Halle, Duggan, Trude, Cusack, and Miss Burt, recommends the retaining of the German language in all grades, while the minority report by Wm. H. Beebe asks for the elimination of German instruction in the primary grades. Immediately after the latter report was read, Mr. Halle asked for the floor, and strongly championed the cause of German teaching. He pointed to a petition signed by 36,000 citizens and taxpayers, all of whom desire the retention of German, and he called special attention to the advantages which a knowledge of the German language offers. "Who was it who wanted the abolition of the German language? The majority of the taxpayers certainly do not. The demand comes from only a few newspapers and individuals who have no understanding of the value of the German language."</p>
   <p>At the close of his speech, Mr. Halle proposed a resolution which recommended <pb facs="5418474_1_0528.jpg" n="3"/>that the question be referred back to the School Board with the request that a report be submitted at its next meeting, in the hope that efforts will be made to submit a plan that might be approved by the School Board. This resolution provoked a lively debate. Dr. Blutharde refuted the assertion of the Beebe report that the reasons which necessitated the introduction of German teaching thirty years ago do not exist any more. Mr. Boldemweck called the School Board's attention to the fact that in case the object was to save money, the Board should begin with the high schools, which are mostly attended by children of rich parents. Mr. Trude, who as an American also interceded in behalf of the German language, declared that German language instruction could not be considered as one of the "fads," against which war was declared. But all efforts on the part of the friends of German were of no avail. When it came to a vote, the report of Beebe was accepted by a majority of eleven to seven.</p>
   <p>The following voted to abolish the German language instruction in the primary grades, i.e., in favor of Beebe's report: D. R. Cameron, Mrs. J. M. Flower, W. D. Preston, J. J. Badenock, A. H. Revell, W. H. Beebe, C. V. Stanford, <pb facs="5418474_1_0529.jpg" n="4"/>G. L. Warner, S. T. Gunderson, J. P. Mallette, J. McLaren. The following who opposed: W. Boldemweck, F. G. Halle, M. J. Keane, P. H. Duggan, T. J. Bluthardt, T. Cusack, A. S. Trude.</p>
