   <p>The revived prohibition campaign of several weeks ago to make Chicago a dry city after the spring election, will apparently be doomed to the same fate as all the campaigns of like character before it. In order to voice the request to proclaim Chicago dry, the petition must bear 73,000 signatures. Notwithstanding the Prohibitionists' eagerness, only 10,000 have signed the petition up to now. As the Board of Election Commissioners requested to have the petition delivered not later than February 4, it is no small task to get the petition completed. Much light was thrown upon the capability and strength of the Anti-Saloon League and other fanatical dry agitators at a meeting last night at Willard Hall. It was decided to eliminate the repetition of signatures in those localities where the agents of the League resided, and the following plan was consummated. The problem which confronted the Prohibitionists was the repetition above alluded to, falsifications, mistakes and similar difficulties, in districts canvassed by agents.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0950.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This was to be changed and more attention to be given to the heavily populated sections and business centers. They conceived this idea in the hope to obtain all the necessary signatures during the period of six days. Thus the League places itself in a position similar to that of two years ago, when at the request of the United Societies for Local Self-government, the Board of Election Commissioners rejected the petition on the grounds of innumerable falsifications of names and other irregularities. Mr. Shields, the superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League, well aware of the weakness of his followers, had to resort to make-believe tactics. Thus, he related that the election of the League's Speaker, Mr. Atkins, has brought about the firm establishment of the Drys in the Legislature, and that the Anti-Saloon League would elect its executive members; also that all requests, as well as all demands of the liberal elements which are opposed to local option, should be submitted to the above board for adjudication.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0951.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Shields forgot to mention, of course, that the liberals will appoint a committee, which will receive all the subject matter of the anti-saloon advocates.</p>
   <p>The greatly agitated convention of the Prohibitionists came to a close yesterday.</p>
   <p>Surprising results have been obtained at the final session; namely, the convention condemned the National Committee of the party and requested its members to resign. Loud praise was paid to Mr. W. P. F. Ferguson, publisher of the National Prohibitionist, who bitterly attacked the party's management in the State of Illinois. Orders were also given that the party shall not indorse any candidate of another party during the coming election.</p>
