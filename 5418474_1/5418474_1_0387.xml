   <p>What is the fate of the German language in the public schools of Chicago? Is there a chance for its continuance and improved teaching management, or will it be further curtailed and finally doomed to dismissal altogether from the curriculum of public schools? The German people of Chicago must decide that question for themselves. Inasmuch as it is only their concern, the answer will depend entirely upon their interest (or lack of it) in the subject in question.</p>
   <p>The responsibility is therefore theirs. If the study of the German language regains its former place in the plan of studies, thus giving our youth the opportunity to learn the most important foreign language, there is no doubt that they will cover themselves with glory. On the other hand, if they prove negligent in the fulfillment of their duty to their own children and the youth of Chicago in general (and thus to the city and the nation), they will justifiably accused of utter <pb facs="5418474_1_0388.jpg" n="2"/>lack of interest, of not availing themselves of the opportunity that now knocks at their poor.</p>
   <p>If the instruction of German is excluded from the program of the public school studies, it will deal a terrible blow to the educational system of Chicago. When they present their demands, the German people must not convey the idea that they are asking for the granting of a special privilege, Nor must they in any way emphasize their German ancestry. However, as citizens and parents knowing the value of the German language educationally and culturally, they must insist upon their demands. Thus, not only children of German parentage will be given the opportunity of learning that important foreign language, but also the youth of Chicago in general, However, no other group was over better equipped to present its demands than the Germans are in this instance. Of course, they, above all other groups, native-or foreign, are expected to realize the value of their language, As a consequence, disinterestedness on their part would naturally indicate indifference to the inclusion of the study of German in the curriculum of the public schools of Chicago, and would give, they felt the impression that it was aimless as well as useless.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0389.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>It is the sacred duty of every German to prevent that deplorable occurrence. It must be prevented. That it can be done, there is no doubt. Moreover, the study of that language must be considerably improved in public schools. What we must do is to give expression to our wishes and demands, now that the opportunity has presented itself.</p>
   <p>Through the decision of the School Board, every student of the public schools, attending either the fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth grade, must obtain from his or her school principal a list of queries in regard to the instruction of German for submission to their respective parents. To the question, "Shall your child partake in the German instruction?" a unanimous "Yes" should be the reply, even in those instances where the parents have ceased to cultivate that language themselves.....</p>
   <p>Furthermore, the German population of our city must not think that it did its duty to the fullest extent by just inserting the word "Yes" into the space provided for it. It must do more! It must win over fellow-citizens of other nationalities to their point of view. It is <pb facs="5418474_1_0390.jpg" n="4"/>quite plausible that the knowledge of German would be equally as advantageous to their children, is to the children of German descent. It must be also borne in mind that the study of that language would have a beneficial effect upon the study of the English language and upon the educational system in general.</p>
   <p>Teachers, on the contrary, do not share this opinion. In fact, they with only a few honorable exceptions worked together last year, to discourage children from taking that study, because, they argued, the students could not advance in other subjects with the rest of the class, which would ultimately lead to their demotion to a lower grade. They have even won over parents of many prospective aspirants to their point of view. The same low tactics against German instruction are still being employed by these educators. However, we are confident that their efforts will not be crowned by success, as they were last year. moreover, teachers will have to take came to avoid a conflict with the School Board, or with the Superintendent of Schools, arising from <pb facs="5418474_1_0391.jpg" n="5"/>a misdemeanor of that type. Their arguments against the instruction of German are not based upon the truth, and therefore, cannot endure. Their opposition to this subject is a matter of convenience as well as ignorance. Mrs. Young, the Superintendent of Schools, as well as some of her highly principled assistants and the School Board, are well-informed of this disgraceful fight against education and they do not approve. Furthermore, the administrative Body of Chicago's Schools is prepared to deal with any teacher found guilty of the offence of agitation against the instruction of German. This censure would be justified (if for no other reason) on the basis that such agitation violates existing regulations.</p>
   <p>After all, neither the principals nor the teachers are executive members of the School Board; therefore, theirs is not the power to make decisions. No ill can come from that source while their threats are not being taken seriously. But the aspect would change considerably if German parents would become intimidate, and would yield to the persuasion of the teachers, whose primary concern is their own comfort.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0392.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>In that instance, the German language as a subject in public schools, would become a sad memory only. The rightful description of the Germans as a fearless and faithful people, would go into oblivion also. If this should be the result of their disinterestedness a "finis" would be affixed to Germanism of our city by its own people. This must not and will not happen. Every parent of German descent must declare himself decidedly in favor of German instruction. Intimidations of whatsoever nature they may be, should be brought to the attention of either the Abendpost, or of a German-speaking member of the School Board. Discretion will be used as to the identity of the complainant. Only thus can we reach the guilty parties.</p>
   <p>Co-operation is therefore of utmost importance.</p>
