   <p>How in yesterday's negotiation of the Board of Education it was visible, that shortly before midnight a proposal was made by Mr. Covert to abolish German instruction entirely from the list of the instruction shelf. The application for reappolntment of Miss Regina Schaner gave the cause to this. This from a few otherwise in favor of German instruction was not approved because they think that under present conditions until better times arrive, this appointment would be unnecessary. Covert's proposal was successful, after Miss Schaner received the plurality of the votes of those present, but not received the absolute majority (due to this late hour six members had left for home), but was called out of order for the time being.</p>
   <p>Next Wednesday it probably will come to a vote again. The motion came right after a protest was received from the German-American Republican Society.</p>
