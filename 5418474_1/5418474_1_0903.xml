   <p>The controversy about the liquor bill which is pending in the Illinois State Legislature has entered a new phase. The Chicago City Council has taken a hand in the controversy in a manner that will show results. As is known, the old opposition between city and county, between Chicago and its metropolitan population on the one hand, and the rural and small town communities on the other, is the underlying cause of the fight. Governor Horner and those members of the Legislature who represent rural districts favor a law which provides for control of liquor traffic by a state commission. Mayor Kelly wants home rule on the matter for Chicago, and the Cook County Democratic members of the Legislature share his opinion.</p>
   <p>The Republicans in the Legislature have utilized this controversy to weaken the position of Chicago and to widen the control of the rural communities over <pb facs="5418474_1_0904.jpg" n="2"/>the city. They have appealed to President Roosevelt, asking him to take a hand in the controversy to prevent the return of the saloon, in line with the platform adopted at the Democratic National Convention. This appeal completely ignores the fact that the platform refers only to dives and haunts of criminals, and that it expressly advocates home rule.</p>
   <p>In the meantime, Governor Horner and Mayor Kelly have reached a compromise according to which two commissions are to be appointed, one for Cook County and one for the rest of the state. The president of the County Commission is also to serve as president of the State Commission. It is still somewhat early to examine this compromise very closely; but in any event, it can be readily substantiated that is one of the most brilliant achievements of advanced controversial bar issue. He has agreed, in the interest of moderation and good morals, to let his greatly plagued contemporaries henceforth sit down and pour whisky into their systems.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0905.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Now the City Council has also entered into the fray and to a man has taken sides with Mayor Kelly. The city Fathers emphasize that, above all else, the right of home rule is at issue. This point is of utmost importance. In order to avoid any false conceptions, we stress the fact that Chicago demands nothing but the right to regulate the liquor traffic that is carried on within her borders. Chicago does not care what the authorities in the rest of the state decide to do in regard to the matter; Chicago has no desire to force its will upon them, nor does it wish to be tyrannized by them. In order to ascertain the attitude of the citizens on the question, the City Council has tentatively decided to have a referendum vote taken at the primaries in April. This resolution deserves commendation.</p>
   <p>In reality, a referendum should not be necessary. However, the saloon question is being kept alive by the determined dries. They are receiving reinforcements from the ranks of the Republicans, who are trying to make political capital out of the controversy. And, finally, we have the demagogues as third member of the trio. Thus the issue which really should have been settled long ago <pb facs="5418474_1_0906.jpg" n="4"/>has been turned into a bitter controversy. That is why a referendum is in order.</p>
