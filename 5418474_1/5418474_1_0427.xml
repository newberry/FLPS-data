   <p>The School-board Committee faced a difficult problem when its appropriation was exhausted and a simple expedient was, to eliminate all of the less important branches of the curiculum... The German language was included in this classification and instruction therein was to be dispensed with for one and a half months... in order to save expenses for salaries. Ways and means were eventually found, to solve the financial stringency... "The German Alliance," an Association of German clubs, whose convocation at the auditorium made such a profound impression throughout the land and even Europe, when it voiced its objection to the Government's friendly attitude towards England, did not consider it appropriate to interfere with the schoolboard's procedure in regard to the German tuition problem... But a recently founded club, whose originator has little influence in German circles- expressed itself in a threatening manner;- its resolution was coached in such audacious and improper terms, that the school-board did not even consider it and merely placed it into the files.</p>
