   <p>A meeting was held last Sunday in the hall of the Catholic St. Paul's Church. It was well attended by members of the church. They had come together to discuss the erection of a new schoolhouse. Rev. G. D. Heldmann explained to the audience the details connected with the building of a new school. At the present 550 children belong to the church-school. It is filled up and no room for any increase. Sketches for the new building had been drawn by the architects, H. Schlacks and H. Ottenheimer; and these were presented to the assembly. Then these plans for the new building were discussed and unanimously approved. It was decided to start as soon as possible with the construction of this new building so that it could be finished before winter.</p>
