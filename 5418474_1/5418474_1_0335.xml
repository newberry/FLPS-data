   <p>An example of these little but extremely mean lies, which are usually smuggled into publications by irresponsible assistants, reporters, etc., may be found in the April 22 issue of the Chicago Daily News. It is contained in a special dispatch from Springfield entitled "Senate Bars German from Schools in Illinois". The article states that "according to the provisions of a bill which was passed by the Senate today, it is forbidden to teach the German language as the basic language in public, private, and parochial schools. The bill makes English the basic language in all schools. It is not forbidden to teach Latin, Greek, or other languages".</p>
   <p>The bill does not forbid instruction in the German language. It does not even mention the German language; and it is not directed against the German <pb facs="5418474_1_0336.jpg" n="2"/>language; and it is not directed against the German language any more than it is against any other language. It merely provides that English is to be considered the basic language, and is to be taught above all other languages; it must be used as the medium of instruction.</p>
   <p>It is open to question whether or not this is just and prudent, insofar as private and parochial schools are concerned. But to say that the bill is a measure directed especially or only against the German language is a deception and a lie. And that was actually stated by the contents and the caption of the report. And thus the action of the Senate was construed as an intended insult to the German-speaking and German-born element of our population. And so the attempt was made to fan the flames of an already strong racial hatred and to maintain and increase the existing dissension.</p>
   <p>A lie is a lie. An openly invented lie is comparatively harmless, because it is easily recognized. But a lie which is covered with a varnish of truth is not easily detected, and passes as the truth which serves as its cover. It <pb facs="5418474_1_0337.jpg" n="3"/>is cowardly, mean, unpatriotic, vulgar; and it is frequently found in the American press. It is the chief source of the dissatisfaction which is prevalent among our people.</p>
