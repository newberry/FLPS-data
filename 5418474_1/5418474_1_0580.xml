   <p>In the Northside Turnhalle, a meeting was held last night, which was not attended by very many, but those present, showed a spirited interest. The object of the meeting was, to find means, to fight against the intention of abolishing the teaching of the German language and also all special subjects in the lower grades of our schools. The following societies and lodges were represented by their membership: Veterans of the German Army (80), Turnverein Fortschritt (180), Rheinlander Bund (96), Turnverein Garfield (200), Harugari (3200),Rothmanner (1600), Germania Mannerchor (750), Auserwaehlte Freunde (34 Lodges), Mutual Benevolent Society (220), Turnverein Lincoln (190), Bowling Club Humor(20), German Society, German Press Club, Plattdeutscher Verein, (175), Chicago Turnerclub (800), Germania Turnverein (150), Social Turnverein (270), Turnverein Washington (90), Aurora Turnverein (470), German Warcomrades (135).</p>
   <p>Turner Max Stern presided. He submitted a resolution, which was drawn up by former Alderman and present Congressman, Mr. Julius Goldzier, and was accepted in an amended form. These resolutions will be handed by a committee of 25, appointed, yesterday evening, to the Schoolboard, which meets tomorrow. The text of the decisions shall not be made public, before the Schoolboard takes notice of same. Considering, that the decision may be made by tomorrow, quick action is demanded.</p>
