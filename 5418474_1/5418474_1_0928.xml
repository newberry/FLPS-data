   <p>The Anti-Saloon League of Illinois needs money which it is now seeking. They are sending printed letters to all and sundry, who the leaders of the League believe might possibly sacrifice twenty-five or fifty or a hundred dollars for the "good cause" or the good will of the League. The letter runs as follows:</p>
   <p>"Of the three steps which lead to ratification of the National Prohibition amendment, the League has taken the first two--the primaries and the general election. We are now confronted with the fight in the legislatures. We are, so to speak, in the position of the Allies--ready for the final cleanup. The campaign, although victorious, has been hard and expensive, since the brewers have fought every inch of the way.</p>
   <p>"At least one legislator was offered five thousand dollars for his vote to <pb facs="5418474_1_0929.jpg" n="2"/>submit the amendment to the voters for approval; the purpose, of course, was to kill ratification by delay. Their main weapon will be bribery--this must be investigated thoroughly and combated effectively. we have to hold the line, and must stop this alien, corrupt, and brutal brewing interest from cheating Illinois out of her rightful place in the order of ratification.</p>
   <p>"Ratification is in sight and the breweries are fighting with their backs against the wall; the time has come to bring this fight to an end by any honorable means and with all the strength at our command. In this critical moment we are turning for help to you as one of Chicago's public-spirited citizens. The cause needs your assistance right now.</p>
   <p>"Won't you sign one of the enclosed cards? Fix the day to make your payment to suit yourself. Hoping you will sign the largest card, we remain.</p>
   <p>Sincerely yours,</p>
   <p>(signed) E. J. Davis, Superintendent Chicago District."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0930.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>On the "largest card" the subscriber promises to contribute one hundred dollars, on the day he himself specifies, to the Special Campaign Fund of the Anti-Saloon League of Illinois. The second card calls for fifty dollars and is white, like the first one; the third card calls for a payment of twenty-five dollars, and is yellow, apparently expressing the low esteem of the League for such a stingy contributor.</p>
   <p>The above-quoted letter is interesting. Certain brewers were subjected to a painful investigation by a committee of the United States Senate because they dared to acquire a few newspapers in a perfectly honorable and legal manner, and let them be managed by men who were against the suppression of the brewers' trade. All brewers were suspected and slandered because they used every possible legal means in an effort to combat the deliberate destruction of their business and property; but nothing illegal could be proved against them except the fact that they defended themselves as best they could against this injustice, and that they attempted to prevent the unconstitutional confiscation of their property.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0931.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The public learned, thanks to the many "investigations" and publications, what the brewers spent their money on and what means they employed in their struggle. But the public has not yet learned what the Anti-Saloon League does with the great amounts which have been put at its disposal and which it has collected and spent. Nor do we know exactly what means it used to assure majorities in Congress and in the primaries and final elections. The general public has no idea why the League's campaign is so expensive or why it needs the money which it claims it must have and which it tries to obtain by circularizing an appeal to "public-spirited" citizens.</p>
   <p>It is difficult to see why the League should still need so much money, for the only thing left is the vote in the Assembly. In the Assembly the majority decides, and the League claims to have won a majority in the election. But it seems that the League does not feel too sure of that majority. Or maybe it does not quite trust the legislators from whom it obtained a Prohibition pledge. It fears bribery, and it complains, at least in the case of one member (of the legislature), of an attempt at bribery, which "is the principal weapon of the alien, corrupt, and brutal brewing interests".</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0932.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Since the brewers, in spite of the many recent public and secret investigations have not been found guilty of any bribery, and since, on the other hand, it has not been made clear for what purposes the League has spent the sums put at its disposal, nor by what means it gained the victory, it can be said that the League is acting very suspiciously in accusing its opponents of bribery. "I judge others by myself," says the proverb, and it is an old trick of crooks to holler "Catch the thief," in order to divert attention.</p>
   <p>The badly discredited brewing interests should learn the lesson the League has taught them. They should investigate the League thoroughly and fight any attempts at bribery. Above all, they should immediately request, and if necessary, compel, Mr. E. J. Davis to name the legislator who allegedly was offered five thousand dollars to vote in favor of the proposal that the voting public be allowed to decide the question of ratification of the Prohibition amendment. That would probably show which of the two sides had attempted bribery, and would also reveal many other things.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0933.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>From a thorough investigation we would probably learn why the League is so greatly opposed to a public vote on the Prohibition amendment and why such a short delay would "kill ratification". Do the Prohibitionists fear the vote of the returning soldiers, or is it because they are not altogether convinced of a popular Prohibitionist majority in Illinois? At any rate, their anxiety about a delay reveals quite a lack of confidence in their cause and shows their determination to force Prohibition on the people of Illinois whether they want it or not.</p>
   <p>And all this is going on at a time when America is championing the right to self-determination of all nations, great or small, and fighting for the democratic ideal. We should not let this [i.e., the undemocratic imposition of Prohibition upon the people] happen, at least not without making a determined stand. The strategy for the fight is easy: Investigation! And the first thing to investigate is the Prohibitionists' demand for money to combat bribery.</p>
