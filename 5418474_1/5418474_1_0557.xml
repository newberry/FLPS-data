   <p>The value of learning the German language in the public schools is recognized by nearly all the nationalities, which are represented in the city. Of the 34,521 pupils enrolled in the German classes in January, only 14,460 were of German descent; 11,295 were Anglo-Americans, and 8,766 belonged to different other nationalities, such as the Irish, Bohemians, Scandinavians, etc. There were 30,462 pupils participating in German instruction during the previous year, and 624 only from all grades, discontinued their study.</p>
   <p>German instruction in the higher primary grades meets with the approval of those parents who are not able financially to permit their children to attend school for more than four or six years. If German were restricted to grammar grades only, a large decrease in the number of pupils would be noticable...</p>
   <p>The Germans have at present one important problem to solve, namely to protect and to retain their position of power in public life, and to defend it against the malicious spirit of the "alien-haters," and the fanatical nativists. Compromise with them is impossible.</p>
