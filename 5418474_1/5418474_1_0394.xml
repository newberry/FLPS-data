   <p>There will be better chances of instructions in "German Language" in public schools during this season. The Schools will open next Tuesday. We again call attention to the fact that the school board has taken steps to assure better chances for the study of German, than before.</p>
   <p>The principals of all elementary schools have been instructed to find out the number of children in the four upper grades, who wish to participate, and the questionaires have been sent to their parents. It is pointed out in particular that the study of German will be a regular subject for all those children preferring it, instead of "natural history" and "art" for which there is a total of 150 munites per week provided. The teachers have been informed that instruction in the German language shall serve the purpose to use it in teaching. Therefore something worthwhile should come out of it. Only 50 applications are necessary, instead of 75 as before in order to maintain and renew the course in the German language in any of the public schools. It seems certain that this should be comparatively easy to attain.</p>
