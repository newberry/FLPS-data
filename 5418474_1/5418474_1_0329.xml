   <p>Everyone knows that when the hatred toward everything German reaches its climax during the War, and a large part of the public considered it superpatriotic to make strong attacks upon all institutions established or advocated by Americans of German extraction, the School Board abolished teaching of German in the elementary public schools. The "language of the Kaiser" was taboo. At that time it was thought that the French and Spanish languages should be taught in the upper grades. The matter was dropped however, because no children wanted to take these courses, and thus there is now no opportunity whatever to learn a foreign language in our elementary schools.</p>
   <p>The case with reference to high schools is different. That part of the course having to do with instruction in foreign languages was not altered, and German, Spanish, French, or any other foreign language, may still be taught. However, <pb facs="5418474_1_0330.jpg" n="2"/>on account of the public attitude the instruction in German was reduced to such an extent that German classes may be found in but few high schools today. Of course the matter could be remedied very easily. If only a few parents request that their children be instructed in German, that request will be heeded. But heretofore no such desire has been voiced, either because parents are indifferent, or because they are not familiar with the situation. Attempts which are made may meet with opposition on the part of this or that principal, but it should not be difficult to overcome such resistance.</p>
   <p>Mr. E. G. Willner, a prominent businessman living at 2352 Grand Avenue, had to cope with objections raised by Mr. Franklin Fisk, principal of Tuley High School, 1313 North Claremont Avenue. Mr. Willner wants his daughter, who attends Tuley High School, to learn German. But at the school she was given to understand that if she wishes to learn a foreign language it would have to be the French language. Mr. Willner then paid Mr. Fisk a visit and was <pb facs="5418474_1_0331.jpg" n="3"/>informed that his daughter would have to enroll in another high school if she persisted in her demand.</p>
   <p>"Our arrangements," said Mr. Fisk, "cannot be altered now."</p>
   <p>Under these circumstances Mr. Willner thought it best to apply directly to the School Board, to which he addressed the following letter:</p>
   <p>"To the School Board of the city of Chicago:</p>
   <p>"Esteemed Ladies and Gentlemen: Permit me to make a few remarks concerning your resolution to abolish instruction in the German Language in public schools.</p>
   <p>"At the time of the Franco-Prussian War I learned French. If anybody had made a proposal to do away with French instruction in the schools of Germany <pb facs="5418474_1_0332.jpg" n="4"/>he would have been told that he belonged in an institution for the feebleminded.</p>
   <p>"A knowledge of the German language is very advantageous, especially in a large city like Chicago, but a knowledge of French, which you are having taught in our high schools, has little or no practical value anywhere in the United States.</p>
   <p>"Very respectfully,</p>
   <p>"G. J. Willner."</p>
   <p>The answer was not long in forthcoming. It is as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0333.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"Mr. G. J. Willner,</p>
   <p>"2352 Grand Avenue,</p>
   <p>"Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>"Dear Sir: Instruction in the German language has not been abolished in our public high schools, but it has been discontinued in elementary schools. The German language will be taught in any high school in which a sufficient number of students enrolls for the course to form a class. That means, in general, fifteen to twenty, since a smaller class would not be worthwhile. The School Board has passed no resolution which bans instruction in the German language in high schools.</p>
   <p>"E. C. Armstrong,</p>
   <p>"Assistant Superintendent."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0334.jpg" n="6"/>
   <p>Mr. Willner took this letter to Mr. Fisk and reiterated his request. Whether it will be granted depends on the possibility of obtaining fifteen to twenty children who want to learn German. That should not be difficult, since there are thousands of Americans of German descent in every school district in the city of Chicago.</p>
