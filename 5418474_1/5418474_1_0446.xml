   <p>p. 5 - Mr. Walleck, a member of the school board committee, made repeated attempts yesterday, when the school board met in conference to submit his proposed resolution for acceptance. Mr. Walleck's contention is that in schools which are attended by pupils, at least 50 percent of whom are descendants of one nationality, it would be necessary to teach the native language of their parents also.</p>
   <p>This resolution was rejected by a large majority. Mr. Dawes, also a member of the school board, thought this an excellent opportunity to denounce German instruction in schools. He declared that it had been an error to introduce the German language in the schools, but that it would be a wise decision to eliminate it from the school plan at the earliest possible moment.</p>
   <p>Dr. Stolz spoke in defense of German instruction. He stressed the pedagogic value of teaching German, whereupon Mr. Walleck assured Dr. Stolz that the resolution was not directed against German instruction. Of course, Mr. Dawes then felt so cheap, and, knowing that he had made a fool of himself, was not heard from during the rest of the evening.</p>
