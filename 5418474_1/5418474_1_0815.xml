   <p>The Chicago Times in its yesterday's edition made once more a violent attack against the teaching of the German language in the public schools. This is nothing new. This paper which in each of its editions is the organ of the worst criminal element, which sings moral songs as "Mephistopheles" in order to better deceive its readers; which published all the addresses of gambling and prostitution houses; this hatred is like the one which makes an uneducated man hate that which he does not know. On the entire editorial staff of the Times there is not one who understands as much German as a fourteen year old German college boy understands of English.</p>
   <p>The Times declares that it is not proper to teach a foreign language in a school supported by an American State. The answer to that is; that the German language is no foreign language but is one of the authorized languages of the country. And the American State consists of citizens speaking different languages of which the German language is one of the most important. They are entitled to their German language as much as a Frenchman living in Metz is to the French language, or rather more so, as they have not become members of the American State through force. Furthermore Germans do not want their children <pb facs="5418474_1_0816.jpg" n="2"/>to learn only German. On the contrary they insist that they should know English as well as do children of English parents. We refuse to answer all the insults of the Times. In conclusion we merely wish to state that Germans coming to this country forswear their German allegiance but not their German nationality, customs or language.</p>
