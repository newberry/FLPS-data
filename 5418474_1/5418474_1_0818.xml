  <body>
   <p>Instruction in German is now given in all the schools which were not burned and where German instruction was given before the fire. No fewer than 2,359 pupils in 8 schools are receiving German instruction. These schools are: Washington School 182; Carpentar 328; Wells 298; Moseley 282; Cottage Grove 187; Haven 35-; Lincoln 380; Newberry 352. Of these 2,359 children, 1,070 are boys and 1,289 are girls. In the Ogden, Kinzie, Franklin and La Salle Schools, which are now under construction, German instruction will be taken up again.</p>
   <p>As a matter of trial, when German instruction was introduced in the Washington School one hundred and sixty five students registered for German instruction in 1865. At the end of the school year in 1870, Two thousand, five hundred and ninety seven children took part in German instruction; by the end of the school year in 1871 their number had reached four thousand, five hundred thirty three.</p>
   <p>To justify the German instruction, Mr. Harris, Superintendent of the School System in St. Louis says:-</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0819.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Even on account of national reasons, German should be taught compulsorily in the public schools. Assimilation of all nationalities to form an American nation is the aim to be reached. Should the Germans be excluded from the public schools, they would be obliged to open their own schools and this would retard the process of amalgamation."</p>
