   <p>German Societies agree to it.-</p>
   <p>In Uhlich's Hall, there was again held under the presidency of delegate Danziger, of the "Turner Society Vorwarts", a meeting of Delegates of a number of German Societies, who decided to work for the principle of introduction of a system to supply free schoolbooks to all the pupils of the Public Schools. A resolution was adopted, the principal contents of which are, that it was the duty of the State to take the thorn out of the present custom of supplying schoolbooks free only to children of poor parents; that furthermore all passages in the text-books should be eliminated, which under cover of Physiology abet the views of the Prohibitionists, that in conformity with the constitutional separation of the State and Church, ther should be no reading matter of a religious content on the textbooks; that the production of schoolbooks, should under no circumstanes be done by convict labor. This Resolution will take the form of  a petition, to be presented to the State Legislature. To submit it to the Board of Education, for the purpose of winning their support, the following Committee of Delegates was elected: L. Danziger, Chas Liuncemayer, A belk, Frank Deisz, R. Arendt, F. E. Dressler, A. Frank &amp; Otto Schroeder.</p>
