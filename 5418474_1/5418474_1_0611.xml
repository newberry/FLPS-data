   <p>On account of a lengthly, lively agitation there will begin on next Monday, the teaching of the German language in the Public schools. So far, the School Board had form letters printed, which had to be mailed by the Principals to the parents of the pupils, but the Principals, who as a rule oppose the teaching of German, failed to do so, and threw the circulars away. According to a change in the rules, decided upon by the Schoolboard, the Principals are compelled to distribute the circulars among the children.</p>
   <p>75 of these applications are sufficient, to introduce the teaching of German in any school, and it is so easy to obtain this figure that there can be no doubt, but that by next Monday, with the exception of a few branch schools, all the public schools in Chicago will start teaching German.</p>
