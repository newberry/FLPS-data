   <p>In these midsummer days, the National Educational Association holds its annual meeting in the country's capital. This organization is an association of teachers, men and women, and it is natural that at their meetings they will deal with school problems. They will first deal with the problem of how to obtain more money for school purposes, the N.E.A., as it is called in our days of initials, is firmly convinced that the country will find its salvation from the school. The school is a panacea for all evils', it can solve all problems:</p>
   <p>It is generally known that, in this country, most cities are either bankrupt or are almost bankrupt. The states are not better off, and this is why the N.E.A. turns trustingly to the Federal government. It seems to assume that, when all others are broke, then the Federal government must be wading in money. True to an adage by Goethe, "Only hoboes are modest," organized teachers will demand half a billion from Uncle Sam. It seems that it will remain only a demand.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0051.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Quite indignant are those who came to the meeting, because President Roosevelt has not come to welcome them personally. At present, the President is on board the cruiser Houston in the waters of the West Indies. At the time he was being sharply criticised by the N.E.A he was visiting with his colored colleague, Stenio Vincent, the president of Haiti. He had instructed General Hugh S. Johnson, head of the N.R.A., to represent him and to make the usual speech at the N.E.A General Johnson, however, is sick and at the present is not in Washington. So it happened that the great convention of the N.E.A was shamefully neglected by the most high personalities.</p>
   <p>At all popular entertainment of this sort the "dear fatherland" is the main thing. Likewise in this case. The special representative of the fatherland was, in this case, the national commander of the American Legion, Edward A. Haynes. He gave the assembled educators of our youth a thoroughly good piece of his mind and declared, among other things, that among the teachers of high schools and professors of universities there are high traitors who implant into the youth revolutionary ideas and, by a subterfuge, seek to spread the red part <pb facs="5418474_1_0052.jpg" n="3"/>of the Star-Spangled Banner over the entire flag.</p>
   <p>Such assertions are not new. In many states, as well as in Illinois, they have resulted in the passage of laws according to which all persons engaged in teaching must pledge themselves, by oath, to uphold the flag of patriotic conviction and of the Constitution. There is a colossal naivete in believing that a teacher who is given to the worship of destructive tendencies will let himself be prevented, by such an oath, from injecting those tendencies into the minds of pupils. Even Mr. Haynes, in his angry address, made the declaration that every man has the right to think what he will. But he must not make propaganda for his ideas if by so doing he offends the rights of others.</p>
   <p>By that, the commander of the Legion hit the nail upon the head, but only theoratically. In practice, no one is able to hold his convictions to himself forever, especially if he is a teacher and has before him youths eager for information. Whether or not he wants to do it, his ideas, his convictions must appear in his lectures. In this point the N.E.A. has become untrue to its tradition.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0053.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Its heads and leaders have often fitly been designated as school politicians; but this time they entirely forgot politics and strategy. In spite of the admonitions of the guest from the American Legion, they enthusiastically endorsed a resolution in favor of unlimited academic freedom of teaching.</p>
   <p>This shows moral courage and merits unreserved recognition. It is also evidence of clear insight and national thinking. For freedom of research and instruction is the foundation of every scientific endeavor, and it is not feasible to ask every teacher in high school or university to renounce it. It is perhaps not totally unjustified that teachers and professors are often reproached for radical tendencies. Their occupation is such that they are particularily exposed to such tendencies. The danger, however, that these teachers may rear a generation of revolutionists and rebels is not great.</p>
   <p>For the purely academic atmosphere of the classroom favors radical ideas. (Sic!) When these young people will no longer subsist on their parental money, when <pb facs="5418474_1_0054.jpg" n="5"/>rough reality takes them by the scruff of the neck, then they will soon enough realize that the wonderful ideas intended to beautify the nations are not applicable in practical life. In conformity with an old Latin adage, we do not learn for the school but for life. And yet life is bound to alter many things in a swift and basic way what we have learned in school.</p>
