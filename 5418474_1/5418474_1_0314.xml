   <p>In Mandel Hall of the University of Chicago the formal dedication of the building recently took place. It was presented to the University by the German-American wholesale merchant and philanthropist, William A. Wieboldt, and has been named after its donor, Wieboldt Institute.</p>
   <p>The new building, which was erected at a cost of $550,000 in Gothic style to harmonize with the other buildings of the University, lies between the Harper library and the building of classical studies on the Midway. "Wieboldt Hall" was dedicated yesterday to the study of modern languages. In his festival speech, Professor Alexander Hohlfeld of the University of Wisconsin, stated that Wieboldt Hall is the only University building in the whole world, in which modern languages exclusively are taught.</p>
   <p>"Wieboldt Institute is the symbol of modern philology," said the professor. "It embodies the ideal of co-operation between the different language departments. The desire for such an institute which has existed for a long time, has now been realized through the large endowment of Mr. Wieboldt."</p>
   <p>Professor William A. Nitze, the president of the Department of Romance Languages, <pb facs="5418474_1_0315.jpg" n="2"/>was the chairman of the festival. The celebration was followed by a tea, and inspection of the new building.</p>
