   <p>It was the Politics of Harpers to undertake at the beginning to encourage as well as gather students who were exceptionally bright, to have them study for degrees. Too bad one of the most capable men Dr. Hermann Edward V. Holst, is lost again to the University. Holst was born in 1841 in Livland and at an early age came to New York where he became engaged in the study of Journalism and Literature. In 1872 he was appointed Professor of History at the newly established University of Strasburg. From there he came to Chicago in 1892 but was shortly afterwards compelled to discontinue his profession due to ill health. One of his most popular and important pieces of work was recalled here. "The Constitution and Democracy of the United States of North America".</p>
   <p>Over the qualifications and arrangements of the German Department there appeared recently an article in one of the foremost papers, the "Western", on February 4, 1900. The leading personnel at that time consisted of Prof.Starr, W. Cutting,. Manager of the Department were Hans M. Schmidt, Wartenburg Kamillo, Wm. Klenze, Paul Oscar Kern, Phil Allen, Ben. Almsteadt and during the summer Richard Hochdorefer, Prof. at Wittenberg College.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0152.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There is only this left to say that the university by extending and introducing the Summer Courses as well as the "University Extension Department" and by trying to increase general popular education made quite an advancement. Through a visit of the German Ambassador Dr. von Holleben became better informed. Already in 1899 not less than six students were studying for Doctor of Philosophy degrees and who wrote their theses in German.</p>
   <p>The total now is 4315 students so that Chicago is third and only Harvard and Columbia are ahead.</p>
