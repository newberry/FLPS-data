   <p>Like a carnival joke reads a lately published prospectus in which, a "Chicago German-American University", announces its opening of business on the first Tuesday in January 1898. On the title page of the prospectus shines, with the remark "reduced", the great corporation schedule of this new planting-ground of modern science. The not badly executed Sigillum, carries in the outer circle an inscription: "German-American University, Chicago, U. S. A." In the middle a note is written in Latin: "Science and Progress. Devotion to Humanity". The center of the whole illustrates in a fitting way a well-made portrait of Pallas Athene.</p>
   <p>As Rector and Treasurer of the University there figures a physician, who for some years was the head of a midwife's institution of which he was the founder. The "Institution Building", a not very big residential building, on West 12th Street, shall in the future shelter the "University". As Deacon of the faculty for Beaux Arts is a gentleman who strived hard for several years, but with little success, to introduce here a treatise supposedly by himself, entitled, "Religion of Idealism". This torch of the Sciences and Arts, also, will undertake <pb facs="5418474_1_0173.jpg" n="2"/>to enlighten the pupils of the new University on the Theory and History of the Arts". By the way, he will also occupy the Professorship of Philosophy. An obscure agent is announced as teacher of the German language and literature. Another agent as Professor of Social Economy.. As Professor of Chemistry one finds, in this unparalleled faculty, a gentleman whose nomination as Park Commissioner had to be cancelled by Governor Tanner, following a storm of indignation it created.</p>
   <p>The suspicion is close at hand, that the real makers know very well, what they want. That they could expect to win a number of real pupils that would be worth mentioning is hardly believable, but rather that they would try to sell a certain kind of Doctor Diplomas. The drawing of such would be empowered by their "rights of corporation". Also efforts might be made, to induce well-to-do patrons of Arts &amp; Sciences to support the institution financially. In return for such patrons is foreseen "The honorary degree of a patron of the University". The originators have this degree already for they are known as patrons of the "German-American University".</p>
