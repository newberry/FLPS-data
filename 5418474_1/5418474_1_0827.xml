   <p>Extensive article about German instruction in public schools. (Mentions another article on the same topic that included statistical material and was "recently" published.)</p>
   <p>German teaching personnel consists of about a dozen women teachers. In St. Louis and Cincinnati number of German teachers three times higher, also number of children taking German considerably larger. In St. Louis German is a special study of the German children- in Chicago the instruction is calculated to profit both German and American children. In St. Louis children are taken into a separate room for German instruction. Children of various grades are divided into German classes according to their knowledge of German. The disadvantage of this system lies in the fact that the German children become separated from their American fellow pupils, and that the American children do not take German. In Chicago, the German teachers alternate from grade to grade, spending half an hour with each class. One Committee for Instruction in German of the Board of Education, wants German instruction to be an essential part of the schools.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0828.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Miss Morch in the Haven School(Wabash near 15, an aristocratic section) teaches German to 425 children of which only 50 are German (15 are "Irish or Colored") Miss Malwina Forster has Kinzie School, Ohio and La Salle, 320 children taking German, less than half of whom are Germans. Miss Anna A. Achert, Franklin School, "Division &amp; Sedgwick Streets, 330; Miss Caroline Mc Fee, Washington School,(Indiana and Sangamon) 303; Marie L. W. Mc Clintock, Moseley School, 24th Street, 350; E. M. von Horn, Wells School, Reuben and Cornelia, 400; E. M. Alfeld, Skinner School, Jackson and Aberdeen, 210 of which all but 15 are Americans. Olivia M. Olson, Cottage Grove, Douglas Place, 118;(none of whom are Germans) Virginia von Horn, Carpenter, 2nd and Center Avenue, 406,(hardly a third German) Amanda Gimbel, LaSalle Primary, North of North Avenue, 450; Mathilde Kaun, Scammon, Madison near Halsted, 400, among them 100 Irish boys and girls.</p>
   <p>These statistics show that the idea of the Committee to win the Americans through their own children for"das Deutsche" (may be translated "The German language") as the German Cause,") has been proven right. The Committee seems to have thought that in the measure in which the German instruction lost its position of separateness may measure the resistance against it will cease. Only in one School (Skinner) one of the teachers is hostile to the German instruction, and his influence <pb facs="5418474_1_0829.jpg" n="3"/>is so patent that no less than 40 pupils who had begun gave up German.</p>
   <p>German instruction in Chicago is not so well organized as in St. Louis. There one has a German "director" (Superintendent) who stands in the same relationship to the German teachers as the English "directors" to the English teachers. Here in Chicago, the work of the director of the German teachers lies on the hands of the Committee, and the Messrs. Schintz, Richberg and Wunsche are business men who cannot be as efficient as an especially appointed German director.</p>
   <p>Of the 20,000 pupils in Chicago, Public Schools, 3654 take German. A year ago only 1114 did.</p>
