   <p>In the matter of the Schoolbook question, there was held another meeting by the opponents of the free distribution of schoolbooks to the pupils of the Public Schools, in the localities of the Bonifacius community, corner Noble and Cornell Streets. After Reverend Evers called the meeting to order and explained in a few words the object of the meeting, Mr. John Kolle was elected as Chairman, and Mr. Andreas Behrendt as Secretary. The Pastors Netzraeter, Burelbach and Erz, also Mr. Frederick C. Happel made speeches, in which they explained the reasons, why they protested against the position presented at Springfield. Pastor Netzraeter called attention to the fact, that more than half of all the pupils in the public schools are not past the age of elementary classes. The parents of these children, mostly workers and small business men, would have to bear the cost of the schoolbooks, together with the better situated citizens, who are in the position to give their children a higher education.</p>

   <p>In similar vein, spoke Pastor Burelbach, while Mr. Happel, from the fact, that at the present time there is agitation carried on in six different states of the union, in favor of the system, of free distribution of school books, drew the conclusion, that the Schoolbook Trust stands behind this movement. Pastor Erz called it an injustice, that those, who save the State much money, through maintaining Community schools, and in spite of that, participate in the burden of paying a share for the public school expenses, should be taxed for something, which offers them no advantage.</p>
   <p>All those present, signed the protest resolutions, which will be submitted to the State Legislature.</p>
