   <p>After a long pause, enthusiasm has been aroused for German art and literature among the students of Elmhurst College. A German club has been established which is planning to perform Lessing's "Minna von Barnhelm."</p>
   <p>Professor Blenk, a German by birth, who studied in Munich, together with Prof. Aruds, is directing the rehearsals of the comedy. What is now needed is to arouse the interest of the public. If this is done, such German performances could become a yearly event. <pb facs="5418474_1_0303.jpg" n="2"/>The cast indicates that the performance will be a complete success. Miss Ruth Chevorowsky, of the Northwestern University, a sister of Pastor Chevorowsky, of Elmhurst, plays "Minna"; Miss Mabel Tiedemann, of Franklin Park "Franciska"; Albert Buch appears as "Major Tellheim"; Karl Huff as the Major's honest servant "Just"; Erich Teidel, himself a born Saxonian, plays the "Innkeeper"; Hugo Bauer, Tellheim's friend, "Werner"; Ernst Walte, the "Count Bruchsal." This performance, which is arranged by the students of the Elmhurst College, is the first since the World War.</p>
   <p>The reawakening of interest in German art can be welcomed with pleasure, as it is an evidence that in this old German institution the perception and love for the language of the old homeland is growing again.</p>
