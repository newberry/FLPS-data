   <p>The school board was in session yesterday.</p>
   <p>(Summary)</p>
   <p>Monthly report and financial matters.</p>
   <p>(Translation Continued)</p>
   <p>Kraus called the board's attention to last month's meeting (July), [saying] that a resolution had then been adopted advising the superintendent of schools to employ Smith's system of teaching drawing in the high schools although at a previous meeting a resolution had been adopted advocating the discontinuance of the method. Burroughs said that the committee on drawing and music had recommended Walter Smith's course, but that nevertheless Mr. Hanstein had refused to adopt <pb facs="5418474_1_0243.jpg" n="2"/>it; not only that, but he also attempted to discharge Mrs. Dimmock, principal of the drawing and music classes of the public schools, in order to introduce his own method.</p>
   <p>A motion was then carried to eliminate Smith's method, the members voting as follows: for the motion, Brenan, Dunne, Maas, Niehoff, Healy, Kraus, Floto, and Delaney; opposed, Hoyne, Curran, Burroughs, and Bridge.</p>
   <p>Hoyne made a motion to reconsider Smith's method and to table the matter for a month. Maas made an amendment to the effect that the committee on music and drawing should report at the next session the merits of Smith's method in comparison with others. The motion was carried, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
