  <body>
   <p>Twice so far the National German-American Teachers Association has held its annual meeting in Chicago, and twice the teachers have enjoyed the hospitality of the Germans of this City. This happened in 1884 and in 1888. The teachers will have another meeting this year. It must be held in Chicago, on account of the World's Fair.</p>
   <p>What the National German-American Teacher's Association aims to achieve is fairly well known to the German. It is the duty of all the German-Americans to help to introduce German methods and pedagogy and to see to it that the superficiality of the "school ma'am" is replaced by German thoroughness and conscientiousness. Only such men and women should take up the high profession of teaching who are devoted to it, and possess an aptitude for it. The most formative period in the life of a child should not be left to the whims of irresponsible young men and women. This expresses the chief aim of the N.G.A.T.A. and includes, as a matter of fact, the culture and promotion of the German <pb facs="5418474_1_0202.jpg" n="2"/>language and German literature.</p>
   <p>The local Teachers Committee will welcome the members of the association, who will be joined by many colleagues from the Old Country. However, our funds are insufficient to properly receive from 400 to 500 guests. For this reason we appeal to the Germans, to the friends of the teachers, for financial aid. We need several hundred dollars, and it should not be difficult to collect them immediately. The teacher's conference will take place from July 6 to July 8 inclusively. Details will be published in the press.</p>
   <p>Contributions of any amount will be accepted by the treasurer, Professor G. Bamberger, 3216 Vernon Ave., or, 91 Judd Street (Jewish Training School) and will be acknowledged through the medium of the press.</p>
