   <p>p. 5 - The antagonistic attitude of the present city administration, toward instruction in the German language, and gymnastics in public schools, has led to a decision, unanimously accepted by all German societies of Chicago at this meeting:</p>
   <p>"In the interest of the education of our young people, the German-born citizens of Chicago demand, that in addition to the culturally important English language, the German language should be taught, as extensively as in years past.</p>
   <p>"We demand also, in the interest of the physical development of the younger generation, that gymnastics be introduced as an obligatory subject in all public schools.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0168.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"The fact that the members of the school board are appointed by Mayor Harrison, will make him directly responsible should these two subjects be restricted in the public schools during the remainder of his administration."</p>
   <p>A committee, composed of Messrs. Leopold Saltiel, Carl Haerting and Fritz Nebel, and Mmes. Elizabeth Skowronski and Pauline Dupre, will submit this decision, approved by several hundred German societies of Chicago, to Mayor Harrison today. Inasmuch as Mayor Harrison will appoint members to the educational council in the near future, it would be reasonable to expect that he will comply with the request of the German citizens.</p>
   <p>Another important decision was the request of the aforementioned committee, to meet a committee composed of five members of the United German-American Citizens of Chicago and Vicinity.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0169.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>As chairman of this committee, Mr. Koelling indicated that the association, of which he is a representative, is desirous of cooperating with the projected new union. Their chief aim now will be to induce Mayor Harrison to elect members to the school board, whose disposition is not anti-German.</p>
