   <p>The school board committee decided at yesterday's session that it would await the report of E. G. Halle, one of its members, before voting on the question of abolishing or continuing German instruction in the public schools. There was a tendency to take unfavorable action on the "German issue," when Mr. Halle asked for the privilege of submitting his findings. He promised to give a written treatise to every committee member before the next meeting. The request was granted. The committee will be prepared to give its report at the next session.</p>
   <p>A member of the school board commented on the general sentiment of the committee towards the special branches: "It is evident that the question of German and gymnastics will give us considerable difficulty. Instruction in drawing will be slightly curtailed and music can be eliminated altogether without serious objection. It may be possible that the entire problem will be definitely settled at the next conference."</p>
