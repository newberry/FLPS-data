<title level="a">THE AMERICAN VERSUS THE GERMAN TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>It is an interesting coincidence that while the temperance movement has attained its height in this country, Germany is experiencing a similar movement, although the objective is somewhat different. The German government has submitted to Parliament a bill for the eradication of drunkenness. The old saying, "although two persons perform the same thing, it still is not the same," can be properly applied in the case of the American and German temperance movements. The American temperance fanatics go so far that in order to curb drunkenness they demand the discontinuance of the sale of intoxicants. Here the drunkard is not as much condemned as is the individual selling the liquor. In this country, they not only aim to teach moderation in the indulgence of liquor, but are not satisfied with anything less than the enforcement of absolute temperance.</p>
   <p>The liquor question in Germany is of a different nature altogether. Although the movement against misuse of intoxicants is the bone of contention, the fight <pb facs="5418474_1_0984.jpg" n="2"/>however, is not directed against the distribution and sale of intoxicants. Thus, the liquor merchant is not held responsible for this evil, but the individual himself, who is the willing victim.</p>
   <p>The bill submitted to Parliament is specific on this point, demanding punishment for disorderly conduct while under the influence of liquor. The bill also requests that the law against drunkenness should be intensified instead of looked upon as a mitigative cause, as was done in the past.</p>
   <p>This clause of the bill is highly commendable. The law against disorderly conduct while intoxicated was misused in Germany to the same extent as the acquittal of persons in conflict with the law is misused here on the pretext of temporary mental derangement. Murderers and other criminals drink excessively before committing their crimes. They do not drink to get courage but rather to protect <pb facs="5418474_1_0985.jpg" n="3"/>themselves against the law. The fact that the mental condition of the defendant at the time of the crime plays an important part at the trial. The criminal takes refuge in drinking in order to defy the law. A reform for the protection of society is badly needed.</p>
   <p>Neither the spirit nor the tendency of the temperance movement in Germany can be compared to the temperance movement in America. Nevertheless, the American temperance fanatics contend that the principal cause for the movement is the same in both countries. The Cincinnati Gazette made a false statement that Germany is contemplating the adoption of temperance laws of the same intensity as those to which the Germans of this country are so strongly opposed. Despite this error, it will provide the temperance apostles of this country a welcome subject for argument.</p>
