<title level="a">GERMAN INSTRUCTION MARTIN SCHMIDHOFER SPEAKS BEFORE THE INDEPENDENT GERMAN AMERICAN WOMEN'S CLUB</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Mr. Schmidhofer, gave very interesting information about the condition of German teaching in Chicago's schools, before the "German American Women's Club." According to his report, the participation of children in the instruction of German has gratifyingly increased. The beginning of this instruction was started in 1871. Later, however, the instructions, owing to the pressure brought by the superintendent of that time, were more and more neglected, so that only in fifty schools, to about 6,000 children was German taught. Today, however, the number of schools, in which German classes are maintained rose to 112, with 18,000 children attending, and these are not only children of German parents, but mostly English-Americans. For instance, in the Stewart School on Broadway and Wilson Avenue, there is not one German child among the pupils. Mr. Schmidhofer praises Mrs. (Dr.) Young, that the teaching of German, is close to her heart, and that there is hope that it will be introduced in all schools. The ladies received Mr. Schmidhofer's report, with great applause.</p>
