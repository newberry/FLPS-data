   <p>Chicago will not find it necessary to decide at the Spring election, how it intends to vote on the Prohibition question. The "Drys," or rather, "The Chicago Dry Federation" did not succeed in obtaining the required number of signatures to make an issue of it. They gathered about 87,000 names, whereas 171,171 were necessary to reach the goal.</p>
   <p>According to existing laws, 25% of the voters must sign the petition, i.e. registered voters of the last election. As the "Drys" could not complete the desired lists, regardless of persistent efforts for months, only about <pb facs="5418474_1_0944.jpg" n="2"/>12% being available, we may assume that the majority of the population is not interested; and that the Prohibition party will see the futility of further efforts at present. Simultaneously, with the announcement of its debacle the Chicago Federation states that it does not consider itself beaten, but is now preparing for greater onslaughts in the 1917 Spring campaign. The Association of the "Drys" declares that it feels assured of success, because they already procured 125,000 signatures, and that it will be an easy matter to find another 100,000. The approaching election (April) will, presumably, be a very weak affair and not more than 400,000 may vote.</p>
   <p>This assumption is very logical and it is indeed very probable that the prohibition issue will appear on the 1917 ballots. It is certain now, that we can look forward to a strong agitation and denouncement of alcoholic drinks and saloons during the winter of 1916-17. Possibly, <pb facs="5418474_1_0945.jpg" n="3"/>the town may be dry. After all, retrospection shows a constant growth in the ranks of the anti-drink league; and, whoever, has kept his eyes open and his ears to the ground, must have observed that even the liberal element gradually drifts towards the desert, because of an ever increasing dissatisfaction with the taverns and attending evils.</p>
   <p>Many otherwise absolutely liberally inclined citizens, express the opinion that Chicago is on the road to prohibition. It cannot be prevented if the industry does not wield an iron-clad broom for a thorough house-cleaning job, and rid its premises of the criminal, and immoral element. It must rebuild its reputation, proclaim respectability; honesty.</p>
   <p>"Rebuild"--today it is done only in isolated instances and because of occasional pressure brought to bear. The large majority of saloon-keepers and brewers like to be looked upon as respectable members of the community, in so far as their friends are concerned. But as representatives of their <pb facs="5418474_1_0946.jpg" n="4"/>calling, they have not gained public recognition. Their position will be synonymous with infamy when ex-convicts, confederates, procurers and crooks can obtain saloon licenses with the knowledge and consent of the beverage manufacturers or through their deliberate intercession. As long as such conditions exist and continue, the danger of prohibition is bound to grow and ere long even "Chicago" will be dry.</p>
   <p>The genuine friends of the brewing and allied interests demand that they cleanse themselves, rectify their mistakes and disperse the unsavory, dangerous element which surrounds them. Their enemies look on contentedly as brewers and saloon-keepers permit the overloading of the branch whereon they sit--until the rupture dethrones them.</p>
