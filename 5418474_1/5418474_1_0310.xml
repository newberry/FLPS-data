   <p>The demand for instruction in the German language in both colleges and high schools, is a source of great satisfaction to the German community.</p>
   <p>The German classes of the Crane Junior College drew a record attendance this school year, no less than 852 students including the German language in their course to study. This figure marks the great progress achieved in this direction, especially when this number is compared to the figures of the days of the World War, when only 105 students attended German classes. Professor Richard Hartenberg, who has been head of the German department of the Crane Technical High School since 1903, has added five more instructors to this department, which is expanding so rapidly.</p>
   <p>The members of the "German Club of Crane College"--eight hundred in number <pb facs="5418474_1_0311.jpg" n="2"/>are also cultivating German art and music, in addition to studying the language. The Schubert festival which was arranged by this club last year was real proof of the young people's ambition. And the impression upon the many visitors was inspiring indeed.</p>
