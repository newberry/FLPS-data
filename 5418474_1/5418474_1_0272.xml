<title level="a">[RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS ORDERED STOPPED] (Editorial)</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>At the session of the Board of Education last Tuesday, a resolution was adopted--without fuss or appeal to prejudice--which nips in the bud all complaints about religious instruction in public schools. Without debate and without a dissenting voice, the resolution forbidding the use of the Bible as a textbook, and prohibiting all religious practices in the public schools, was adopted.</p>
   <p>The Board of Education acted correctly and intelligently. As long as Jews and heathens, as well as various kinds of Christians, contribute taxes for the maintenance of schools, they evidently will be cheated if only a specific religion is kept on tap. After all, parents pay school taxes under the assumption that nothing is taught to their children which is likely to cause religious dissension at home. <pb facs="5418474_1_0273.jpg" n="2"/>Children should learn reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, history, and so forth; they should be kept immune from the hairsplitting dogmas and the brooding incidental to some of the beliefs fostered by religious societies, and the students should be spared the problems of the "marriage relationship of the Divinity" [Verschwaegerung Der Gotthert: Probably refers to His relationship with the Virgin Mary], "the original sin," "salvation," "predestination," "resurrection of the flesh," etc. For all these theories the Bible supplies the raw material; therefore the Bible does not belong in the public schools--that book has its place in parochial institutions and during confirmation instruction.</p>
   <p>Only after the public school has disproven the reproach that it is subservient to a particular creed can it defend itself with a clear conscience and with dispassionate definiteness against clerical attacks. Such attacks have not yet been made in Chicago; that is why the Board's action is especially commendable--it acted in the right spirit, independent of compulsory measures. <pb facs="5418474_1_0274.jpg" n="3"/>We may expect that a few Protestant clergymen will criticize the Board of Education from the pulpit next Sunday; but that is immaterial.</p>
   <p>The press of both political parties believes in eliminating religion from the public schools and in that, as well as other cases, the written word will be mightier than the spoken, or--as the "Berliners" say--"the brazen mouth!"</p>
