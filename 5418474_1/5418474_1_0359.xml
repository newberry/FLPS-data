   <p>At yesterday's Meeting of the Association of German Teachers at the Kaiserhof Hotel, the parents of the children who were present at the trial instruction, must have been greatly pleased at their performances, and as all the children were Americans, German parents would have been pleasantly surprises, to hear the clear and precise answers which were the best proof that American parents are laying great stress on their children's study of the German language.</p>
   <p>It was heart stirring to see the results of the extraordinary professional teaching of Miss Louise E. Poppelbaum. With a masterly understanding of the pupils way of thinking, the talented teacher not only could draw answer after answer, but also keep their interest in the objects alert. It was easy to observe how the little girls and boys were trying to satisfy their beloved teacher.</p>
