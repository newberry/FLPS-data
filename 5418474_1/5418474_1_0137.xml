   <p>In the great, densely-filled hall of the "Haskell Oriental Museum" at the campus of the University of Chicago the inaugural lecture of Dr. Heinrich Kraeger, Professor at the Royal Art Academy in Duesseldorf took place yesterday afternoon, at 3 o'clock. The introduction of the German lecturer into his new office was made by Dr. Judson, the ad interim dean of the University. Professor Laughlin, who a short time ago returned from Berlin as lecturer of political science, bade him welcome in the name of the faculty. The German Consulate and the German Department of the University were represented completely, also numerous other members of the faculty gave honor to their trans-atlantic colleague by their presence at his first lecture. This consisted of a general introduction for his topic: "The History of the German Art of Painting, from its beginning to the present. Besides these lectures, Dr. Kraeger will give once every week for two hours, seminary exercises on the mutual influence of German Art and Literary History.</p>
   <p>Beginning next Friday evening, Dr. Kraeger will give lectures at the Germania Club-house and will start them with a reading about the Art of Adolf Menzel, illustrated by photographs.</p>
