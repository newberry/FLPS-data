   <p>During a recent session of the Illinois Manufacturers Association, Charles H. Wacker, well-known Chicago brewer, declared that beer is a drink which promotes moderation. This is readily proven by the fact that many foreign governments try to diminish the consumption of strong alcoholic beverages by giving full support to beer and the milder stimulants, such as light wines, etc. And if, we compare Germany, England, and the Scandinavian countries, which regard beer as a universal drink, with other nations, then the assertion about the healthful properties of barley brew appears rather convincing.</p>
   <p>The brewing industry undoubtedly has a great future in this country, and Chicago may look with satisfaction to our developments in this <pb facs="5418474_1_0957.jpg" n="2"/>line, as we are destined to become leaders. Malt products like "Pale Perfecto and the "Ulmer Nalz" [Malt of Ulm, a district] of the wacker and Birk Brewing Company, and the excellent "Malt Marrow" of the McAvoy Brewing Company, are quality products which build a reputation for themselves and the city of their origin. As people become convinced that beer when properly used is a health-giving drink, the demand for the pure article, such as the above brands, will show a constant increase.</p>
