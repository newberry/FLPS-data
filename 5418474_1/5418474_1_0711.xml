   <p>The teaching of German in Public Schools is an absolute necessity and not a mere concession. A city which counts among its population such a large percentage of the German Element as Chicago does, can not ignore the German language, without disadvantage to itself; and furthermore, free schools can fluorish with our population only when it offers to the pupils the opportunity, to learn the native language of their parents. This in itself, would be sufficient reason, why the German language should be taught in public schools, and for another still more important reason, because the parochial schools, which are so dangerous to our free thinking, are steadily growing, which is the consequence of devoting much time and energy to the teaching of German. Neverthe-less, the management of public schools, has for years taken a hostile attitude toward the teaching of German in public schools which was taught only to advanced pupils, thus out of 48,000 pupils, only 8000 can get German instructions. But even this small number is, through various limitations, reduced to 6000 for whom the opportunity to learn German is afforded. And of this number 2000 have applied for the German instruction.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0712.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The parents of the children who attend the Picard-School, near Mc Cormick's factory on 22nd Street, have repeatedly asked the School Board, to introduce the German Language in that school, but without any success. Four rooms in the Picard School are vacant, while the neighboring parochial schools are overcrowded, still the superintendent insists, that the school would not prove large enough, should German be added to their studies.</p>
   <p>The same conditions prevail at the Foster School, 12th and Halsted Streets. As limited as the teaching of German already is, it could not be surprising, if it would be stopped altogether. The School-board decided last year (The Germans Frankenthal, Hotz and Vocke, voted for the same measure too) upon optional studies "which means, that only pupils whose parents desire it, may take that particular study, but unless each class room, has at least 20 pupils for such studies, it would cease to be taught, and that of course includes German.</p>
   <p>If the Germans don't employ drastic measures, the German language will not be taught <pb facs="5418474_1_0713.jpg" n="3"/>in our public schools much longer, and the Germans will have to send their children to private schools, although they have to pay for the support of public schools. Nativism dominates our School-Board, supported by several Catholics, who in their own interest, welcome any measure which would weaken the public-school system, so much hated by them. There are only three German members of the School Board, therefore, nothing can be expected from there, if public opinion would not resort to the necessary pressure, to bring about the desired results.- We call on the reliable men of the city, to take this matter up, and arrange meetings at which, the indignation over the school Board's policy can be expressed, thus the members of the School-Board may see, that the people not only wish the continuance of the teaching of German, but that same should expand among public schools.</p>
