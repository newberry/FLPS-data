   <p>The following report of the Supervisors of the German School Lessons, Dr. Zimmerman to Mr. John C. Richberg, President of the School Committee for the German Lessons at Public Schools is more active and effective than the previous one.</p>

During the last half yearly period German Lessons have been introduced at 8 new schools, "The Jones", "Nickersonville," "Raymond", "Marquette", "Clark", "Douglas", "Wicker Park" and "Burr School." There remains only 6 grammar schools in town where the German language is not taught. The following index gives the names of the schools, the number of pupils in the grammar schools, the number taking part in German Lessons, and the number of teachers:-</p>

   <p>The Wicker Park and Burr Schools will, after a resolution of December 20th, 1880, introduce German lessons.</p>
   <p>The total number of all pupils in the 25 schools December 31st, 1880, is 6294, the number of German pupils 3399. The number of pupils in the High Schools are 1132 of which 257 participate in German lessons. This totals 7426 pupils of which 257 participate in German lessons about 50%. By the rule of 20 <pb facs="5418474_1_0674.jpg" n="4"/>in several classes in 13 of the 25 schools, 979 pupils are prevented from learning the German language.</p>
   <p>If this rule was not in force about 1/3 (326) of these pupils would participate in the German lessons. January 3rd, 1881 an increase of 330 pupils is expected, whereto must be added the pupils of the 2 new schools, Wicker Park and Burr which would make a total of 4000.</p>
   <p>Dr. G. F. Zimmerman</p>
