   <p>In this fight involving the German language instruction at our public schools, we are opposed by the entire English press. The fight about the German instruction is not a party issue. It is a bitter contest between the progressive spirit of Germanism and antiquated Americanism. The latter is somewhat conceited because it has produced a few eminent scientists. They conclude from this fact that the old system is still satisfactory. They forget that those few distinguished men rose to eminence not on account of the educational system but in spite of it.</p>
   <p>The fight around the German instruction is thus a contest between the old educational methods and the new ones. But because the new educational methods originated in Germany, the contest now raging is assuming a political tinge. The fight is narrowing down to a test of strength between the pro and anti-German elements.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0574.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The real purpose dictating the abolition of the German instruction is inspired by the desire of eliminating simultaneously all German influence.</p>
   <p>No doubt, the situation is serious and it behaves every German to do his duty and to defend his rights. The school board members who upheld the German pedagogical ideas will then be convinced that the majority of the public is supporting them.</p>
