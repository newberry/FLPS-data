   <p>It is regrettable that the many denominational schools of Chicago have such a large attendance of pupils, which is the consequence of a poor Public school system. The blame for this falls on the corrupt citizens themselves who are indifferent to public welfare.</p>
   <p>The wealthy class, sends their children to public schools and for their high school education they send them to institutions, maintained by public funds. Those public schools are built for this purpose only although we won't go so far as to say that they afford all the latest comforts of modern buildings, but it is certain that they are superior in every respect to the denominational schools which spring up almost over night. In poorer neighborhoods, generally populated by large families, schools are very scarce. It is also a fact that our city executives are not willing to grant money for the use in poorer districts. The same question is handled differently when it concerns the wealthy class. All this is the underlying cause for so many denominational schools. Public corruption is a welcome thing to the clerics of different religious denominations. They erect schools and teach youth intolerance toward other religions. The responsibility for all this lies with our city <pb facs="5418474_1_0238.jpg" n="2"/>executives. If there would not be so much corruption, taxes would be paid according to the wealth of the individual and, the city would dispose over sufficient funds to build institutions which are so much needed. Corruption suffers, that 20 to 25,000 Chicago's children are in daily danger of losing their lives in schools, which are nothing but fire traps and public conscience has still not been aroused!</p>
   <p>So many lives are in danger because of the corruption of the city administration, the wealthy class of citizens and the clergy.</p>
   <p>The yesterday's Fackel named the Catholic schools which are fire traps. The parents have warning to act and to avoid a disaster such as that of New York.</p>
