   <p>The School Board at its regular semi-monthly session yesterday was present in full numbers with the exception of Stiles, who is still in Europe..... The committee on instruction recommended the addition of more teachers for classes in German, and the following were appointed: Charlotte A. Laub, Emma Brauschenbusch, Rosa Widmer, and Amelia Schnell.</p>
   <p>The committee on drawing succeeded in getting its long report adopted. It contained a recommendation to continue the use of Smith's Method of Instruction in Drawing in all schools, including high schools, but provided that in exceptional cases other models may be used for copying with the consent of the principal. The report was really only a eulogy of the Walter Smith system. However, much of the effectiveness of all this laudable comment was lost, since the committee admitted that it was not well versed in the <pb facs="5418474_1_0241.jpg" n="2"/>matter and relied entirely on the declarations of the publisher. But Inspector Kraus's motion was carried that the defects of Smith's method should be corrected at the teachers' discretion.</p>
   <p>After finishing the routine work, and ordering payment of bills the board adjourned.</p>
