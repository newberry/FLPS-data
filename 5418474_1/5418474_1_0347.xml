   <p>Instruction in German will be continued in the public schools of Oak Park, including its high school, and also in the schools of River Forest township. The school board of the community voted unanimously last night in its favor, and rejected a petition of the George Rogers Clark Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution for abolition of German instruction. After a short debate, President J. Kibben Ingalls and Mrs. W. A. Douglass and G. E. Ellison, school commissioners, voted for the continuance of German instruction. School Commissioners William Pettigrew and Walter D. Herrick were absent.</p>
   <p>In his address to the school board, President Ingalls said: "Since Dr. Philander P. Claxton, federal commissioner of education, the National Security League, and the educational authorities of the Allies recommend the study of the German language, we cannot do anything but vote for the maintenance of German instruction in our schools."</p>

   <p>It was claimed yesterday in Oak Park that the members of the D. A. R. and the people of Oak Park and River Forest would continue their agitation against the German language. Furthermore it was said that some high school students would refuse to continue the study of German even if this had a bad effect on their grades and delayed the completion of their school courses.</p>
