   <p>p. 5.. A meeting under the auspices of the United German Societies was held at the Orpheus hall yesterday. The original purpose of this meeting was to protest against the discontinuance of German instruction in the public schools, effective November 15th. Although immediate discontinuance of German instruction was not imminent, the society deemed it advisable to meet in conference and discuss the future of the German language in public schools.</p>
   <p>Mr. Leopold Saltiel, chairman of the meeting, reported on steps undertaken by the organization. When the executive committee of this organization learned of the school board's plan, Mr. Saltiel got in touch with the mayor. He informed him of the energetic protest the organization is planning.</p>
   <p>The mayor replied that Judge Tuley was responsible as he had assigned the sum of $125,000 of the school board's money to the building fund. Mr. Harrison then offered to consult with Mr. Harris, president of the school board. The latter informed Mr. Saltiel that German instruction will be maintained in the public schools, although the funds will have to come from some other source.</p>
   <p>A debate followed during which Mr. Newmann expressed the opinion that instruction <pb facs="5418474_1_0426.jpg" n="2"/>in German in our public schools was not given by conscientious teachers. He spoke of persons who lacked adequate preparation. He contended, that to dispense with German instruction is preferable to the method used.</p>
   <p>Mr. Donat warned against hasty decisions, and advised prudent procedure in this matter. "Moreover, he said, "the teaching of German in the public schools is not as bad as was intimated." In defense of the German instructors in the public schools, Teacher Zutz said: "The real reason why German teachers of repute do not care for our public schools, is to be found in the fact that there is no certainty of tenure. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to secure the necessary funds for this branch of education. It is up to the school board to secure from the city council the necessary funds and thus to avert serious consequences. This suggestion should be made to the members of the school board by the central committee of this association...."</p>
