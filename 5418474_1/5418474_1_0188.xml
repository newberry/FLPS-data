   <p>Since the eagerness of the Know-Nothing element did not succeed in banishing progress from our public schools, it is not at all surprising that the old attempts which have been in vogue for years are now being applied to the Normal School.</p>
   <p>For those who happen to be uninformed, the Normal School is a seminary where women are educated to become future teachers of our county schools. It is under the jurisdiction of a highly respected pedagogue, Col. Parker, who is a staunch crusader of the Pestalozzian educational method. This method practices the gradual and progressively systematic development of the mind, as opposed to the inane drilling which has been the usual method in America for years. The Normal School of Cook County achieved distinction <pb facs="5418474_1_0189.jpg" n="2"/>under Col. Parker's leadership and its students are sought as teachers throughout this, and other States. They are growing into a veritable army of apostles that represent the progress of education.</p>
   <p>This naturally incites our dense and sulking Know-Nothings and the Whig-adherents who now resort to the battle cry: "Down with the fads!"; and fads include everything beyond the three R's. In this instance, the onslaught is directed against Col. Parker. Not that they feel any particular animosity towards the Colonel, but in ousting him, they endeavor to reach the method. Indeed, their hopes and wishes go far beyond that. There are many people, especially in the Irish contingent who wish to dethrone the entire school by attacking its leader. They desire to abolish the seminary. It disseminates too much knowledge.</p>
   <p>Small wonder then, that they selected the same Thornton for their banner-bearer who for years proved himself to be an obstinate adversary of Parker.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0190.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The fact that their man never attended a higher institute of learning is not a detriment by any means. That he is incapable of judging the relative merits and results of different educational methods, is immaterial; be it then that his own limitations qualify him. It suffices that he is antagonistic toward Parker's creed, that he is willing to lead the anti-Faddist faction, and is prepared to appear as the apostle of intellectual degeneracy, By doing this he assures himself of support from the anti-Faddists and the Know-Nothings toward that final goal, the dissolution of the Normal School.</p>
   <p>Thornton is also the attorney for Mr. Beck. The latter was a wealthy man at one time. During this luxurious period of plenty, he magnanimously deeded the ground on which the school now stands to the country.</p>
   <p>A stipulation was attached to this philanthropical present by Mr. Beck, <pb facs="5418474_1_0191.jpg" n="4"/>specifying that the property would revert to him or his heirs, if it should ever be used for other purposes than those incorporated in the document.</p>
   <p>Mr. Beck is now impoverished, and he would be quite satisfied if the Normal School were abandoned.</p>
   <p>There is no law in this land whereby presents may be revoked, nor any statute, like the one in Germany whereby the recipient can be compelled to pay a suitable rental, or commensurate with the value of the property to the donor; if such a donor should meet with adversity at some subsequent period. There is that precedent, the famous Carsten-Lichterfelde case. Obviously Mr. Beck's position is not enviable, but it would be sheer lunacy to return this property on ethical pretexts now that the improvements have increased the value of the entire community. Then there is also the <pb facs="5418474_1_0192.jpg" n="5"/>question of the investments made by the county in erecting the building. It is evident that diverse interests are working towards the disintegration of the school. The greatest force, however, comes from the Know-Nothing element, and our present administration is solely responsible for this element having attained such power on the school board. In the approaching county elections, the voters will know whom to blame if the party leaders do not disarm the apostles of stultification. It would be a disgrace to Cook County if the functions of this institution are crippled or if it is allowed to disappear entirely.</p>
