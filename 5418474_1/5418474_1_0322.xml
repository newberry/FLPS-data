   <p>The affiliated Germanic Group of the City of Chicago has just been founded. It is an organization for the furtherance of the study of modern languages and literature at the University of Chicago. The group also wants to be instrumental in the maintaining and introducing of all those traditional values from the old world which could contribute to the best of the new world. The group will participate in the ceremony of laying the cornerstone of Wieboldt Hall on November 6. This University building will be dedicated to the study of modern languages, for which the Wieboldt Foundation contributed $500,000.</p>
   <p>The United German Group will co-operate with the Univertisy of Chicago, because the members of the group recognize that the University, being more <pb facs="5418474_1_0323.jpg" n="2"/>experienced, is better prepared to further the knowledge of the culture of their homelands. To the group belong outstanding Chicago representatives of Germanic nations who on many occasions have successfully solved problems seriously affecting the welfare of their people.</p>
   <p>The members of the representative committee of the United Germanic Group, all Chicagoans, are the following:</p>
   <p>Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, chairman; William A. Wieboldt, honorary chairman; Cornelius Teninga, secretary-treasurer.</p>
   <p>Danish: Dr. J. Christian Bay, S. T. Corydon, Dr. Max Henius, E. C. Bunck.</p>
   <p>Norwegian: Andrew Hummeland, Col. T. A. Siqueland, Judge Oscar M. Torrison, Birger Osland, John P. Hovland.</p>
   <p>Icelandic: Chester H. Thordarson. <pb facs="5418474_1_0324.jpg" n="3"/>German: Bernard DeVry, E. J. Kruetgen, A. F. W. Siebel, Max L. Teich, Henry Zander.</p>
   <p>Dutch: Judge Frederic H. De Young, D. C. Gordon, Dr. G. J. Hagens, Cornelius Teninga, John Vennema.</p>
   <p>Swedish: Henry S. Henschen, A. Lanquist, Honorable Edwin A. Olson, Charles S. Peterson, E. P. Strandberg.</p>
   <p>The University of Chicago is represented by its president, Dr. Max Mason, Philip S. Allen, Professor and acting chairman of the department of German language and literature; Professor Ferdinand Schevill, from the department of history, and Dr. H. Y. Atchison.</p>
   <p>Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, chairman of the main committee, today issued the following statement: "According to the U. S. census of 1920, fifty per cent of all Germans, Scandinavians, Dutch, and Flemish born abroad live in the twelve <pb facs="5418474_1_0325.jpg" n="4"/>states of the Middle West, of which the industrial and cultural center is Chicago. This fact is all the more remarkable as these twelve states contain only twenty-eight per cent of the total population of the United States.</p>
   <p>"Having realized that Chicago is close to being the true center of the bulk of the Germanic peoples, many far-sighted persons belonging to these races have for some time had the intention to take measures which would afford an insight into the literary, historical, and cultural values of the Germanic languages and literature, to emphasize the effects of such studies as a powerful factor in the fusion of all elements which make up American civilization.</p>
   <p>"The University of Chicago appears to have offered an excellent opportunity to these outstanding minds of which they should not fail to take advantage. It is the opportunity to serve as a medium for the presentation of the intrinsic values of Germanic civilization. <pb facs="5418474_1_0326.jpg" n="5"/>"The term 'Germanic' is in this sense a philologic one. As such it betokens the fact that the German, Scandinavian, and Dutch languages all have the same origin and that they went through developments which differ from other types of languages. They are, in a way, sisters and cousins.</p>
   <p>Although English is likewise a Germanic language, it is, in the nature of things, given so much attention in American schools and institutions that it must be dealt with in a separate department. Within the so-called modern group of languages there are also the Romance languages such as French, Italian, Spanish, etc.</p>
