   <p>The nativistic press expresses its jubilation in all the notes of the scale on account of the kicks which the mayor gave the Germans, and of late these news-mongers have become so rowdyish, that they now even demand the revocation of Robert Lindblom's appointment.</p>
   <p>Lindblom is a capricious chap, but the opinion prevails that he is friendly towards the German interests; has liberal, modern, progressive views, and, among the seven appointees, is the best, next to Halle. Therefore his, and of course Halle's, Keane's and Brenan's nominations should be confirmed, by all menas; the other three, Thornton, Cameron and Mrs. Sherman never!</p>
   <p>The Germans,and their friends, who believe in a modern education, must now place their sole hope and reliance on the City Council, after "their Carter" left them so dismally in the lurch. We must buckle down to a new school fight, at once and without delay! The men who formerly appealed to the Germans in order to have the German language taught in the private schools and found courageous response, should rally to the support of the dearly purchased privilege, now that its continuance is jeopardized in the public schools.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0508.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The people should volunteer and help out of gratitude, do it with alacrity and pleasure. It is time, that Chicago's Germans became aroused again and gave such "confidence men" as Carter H. a convincing and lasting reminder. If the appointments are sustained, then the dissenters will be safely afloat on the high tide and ere long we'll be in the same fix as the trusting, dumb St. Louis Germans, who found out that German instruction and gymnastics, which had been adopted there, in the public schools, after prolonged and weary efforts. were simply discontinued.</p>
   <p>The German population of Chicago can, if it is united, change this rout which Conniver Carter planned for them; Germanism may emerge victoriously. Of course, euphonious expressions of thanks don't help, (the editor refers to a precendent, translator.) but the Germans can exert pressure on the aldermen, at least on the majority of them, so that they will not dare to confirm the appointments of Cameron, Thornton and Mrs. Sherman. Carter H. Harrison can, thus, be compelled to select staunch advocators of a modern educational system.</p>
   <p>The aldermen can all be informed. They should be admonished, that the Germans will not support them at the polls if they ignore the wishes of the German population in an important matter, such as this!</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0509.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Could any one be more antagonistic towards Germanism than Charles Thornton? That he defended his prohibition ideas even at Democratic meetings, that he helped frustrate all the efforts of the Englewood and Hyde Park liberals who tried to abolish temperance, all this might be condoned. But Thornton is the father of the "anti-fad" fight; he commenced it at the County School Council, and therefore "our" Carter's official action appears so supremely pro-German! Thornton was barely elected to the County School Board, two years ago, when he declared his relentless war against Col. Parker and the Normal School.</p>
   <p>For many years Col. Parker was the only man among Chicago's prominent pedagogues, who had a definite goal and introduced the special branches at the Normal schools. He selected educators of progressive educational ideas from the seminaries; recently he added the well known German teacher of gymnastics, Kroh, and with the support of the Turners, (German Gymnastic Associations,) agitaged for the construction of a gymnasium.</p>
   <p>Only a few weeks ago he appeared as a speaker at the Central Music Hall, where he condemned the backwardness of the nativistic faction and their conceptions of educational principles. This Thornton showed virulent animosity against Parker and his pedagogical methods; he even demanded his dismissal, printed <pb facs="5418474_1_0510.jpg" n="4"/>derogatory circulars about him, instigated an investigation. This Thornton was chosen by Harrison - irrefutable evidence of the insincerity of his fawning pro-Germanism.</p>
   <p>And Cameron? He was that single Democrat who not only voted for the curtailment of the special branches, but wanted them thrown out altogether. Messrs. Halle, Stern and others, implored Harrison to protect the Germans from Cameron, and not to nominate him. He was appointed.</p>
