   <p>The sophisticated, who made the assertion that the study of German in our public schools should be eliminated, because of the fact that the great majority of the people are becoming of the futility of the same and that a general opposition against it exists, would do well to examine the reports of Dr. Zimmermann, the able director of German instruction. The following figures are sufficient evidence that these exceedingly wise men are mistaken. The interest in the teaching of German is not only diminishing, but on the contrary, is steadily increasing. Total number of pupils studying German 29,642. Total number of pupils in schools where instructions in German are given 57,000. Percentage of pupils studying German (exclusive of high schools) 32%. Pupils of German descent studying German, 13,248. Pupils of Anglo-American descent studying German 9,159. Pupils of other nationalities studying German 7,235. Number of schools where German is taught 129. Number of teachers of the German language 224. Increase in the number of schools teaching German since 1890, 26. Increase of teachers of German since 1890, 43. Increase in <pb facs="5418474_1_0624.jpg" n="2"/>the number of pupils studying German since 1890, 5,379.</p>
   <p>This is a very desirable result of which Dr. Zimmermann, as well as the Board of Directors, can be proud.</p>
