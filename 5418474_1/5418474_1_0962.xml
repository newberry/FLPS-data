   <p>His unwarranted complaisance encouraged Frank Hall to insist upon enforcement of the Sunday laws. Potter Palmer, owner of the Palmer House, must pay a twenty-dollar fine and costs, because he failed to heed the Sunday closing law. Hall threatens to have all saloon keepers arrested if their taverns are open for business next Sunday. Today's mass meeting of tavern owners, at Brand's Hall, may be of great significance, as it affects their future in this city.</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison concocted a nice mess for the taverns. His subservience to "Rev." Frank Hall [quotation marks appear as indicated, <pb facs="5418474_1_0963.jpg" n="2"/>Translator], of babbling music hall fame, encouraged the latter. Hall, it will be remembered, secured a subpoena against Potter Palmer, because the hotel proprietor permitted an infraction of the State's Sunday Closing Statute on January 6. Liquor was sold on the "Holy three Kings Day," and yesterday the case was argued before Justice of the Peace Everett, who assessed a twenty-dollar fine and nine dollars sixty-five cents in costs against the defendant. Frank Hall was so elated that he threatened to have all malefactors arrested and brought into court on Monday morning.</p>
   <p>Corporation Counsel Walker, in commenting on the case, said; "There is no reason why the law should not be enforced. It has always been regarded as sufficient to draw the shades of windows and not to keep the doors open. That is humbug. The law prohibits the sale of liquor on Sundays. It depends upon the incumbent administration just to what extent the statute is to be enforced. Were in Chicago no particular zeal has been shown at any time. We have a tremendous German population.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0964.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Germans like to bring their families to some respectable place on Sunday afternoons, where they can enjoy a glass of beer and good music. But the law is not concerned with that; what is applicable to one applies to all. Everett is only a Justice of the Peace; an appeal against his verdict would have to be entered in the Criminal Court."</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison was not at his office when the danger of Chicago's impending dryness became known. Police chief Kipley refused to comment on Everett's decision when questioned by reporters. He said, "I am not interested in the opinions of justices of the peace!"</p>
   <p>Frank Hall intends to hire twelve detectives next Sunday to help him secure evidence.</p>
   <p>A committee from the 18th Ward will see the Mayor.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0965.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The German tavern keepers must not fail to be at their scheduled mass meeting this afternoon, at Brand's Hall, at two o'clock. The resolutions may have a far reaching effect upon their business. If the saloons are closed on Sundays, then the tavern owners are confronted with a diminution of not less than fifty business days, without a corresponding reduction in license fees.</p>
