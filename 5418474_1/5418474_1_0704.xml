   <p>p. 8-2 The following is the substance of an editorial on the question of German in the public schools, printed in yesterday's Staats-Zeitung:</p>
   <p>"The School Board gave the German-speaking citizens of Chicago a very unexpected Christmas Eve gift, nothing less than the prospect of the banishment of the German language as a branch of instruction from the public schools. The thing, too, was done in an underhanded way. There had been no previous mention of the matter, either in the press or the proceedings of the School Board.</p>
   <p>"There was no direct proposition before them to accomplish this purpose. The matter under consideration was the fixing of the estimates for the coming school year. Suddenly, Mr. Stone moved that the salaries of the special teachers -teachers of German, drawing, and music - be put in only for the six months running from the 1st of January to the 1st of July; that is, to strike them out for the rest of the year.</p>
   <p>"The end and aim of this proposition was plain to the German members of the School Board who were present, and they spoke of this underhand method as it deserved...."</p>
