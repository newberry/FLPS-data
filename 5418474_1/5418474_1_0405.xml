   <p>Under the heading "A Neglected Heritage" the "Chicago Tribune", yesterday(Sunday), printed an article in which every German-American, or any immigrant possessing a foreign tongue, but, especially, the "Tribune", and its "cohorts" as well as the city School Board, should be interested. The editorial calls attention to the German Kaiser seeking to further a study of the English language, in every possible manner, and that the business circles of Germany fully appreciate the great usefulness of many languages, especially English, and act accordingly, and that consequently the study of English is pursued with great zeal. Indeed, not as an intellectual objective, maybe, but for a more practical purpose meant to endow the new generation against economic competition. Great Britain and the United States do not indicate that they estimate the worth of the knowledge of foreign languages in the business world.</p>
   <p>With this introduction the paper comes to the main issue stating: "The United States has a particular advantage in not being utilized. In this</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0406.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In this country are thousands of children whose parents are in command of a foreign language. In the public school the children learn only English, but are incompetent to express themselves fluently in their parent's language, or able to correspond properly in the same. All business organizations aiming for the expansion of American trade relations, should therefore, develop a corps of clerical help, capable of corresponding in two languages. Many foreign speaking nationalities are represented here, and one of the most valuable assets they have brought from their fatherland is negligently discarded."</p>
   <p>This shortsightedness has found support in the American press, and, alas, approval by the superintendents of Chicago Schools, and thus it happened that the instruction of German in the Chicago Schools took a backward step in the last few years. While at the same time it grew in importance; this being gradually and generally recognized. What a confession from a bright intellect!</p>
