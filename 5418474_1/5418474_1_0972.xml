   <p>Even the more strict members of the German-Lutherans will have nothing to do with prohibition. The recent conferences of different synods have demonstrated this attitude. The synod accepted a resolution which is, basically, a definite stand against political prohibition, and contains the following statements: "We as a church can not participate in the present ecclesiastic political temperance movement, because it does not discriminate between secular and ecclesiastical administration, but mixes them together. It is the duty of the secular government to prevent vice with lawful means, but it is the duty of the church to save men by faith in Christ from committing sin. However, there is another reason why the church does not identify itself with prohibition. The prohibition movement does not discriminate between proper use and abuse of the gifts of God. No gift of God can be condemned as such, but it is the abuse and misuse which is wrong and leads to corruption."</p>
   <p>The differentiation between moderate use and misuse is made very plain, and this is in accord with Luther's teachings who condemned drunkeness, but recommended the reasonable use of beer and wine.</p>
