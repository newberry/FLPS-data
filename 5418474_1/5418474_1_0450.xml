   <p>"Mr. Superintendent, does Edison speak German?" "No!" "Did Milton speak German?" "No!" This "highly intelligent" chat, took place yesterday, between Mr. Harris, the president of the School Board and Dr. Andrews, the superintendent of schools, at an open meeting of the School Board. These two men are at the helm of our school system, and due to the positions they hold, are expected to be an example to our youth. What a demonstration of their intelligence they exhibited at this meeting!</p>
   <p>This dialogue was the "counter argument" to the speeches, delivered by the members of the School Board, Messrs. Meier and Schwab and Dr. Stolz, in course of the debate, which followed the finance committee's announcement that a considerable reduction of the appropriation for German instruction in public schools is contemplated.... Mr. Chris. Meier, another member of the School Board, insisted that there should be no reduction for this branch of the educational system.... Mr. Meier said: "I consider it an injustice to limit the instruction in a branch of the educational system, which has been added, because its importance has been recognized.".... Another School Board member, defending <pb facs="5418474_1_0451.jpg" n="2"/>the German language, was Dr. Stolz who said that at this meeting he does not speak as a German nor as a representative of a German organization, but as a member of the School Board, who is convinced of the importance of German instruction.... A special meeting in this controversy will be held February 28th.</p>
