   <p>Dr. W. Whitney, the manager of the chemical division of the General Electric Company, is decidedly an adherent of instruction in the German language in American high schools. About the value of these instructions in regard to scientific research and literary pursuit in general. Dr. Whitney says: "The fact that we can continue to combat illness with serum and other similar modern developments we owe partly to the thorough work of German scientists, who set down the results of their research in epoch-making works. At the John Crerar Library of Chicago, the most extensive scientific library in the United States, about 30% of the entire number of books are German.</p>
   <p>At the library of the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research, the proportion of German books to English is two to one.</p>
   <p>At the library of our own research laboratories, the shelves are more than three eighths filled with German books. And even yet we make daily discoveries at the library, that many of the best articles and books of references remain inaccessible to young engineers, because of their ignorance of <pb facs="5418474_1_0328.jpg" n="2"/>the German language."</p>
   <p>The American scholar, Dr. Wheelock, says, "In studying the German language we find beauty, means to culture, and practical value."</p>
