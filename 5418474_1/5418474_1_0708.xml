   <p>The school board held a special session yesterday and the following members were present: P. A. Hoyne, president, and the inspectors: Stone, Vocke, Keith, Armstrong, Frake, Curran, and Delaney.</p>
   <p>The complaints of the citizens that the Wells Street school was in an unsanitary condition were referred to the committee on public buildings, likewise a report by the board of health on ventilation, sewers, and other conditions involving schools, and particularly the Scammon school.</p>
   <p>A lengthy debate ensued on appropriations for salaries of special teachers, involving instruction in German, music, and drawing. Board members English and Stiles wanted a detailed account of all appropriations granted for the special branches [German, music, drawing] to be submitted to the city council. Stone relinquished his chairmanship temporarily to Frake, and declared that he would <pb facs="5418474_1_0709.jpg" n="2"/>like to have German language instruction excluded from the public schools. Stiles remarked that he considered the request justified. Only recently General Lieb, an influential, highly respected German, said at a public meeting that German instruction in our public schools was a humbug, prompted by politics.</p>
   <p>Curran made a motion to give an estimate to the city council, and inform that body what the cost of each of the separate special subjects would be. The motion was accepted.</p>
   <p>Stone made a motion to eliminate the appropriation for German instruction. The motion was declared out of order.</p>
   <p>The report of the committee was submitted and considered. Stone made a motion to restrict appropriations for the salaries of special teachers to an amount sufficient to pay them for the current year. The motion was carried.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_1_0710.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>According to the aforesaid, no appropriations were made for German instruction, drawing, and music beyond the end of the school term, July, 1880.</p>
   <p>In favor of Stone's motion were: W. J. English, M. E. Stone, E. G. Keith, J. Frake, W. Curran, M. A. Delaney, and J. N. Stiles--seven.</p>
   <p>Opposed were: W. Vocke, A. C. Bartlett, E. Frankenthal, Hoyne, and Armstrong--five.</p>
   <p>Adjournment followed.</p>
