   <p>Only 200 tavern owners attended the meeting at Brand's Hall. Several speakers discussed the problem and defended their calling, claiming that saloon-keepers are better and more useful citizens than the Drys, that they pay the highest taxes, and that they intend to be heard should present ordinances be changed. Mayor Harrison's tavern bill was endorsed and a committee will confer with him. Thus far the Sunday question has not been officially considered by the Tavern-keepers Alliance.</p>
   <p>The mass-meeting of the Liquor-Dealers State Protective Association of Illinois, called at the instigation of the First district officials, at Brand's Hall, corner Clark and Erie Streets, was not as well attended, <pb facs="5418474_1_0959.jpg" n="2"/>nor did it proceed as enthusiastically, as might have been expected.</p>
   <p>Altogether there were about 200 tavern-keepers present, mostly Germans, when P. L. Wodack called the meeting to order. We declared that the present question, which originated again from the dry element and fanatics, required an answer. The saloon-keepers, who contribute so much to the City and Government, also have the right to be heard when changes are being contemplated that may affect their business.</p>
   <p>Messrs. M. R. Harris, August Mette, Joe Grein and Philip Koehler held lengthy speeches and asserted that most saloon-keepers have more dignity and honor and are undoubtedly better citizens than the Drys who regard the taverns as a public nuisance. Every respectable tavern owner endeavors to obey the law, although at times he is beset with considerable difficulties. For instance, it is well-nigh <pb facs="5418474_1_0960.jpg" n="3"/>impossible to avoid legal traps, such as the statute which prohibits the sale of intoxicants to chronic inebriates. And the law considers any man a drunkard who has been intoxicated four or five times within one or two years, a condition which is not readily discernible by looking at a person.</p>
   <p>It was emphasized that the city ordinances were succesful in abolishing so-called vice dens, for which no bona fide saloon-keeper could object. The law is restrictive. Only persons with unquestionable reputations can secure licenses. However, if it is proved subsequently that a saloon becomes the meeting place of a disorderly element, then the permit shall be revoked. Mayor Harrison can, within a few minutes, affix his signature to dozens of cancellation orders. It was a mistake that the booze joints which were open throughout the entire night, were not closed long ago. There were about fifty such places and their existence has been detrimental to the other five or six thousand. All ordinances which affect taverns <pb facs="5418474_1_0961.jpg" n="4"/>should be impartially enforced.</p>
   <p>The speakers stressed one point in particular, exhorting all tavern owners to become affiliated with their respective organizations, as only thereby will they be able to properly defend their cause.</p>
   <p>The Sunday question was not given official recognition, and the midnight closing ordinance received only casual attention. The gentlemen were content to accept a resolution by Joe Grein, wherein Mayor Harrison's proposed ordinance meets with general approval. The chairman appointed a committee which will visit Mayor Harrison, at ten O'clock Monday morning, to confer on the new rules. The results of the conference will be submitted to the Executive Board of the Saloon-Keepers Alliance.</p>
   <p>A mass meeting has been announced for Sunday evening in Austin.</p>
