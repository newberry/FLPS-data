   <p>The article of Last Saturday's Abendpost about the new projected Post Office Building has undoubtedly been published to interest the masses in one of the most imposing structures of its kind in the world. It is an admirable intention, since it is a suitable means to familiarize the American public with architecture, the greatest of the arts, about which our people do not seem to be informed at all. It appears that the Germans are leaders in this human endeavor, because in Germany large buildings are not erected without first obtaining a general opinion. Alas, it is their universal interest in art and science that prevents the creation of monumental box-like structures, so numerous here, and which are accredited with representing the non-existing American style.</p>
   <p>Naturally, in his antipathy to anything German, the American refrains <pb facs="5418474_1_0112.jpg" n="2"/>from according proper recognition to German architecture. He endeavors to copy the English and the French. This produces results which are styleless and have nothing in common with what is understood by the term "architecture." It is given the classification of American style, an irony to American architecture.</p>
   <p>The fundamentals of the art, silhouette, distribution of solids, distance, rhythm, and synthesis, are mute subjects in our high schools. [By "synthesis" he means the accepted, or traditional classical conceptions of beauty which predominate abroad]. These essentials were again ignored when this governmental structure was planned. As the illustration clearly shows, two railroad depots and the projected Post Office Building present a competing parade. The absolutely unsuitable, futile and, it appears to me, useless tower is not compatible with the mass-grouping,-depots and Post Office Building,-but separates all of it into three formless conglomerates, robs the work itself of uniformity and precludes a <pb facs="5418474_1_0113.jpg" n="3"/>symmetrical entirely.</p>
   <p>This immense and inspiring problem, a rare chance, indeed, should have been solved by a master, or through the advice of some connoisseur, if we wish to create a reputation for American architecture. Only recently Oberbaurat Professor Otto Wagner of Vienna ("Oberbaurat" means "supervisor of the Architects' Council"), well-known here as an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects, wrote to me how profoundly he regrets our undeveloped architecture. He is convinced that there is no land as suitable for the creation of individualistic edifices, and thereby cultural works of the present era, as America. Professor Wagner is undoubtedly correct, but he lacks a certain insight into our conditions. He is unaware of the way whereby such great assignments are awarded here and why they seldom, if ever, reach a gifted architect. Possibly, the trial might be made sometime to give this imposing task to a master, even if perchance he did not acquire his wisdom at the "Beaux Arts" but happens to be a bona fide genius. Such a decision would be highly favorable to our growing metropolis, which, with its present lack <pb facs="5418474_1_0114.jpg" n="4"/>of architectural gems, creates a poor impression. Frank Lloyd Wright and Sullivan were men of such caliber that the mighty solution could have been expected, and as I remember, even these Americans developed their talents in Germany. But that should not be a detriment!</p>
