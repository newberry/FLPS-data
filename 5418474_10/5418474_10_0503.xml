   <p>In spite of the cloudburst Saturday night, which preceded the celebration of the Constitution involving the Empire's Banner held at the Lincoln Turner Halle, it was well attended..... The Constitution celebration, which was under the musical leadership of Mr. Johnk, for past years has been enjoying the reputation of presenting a select program of German classical music, good speeches, etc. Therefore, it is attended by that class of people who seek satisfaction in a higher type of entertainment.... Mr. Fritz Bremer, president of the Empire's Banner in this country, welcomed the large audience heartily, among whom were guests from Elgin, Elmhurst, Geneva, Gary, and Hammond, Indiana. He spoke enthusiastically of the great celebration of the Constitution, involving the Empire's Banner, which was held this year in Coblenz on the Rhein, Germany.</p>
   <p>The speaker was confident that some day the Empire's flag, black, red, and gold, will fly over a united people of the German Empire, pledging themselves to the performance of duty and social justice. Thus, the proud <pb facs="5418474_10_0504.jpg" n="2"/>colors of 1848 may be raised again over a free and happy Germany. Mr. Bremer emphasized that the principles upon which that organization was founded must not be mistaken for an organization with political purposes. "Moreover," said he, "it has been established in order to help preserve the reverence for the flag, for the Constitution, and keep the Republic alive. And only a nation as the American nation, whose devotion for the Constitution and reverence for the flag is so pronounced, can appreciate our endeavor. None of us wish to establish a German republic in this United States!" exclaimed the speaker, for which he received a stormy applause. "To fulfill our duty toward America is our chief ambition. We wish to take active part in the building of the structure of social justice of this nation. Furthermore, we wish to promote peace among nations, firmly believing in a government representing the people. Therefore, I appeal to the friends of the German people, who believe in truth and the sublimity of republican ideals to join our movement." Mr. Bremer was loudly applauded at the conclusion of his address. This was significant of one thing only, the audience agreed with him.</p>

   <p>The Schleswig-Holstein Singing Society, was then heard in selections of German national songs of extraordinary beauty. The second part of the program was introduced with the playing of the "Empire's Banner March," which was followed by the overture to "Egmont." The next selection on the program was the recitation of "Constitution Day," "Still I like thee," and "Awake," the rendition of which Mr. Blassee was loudly acclaimed. Following a cello solo played by Mr. R. Haugan, was the festive address given by E. von Schroetter.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion, the audience stood at attention sang "Deutchland, Deutchland, uber Alles," and "The Star-Spangled Banner."</p>
   <p>The German consulate of Chicago was represented by Doctor Schaller, the German vice-Consul. He, too, delivered a short address, in which he pointed out the significance of Baron von Stein, referring to him as the Luther in political Germany.</p>
   <p>The interesting pamphlet issued by the Empire's Banner Organization of Chicago <pb facs="5418474_10_0506.jpg" n="4"/>disclosed that congratulatory dispatches from German political leaders have been received.</p>
