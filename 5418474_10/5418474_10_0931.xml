   <p>The one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Father Jahn, the founder of the German Turner societies, was celebrated by the Turners in this and the old country yesterday.</p>
   <p>The Turner societies continued to spread and increase in numbers even after his death, and in all countries wherever there resided a number of Germans Turner societies were started. There is hardly a prominent city or town in this country, which has not one or more of these societies. In this city there are four of them. The North Chicago Turngememele, the Vorwaerts Turner Society, the Aurora Turner Society, and the South Chicago Turner Society. The members of these societies showed their reverence for Father Jahn, yesterday, by great festivities at their respective halls. At the north side Turner Hall there was a grand concert, gymnastic exhibition by the pupils and speechmaking, followed by a ball.</p>
   <p>The Vorwaerts Turngenmeinde embraced this opportunity to lend eclat to the grand opening of its renovated hall on West Twelfth Street. There were speeches, beer and all kinds of amusements.</p>

   <p>The Aurora Turner Society had a grand time at its hall, corner of West Lake and Peoria Streets, during the afternoon, and in the evening the members participated in the festivities at the North Side Turner Hall.</p>
