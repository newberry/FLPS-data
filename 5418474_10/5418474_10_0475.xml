   <p>Tonight at 7 P.M. Section 28 of the G.U.V. celebrates its Christmas festival in both halls of the Lincoln Turnhalle, 1005 Diversey Parkway. Complying with a good old German custom, the main part of the festival is going to be the giving of presents to children--for is not Christmas time a special holiday of joy to all children! In addition, there is going to be a Christmas entertainment at which Hartwig's orchestra will supply the music, and the singing section will give Christmas carols. The carols on the list are "Stille Nacht" and Hymne an die Nacht".</p>
   <p>The section cordially invites all its members and friends, together with their friends, to come to this German Christmas celebration, and promises that the necessary refreshments will be taken care of to the best of its abilities.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0476.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>They will, as we have found out, be dispensed at cost. The celebration will wind up with a social evening and family ball. For the latter, Hartwig's orchestra will provide the music--hence, all guests may well anticipate beautiful and gay hours. The admission fee of thirty-five cents has been decided upon to give everyone the opportunity to take part in the festivities, and to celebrate Christmas once again. It is a holiday at which all troubling thoughts should be forgotten, and one should rejoice with the children, as one of them.</p>
