   <p>From June 24 until July 4, every night at 8 o'clock, a performance of a great military show will be given as a part of the George Washington Memorial celebration. The management of this arrangement in which the troops of the entire Sixth Army Corps will participate is in the hands of Major-General Frank Parker, Commander of the Sixth Army Corps. General Parker, who has requested the different national groups of Chicago to participate in these performances, has allotted Saturday, July 2, to the German-Austrian group.</p>
   <p>Last night at the offices of Attorney Otto F. Reich, chairman of the German National Committee for the George Washington festival, a discussion took place in which the following persons participated: Otto Reich, chairman; Frederick J. Haake, secretary; Mrs. Emma Eitel, Mrs. Anna Hanatchek, Frank Waldherr, A. C. Wehrwein, F. Brummond, Otto Schwark, A. W. Morton-Medenwald, and John Hep.</p>

   <p>Mr. Reich explained the purpose of the meeting, declaring that the Germans and Austro-Hungarians were again invited to participate at this military show. A similar invitation was made two years ago. Two display trucks will be placed at the disposal of the German-Austrian groups, and it will be up to them to decorate these trucks in a fitting manner. The predominant theme of each truck will be the representation of a special cultural contribution of the respective national groups.</p>
   <p>After detailed discussions and numerous propositions, a resolution was finally adopted in which further details in regard to decorations of the display trucks are to be left to the decision of a committee which consists of the following persons: Dr. Otto L. Schmidt, Anna Schoeller, Anna Hanatchek, Minnie Schmidt, Ernest Knutgen, and Paul H. Mueller. It was especially emphasized that the display truck had to accompany the parade every night, and that it should also be made distinguishable as contributions of German-Austrian groups.</p>
