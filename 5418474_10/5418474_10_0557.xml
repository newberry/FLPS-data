   <p>The German Veterans' Organization of Chicago, the oldest and largest of the local military organizations, holds its regular meetings on the first and third Sunday of every month, beginning at 2 P.M. At every second monthly meeting, there is a membership campaign, followed by family dances and other entertainment. New members may join at any meeting if they are in possession of their military papers.</p>
   <p>The German Veterans' Organization was founded in 1874, has considerable funds at its disposal, and is thus in a position to pay its members promptly for sick aid or funeral expenses. There are also other funds from which comrades can receive immediate help in times of need. The organization now has 300 members, two thirds of whom are veterans of the World War. They find here the best opportunity to associate with comrades. Their winter headquarters <pb facs="5418474_10_0558.jpg" n="2"/>are in the Lincoln Turner Hall, but in the summer in the gay Casino Restaurant of the beautiful and shadowy Riverview Park.</p>
   <p>The next meeting will take place on Sunday, April 18, at 2 P.M., in the Lincoln Turner Hall.</p>
