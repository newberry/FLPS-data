  <body>
   <p>Chicago differs from other world cities most strikingly because of its cosmopolitan character which is stamped upon it by the many nationalities within its population. The hundreds of thousands of immigrants have not been merged with the public in its entirety, but the individual nationalities form almost exclusive colonies in different parts of the city. All are growing continually due to the arrival of more European countrymen. The administration of the World's Fair is trying very hard to solve the problem of making the World's Fair a variegated, international affair in this city.</p>
   <p>Although only a few hundred foreigners will come to the World's Fair, we, nevertheless, could easily arrange a large international gathering, which would excel those at Constantinople if only a fraction of our own population of foreigners would dress in their national costumes and walk on the streets on certain days.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Times has made a thorough investigation regarding the different nationalities, and has published the extremely interesting results. The following list <pb facs="5418474_10_0119.jpg" n="2"/>of the nations represented here furnishes instructive information.</p>
   <p>We find in Chicago:</p>

   <p>These figures about the nationalities are taken from the index which secretary Stone published last year, and which are based upon the statistics of the census taken in 1890. Not included in this list are the immigrants who arrived in the interim, particularly those from Russia and Poland.</p>
   <p>The accuracy of Stone's calculations in regard to the number of American born persons living in Chicago is doubted by many. Likewise the number of Irishmen is listed too high, but there is no doubt that the German population is at least 300,000 strong. The North side is generally considered as the chief residential district of the Germans. Here we find German poets and artists immortalized by the respective names of streets. Here also we find German churches such as the St. Jacob's, St. Joseph's, St. Paul's, St. Jacobi's and others. One may go from one store to another, everywhere German is spoken. There are few disturbances. All are peace-loving, industrious, and clean, in short, it is a German neighborhood.</p>
   <p>In some districts on the North side, as for instance, on Franklin, Market and other streets the Irish element is noticeable. Nine-tenths of the people of the old 19th Ward are from the Emerald Isle. However, the chief residential district of the <pb facs="5418474_10_0121.jpg" n="4"/>Irish is now on the West side. Milwaukee Avenue beginning at Ohio Street and going north west is essentially a German business section. There are also other neighborhoods which could be designated as German colonies. Later we will enter into this matter of German population more deeply.</p>
   <p>The numerically largest colony - the Poles - we find on Milwaukee Avenue and Noble Street. The Swedes we find at East Chicago Ave, and on some side streets west of Wells, as well as on Division Street, west of Sedgewick and on Orchard, Willow, and Clybourn Avenue.</p>
   <p>Russians are chiefly located at Canal and Clinton Streets. In South Chicago a Dutch colony is developing rapidly. The workers in the iron foundries there are nearly all Dutchmen.</p>
