   <p>The jubilee of yesterday was one that would not but excite the most enthusiastic admiration of all that witnessed its intricate picturesque but harmonious details. Aside from the stimulus given to the exertions of the master minds, who were responsible for its arrangements, by the fact that they were citizens of Chicago, the conditions of its success were dependent on its Germanic associations. The German mind is peculiarly constituted to bring out the most striking features of the show and pomp on a festival day, and to enjoy the pleasures of its parade and social abandon.</p>
   <p>For a number of weeks the German mind of Chicago has been severely agitated over the grave question of the celebration which transpired on yesterday with so much eclat. Societies have discussed the question mightly, while individuals have been harrowed with anxiety concerning their respective appearance on the great occasion. Committees have been assiduously engaged raising funds, and for once this usually unpleasant task has been rendered comparatively agreeable by the willingness of all to contribute. The preparations, in accordance with the general enthusiasm were on the most extravagant scale. The property rooms of the various theatres were ransacked for costumes, and even many, doubting the resources of this city, sent to New York for their apparel.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0947.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On Sunday night all the arrangements were completed, and it only remained to hope for a pleasant day.</p>
   <p>Not only by the Germans but by people of all nationalities was the day observed as a holiday. The banks and most of the prominent wholesale houses were closed throughout. The board of trade held no session, and although it was expected that the open board would convene, but few of the bulls and bears were on hand. The postoffice was closed part of the day, and in fact business was generally suspended.---</p>
   <p>At the northwest corner of the courthouse a large platform had been erected by the committee of arrangements, for their own benefit and for invited guests. The courthouse itself had been put in order also. The stars and stripes floated proudly from the dome, and the red, white, blue, and yellow mingled harmoniously at every projecting angle of the old pile, and being public property, delegations from Kankakee and Calumet took entire possession of the windows in the hall and other favorable places for observation, as they had a right to do.</p>

   <p>The procession was timed at this point, and was found to be just three hours in passing, which would indicate a length of about five miles. If South Clark was demonstrative North Clark was trebly so. Berlin itself could hardly have done more handsomely by the victorious comquerors of France than did North Clark by the footsore veterans of a day's campaign.</p>
   <p>But after all North Clark street was not a unit. The Fremad, whose office is just across the bridge, displayed its banner at half-mast in token of the suffering of the Danes at the Prussians hands.</p>
