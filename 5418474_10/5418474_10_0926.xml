   <p>The newly founded "Bavaria Verein" held yesterday afternoon, at Steinmuller's Halle, 45 North Clark Street, a very well attended meeting, which was presided by its president. The fact, that a large crowd gathered at this meeting, is proof enough, what great interest the Bavarians, living in this country take, in establishing a Societyof their own. After an excellent address, which was received by stormy applause, Dr. Etolina, for many years a citizen of Chicago, was made an honorary member of the Society.</p>
   <p>Steinmuller's Halle, was chosen as the Society's headquarters until May 1st, 1881, with regular meetings every first and third Friday of each month. Captain George M. Miller and Lieutenant Baus, both members of the Society, asked permission to collect donations for the purchase of a Bavarian and an American flag. A committee was then appointed, which was entrusted with the arrangements of an entertainment, in the near future.</p>
