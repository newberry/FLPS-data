   <p>Pastor Adolph Korell, M. D. R., speaks at celebration of the German Club. Almost too beautiful was the opening of the winter season of the German Club, the program so copious, that Mr. Otto F. Reich had to postpone his illustrated travelogue on Germany until the next meeting. The attendance was very good, filling the Cameo Room of the Morrison Hotel, and many beautiful heartstirring things were said. For the first time in the Club's history, the former presidents of the Club were honored.</p>
   <p>"One year ago, Dr. Hugo Eckener, Navigator of the Zeppelin, was our guest," said President Giebel, welcoming those present, "today there are members of the German Parliament. And when the German members of the interparliamentarian congress in Washington appear Monday evening at the Germania Club, we want to show them, of what the German-American element <pb facs="5418474_10_0574.jpg" n="2"/>of Chicago, consists. For that reason everybody should participate in the reception and the banquet following it." The speaker rendered great praise to the former presidents of the Club stating, that they could, without prejudice and with their experience, promote the Club's interest to better advantage than anybody else and that they were always willing to assist with advice and deed. He then presented the gentlemen. Only Mr. Henry Zander was absent, having accompanied his ailing wife on a recreation trip, but he sent his best regards to all. He pointed out that the Club proved its loyalty during the war, by placing twenty-eight million dollars worth of liberty bonds and procuring 1,038 members for the Red Cross. At that time Mr. Zander was the president of the Club. Mr. Oscar A. Kropf, the first president, from 1913 to 1916, quoted Goethe: "The eternal feminine draws us," and by that he complimented the many ladies present. "The ideas which hovered before us, when we founded the Club," he said, "and I can see only Wm. Rochmann Schmidt and our old and good friend John Traeger, of all the founders - was to give the German element the same position, which other nationalities enjoy. The German instruction <pb facs="5418474_10_0575.jpg" n="3"/>has the same claim in the public schools, as that of any other cultural language. We therefore desire to create an organization, which will weld the German element, not through the force of language, but through the ties of blood. Therefore we ask as one condition of admission only the proof of German descent. We should be just as powerful, as any other nationality in regard to American citizenship, not only in regard to duties, but also in those of rights. We of German blood can be proud of our ancestors, and no matter what unpleasantness happened during the last years, we as loyal citizens of this country are proud of our Germanism. Only recently President Coolidge stated in his Omaha speech, that the time of race hatred and prejudice has passed, that the spirit of reconciliation must march through the country, so that the races can recover. We had our wars with England, and in spite of that, we did not kill the English language. Therefore we want to hold high German literature, German philosophy, the German art of centuries, and cultivate German ideals not as separate elements, but as full fledged Americans, and with German industriousness. German honesty and German progress show a great example to the other elements, through working together for the benefit of the country, for which our ancestors and our youth have fought.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0576.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The German In Public Offices.</p>
   <p>Mr. Wm. Rothmann complained that the German element takes very little part in the administration of state, city and country. Only a few like Edward Litsinger, Judge Brentano Charles Dieters, Arthur Lueder and a few more represent the German element in public life, while one-third of the city's population is of German blood. The Club should promote the election of qualified representatives of the German elements of which there is no dearth. And to such he pledges his support.</p>
   <p>Mr. John F. Voight described the history of the German elements in the United States. A German scholar gave the name of the true discoverer of America, Americus Vespucci, to the country, and a few days ago Columbus was celebrated as the discoverer. The strong German preponderance in Washington's body guard, Germantown, and Pastorius were quoted by the speaker.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0577.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The first declaration of independence originated in Germantown. More than 200,000 Germans fought in the ranks of the Northern Army in 1861 to 1865, a larger percentage than furnished by any other element of the population. More than 500 officers were of high rank. And in the last war, the German element, although with a bleeding heart, proved its attachment. It is characteristic that the German, wherever he settles, roots deeply. And so should it be here also; but the German Club, instead of 3,000 members, ought to have thirty thousand, because in that case it could accomplish something really useful, to the benefit of the city, which is bound to become the largest of the country. And the German element has a great share in it.</p>
