   <p>The summer festival of the Allied Austro-Hungarian Clubs of North America, Chicago Alliance, was given at Harms Park. It has been highly successful, due in a great measure to the favorable weather. An auto parade, comprising more than a hundred festively decorated cars, started from Dayton Street and North Avenue. Members of the Club, representatives of other German associations of Chicago, and businessmen of the North and Northwest side were present. Festival marshal Charles Heck did justice to his calling, and with proper circumspection, led his followers safely through the streets of the North side to Harms Park. Many a jovial greeting was exchanged with the throngs on the sidewalk, where occasional acquaintances <pb facs="5418474_10_0606.jpg" n="2"/>could be recognized.</p>
   <p>When the participants arrived at their destination, a social, festive spirit soon asserted itself, becoming considerably intensified by an addition of four hundred singing, flag waving guests from Milwaukee. They were members of five Austro-Hungarian clubs who came by special train to join in the festivities....[The names of six Milwaukee German organizations are listed. Translator].</p>
   <p>Chicago was represented by members of nineteen organizations. As Alliance president, Doctor T. W. Kobalter, declared in his festival speech that it represented a brotherly union, not only of Chicago, but of Milwaukee's clubs as well. The festivities then became synonimous of a German-American day, in every respect.</p>

   <p>Ample entertainment was provided, splendid in every particular. Young and old found amusement at the Vienna Prater, a faultless replica beyond criticism. Slides and a merry-go-round proved very attractive; also arrangements had been made whereby Fortuna could be tempted with a nickel, and other kindred pleasant diversions to regale all. Exceptional liveliness prevailed at the dance hall, where couples stopped only long enough during intermissions to strengthen themselves with refreshments for the next round....</p>
   <p>As members of singing societies were present, festive melodies were not lacking, and thus one heard the last song, and had the final dance until the stars twinkled in the sky....</p>
