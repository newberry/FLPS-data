   <p>The meeting which had been called for Saturday evening, by the German Lutherans to the Central Music Hall, resulted in a real triumph for Judge Altgeld. It was quite evident on which side the German Lutherans will be found in the coming elections. The heads of nearly all the Lutheran Parishes of Chicago and suburbs, were present and their members appeared in such numbers that no seat was unoccupied. Mr. T. G. Diener, proprietor of a stone masonary, was Chairman and welcomed the public. He then introduced Mr. William Herzberger as the first speaker. He outlined the history of the country in an effective speech and said, that there was always a party, which tried to suppress the liberty given by the Constitution and change the population of the country according to a puritanical and capricious system. This party at present makes all possible endeavors to achieve their object and therefore the greatest caution is necessary for all freedom loving citizens. Judge Altgeld was the next speaker. He spoke about the Edwards Law and the very ambigious position of the Republicans on the repeal of part of same. He pointed out that, it would be necessary not only to elect a Democratic Governor but also a Democratic legislature to bring about a thorough reform.</p>
