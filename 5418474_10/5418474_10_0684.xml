   <p>The administrative council in charge of the Veterans Relief Fund created on Jan. 18, 1911, will hold its annual festivity at the Northside Turn hall on Thursday, Jan. 20, to commemorate the founding of the German Empire 45 years ago. The entire net proceeds will be used to augment the relief fund which has been created for the benefit of the local destitute veterans of Germany's significant period, the years 1864, 1866, and 1870-71. Nearly all of the 160 veterans living here, excluding the injured, were in France on that memorable day, Jan. 18, 1871, when the German Empire was founded in the Royal Palace at Versailles. [Explanatory - We Americans call it the "the Palace," but the German newspaper uses the term "castle," which is probably more appropriate, as this building was formerly a fortress. Transl.]</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0685.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Many of the men were already members of the older contingents at that time, and now, unfortunately, about one fourth are in dire distress through no fault of their own, suffering from relapse and ailments attributable to advanced age. [This sentence refers to the "Land-wehrleute" or "Home-defense men," old men used for reserves during the Franco-German war of 1870-71.]</p>
   <p>Let us hope that Chicago's Germanity will, at least on this day, not forget the German veterans who have been in our midst for the last forty years.</p>
   <p>The program will be: Address by Professor Scherger, of the Armour Institute; a cappella singing by the twenty-three United Male Choral <pb facs="5418474_10_0686.jpg" n="3"/>Clubs of Chicago, under the leadership of Karl Reckzeh; concert by M. Ballmann's entire orchestra; marble groups (impersonated) by the Active Division of the Chicago Turngemeinde (gymnast community, in this sense comprises several clubs. Trans.); Large, animated picture: Deference to the German Emperor and the Emperor and King of Austria-Hungary, Franz Joseph, soldiers of various nations. In the background, George Washington and the Angel of Peace. [The article, in reference to the German Emperor, does not state whether the present ruler is meant or the crowning of the Emperor in 1871. Trans.]</p>
   <p>Finale: Imposing theatrical production, "The Siege of Warschau," by Ullrich Haupt. The actors of the German Theater will cooperate, as well as the Song Divisions of the German Veterans Association of <pb facs="5418474_10_0687.jpg" n="4"/>Chicago and many former soldiers, all in the regular grey field uniforms. Trenches and other realistic displays, etc.</p>
   <p>Admission 50 cts. No dancing.</p>
