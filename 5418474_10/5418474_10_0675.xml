   <p>All necessary preparations for the forthcoming festivities to be held under the auspices of the Veteran's Central Association, an alliance of all the German Veteran Clubs of Chicago and vicinity, have been completed. In the impending program, particular stress has been laid on quality, and all present will have the satisfaction of having spent an enjoyable evening. Particular attention is called to the financial angle of the celebration: the entire surplus will be given to the German and Austro-Hungarian Aid Society.</p>
   <p>To quote from the festival announcement: "For this reason, and in the interests of the wounded, the widows, and orphans, we beseech you to <pb facs="5418474_10_0676.jpg" n="2"/>appear in full numbers. What genuine German heart does not pulsate faster and more vigorously on the recurrence of the day when Emperor William II entered the world? This sentiment does not only prevail in the German homeland, but manifests itself throughout the earth, and particularly in America. With all due respect to the United States, the Emperor's birthday will be celebrated next Thursday, at Schoenhofen's Hall, Milwaukee and Ashland Avenues, at 8 P. M. German soldiers will acclaim this event with intense enthusiasm, especially now when Germany maintains its victorious position, although surrounded by a world of enemies. All participants are requested to start at the appointed time. Tables will be reserved for clubs in corpore, provided the latter are punctual. If some clubs not previously listed with us desire to be present, then kindly notify our secretary, Otto Dietz, 410-420 N. Western Ave."</p>
