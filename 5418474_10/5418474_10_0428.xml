  <body>
   <p>Last Monday, under the chairmanship of Frau Elizabeth Vavrinek, the annual meeting of the Ladies' Aid Society of the German Day Organization was held, and officers were elected. There were present, as guests of honor, Herr Gustav A. Brand, the re-elected president of the German Day Organization, and the newly elected vice-president, Herr Frank K. Waldherr. Herr Brand thanked the ladies for their fine co-operation that made for success in the recent German Day celebration. He encouraged the Ladies' Aid Society to continue their work with renewed vigor and energy in preparing for the success of German Day in 1935.</p>
   <p>The officers then individually made their reports, all of which were favorable. The president, Frau Vavrinek, in her detailed report, at first spoke of the foundation and organization of the Ladies' Aid Society; she recalled to memory the sacrifices the ladies made last year for the success of German Day, and she concluded with the earnest request (which was directed, not only to those <pb facs="5418474_10_0429.jpg" n="2"/>present, but to all German women) that all contribute their share to make the coming German Day an even greater success.</p>
   <p>The following officers were elected for the coming year: Frau Elizabeth Vavrinek, president; Frau Lena Schoenstedt, vice-president; Dr. Helen Dugdale, second vice-president; Frau Susan Andree, corresponding secretary; Frau Barbara Edinger, treasurer; Frau Lillian Rapp and Frau Anna Richter, chairmen of the entertainment committee; Frau Anna Hanatschek, chairman of the program committee; Frau Paula Hutter, chairman of the publicity committee.</p>
