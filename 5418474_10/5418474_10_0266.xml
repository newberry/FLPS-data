   <p>It has been well known that for some time the German Lutheran societies of Chicago have been engaged in the preparation of a bill for the radical amendment of the present Compulsory School Law.</p>
   <p>This measure was received here today and will be introduced in the Senate tomorrow by Senator Knopf. The bill was first tendered to Senator Humphrey of the Seventh District by the German Lutheran committee of his district, but he deemed it too radical in its amendments and declined to become its sponsor.</p>
   <p>Senator Humphrey was opposed by a considerable number of Lutherans of his district, last fall, on account of his views and his former vote for the Compulsory School Law, and he thinks the amendments to the present law should be slight indeed; and rather of a verbal than a repealing character. The bill which Senator Knopf will introduce is as follows:</p>
   <p>An act concerning the compulsory education of children.</p>
   <p>Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the people of the State of Illinois represented in the General Assembly, that every parent, guardian, or person having under his control a <pb facs="5418474_10_0267.jpg" n="2"/>child between the ages of seven and fourteen years shall annually cause such child to attend for at least sixteen weeks, during each year, such public or private day school as may be selected by the parents or guardian. For every neglect of such duty the person offending shall forfeit to the use of the public schools of the city or district in which he resides, a sum not less than $1 nor more than $20, and shall stand committed until such fine and costs of suit are paid. But if the person neglecting to send his child to some public or private day school shall show that instruction has otherwise been given during the year for a like period of time to such child, or that his physical or mental condition, as declared by a competent physician, is such as to render such attendance inexpedient or impracticable, or if other good and reasonable cause be shown; then such penalty shall not be incurred. Such a fine shall be paid when collected to the school treasurer of such city or township, to be accounted for by him as other school money raised for school purposes.</p>
   <p>The certificate of the superintendent or principal of a private or public school that the child is attending, or has for at least sixteen weeks during the current year attended, shall be first hand evidence of such facts. Any superintendent or principal of a school who, with intent to evade the provisions of this act, shall make a wilful false statement concerning the time any child has attended the school under his charge <pb facs="5418474_10_0268.jpg" n="3"/>shall be fined for such offense not less than $3 or not more than $20, for the use of the public schools of the city or the district in which the school under his charge is situated.</p>
   <p>Sec. 2. It shall be the duty of the Board of Education in every city, of the Board of School Directors in every school district to appoint one or more officers, whose duty it shall be to carefully inquire concerning all supposed violations of this act, and to enter complaint against all persons who shall be guilty of such violation. It shall also be the duty of said officers to arrest children of a school going age who habitually haunt public places, and also truant children who absent themselves from school without leave, and to place each child thus arrested in charge of the parent, guardian, or other persons having charge of said child, and that said parent, guardian, or persons having the right to control such child shall designate the school which he desires such child to attend. Where the parent, guardian, or person having control of a child shall refuse to designate any particular school, or in case such child has not parent, guardian, or person in control, then the truant officer shall take such child to the public school situated in the district where such child lives or to such public school as the Board may direct. Said truant officer shall have such compensation for services rendered, under this act, as shall be determined by <pb facs="5418474_10_0269.jpg" n="4"/>the Board of Education, or the Board of Directors, appointing such officer, which compensation be paid from the distributable school fund.</p>
   <p>Sec. 3. Any person having control of a child who, with intent to evade the provision of this act, shall make a wilful false statement concerning the age of such child, or the time such child has attended school, shall for such offense forfeit a sum of not less than $3 nor more than $20 for the use of the public school fund of the city or district in which he resides.</p>
   <p>Sec. 4. Prosecution under this act shall be instituted and carried out by the authorities of such boards, and be brought in the name of the people of the State of Illinois for the use of the school fund of the said city or township.</p>
   <p>Sec. 5. Police, municipal courts, justices of the peace, and judges of the County Court shall have jurisdiction within their respective counties of the offenses described in this act.</p>
   <p>Sec. 6. Any truant officer, who shall wilfully neglect or without due inquiries arrest any child or children that have complied or are complying with the provisions of <pb facs="5418474_10_0270.jpg" n="5"/>this act, or that are excused from attendance under the provisions of Sec. 1, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be fined not less than $5 nor more than $25. Such a fine may be recovered by information, complaint, or indictment, or other appropriate remedy in any court of competent jurisdiction, and when recovered shall be paid in to the school fund of the city or township in which he was appointed.</p>
   <p>Sec. 7. An act concerning the education of children, approved May 24, 1889, in force July 1889, and all other acts and parts of acts inconsistent with the provisions of this act are hereby repealed.</p>
