   <p>A social gathering was held in honor of Oscar Sputh, teacher of gymnastics, last night at the Vorwarts Turner Hall. Mr. Sputh received a golden diploma on the occasion of being a member of the American Union of Turners for 50 years.</p>
   <p>At the gathering, which was arranged by the Vorwarts Turn Verein, representatives of different clubs and societies, all the old friends of Oscar Sputh, and the first speaker of the Illinois Turner Section, Leopold Saltiel, were present. The first speaker, Theodore Gross, honored the merits of the turner, Oscar Sputh, who took the greatest interest in turner affairs. The services which he rendered were important in the history of gymnastics in Chicago, and are closely connected with its development. In the name of the Vorwarts Turn Verein, he congratulated the honored guest and presented him with the golden diploma of the Turner Union.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sputh thanked him in a stirring speech and accepted the congratulations of all present. Then a letter was read from Dr. Carl Sputh, his oldest son, and the consulting physician at the Gymnastic Teachers Seminary of Indianapolis.</p>

   <p>Besides his wife three daughters and two sons-in-law attended the celebration.</p>
   <p>Leopold Saltiel delivered the congratulations of all gymnasts of the district, and thanked Mr. Sputh for his self sacrificing activity for the gymnastic exercises. Mr. Saltiel expressed hope that Turner Sputh might be in the position for many years yet to place his experiences and services at the disposition of the Vorwarts Turn-Verein and the Illinois district.</p>
   <p>Several other turners spoke and, in humorous speeches referred to the years of their youth, when they received their first gymnastic instructions from teacher Oscar Sputh. Teachers Lautenbach, and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn mentioned the honors won by Mr. Sputh at the athletic sports of 1889 in Cincinnati, and praised him as a true adviser of all young gymnastic instructors, whom he had supported with word and action. Turners Emil Petri and Sonnenleitner, who are already in possession of Golden diplomas, welcomed Oscar Sputh as a new member in their midst.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Klefs and husband entertained the guests with piano and song recitals.</p>
