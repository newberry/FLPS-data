   <p>The arrangements for the celebration of the hundredth birthday of one of the greatest German poets, Fritz Reuter, were made by the "Low German Guilds" of Chicago. The celebration was ushered in most thoughtfully and ingeniously. About 500 members assembled in spite of inclement weather at Western Avenue and Division Street and marched with music to the Reuter Monument in Humboldt Park, where they placed a wreath. The music played a national tune, producing a patriotic frame of mind. It was the ideal of a United Germany, which was responsible that the youthful enthusiastic student, Fritz Reuter, was sentenced to death for high treason, with many other noble youths. This sentence was changed to seven years in prison, which young Reuter had to endure, and which caused such a decided change in his later life.</p>
   <p>A glee club recited, "This is the Day of the Lord." Mr. H. Mueller of the Low-German Guilds, gave a splendid address. He portrayed with deeply moving words the life and deeds of the poet. Again the band <pb facs="5418474_10_1183.jpg" n="2"/>played and the celebration of the forenoon came to a fitting close.</p>
   <p>The second part of the program was carried out during the afternoon and evening in the beautifully decorated large hall of the northside gymnasium. The large hall and the gallery were early filled to the last seat. Among those present prevailed a solemn mood. Indeed, it was a gathering of true friends of Reuter, who knew their poet well from his works.</p>
   <p>Under the direction of Ballmann his guest artist rendered the jubilee-Overture by Weber. In the name of the Low German Guilds, Mr. Linnemeyer welcomed the guests in the Low-German dialect. A prologue, composed by M. Drescher, was exceedingly well declaimed by Mrs. A. Strey. One of the most lovely poems by Reuter "Da Wedd," was splendidly recited by Mr. Linnemeyer. The evening celebration ws introduced with "Lohengrin" by P. Wagner. Reuter and Wagner had been good friends. Deeply enjoyed by all was the song, "Spring On the Rhine," which was <pb facs="5418474_10_1184.jpg" n="3"/>sung by Schiller's Glee Club under the able direction of H. Biedermann.</p>
   <p>The official speech, given by Edna Fern, was greatly enhanced through the showing of 42 beautiful pictures in slides taken from Reuter's life. A number of national and folk-songs were rendered by the orchestra. The play, "Departure of Hanne Nuetes", followed; the performers were mostly members of the guilds.</p>
   <p>To portray to the spectators the genius of the great poet, Fritz Reuter and all those with whom he so often associated, was attempted in the final play of the eveining. The first day of the festival ended with a merry ball.</p>
   <p>The program for the 2nd day was arranged as follows:- Coronation March from "The Prophet." Light Cavalry, Overture. Address of Welcome, by <pb facs="5418474_10_1185.jpg" n="4"/>Mr. C. Tarchow; "Fascinations of the Night" by the Sennefelder. "The Mill in the Forest" by the orchestra. "At the Rhine and and With Wine." Solo. "Baby Parade," Ballmann's Orchestra. "My Dream" Sennefelder. "Night in Berlin", Ballmann's Orchestra. "Marshal Blucher in Teterow" by F. Reuter.</p>
   <p>Another ball will bring to a close the second day of the festival.</p>
