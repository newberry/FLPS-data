   <p>"At least 26% of the American population is of German extraction, and what these 26% have, and still will accomplish in the brilliant development of the American nation, cannot be adequately expressed."</p>
   <p>These words of appreciation for the German element in America were uttered by Governor F. R. Zimmerman of Wisconsin, and American of German extraction. He spoke at the first luncheon of the German Club at the Morrison Hotel, yesterday afternoon, and was loudly applauded by four hundred fifty attentive listeners.</p>
   <p>Governor Zimmerman who, according to his own words, is of Swabian descent through his father, and of Bavarian descent through his mother, spoke particularly on the history of German immigration in <pb facs="5418474_10_0548.jpg" n="2"/>America. He eulogized all the great Germans such as Carl Schurz, Franz Sigel, Robert and Peter Muhlenberg, Baron Von Steuben and others whose lives are entwined with the history of the United States. The speaker received a stormy applause.</p>
   <p>Michael F. Girten, president of the German Club, also the Austrian Consul General, presided at the luncheon. A musical trio under the leadership of Otto G. Beyer, and the Apollo Quartet, offered a splendid entertainment.</p>
