<title level="a">REVEREND HERZBERGER TAKES UP BATTLE AGAINST NATIVISTS AND PROTESTS AGAINST PERSECUTION OF CATHOLICS.</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The election is past, and the enemy against whom the Germans fought is defeated. It is quiet again every where, and politics are left to the politicians. However, a large theater was filled Monday night to listen to a political speech.</p>
   <p>Rev. F. W. Herzberger, the famous Lutheran clergyman, spoke on the subject, "The School Question from the Constitutional Point of View." Undoubtedly, the reputation of this eminent speaker attracted the astoundingly large audience to the hall at this time...</p>
   <p>If something good was achieved in the recent straggle it was the fact that for the first time the nature, the activities, and the methods of the nativistic societies became obvious to their full extent, and the danger of all this was recognized. Another favorable result of the recent battle was, that opposing factions were united against a common enemy...</p>
   <p>"I appear today as a defendant," the speaker stated. "They have accused <pb facs="5418474_10_0111.jpg" n="2"/>me and my friends of being opposed to compulsory school attendance and to the English language. We are also blamed for stirring up race prejudice, and for having sold out at the election. The last accusation is so contemptible that I deem it unworthy of a reply. I am a Lutheran and an American. I am fond of my country and my church, and when either is in danger, gold is not necessary to induce me to defend them.</p>
   <p>"They accuse me of interfering with politics, as a clergyman. Has any one heard me, or any other Lutheran minister, say anything about tariff? But have we not constitutional rights to defend our parochial schools?"</p>
   <p>The speaker continued then to prove that neither the Lutherans nor the Germans in general are against compulsory school attendance, or against instruction in English, or against our public school system. They maintain parochial schools because their children receive more efficient instructions in English and German, and, at the same time, they are instructed in religion...</p>
   <p>"Such secret political societies - I emphasize, political societies - as the 'Patriotic Sons of America' and similar ones, have ruined the Republican party... They say, 'America for the Americans!' Are they, perchance, the <pb facs="5418474_10_0112.jpg" n="3"/>original Americans? We also are opposed to immigration of paupers, but industrious and able immigrants should always be welcome.</p>
   <p>"These nativists want to protect the little red school house. Has our government become so weak, that it needs these patriotic (?) Pinkertons to protect our schools? 'We only want one language,' they say; but have not our forefathers declared that this country shall be a haven for the oppressed of all countries and tongues?</p>
   <p>"Nativists assert also that they want to protect this country against Roman Catholicism. Of course, I am a Lutheran, and in my church I preach against Rome. But as a Lutheran, as an American citizen. I protest against such societies, because they persecute good, loyal citizens for being Catholics. The constitution says very clearly, 'No religious test shall ever be required....'</p>
   <p>"When our forefathers fought for liberty, they did not gather in secret societies, but they stood up like men. During my youth the American people did not know any secret societies with such ugly intentions. When the soldiers marched through the little town in Ohio, where my parents lived, <pb facs="5418474_10_0113.jpg" n="4"/>they were not Lutherans, Catholics, Irishmen or Dutchmen, but American soldiers, marching to the battlefields. When my father returned from the battlefield, dying, he was not the Dutch-Lutheran minister, but the American chaplain. Neither did we celebrate the victory as Lutherans, Catholics, Irishmen, or Germans, but as Americans.</p>
   <p>"'A house divided against itself can not stand.' Come on, men! Take a stand again upon the constitution, and declare anew that all men are born free and equal!"</p>
