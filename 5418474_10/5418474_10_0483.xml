   <p>District 335 of the German Aid Bund celebrated, last Saturday night, the twenty-fifth anniversary of its existence. Numerous members and friends participated. It took place at the Lincoln Hall. The festival committee, ably presided over by Frank Waldherr as president and by James J. Heidy as secretary, made all preparations in an excellent manner. A ball brought the affair to a successful close.</p>
   <p>The musical part of the program was taken over by Joseph Brauneker's orchestra and by the singing section of the German Aid Bund. They took care of their part of the program to the satisfaction of all. The orchestra played a number of marches with the same perfection as they played selections from operas and operettas. The singing section gave the songs "Kroent den Tag" <pb facs="5418474_10_0484.jpg" n="2"/>and "Schoen ist die Jugend," under the able direction of Ludwig Lohmiller. Their selections were well received.</p>
   <p>The president of the festival, Waldherr, welcomed the guests in the name of District 335 with words coming from the heart, and thanked them for the large attendance. It was proof that the appeal for co-operation was not made in vain. In the name of the district which gave the festival, the chairman gave assurance that the members have not forgotten it, and that on the next occasion they will repay favors with favors.</p>
   <p>A telegram of congratulation came from Mayor Cermak.</p>
   <p>The main address was given by Chief President Ernst Herklotz who came from Pittsburg to Chicago especially for the festival.</p>
   <p>"With pleasure did I comply with the invitation," said the president, "because District 335 has always been one of those which have adhered to the flag. It <pb facs="5418474_10_0485.jpg" n="3"/>had an outstanding part in the development of the entire Bund as well as of the District of Chicago. Particularly in this connection may be mentioned the secretary of many years' standing in the district, Mr. James J. Heidy, whose tireless co-operation succeeded in bringing the district to the top."</p>
   <p>In the course of his address President Herklotz made mention of the reorganization of the Bund which was recently completed. About a hundred fraternal organizations in all parts of the country saw the need to make similar changes. It is already beginning to show that the preponderant majority of the members realize not only the need but also the purposefulness of these changes. In spite of the decrease in membership, unavoidable under the circumstances, and which even the German Aid Bund could not escape, it numbers today 48,000 members. Now it is up to the faithful co-operation of all members to bring these numbers back to their former size. Financially, the Bund stands today on a better footing than ever before.</p>
   <p>Besides the federal president, who in the course of the evening could scarcely <pb facs="5418474_10_0486.jpg" n="4"/>find time to do anything but shake the hands of the many coming to greet him, there were many guests of honor whom President Waldherr presented on the stage.</p>
   <p>There were, to begin with, Dr. Georg Schneider and Herr Christ Stephan, two of the founders of the district who could have never been made to stay away from this day of honor. Also present were the chief representatives Adolf Danneberg, president of the Chicago Central Committee, Willy H. Speer, Henry Schlosser, Valentin Dietz, Paul Poppendont, Joseph Schabhuettl, and James J. Heidy. From special districts there were President Bruno Morositz (334), Ida Krause (379), Philipp Scherer (409), Ernst Reiffert (495), and Karl Kovacz (572), Dr. J. W. Kobalter, ex-president of 335, brought greetings and congratulations as special representative of the Austrian Consul General.</p>
   <p>To the festival committee, which made all preparations in the best manner, we owe thanks for the success of the festival. It consisted of the following <pb facs="5418474_10_0487.jpg" n="5"/>members: President of the District, Stephen Turinsky, festival president Frank K. Waldherr, secretary James Heidy; Joe Schabhuettl, treasurer; Eugene Bastius, ticket manager; Joseph Brauneker; Frank Dirnbauer; Mathew Donis; Henry Groenbeck; D. J. W. Kobalter; John Lenz; Mary Pertzel; Fred Pulver; Rudolph Russ; Michael Sihant.</p>
   <p>A pleasant surprise was prepared by President Turinsky for his district; he presented them with a pretty memorial wreath made of silver.</p>
   <p>Of the organizations, besides the various districts of the German Aid Bund, the following sent representatives: Stock im Eisen, Organization of Schuh Plattlers, Gamsgebirg, Vienna Gemuetlichkeit, German American Sick Aid Society of Musicians, the three Styrian Societies.</p>
