<title level="a">CHICAGO TURN COMMUNITY CELEBRATES FIFTIETH ANNUAL OLD SETTLERS' FESTIVAL</title></bibl>

   <p>"Welcome ye Aged, come to the celebration!"</p>
   <p>"Good wishes for the fiftieth time, and many a greeting!"</p>
   <p>"Forget the age, enjoy the day's vacation</p>
   <p>And banish thy life's narrowness during this festive meeting!"</p>
   <p>They heeded the call, the men and the women who helped to create Chicago's greatness, as Mayor Dever so aptly expressed it in his festival speech.....</p>
   <p>Neither the raucous clamour of war, nor periods of distress could deter them, whenever the Turn Gemeinde announced that festive day; a tradition of half a century. Thousands crowded into Brand's Park, a living testimonial that the Annual Old Settlers Picnic enjoyed acclaim far beyond the confines of our city. Although a prolonged rain in the afternoon softened the ground considerably, it did not detract from the festivities. The arrangements proved so appealing <pb facs="5418474_10_0609.jpg" n="2"/>that everybody felt satisfied, regardless of the uncontrolled precipitation.</p>
   <p>At the very beginning, many visitors arrived, hurrying to be among the early registrants. For weeks, the older element lived in keen expectancy of that moment. As the afternoon hours approached, increased registration became apparent, providing extra labors for the committee in charge. When the heavens opened their flood gates, several open-air entertainments had to be abandoned; particularly the foot races of the children.</p>
   <p>As usual, the prize dance of the old people proved a great attraction, and not less than twenty-eight couples took part in the performance. Nine were honored with bouquets .....</p>
   <p>Mayor Dever .... in his festival speech said that he considered it his duty to be here .... as this represents a mile stone in the City of Chicago ..... "On one day a year we should forget our personal interests as far as possible to celebrate with the men and women to whom we are so greatly indebted."</p>
