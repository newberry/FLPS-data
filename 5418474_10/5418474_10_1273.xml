   <p>The German ladies last night gave a German Christmas celebration at the Lincoln Turnhalle which brought a few hours of gaiety to small and large children alike. The leader of the ladies, Miss Schneider, together with her faithful assistants, rehearsed a new Christmas festival play with great care; it won a great deal of lively applause from all. Even though the children showed marked signs at times of having imperfect pronunciation, it is significant that the ladies took it upon themselves to arrange this stage show. Some of the little artists did their acting quite well. Right after this, the children gave a pictorial presentation of the Christmas story during which German Christmas carols resounded from the children's voices.</p>
   <p>Not until St. Nicholas made his appearance did the tension, with which the children anticipated the event, subside. The little ones gathered <pb facs="5418474_10_1274.jpg" n="2"/>quickly around the stage, and with smiling eyes received the gifts. St. Nicholas, having quoted many beautiful sayings to enhance the solemnity of the moment, was close to everyone who received a gift, and was a welcome guest to all, large or small.</p>
   <p>For the older guests there was a gay and enjoyable dance.</p>
