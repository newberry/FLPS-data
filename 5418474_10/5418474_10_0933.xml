There were probably 600 to 700 people which swelled in the evening to nearly 1,000. Tomorrow, the festival will culiminate in a grand Fourth of July celebration, embracing a parade, speeches by the Hon. Bob Ingersoll and the Hon. Emil Rothe of Cincinnati. Johnny Hand's centennial Band has been engaged and during the afternoon the Balloon "Chicago" with be sent up with appropriate ceremonies and a very reliable anchor rope.</p>
   <p>Over 1,000 German people came together at Ogden's Grove yesterday afternoon. The occasion was a grand midsummer festival, given by the Honoverian Relief Society in aid of the German Relief Society. The Hon. Henry Claussenius, the German consul, opened the entertainment in a brief speech of welcome.</p>
   <p>Mr. Francis A. Hoffman Jr. also made an excellent speech, which was heartily applauded. There were dancing and music, instrumental and vocal, the latter led by Mr. Schmoll. Fireworks lighted up the evening, and at midnight the festivities were over.</p>
