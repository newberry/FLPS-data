<title level="a">PASTOR R. A. JOHN RETIRES FROM POSITION AS MINISTER OF ST. PAUL'S.</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Today, Pastor Rudolph A. John closes his activity of 40 years as Pastor of the Evangelical St. Paul's congregation. He is holding his farewell sermon this forenoon. His departure causes great regret, but his decision to retire, was irrevocable. On the other hand he has declared his willingness to assist Pastor Pister, who from now on will be the only minister of the congregation, whenever needed.</p>
   <p>Pastor John descends from an old Prussian officer's family. He was a distant relative of the authoress Marlitt Eugenie John, whose one hundredth birthday was lately celebrated. His father, Dr. Rudolph John belonged to those "48'ers" who left the old country in the stormy period when Germany's youth expected the "People's Spring".</p>
   <p>The elder Dr. John was literarily active in Leipzig and was one of the co-workers on the first edition of Brockhaus Conversation Lexicon. He edited the history of the 30 years' war and a number of other works.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_1439.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>He joined the colony of scholars in the virgin forests of Missouri, to which Dr. Dutzow, Friedrich Munch and others belonged, and where he founded a new home.</p>
   <p>Dr. John was, in the German settlements of Missouri, a, schoolmaster on week days, and minister on Sundays, bringing German sermons to the American forest. Among his friends and colleagues were Carl Schurz, Follenius, Hacker and other celebrated men of that period.</p>
   <p>His first son, the present Dr. John, was born in Washington, Mo., where he spent his childhood days in the old Dut zow settlement. From here the family moved to St. Louis, where the son attended parochial school, the public school, high school and finally Washington University. He then entered the preacher's seminary of the Evangelical Synod, which at that time was situated in a valley near Marthasville. After three years he passed his examination at the age of 19 years, and was accepted as a member of the Evangelical Synod.</p>
   <p>His first field of work was in Southern Illinois, where he was engaged as a traveling preacher. As he inherited great literary talent from his father <pb facs="5418474_10_1440.jpg" n="3"/>and occupied himself with the pen, he soon was known in wide circles and received a call to Richmond, Va., to the St. Johanne's church. Here he married Miss Emilie Wenzel, who belonged to an old Marburg family, settled in the Virginia city.</p>
