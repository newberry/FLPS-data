   <p>The older teams of the Chicago Turner Societies held their reunion at the Almira Turner Hall yesterday. The exhibition of a series of gymnastic exercises, at which seventy elderly gentlemen were eager to participate, was the chief purpose for the gathering there. The program was introduced by the musical selection "Gymnasts, Come Forth to the Fray", excellently delivered by the Bear singers. This was followed by gymnastic exhibitions, under the direction of the turn teacher Edwin Bercher of the Turner Society Almira. He was assisted by the athletic instructors Mr. Franz Gerlich, of the La Salle Turner Society; Otto Dreisel, of the Aurora; and Hermann Dreisel, of the Social Turner Society. The exercises consisted of various types of gymnastic exhibitions and of short-period endurance running. These exhibitions were performed by old-time Turners, among whom Mr. Conrad Heisel, of the Chicago Turner Society, showed alertness and agility comparable to a much younger man, although at the age of seventy-three years. They performed with admirable exactness and no doubt to the utmost satisfaction of the athletic instructors.</p>

   <p>A meeting was then held following the exercises, at which Turner Koelling presided. It was announced that the following societies were represented by their older teams: The Turner Society Almira, by twelve; the Eiche, by six; the Freiheit, by five; the Social Turner Society, by ten; the Chicago Turner Society, by four; the South Side Gymnasts, by twelve; and the Turner Society La Salle, by four. The societies Aurora, and Vorwaerts whose older team membership has been exhausted for some time were represented by six Bears. The Grand Crossing Turner Society sent no representatives. Mr. Koelling announced further, that the older team of the Turner Society Lincoln, which has just recently withdrawn, is considering seriously to rejoin the organization. An invitation was then read, sent by the Labor Singing Alliance of the Northwestern States of America, requesting the society's active participation at the second singing festival, to be held July 6-8, in the hall of the First Regiment. A short conference followed at which it was decided to accept the invitation.....One more thing was generally agreed upon before the meeting ended, that the next Older Team Day shall be held in the gymnasium of the La Salle Turner Society.</p>
