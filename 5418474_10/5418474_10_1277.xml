   <p>The Social Turnverein, in its hall on Belmont Avenue and Paulina Street, is going to celebrate Christmas next Sunday with gifts to children and with a ball.</p>
   <p>The fest begins at 8 P.M. sharp, introduced with music by the Beisse orchestra. All classes of girls and boys, including those of the orphanage, will demonstrate their gymnastic games.</p>
   <p>A very rich program is planned, in which gymnastics and rhythmic exercises will be featured. The new gymnastic teacher of the Social Turnverein, Bernhard Brockmann, has coached the classes for the first time, and there is much speculation as to the results he has obtained with his coaching.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_1278.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>There will be gifts for the children which will, as usual, wind up the official celebration. This will be followed by a ball. Young and old will have a good time with dancing, with music provided by the Beisse orchestra.</p>
   <p>A visit to the event will be enjoyable to all friends of turning.</p>
