  <body>
   <p>The St. Paul's Congregation, whose place of worship is located at Orchard Street and Kemper Place, celebrated a jubilee yesterday. Three quarters of a century have passed since it was founded. For a full seventy-five years it has held together faithfully, always defending the principles laid down by our forefathers. In spite of many adversities it has kept on growing and can now enjoy its accomplishments wholeheartedly. The past was recalled to memory, men and women were remembered who once guided the fate of the community, especially the Reverend [Joseph] Hartmann, who served here all those many years. One remembered the old church, which stood at La Salle Avenue and Ohio Street and was only given up when, thanks to the untiring efforts of the Reverend Rudolph A. John, a new one, much larger and more beautiful, was completed. Memories were recalled of bygone days, during which our fathers and forefathers built what their children are enjoying today. A <pb facs="5418474_10_1466.jpg" n="2"/>reminder to preserve it for their descendants was given during yesterday's jubilee celebration.</p>
   <p>Two services were held, one in the morning and one in the evening. At the first one the German language was used, since it had been used exclusively for many years and was more familiar to many of the older members. In the evening English was spoken, which the growing generation and those who had just come of age knew much better. It goes without saying that on each occasion the church was filled to capacity. In the morning the three church bells--named Faith, Love, and Hope--called the worshippers to service. In the evening a trombone ensemble played the hymn, "Nun danket alle Gott" (Now Thank We All Our God). The orchestra and the organ then played the prelude to Wagner's opera, "Parsifal," followed by a selection from Mozart, "Heil und Friede" (Redemption and Peace), and by a jubilee hymn, composed twenty-five years ago at the occasion of the community's golden anniversary, and sung by the choir of Uhlich's Orphanage. Then followed the Ninety-Fifth <pb facs="5418474_10_1467.jpg" n="3"/>Psalm in the version of Mendelssohn, accompanied by organ and orchestra. Afterwards, the Reverend Mr. Pfister, one of the two clergymen of the church, delivered the sermon. This concluded the first part of the service.</p>
   <p>The second part was opened with a verse of Luther's hymn, "Ein' Fester Burgist Unser Gott," (A Mighty Fortress Is Our God), after which the other clergymen, the Reverend Rudolph A. John, delivered his sermon. He has been officiating now for over thirty years and has rendered the greatest service to the community, a fact which is appreciated to the fullest, for he is equally popular with old and young. His sermon was based on the text of the Scriptures: "Ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free."</p>
   <p>A trio, together with the choir, then sang Haydn's "The Heavens are telling". After that, fourteen members, who had participated in the golden jubilee of the community, sang the same prayer, which had been sung at that time, accompanied by the organist, Mr. C. A. Weiss, who has held his position for thirty-two years. The next number also recalled memories of the celebration held</p>
