   <p>It was in the year 1878, when the desire to found a society of their country men was expressed by the Chicago Swabians. Such organizations existed already in New York and Philadelphia. So it came about that on Sunday, March 31st, 1878, 23 men met at Karl Taxis locality, corner State and Adams Streets. At this meeting the Swabian Society was founded.</p>
   <p>At its third gathering the statutes were established. They begin thus: "The purpose of the society consists in the yearly observance of the well known Cannstadter folks festival and in the cultivation of German cheerfulness as well as in the assistance to its members and their families and in general charity."</p>
   <p>A beautiful aim for any society. The Swabian Society during the 50 years of its existence has shown by its actions that it was in earnest with the fulfillment of those high aims and duties. At the fourth meeting they proceeded to the election of officers. Ernst Himmel who today yet is the honorary president, was elected president. G. Federer who was temporary president became <pb facs="5418474_10_0545.jpg" n="2"/>vice-president, Franz Demmler, secretary; Louis Glanz, treasurer and Adolph Hartmann, financial secretary.</p>
   <p>At the following meeting they started already the preparations for the first Cannstadter folks festival which was going to take place Sunday, August 25, 1878 in Ogden Grove. Hand in hand with the founding of the society goes the singing section, but which dissolved in 1880 on account of lack of participation.</p>
   <p>The Swabian singers union took its place in 1894. It appeared for the first time at that year's festival under the direction of Dr. Brodbock. The two so successfull folks festivals were the occasion for the first contribution on Nov. 18, 1879 of 50,000 dollars for the erection of a Schiller monument. Seven years later in May, 1886, it was dedicated amidst the participation of a large number of Germans, in Lincoln Park. And while we are speaking of monuments, we wish to say that the erection of a Goethe monument took place in the year 1890.</p>
