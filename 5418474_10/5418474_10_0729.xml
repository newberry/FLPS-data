   <p>The Swiss national festival was celebrated yesterday at the northside gymnasium by the United Swiss clubs and Societies of Chicago in a very dignified as well as effective way. The large hall of the gymnasium was filled up to the last seat, which is usually the case at all Swiss affairs. A very appropriate and diversified program had been arranged and exceedingly well carried out and the enthusiasm of the audience knew no limits.</p>
   <p>The Swiss consul, Mr. Holinger, gave a very inspiring speech. He portrayed how about 600 years ago the foundation was laid for a splendid development of Switzerland by the oath of Gruetly. The commemoration of this day being celebrated by the local Swiss societies for 50 years and the interests for the same is steadily increasing. He also pointed out, that the words of the poet: "As brethern we will ever be united; no want or danger shall us separate" have found an echo in the hearts of the Swiss and this has been demonstrated recently. As part of Switzerland was damaged by a flood and some of the Swiss suffered greatly, the Swiss clubs and societies collected 14,300 Francs ($2,724.00), and sent it as an offering of love to their suffering kinsmen in Switzerland. The speaker received <pb facs="5418474_10_0730.jpg" n="2"/>thundering applause.</p>
   <p>The different singing and athletic clubs, deserve special recognition for the excellent rendering of the comedy by the Helvetia Athletes and the "groups of marmor" under the direction of Mr. Buerger. The "Four seasons, of the year", played with the co-operation of children mostly and directed by Mrs. M. Schmidt, was an outstanding success. A poem for the occasion, composed by J. W. Dietz and declaimed by Mrs, M. Schmidt, received considerable recognition.</p>
   <p>The enthusiastic applause of the public gave evidence that the skillful performances of the players were appreciated.</p>
