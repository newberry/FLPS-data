   <p>Chicago, the busy, restless metropolis, held a memorial procession yesterday in honor of the great leader whose life has become part of the history of this city. Here he was nominated for the presidency by a powerful political party, and Chicago also had been the home of the despicable creature Guiteau, whose sordid efforts to attain fame, no matter how, made him the murderer of the man concerning whom the nation felt that he would become the greatest President that the United States had ever had.</p>
   <p>What Chicago undertakes generally assumes colossal proportions....The multitude, which usually expresses itself boisterously at processions, maintained an almost deathlike silence, although probably more than a hundred thousand people lined the street for a distance of three miles....All business was suspended.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0890.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Michigan Avenue, south of Madison Street, served as the gathering place for the various divisions. The few police were powerless to control the immense throng. However, a semblance of order was brought out of chaos, mostly through the co-operation of the crowd, which complied with the orders of the leaders and officers of the procession without argument and as well as was possible, considering the surging multitude, and this enabled the marchers to form in ranks....</p>
   <p>The Great Procession</p>
   <p>Start: Monroe Street and Michigan Avenue....through the downtown section....back to Michigan Avenue south of Eldridge Court, where the procession dissolved.

   <p>The procession showed almost no ostentatious display, and that in particular made it very impressive. The soldiers marched with lowered rifles and bowed heads; flags were rolled up and draped in black. The musicians played funeral marches and at suitable intervals funeral bells were sounded; occasionally a few salvos were discharged. All proved highly appropriate.</p>
   <p>The Army was represented by about two thousand men. The Scotch Company, thirty men of the Sixth Regiment, had the most conspicious uniforms. There were also four cannons in this part of the funeral procession. The citizens who were in the parade did not march particularly well. The veterans, about four thousand, marched to the tune of a fife with muffled drumbeats and proved very impressive. These men, hardy soldiers, walked in true Army style, and their demeanor showed in every way their esteem for a departed fellow member.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0900.jpg" n="12"/>
   <p>The catafalque [empty hearse in this instance] was drawn by six black horses led by Negroes, and this entire dark group did much to augment the mournful aspect of the procession. On both sides of the float appeared the following inscription in white letters:</p>
   <p>In Memoriam</p>
   <p>James Abram Garfield</p>
   <p>Scholar, Statesman, Patriot</p>
   <p>Born November 13, 1831 Died September 19, 1881</p>
   <p>May He Rest in Peace</p>
   <p>Laurel branches were mounted above the inscription; crosses of white immortelles were fastened to the front and the rear of the vehicle as well as in other suitable places. Allegorical figures, a half-open portal signifying entrance to the hereafter, a cross and a broken pillar were at the center of the catafalque; above it was a pedestal, draped with the Star Spangled Banner enshrouded in black, while a laurel wreath and golden sword, hilt wrapped with black ribbons, lay on top of the pedestal. The pagoda-shaped roof was <pb facs="5418474_10_0901.jpg" n="13"/>surmounted by an eagle, wings bound with black cloth, as if to prevent flight. To relieve the monotony of the dark draperies, heavy silver fringes were added. A saddle horse, decorated with the emblems of mourning.... followed the catafalque.....</p>
   <p>The German Division</p>
   <p>The German division, which formed the end of the procession, consisted of ten thousand men at least and was the most imposing part of the entire parade. Their numbers seemed endless as the men marched with their countless club banners draped in black. The immense participation of the German element shows most conclusively what esteem the Germans have for the land of their adoption and provides splendid compensation for the neglect of Germany in failing to send a suitable note of condolence to America, the nation of which the German people form a major part.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0902.jpg" n="14"/>
   <p>The parade was fully two miles long and required three hours to pass a given point. [Translator's note: Verbatim. According to the figures given a man could hardly keep his balance walking so slowly; the parade probably was longer than indicated, and the men walked faster.] About sixty thousand people marched, and it was the greatest demonstration ever witnessed in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Central Music Hall</p>
   <p>A memorial service was held at Central Music Hall in the afternoon..... Pastor Miln was the speaker.....At the end [of the service] the dirge composed by Oscar Schmoll for the occasion, poem by Mr. Dietz, was presented by five German and twenty-eight American singers.</p>
