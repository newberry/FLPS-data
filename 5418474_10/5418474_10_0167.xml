   <p>German is now given in all the schools which were not burned down and where German was taught before the fire. An average of 2,359 pupils in eight schools are taking German. These schools are Washington School, 182 pupils; Carpenter, 328; Wells, 298; Moseley, 282; Cottage Grove, 187; Haven, 350; Lincoln, 380; and Newberry, 352. Of these 2,359 children, 1,070 are boys and 1,289 are girls. In the Ogden, Kinzie, Franklin, and LaSalle schools, which are now under construction, German will continue to be taught as before the fire.</p>
   <p>When German was added to the curriculum of the Washington School in 1865, as an experiment, one hundred sixty-five students registered. By the year 1870, the number of children taking German grew to 2,597, and by 1871 these numbers increased to 4,533.</p>
   <p>To justify the introduction of German in public schools, Mr. Harris, superintendent <pb facs="5418474_10_0168.jpg" n="2"/>of the school system of St. Louis, says:"Even on account of national reasons, German should be included among the subjects taught in the public schools. The assimilation of all nationalities to form an American nation is the aim to be reached. Should German be excluded from public schools, the Germans would segregate into their own schools and this would retard the process of assimilation."</p>
