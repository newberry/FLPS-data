   <p>On the one hand a large portion of the people of the United States are preparing for another onslaught against the prevalent system of protective tariffs, while on the other hand England seems to prepare for an attack against free trade. This fight against the system of free trade is carried on by the ruling classes, and not by the rank and file of the labor and middle classes. No other than England's prime minister, Lord Salisbury, has declared in a public speech that free trade as a system is a failure. The expectations of the defenders of free trade have not been justified. They hoped that all other countries would be compelled to introduce free trade after England had done so; but in reality the contrary took place. Other countries followed more and more a system of protective tariffs, and each tried to exclude the other countries as well as England from their markets.</p>
   <p>The teachings of free trade has become second nature, as it were, to the broad masses of Englishmen, and it will take decades before they are ready to accept different viewpoints.</p>
   <p>However, it is not admitted that he (Salisbury) is wrong. As there is an excess of protective tariffs, which is true at the present in the United States there <pb facs="5418474_10_0262.jpg" n="2"/>may be an over abundance of free trade, as appears to be the case in England because its export, although continually on the increase, does not expand in proportion to its import. The proper way may be the golden middle course which is true of nearly all other things in life, the proper measure of free trade and of protection.</p>
