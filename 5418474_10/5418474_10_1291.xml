   <p>Many of the German clubs and associations took advantage of the holiday to give to the children of their members a special treat. Crowds of children rejoiced last night, standing around large, beautifully decorated Christmas trees.</p>
   <p>It is a well-known fact that the Vorwarts Athletic Club makes its festivities a real success. Such was its Christmas celebration yesterday. The children were, of course, especially taken into consideration, because Christmas is the most joyous festival for them. The hall was filled with young and old long before the appointed time, and their faces expressed festive joy and expectation. The hall was brilliantly decorated, the chief ornaments being two beautiful Christmas trees. The first part of the <pb facs="5418474_10_1292.jpg" n="2"/>program consisted of gymnastic displays by all the boys' and girls' classes, as well as by the young women's class. During the intermission Christmas presents were distributed to the children in the hall below. The children came down in groups, and the presents they received were useful and attractive articles, and their joy was exceedingly great. The parents participated in the merriment of the little ones; they applauded the gymnastic performances of the children and enjoyed the entertainments and the ball, that followed, very much.</p>
   <p>The Germania Athletic Club held a gymnastic display last night, in its hall, 3417-3521 South Halsted Street, in connection with its Christmas festival. To judge the pupils by their splendid gymnastic performances, they must receive good instructions. The efforts of the children were well rewarded by generous and appropriate Christmas presents.</p>
