   <p>In the short period of only one year the Zion Parish in the Maywood-Bellwood district, with its Wolga Germans, was destined to make progress of a rather satisfying nature. The number of members is growing steadily. October 30, the new spiritual leader, Herr Pastor E. Amend, was introduced. He was formerly at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, and, under his leadership the parish developed satisfactorily.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday, December 11, at 3 P.M. the parish will celebrate its first anniversary in the Eureka Hall on 25th Avenue and St. Charles Road. The preachers will be Dr. Klotsche, from the Lutheran Seminary in Maywood and Pastor Ernst Schmidt from the German and Transylvania-Saxon St. Paul's Parish of Chicago. Beside the choir of the Zion parish, the German church choir of the St. Paul's parish will contribute toward beautifying the festive hour. During the services the solemn initiation of thirty new members will take place. The parish holds Sunday school at 9 A.M., and German services at 10 A.M. are held <pb facs="5418474_10_1394.jpg" n="2"/>in its chapel, 2142 St. Charles Road, Bellwood, I11.</p>
