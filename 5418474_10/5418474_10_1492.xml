   <p>In the St. Paul's Church at 22nd Place, since yesterday the 10th convention of the Chicago Branch of the Catholic Guards of America takes place. The St. Paul's cadets of the St. Pauls's Parish founded by their former clergy man, Father George D. Heldmann, fetched their guests from Ashland Avenue and 22nd Street and conducted them to the church, where they were welcomed by the National President Mathias Lillig with a hearty speech. Pater Victor also made a speech and spoke about the activity of the guards and wished them further success.</p>
   <p>Today a holy mass was celebrated and afterwards the convention was opened, which will finish with the election of their officers. The local branch of the Catholic Guards has 500 members.</p>
