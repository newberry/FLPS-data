   <p>In the congregational church at Ashland avenue and Washington Blvd., there is a meeting of the German Baptists' Union of North America, in which more than six hundred delegates and others participated.</p>
   <p>At the session on yesterday, which took up mission affairs, Reverend A. Orthner of Bay City, Michigan, was appointed German Baptist Missionary in Kamerun, West Africa. He will again organize the German Mission work which has been abandoned since the World War.</p>
   <p>Rev. William Kuhn, of Chicago, was elected secretary of the General Mission society of the Baptist conference. The president of the conference is Prof. Hermann von Berge, of Dayton, Ohio; and the secretary is Pastor Hans Steiger, of St. Joseph, Michigan.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_1417.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Union of German Baptists consists of two hundred seventy-five with 35,000 members. In 330 Sunday schools, 35,000 children receive Bible instructions, while the youth's union consists of 220 societies with 9300 members.</p>
   <p>This is the twenty-second Assembly of the conference. Every three years, a union conference is held, at which important resolutions for the next three years are passed. The Mission educates its ministers at its seminary in Rochester, N. Y. It also maintains Old Peoples' homes in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon, besides other charitable institutions, as the Children's home in St. Joseph, Michigan. This home is considered a model in its class by experts. In Cleveland, Ohio, the Union maintains a publishing house.</p>
