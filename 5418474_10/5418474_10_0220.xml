   <p>President Wilson has appeared before the public with the declaration that he will consider the results of next Tuesday's election, as a vote of confidence or a vote of mistrust for himself. According to the President, every vote cast Tuesday will be considered for or against Woodrow Wilson. And this declaration proves again, what Mr. Wilson has proven daily during the tenure of his office; that he considers congress to be a subordinate corporation, called upon to do the will, and to observe the political views of the President. And the voters will receive the declaration of the president with great glee, because it facilitates their choice. When casting their votes will merely be a question as to whether they are satisfied with the President's decisions, as far as they concern the people's material welfare. And therefore, it is worth while on the one hand, but it is, on the other hand, everyone's duty to submit the actions of the President, and their results, to an objective and serious criticism. The question arises: Does President Wilson, on the basis of his deeds so far, deserve the further confidence of his voting fellow citizens? The President's actions must be judged separately, according to their moral and economic value. The economic life of this country, has been greatly affected <pb facs="5418474_10_0221.jpg" n="2"/>through the tariff laws and Clayton Anti-Trust laws. The tariff laws which have been created, under the pleasing slogan that it would facilitate free competition, have deeply affected the economic structure of the country, and has not only deprived enterprises and working men, but also the national budget of certain incomes. The latter to such a degree, that under the title wartax, increased burdens have been put on the people in order to cover the deficit, brought about by the tariff laws. But the taxes would be a minor evil, had they not broken the backbone of our domestic industry, and at the same time destroyed the existence of millions of workingmen. For his tariff laws, therefore, the president scarcely deserves the confidence of his citizens. The Clayton anti-trust law is acknowledged to be a weakened Sherman law. Instead of regulating the corporations, this law causes uncertainty, and lack of enterprise, no director of a corporation is able to foretell whether some of his acts are not contrary to the law. The law is principally directed against "unethical competition", but it omitted to clarify the conception of the "unethical competition". No business man therefore is in a position, to improve his business through application of new methods, because he is always in danger of running up against the "sphynxlike unethical competition." The natural consequences are that a large number of contractors, so as not to be subject to annoyances, have retired from business and therefore employees have lost their daily bread. This experiment of the President in the economic field, also has miscarried and <pb facs="5418474_10_0222.jpg" n="3"/>therefore does not encourage us to further confidence. But if the President was unable to preserve our economic goods, he certainly preserved our morals and our authority. For instance in Mexico, where he with the assistance of his clever Secretary of State, brought it about so that first Huerta, later Villa and Carranza were dancing on his head, and now the whole of Mexico bears an attitude towards us of which we surely can not boast. The President secured the Chinese Republic's neutrality, but when Japan did not pay any attention to it, and merrily invaded Chinese territory, our President excused this step with the phrase "military necessity", without asking or receiving an apology from Japan. The attitude which the President maintained in the European war question, his neutrality, shall not be discussed here because every child knows that through this attitude the respect for our Republic has not increased. Therefore, if President Wilson is looking for confidence, he certainly should search for it among foreign manufacturers, among the English and Japanese. They surely will not withhold it from him. He honestly strove for it there. It is different with the citizens of this Republic and they will vote accordingly on November third.</p>
