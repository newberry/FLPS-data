   <p>The Saxons from Transylvania have founded a Lutheran parish of their own in Chicago. The meeting called for this purpose, under Chairman George Daniels, made this decision with unusual accord. A sheet of paper was circulated upon which all who came obliged themselves to join and to pay a monthly contribution. Following this a committee was elected and instructed to look for a church in which services would be conducted. Through the co-operation of the mission superintendant of the Wartburg Synod, Reverend E. Knudten, D. D., they were given permission to hold services in the Grace Church (550 Belden Avenue). The church is quite favorably situated, right in the center of the largest Saxon neighborhood of Chicago, and it is easily reached by the streetcar lines on Lincoln Avenue and Larrabee Street.</p>
   <p>At the same time the church committee made the announcement that beginning with Sunday, April 25, regular services will be conducted in that church, for the time being at 2 P.M. Not only the members but all Transylvanian Saxons who live in Chicago and all friends of our people are invited to attend.</p>
