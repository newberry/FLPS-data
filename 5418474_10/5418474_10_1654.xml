   <p>Words, no matter how forceful they may be uttered, will not make an impression upon those who have become devotees of the abominable absurdity called "Christian Science." Absolute stupidity is an invincible force. An absurdity may be crowded out or suppresed by another absurdity, but it can not be over come by sound reason and common sense. Every attempt to expose their mad folly ends in failure. For whom ever believes in these delusions, whether it is fortune telling, exorcism, apparition healing of the sick by prayer, or by Christian will-power, the weapons of the mind are ineffective and powerless. Every attack is met with that smile of contempt and superiority, modified by a sense of pity. The peculiar characteristic, and the amusing joke of this American madness is the fact that the proclaimers announce themselves as the representatives of real intellectual advancement, and they consider the defenders of sound reason and of true science, the pitiable victims of superstition and bigotry. However, this is not only practiced by spritualist and similar fakers, but also by those who wish to enforce prohibition, blue laws, equality of sexes, and associated reforms.</p>
   <p>There is nothing a sane person can do except to shrug his shoulders in pity and <pb facs="5418474_10_1655.jpg" n="2"/>let others choose their own "fashion" in which to become idiotic or perhaps saintly. However, if others are injured by these delusions then it becomes a matter of public attention and the duty of officials to stop it. Not that the absurd delusions as such could be stooped, but those activities poromulgated by them, which are injurious to the well-being of others, should be forbidden. From this viewpoint it becomes the right as well as the duty of the government to prosecute these miracle fakers in the same manner as they would those who commit murder motivated by religious fanaticism.</p>
   <p>If one is familiar with conditions in our country, he will be aware of the fact that the vast majority of the mediums and faith-healers are fakers and scoundrels. They take advantage of the enormous stupidity of our half-cultured and our uneducated ponulace. Their criminal activity will continue to be lucrative until the "renowned" American system of education is based upon a strong developement of the power to think and to will, instead of a mechanical cramming of the mind with facts and figures not understood and repeated in parrot-like fashion. The American system of education is the most fertile soil for all these absurdities and delusions, which parade under the disguise of intellectual progress.</p>
