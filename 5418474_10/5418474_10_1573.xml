   <p>Pastor Kling of the St. Lucas Church, whose name has often been mentioned lately, will not preach any more next Sunday or in the future in his community. The happenings of the last months caused him to give up the fight with the opposition and his position as peace in his parish could not be established anymore. Some friends of Mr. Kling whose names will not be mentioned appeared to-day in the office of the Abendpost with the above statement to which they added that the whole fight had been caused by some dissatisfied parishioners. The accusations which had been made against Mr. Kling, have not been proved by the investigation. The complaints of his immoral behavior and his embezzlement of money have not been found justified.</p>
   <p>They also denied that Mr. Hattendorf has fought with some members of the St. Lucas parish as had been stated yesterday. The whole affair is so distasteful that it will be best to forget all about it.</p>
