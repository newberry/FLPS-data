   <p>At the regular meeting, held last night at the Lincoln Turner Hall by the Friends of New Germany, K. Sautter spoke at length on the purposes and aims of the Bund in the United States. From its endeavors to keep all Germans unified, and to get Germans to profess, openly and freely, their nationality and the prestige of the old homeland, the Bund gets its justification, and thus becomes a nucleus of German-American life as a whole. The speaker concluded his statements with Schiller's words: "Always strive for the whole, and shouldst thou be unable to become a whole, attach thyself as a link that helps make a whole." Applause followed.</p>
   <p>Later in the evening, Herr Morton Medenwald, guest speaker, spoke of European politics, using the latest events as proof that Hitler's peace professions are no empty illusions, but that the leader of the German people has time and again followed up his words with deeds. Medenwald was followed by F. Von Fredersdorf, who, in a brief address, spoke of experiences from his own life.</p>
