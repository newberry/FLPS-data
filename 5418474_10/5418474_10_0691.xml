   <p>The Germans in Chicago must also do their share of the fighting during this great World War. Professor Kuehnemann has pointed out in his lectures that this War is not only being fought with guns and cannon but is even more a clash of the minds and ideologies of people, with the civilization of mankind as a prize. Could any culture exist without German music? What haven't German musicians done for our more immediate home, Chicago! Was not the Thomas Orchestra established by a German, and did not German musicians maintain it for the most part and built it up? During a time when other nationalities were mainly concerned with making a living, a small group of loyal admirers of German tradition labored to preserve and to cultivate lofty cultural achievements. Unfortunately, it must be said that these artists did not get the support of the German population which they had hoped for and were entitled to. Particularly the Germans who are blessed with earthly goods do not care much for the idealistic efforts of their compatriots, but are totally wrapped up in the American ideal of chasing the dollar.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0692.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This is the case again today. A small group of people are cultivating and guarding German culture, and they have to fight against the apathy and indifference of their German compatriots, making the greatest efforts to prepare a lasting and dignified place in Chicago where German chorus singing can prosper. Especially during times like these, when the German is pictured as a barbarian devoid of any culture. The Germans in this country should strive to maintain German culture and to support to their utmost those institutions which have made it their business to preserve that culture. The Chicago Singverein [Singing Society] has been trying for four years to present great German musical compositions in masterly fashion. It is true that they have met with the approval of the greater portion of the public, but as the Singverein have to incur all sorts of expenses in order to represent the Deutschtum in a dignified way, and since half of the concerts were given gratis for charitable purposes, their income is not sufficient to put the verein on a financially secure basis. It would be very desirable if a solid and dependable nucleus of nonsinging members could be <pb facs="5418474_10_0693.jpg" n="3"/>formed, with some lifetime members paying a lump sum of one hundred dollars as membership fee, others paying twenty-five dollars annual dues, and the great majority of inactive members paying ten dollars annual dues, which they could make up in most cases by getting free admission tickets.</p>
   <p>This would not only relieve the Singverein of the worries over their financial situation and save the active members the troubles of selling admission tickets, but larger compositions could lie rehearsed and performed, which is impossible at present on account of the purchase and rental expenses.</p>
   <p>Next spring the Singverein will probably perform the poem, "Dos Lied von der Glocke" [Ballad of the Bell], which has been set to music by Max Bruch. We hope that the verein will not be handicapped in their work by financial worries, and that they can devote all their time and energy in preparation for this wonderful performance.</p>
