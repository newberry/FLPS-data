   <p>Sunday, October 16, the Parish of St. John, Moffat Street and Campbell Avenue, celebrates its golden anniversary.</p>
   <p>At the morning services, which begin at ten o'clock, Pastor C. A. Koenig will give the German sermon and Dr. C. W. Locher the English sermon. At the evening services which begin at 7:30, Dr. R. A. John of Chicago will preach. The neighboring Evangelical parishes, St. Peter's, First English, and Nazareth are invited and their pastors, H. Lambrecht, L. W. Goebel and F. P. Umbeck will bring greetings from their own parishes to the celebrating one. At the services on Monday night, the activities of the women's societies will be discussed. Pastor Julius Kircher from the Trinitatis Church (Trinity <pb facs="5418474_10_1398.jpg" n="2"/>Church) will deliver the sermon. On Tuesday night, the work of the young men's and young women's clubs and also that of the Sunday schools will be the topic. At this session, Pastor Armin M. Mayer of St. Luke's parish will give the sermon. On Wednesday night Pastor L. W. Goebel will preach. The evening will be dedicated largely to the men.</p>
   <p>The parish choirs and the soloists, Mrs. Lillian Winter and Mrs. Erna Pfeifferstorm, will contribute to the festivities.</p>
   <p>The first steps in the founding of the parish of St. John were undertaken by the widely known Reverend Gottlieb Lumbrecht, now pastor of the St. Peter's parish. In the year 1882 he gathered the numerous Germans in the vicinity of Western and Milwaukee Avenues, for the purpose of organizing a parish. After having conducted a number of services, Pastor Hugo Stamer, of Kankakee, took over the field of his labors. The latter founded, on October 18, 1882, the parish with eleven members. A small structure was built on Cortland <pb facs="5418474_10_1399.jpg" n="3"/>Street near Western Avenue to be used for divine services and as a school. The synod gave the parish $400 for the building. Pastor Stamer was a zealous school advocate, and in the year 1883 a teacher was engaged. After a few years there came another teacher. The school lasted until 1900. From then on the pastor gave religious and German instruction on Saturdays.</p>
   <p>In the year 1884, the parish acquired five building lots on Moffat Street near Western Avenue. The little church they had been using was moved, given a substructure, and considerably enlarged so that the new basement could contain two schoolrooms.</p>
   <p>In 1886 a second spacious parish house was built (of burnt bricks) close to the church. The parish grew on and on under the self-sacrificing efforts of the pastor.</p>
   <p>In 1910, the women's club reported that the money raised for the building of a church had attained the sum of $13,000. Accordingly, the parish decided <pb facs="5418474_10_1400.jpg" n="4"/>to start building a church. The members pledged themselves for small or large sums without having to be urged. Plans were drawn up and accepted by the members, and the contract was given to Lane and Borkemeyer. On December 11, 1910, the new church was dedicated. It had a tower one hundred feet high and, in the basement, had an auditorium with 400 seats. The mortgage on the new building was paid in ten years.</p>
   <p>In April 1919, Pastor Stamer, having faithfully served the parish for thirty-seven years, entered into well-deserved retirement. Pastor B. H. Leesmann was called to become his successor. He came from Ogden, Utah, and was inaugurated into office by his predecessor July 6, 1919. It was the wish of the parish to have the English language cultivated in like manner. Each Sunday or holiday, two services were conducted, German at 10 A.M., and English at 11 A.M.</p>
   <p>In 1922, beautifully painted church windows were ordered from Max Zettler of Munich. They were donated to the parish by members of organizations, <pb facs="5418474_10_1401.jpg" n="5"/>among them two ladies' clubs, the young folks' organization, the Bible class, and the families of Messrs. Schaefer, Wendt, Menzel, and Freese.</p>
   <p>The social groups, including the Sunday school, are in excellent condition. The parish has contributed--from 1920 until 1932--the sum of $33,389.12 for charitable purposes. Pastor Stamer is now in his 86th year. He was the cofounder of six other parishes in Chicago besides the one now celebrating its anniversary.</p>
