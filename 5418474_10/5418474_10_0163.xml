   <p>Last Sunday, the pulpit was used as just as it was two years ago, by American Know-Nothings and hypocrites, to make political attacks against the Germans. The worst attacks were made by the fanatic, R. F. Ravlin, who does not fail to thunder every month against the German Sunday in Chicago. In his last Sunday sermon he directed his insults against A. C. Hesing, because the latter had done so much in favor of Sunday freedom. He calls the present liberal Sunday ordinances and the banishment of the Bible from the public schools by order of the Board of Education, the work of thieves and drunkards, the scum of Society. He calls the opposition party, the party which has introduced the now reigning disorder in Germany and the prevalent prostitution in France.</p>
   <p>He calls Mr. Hesing a vain, drunk and selfish infidel.</p>
   <p>Medill reprints such a sermon with pleasure and recommends it to his readers. Yes, he even uses as election document, a sermon full of hatred against Hesing, by a certain Baptist preacher Florence Mc Carthy, whom the Tribune has previously often ridiculed. <pb facs="5418474_10_0164.jpg" n="2"/>Such insults must be answered today by our votes.</p>
