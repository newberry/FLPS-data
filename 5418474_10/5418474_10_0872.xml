   <p>Association of Veterans of the German Army, held its first "Founders Meeting," at Brand's Hall. Its members were participants of the illustrious battles of '64,'65,'70 and '71. The precision and smoothness of its proceedings could well serve as a shining example to many of the longer established clubs.</p>
   <p>That peculiar spirit of German faith and honesty permeated the environment which must have been impressive even to the laurel-wreathed bust of old Emperor William and, could the departed hero have been awakened, he would look with pride upon the assembled braves, etc. Many were adorned with the iron corss (emblem of bravery), etc. Hempstead Washburne, son of Elihu Washburne, gave the declamation of the evening in English and German, bestowing full recongition to the achievements of the German army and people. He spoke of his father's activities and the assistance he gave to those Germans who were beleaguered amongst others in Paris. Jubliant acclaim was accorded to his anecdote, and many a glass emptied in memory of his"unforgettable father. The Juvenile Male Chorus and the Weegesche Orchestra gave exemplary assistance. Presiding officer Georg von Massow, introduced the speaker. The meeting closed with a "ball," which was supplemented by banquet.</p>
