   <p>The local branch of the German-American National Union held its yearly general meeting last night in the Schiller Building. The chairmanship was in the hands of President, Judge Max Eberhardt. All affiliated associations had sent their delegates.</p>
   <p>In his report the President emphasized the great aims the unions held, which could not be obtained by individual clubs. The main objects are:</p>
   <p>The homogeneous principle of the Germans, the protection and preservation of the German language in schools as well as of the gymnastic lessons, the maintenance of the German morals and customs as promoter of German culture in this country; the accomplishing of the missions of German history since the beginning of American history. From a small beginning the Union has developed in the course of the first year, very extensively and now combines 67 clubs and societies. Notwithstanding its youth, the Union can look back on great accomplishments - such as success against the Prohibitionists, <pb facs="5418474_10_0754.jpg" n="2"/>its collection for the sufferers of the earthquake in the Pacific Ocean, the great memorial celebration in honor of Karl Schurtz, held in cooperation with the German branch of the Historical Society of Illinois and the Chicago Citizens Association and the worthy celebration of German Day.</p>
   <p>If the 700 German associations still outside the country would join the Union, they would be better equipped for achievements. For expenditures only $589.24 was at their disposal, and it would not have been sufficient had not all officials served without compensation and the German department of the Historical Society had permitted free use of their offices. In the first year of their existence 70 clubs with 9915 members belonged to the Union, of which 4 with 638 members applied for their withdrawal. One club with 160 members has applied for membership since the beginning of this year; so that the present position is 67 clubs with 9447 members. Besides, there are 29 individual members. The meeting instructed the board to work out plans for a worthy celebration of the German Day in Chicago for this year and to report in a meeting of delegates, especially called for this purpose.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0755.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Unanimously it was resolved to instruct the Board to protest against the acceptance of the "Local Option Bill" at the legislature at Springfield and to send copies to both houses of the legislature.</p>
