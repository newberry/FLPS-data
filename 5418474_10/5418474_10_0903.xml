   <p>Mayor Harrison takes great interest in the forthcoming ceremony, scheduled for next Monday [September 26]. He is energetically at work attending to the various details and finds enthusiastic support.....His proclamation.....[Translator's note: Non-German items are omitted.]</p>
   <p>Participation of the Germans</p>
   <p>A meeting was held yesterday at the City Hall. Representatives of the following German clubs and lodges were present: Schwabenverein (Swabian Club) Turngemeinde (Gymnastic Association), Baiernverein (Bavarian Club), Turnverein Vorwaerts (Forward Gymnastic Club), Plattdeutscher Verein (Low German Society), Thueringer Verein (Thuringian Society), Orpheus Society, Maennerchor Der Druiden (Druids' Male Chorus), Hermannssoehne (Sons of Hermann), Pythiasritter <pb facs="5418474_10_0904.jpg" n="2"/>(Knights of Pythias), Deutscher Kriegerverein (German Veterans' Club), Oddfellows, Badischer Verein (Badensian Club), Der Voroat des Chicago Turnbezirks (Headquarters of the Chicago Gymnastic Distirct), and Die Vierundzwanziger (the Twenty-four Club).</p>
   <p>Max Stern opened the meeting. F. Demmler was elected chairman, and L. Mueller secretary. Upon the motion of Max Stern it was decided that the German lodges and associations should appear in large numbers and form part of the procession.</p>
   <p>Mayor Harrison was present at the conference and declared it advisable to appoint a leader for the German division. Hermann Pomy was chosen marshal, and he selected the office of Wasmannsdorf and Heineman, 165 East Randolph Street, as headquarters. Clubs and lodges are requested to send information to the above address about the number of persons who will march in the parade.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon a subcommittee met at Quincy Number Nine and passed a resolution to issue the following appeal;</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0905.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"To the German-Americans of Chicago:</p>
   <p>"What good and faithful citizen of this nation has not been deeply affected by the tragic news of our beloved President's death, which shook our great Republic to its very foundation? Who could withhold his tears when we read of the ebbing powers of resistance as Garfield, victim of an assassin, approached his final hour--when we finally realized that this good citizen, compassionate father, faithful husband, profound thinker, great scientist, valiant soldier, and successful and admired statesman had finally reached the boundary of our terrestrial existence and in conformity with inexorable laws was doomed to follow the path which we all eventually must tread?</p>
   <p>"We also, who first saw the light of day on distant shores, in another part of the world, have felt the crushing blow of fate just as intensely as our fellow citizens who were born here because our hearts also throb in unison with the fortunes and the sorrows of this great Republic. We are so firmly <pb facs="5418474_10_0906.jpg" n="4"/>attached to this country and have become such an integral part of it that we are affected even by the most trivial incidents which concern the nation.</p>
   <p>"From that far-off land where our cradles stood, where rulers "by God ordained" waxed fat and lived in splendor derived of the exploitation of their subjects, from that distant domain now emanates a cool indifference toward us; yet our fathers in times of distress defended with their lives its foreign aristocracy. Therefore let us German-Americans atone for the conduct of uncivil officialdom abroad. [Translator's note: The German administration directed Mr. Busch to express regrets for President Garfield's death, whereas a note of this kind should have been written by the emperor or at least by the chancellor.] Let us correct this tactlessness towards our fellow citizens by appearing in full numbers in the memorial procession; let us show that while not forgetting the land of our birth, we are at all times intensely devoted to the land of our choice.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0907.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"For this reason a temporary committee was formed, and a resolution was adopted to invite all German-American clubs, associations, and lodges to participate in the ceremony next Monday. A meeting will be held in the assembly hall of the city council on Saturday at two o'clock to arrange the various details, and the presidents of all German-American clubs of Chicago, or their delegates, are requested to be present.</p>
   <p>"The Committee:</p>
   <p>Max Stern, Emil Dietzsch, Franz Demmler, Hermann Pomy"</p>
   <p>To the German Singers of Chicago</p>
   <p>Emil Dietzsch has written a poem in commemoration of the impending event; Oscar Schmoll has composed the music for the dirge, and a rehearsal has been scheduled for tonight at Athenaeum Hall, 50 North Dearborn Street, Room 7. All German singers are invited to the rehearsal at eight o'clock this evening.</p>
   <p>Franz Amberg,</p>
   <p>President of the American Singers' Alliance.</p>
