  <body>
   <p>The board of directors of the German Society of Chicago met at 5 P. M. yesterday at the office of the Society, 51-53 South LaSalle Street. Mr. George Schneider, chairman of the Board, presided.</p>
   <p>The minutes of the last meeting were adopted as read.</p>
   <p>Colonel Knobelsdorff reported that excellent order prevails at the Home for Needy, and that business matters are well regulated. However, he thinks that the value of all goods donated heretofore is not more than one thousand dollars, the published reports estimate the value at two thousand dollars. A special collection book was used to keep account of donations made to the institution. It was always used by the solicitor of the Home.</p>
   <p>Maintenance cost to date was two hundred dollars.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0937.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The report was adopted after the records of the secretary and treasurer had been examined and approved.</p>
   <p>It was voted to authorize the board of directors of the Home to assume complete charge of the institution, to transact all business connected with the management, to accept or reject applications for admission, etc. The secretary of the German Society of Chicago was instructed to approve payment of all bills presented by the chairman of the board of directors of the institution.</p>
   <p>Mr. H. Enders then reported on the financial status of the Home:</p>

   <p>Cash................................$7,451.62</p>

   <p>Subscribed but not paid................................................... 720.00</p>
   <p>Total.................................................................... $10,228.47</p>
   <p>Eighty collectors have reported so far.</p>
   <p>Mr. Enders was instructed to write receipts for the donations yet to be received and to give these receipts to the collectors.</p>
   <p>Report of Treasurer</p>
   <p>Balance on November 26, 1873...........................................$1,862.66</p>
