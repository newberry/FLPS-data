   <p>The Annual Festival for the Home of the Aged, sponsored by the Communities of Chicago, took place on July 13 at Arlington Park. The weather being favorable, many people participated in the celebration. Indeed, three extra trains had to be put into service to accommodate the crowd, and automobiles congested the highways in large numbers.</p>
   <p>Pastor Carl Noak, chaplain of the Home, opened the services in the park of the institution. Pastor A. H. Werfelmann, of Glenview delivered the festival speech in German. The Jehovah Male Chorus, under the leadership of John Zitzmann, sang hymns of praise before and after the service. The brass band of the Arlington parish regaled the assembly with communal songs and festival music.</p>
   <p>As the afternoon service did not commence until three o'clock in the afternoon, <pb facs="5418474_10_1445.jpg" n="2"/>many strangers had an opportunity to see the Home and the city.</p>
   <p>Pastor E. V. Haserodt was the second speaker. He spoke in English. The choir of Immanuel parish (Pastor E. Holter) sang a German air before and an English song after the sermon. The collection and the proceeds from the booths accrued to the institution. A number of girls also asked for donations to augment the fund for the annex. The festival proved to be a thoroughly pleasant affair.</p>
