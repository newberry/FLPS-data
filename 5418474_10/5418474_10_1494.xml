   <p>The German congregations unite to honor the head of the Church. The Golden Jubilee of Pope Pius X, was celebrated yesterday afternoon by the German Catholic congregations and societies, in the spacious school hall of St. Michael's congregation, North and Hudson Avenues. The celebration was opened by a procession. The marchers formed at Hudson Avenue and Eugenie Street. At their head rode thirty-six policemen under Captain Healy. Then followed marshals and the band of the Chicago district unions of Catholic Societies in Illinois, under whose direction the celebration took place. The banners of the Pope were carried by dignitaries of the Church, and four young honor boys, in white vestments. After these came a youth organization, St. Michael's Band, Knights of St. John, Commandery of St. Michael and St. Alphonsus, St. Paulus Cadets in uniform, societies of St. Michael's Congregation, St. Alphonsus Band and the adult members of thirty-six other German Catholic congregations.</p>

   <p>Accompanied by the firing of cannon, the procession moved through crowds of spectators lining North Avenue, LaSalle Street, Schiller Street, North State Street, and stopped at the residence of Archbishop Quigley. The replate was clad in full offical regalia and rode in a carriage. A number of resolutions directed against all economic ills and requesting all the faithful to display an unlimited loyalty to the Pope, were accepted.</p>
