   <p>The meeting of the German Roman Catholics which has been looked forward to by all the German Catholics of the country with much interest, opened last night at the Battery D Hall. The speaker's platform was decorated with the American and German national colors. The arrangement of the meeting was in the hands of Pastor Wilhelm Tappert of Covington, Kentucky, W. Th. Casper of Milwaukee and Friedrich Arendes of St. Louis. Of course, the German Catholic clergy was represented in large number. In spite of the intense humidity, the interest taken in the proceedings was remarkable. After Pastor Tappert had opened the meeting with a few words of welcome to the delegates and guests, Mr. Spaunhorst stepped on the speaker's platform and delivered the opening address saying: "I choose to salute you with the words, 'Praised be Jesus Christ', for the opening of the first general German Roman Catholic convention of North America. We Catholics of German extraction scattered throughout the country, are glad for this opportunity of meeting here. We are fond of our mother tongue, and hold to the customs and correct morals which we have inherited and have brought with us from the old Fatherland, in high honor. It is well known, that the Germans lack the ability of acquiring large sums of money, or to hunt for big paying positions, but their wealth consists of honesty, faithfulness and will-power".</p>

   <p>The next speaker, Pastor Ferdinand Hundt of St. Peters, Indiana, chose for his theme: "German-Catholics in America". His speech was naturally the most interesting one of the evening. We wish to show to the world, that there is a peaceful relationship between "German and "Catholic" and also to show, that the German-Catholics in this country under the protection of the American flag, have worked in the past and will work in the future for the interest and welfare of their adopted country. But it is that class of German-Americans who are born in this country, or the newly immigrated German people, who feel ashamed of their nationality, who disclaim thier mother tongue and German customs, and who are trying to force their ideas upon us. This sort of German-American is a disgusting mixture, neither German nor American. with the exception of a comparative few, the German-Catholics of America are true to their native country and true to the Christian faith, both of which are almost inseparable. A nation abolishing its mother tongue throws a good deal of its national heirloom overboard.</p>
