   <p>The Germania clubs luncheon in the Cameo room of the Morrison Hotel yesterday morning was in every respect worthy of its predecessors. The program, furnished by the Fritz Renk trio, was at its usual ideal height. Besides Mr. Renk, the cellist, Walter Brauer of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra excelled with two songs. The president of the club, Mr. Otto F. Reich opened with the request to help raise the membership to 5,000. He said amongst others: "In the big drive of the American Welfare Association for the support of the starving children of Germany and Austria, our club has done the utmost, especially is it admirable how our ladies have worked from house to house.</p>
   <p>We proved that we belong to a club, that is not called upon in vain, where charity is concerned. We never had in the clubs history so many members, but we intend to expand even more, our prime purpose being to win 5,000 members. For this reason I ask you, that every member should get one other member, because we want to become the largest club in the city, in order to be able to exercise charity in a still larger measure.</p>

   <p>Mr. Reich was followed by Professor George L. Scherger, who was on the program to relate his experiences in Europe. Professor Scherger answered a request to give his views about the shameless French occupation of the Ruber province, first. He had the following to say: "Chaotic conditions prevail in Europe with the exception of England at present, which must lead to a terrible catastrophe in a short time. The most regrettable aspect of the whole thing is, that we are mainly to blame for such terrible conditions. The German people, unconquered in the field, believed in the 14 points which Woodrow Wilson drew up, the German people believed in the honesty of this government, when it surrendered its arms in November, 1918, in the shameful treaty of Versailles which it signed in the belief of our magnanimity. And what did our government do? Did she protect her former enemy? Had the German people guessed in 1918, how much the promises of a president of the United States were worth, they would have fought to the last man.</p>
