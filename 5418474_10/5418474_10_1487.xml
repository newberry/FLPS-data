   <p>The first German Baptist Congregation, whose lace of worship is located on North Paulina and Superior Street, is going to celebrate its fifty-year jubilee shortly. The celebration begins Sunday, October 23th, with divine services in the morning, on which occasion the former preacher of the congregation, Mr. Jacob Meier and Professor L. Kaiser, of Rochester Baptist Seminary, will hold the festival sermons.</p>
   <p>A RETROSPECT</p>
   <p>The first German Baptist Congregation of Chicago was founded in 1858 with sixteen members, and held its first meeting in a Presbyterian Church near Throop Street. Their first chapel was erected in 1866 on Bickerdyke and West Huron Streets, where services were held till 1886, during which time the <pb facs="5418474_10_1488.jpg" n="2"/>the building was enlarged. In the meantime the congregation founded several missions in different parts of the city, which gradually developed into independent congregations. The first missionary house was erected in South Chicago, later followed by one on Burling and Willow Streets, and a little later again in a house on the southwest side, at present the place of worship of the third Baptist congregation.</p>
   <p>THE PRESENT CHURCH</p>
   <p>In the year 1888 the present house of worship was erected at North Paulina and Superior Streets, and at the same time, one in Harlem, which is now the church of the Oak Park congregation. Ten years later, with the building of a chapel on Courtland Street and Spaulding Avenue, the foundation was laid for the present Humboldt Park congregation, which was joined by 133 members. In the year 1902 forty-five members were released, to form a congregation on 27th Street and 5th Avenue; four years later a Mission on Irving Park started, which is now called the Emmanuel Congregation. After the church on Spaulding and Cortland Avenue, the German Baptist congregation erected in 1896, an old Home, costing 40,000 dollars. Adjoining the church of the First Congregation, <pb facs="5418474_10_1489.jpg" n="3"/>was built a Deaconess and Girls' Home, at a cost of $6,000. The total property value of the German Baptist congregations in Chicago amounts to $150,000. In the course of years a Bohemian mission branched off the First Congregation, which, in the meantime has split into two congregations.</p>
   <p>The first Baptist Congregation has now 550 members. The present minister is S. W. Hainel. For almost twenty-eight years, from 1878 to 1906, Mr. Jacob Meier served as preacher to the congregation. He found about two hundred members scattered all over the city. Under his ministry the congregation has developed a great activity. He was granted the privilege of baptizing twelve hundred persons in their faith. From the sixteen members of the First Congregation of fifty years ago, there became 2,000 members, which are served by eight congregations.</p>
