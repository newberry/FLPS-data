  <body>
   <p>The German Social-Democratic party, the adherents and partisans of which have for decades been designated as "men without a country" by Germany's rulers, has come into power and respect. Already it is participating in the government and seems to be in the process of taking it over completely. At first called a peril to the state, it has now become the coleader and may perhaps turn out to be the saviour of Germany.</p>
   <p>The American social democracy, the followers of which were for decades looked upon as impractical and harmless dreamers, became a danger during the same period, not so much because of its own activities and aspirations--its policies and political activities--but rather because of the war and the course of events in Germany. And it did not really become a danger for the system of government in power, that is, the state, as was the case with the German social democracy, but was mainly a danger for the German <pb facs="5418474_10_0204.jpg" n="2"/>element, which was, more than any other group, drawn to it by its opposition to any national war, an attitude which later developed into an opposition to the raging World War, as well, and America's entry into it. And, here in Illinois, it also endangered a just and lasting peace; and constituted a threat to the German people, to the German social democracy, and to itself.</p>
   <p>The American social democracy, and particularly that of Illinois, endangers--and seriously endangers--a just and lasting peace; it seriously threatens the German social democracy and the German people and, particularly, our citizens of German descent, because it may harm the Democratic Senatorial candidate by nominating Mr. Bross Lloyd; because it may divert many votes from Senator James Hamilton Lewis, President Wilson's candidate, who is a staunch supporter of Wilson's peace policies and a dependable supporter of the President, and thus may pave the way for a victory of the Republican candidate for the United States Senate.</p>
   <p>"During these grim times nothing must stop us from speaking the simple <pb facs="5418474_10_0205.jpg" n="3"/>truth."</p>
   <p>The plain truth is that every vote cast for the Socialist candidate for the United States Senate is a vote against a just peace, a vote for the continuation of the war until Germany and the German people are utterly destroyed; a vote for the kind of peace England and the other powers in the Entente desire; a vote for the worst enemies of social democracy and, especially, of all citizens of German descent and German thought.</p>
   <p>The Democratic party in the past may have bitterly disappointed the expectations that were placed in it. It may have been democratic in name only and, in essence, just as plutocratic as the Republican Party--but since Woodrow Wilson has assumed the leadership, it has become democratic in spirit and action also. The first year of Wilson's administration gave the country more genuinely democratic--social-democratic, the Republicans would say--legislation, than all the social-democratic agitation could have secured in a generation. If the social democrats do not see it this way, because they themselves are not responsible for this legislation; <pb facs="5418474_10_0206.jpg" n="4"/>if they choose to continue to fight the Democratic party because the latter took the wind out of their sails and did not entirely complete their program; if they insist, out of political obstinacy, pride, or envy, on voting for their own candidate, thereby giving their worst enemies hope for success--very well, let them! If some people think it prudent to antagonize the Democrats just to show that they do not like them, and to cut off their noses to spite their faces, we say--let them cut! You can't argue with shortsighted and obstinate dogmatists, sentimentalists and fanatics.</p>
   <p>But no citizen of German descent, at least no reader of the Abendpost, is going to remain unwarned of the great danger which the socialistic agitation constitutes for him and his most vital interests. A citizen of German stock who is for justice and peace, and wants to protect himself and his future, must cast his vote for the candidate endorsed by Wilson, James Hamilton Lewis, even if he has to vote Republican for all the other offices which are to be filled.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0207.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Every American of German origin who helps to make the United States Senate a Republican body and helps to turn it over the leadership of a Henry Cabot Lodge, is voting against himself and his own future. Self-preservation is the first law.</p>
