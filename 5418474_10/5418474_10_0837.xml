   <p>Two Chicago German societies, the Turngemeinde and the Sennefelder Liederkranz, are preparing to celebrate Sept. 23, the one hundredth birthday of Karl Theodor Koerner. The Chicago Turngemeinde has already prepared an elaborate program and proposes to make the celebration a festival to which the Germans from all parts of the city and country will be invited Rabbi Hirsh will be the speaker of the evening. Several of Koerner's songs will be rendered by different singing societies, and the program will include the representation of one of Koerner's plays, as well as tableaux representing scenes from the war against Napoleon. The Sennefelder Liederkranz will under the leadership of Hans Balatka celebrate the day in similar fashion.</p>
   <p>Theodore Koerner was born Sep. 23, 1791 in Dresden. It was he who wrote during the Franco-Prussian War the stirring songs which have become famous throughout Germany and are today classed among the best poems of German literature. In the battle of Gadebusch he was fatally wounded, and died on the field. Although only twenty four years old when he died, he had written a number of dramas and comedies, of which "Zriny" is the best known, and several volumes of poems and songs.</p>
