   <p>The sensation of the day is caused by the message of the rebel leader, Carranza, sent to the president of the United States. The message caused a sensation only among those whose political and diplomatic point of view stops at the end of their noses. It is not necessary to possess the faculty of hearing the grass grow to be able to prophecy the constitutionalists' deportment, as we did at the time the entanglements were in their infancy, and when our administration found it advisable to choose the smaller of the Mexican evils: those of Carranza and Villa. With Carranza's support the government of the United States conferred a certain degree of legitimacy upon the constitutionalists, and this point of view, would have compelled our government to maintain a position when the Tampico incident occurred, that would have differed from the one taken. On April 16th, at a time when the incident was but in an embryonic state and one thought of slaughter, we wrote as follows: "We do not want to argue whether our government should see in the Tampico incident, an intentional insult to the American people, but if the administration is sensitive in this respect, as it was during the whole course of the Mexican disturbances, which brought it so many humiliating rejections, it is not Huerta whom they characterized as a contemptible bloodhound and with whom they declined to have any connection, but the acknowledged favorite, Carranza, expecting of him the liquidation of the <pb facs="5418474_10_0227.jpg" n="2"/>disgrace caused the American people. Merely a refusal by Carranza to give satisfaction for the insult committed on Mexican soil should cause the administration in Washington to feel justified in securing such satisfaction through the use of arms. And now comes Carranza, eight days after the above lines have been written, and demands in his message to the president, that the American soldiers should be recalled from Mexican soil. If the United States has been insulted, and is asking for satisfaction, it should turn to him or to the constitutionalist government whose chief he has a right to be considered, since Washington conceded him this position. The Illinois Staats Zeitung was the only paper seen amongst all American newspapers regardless of the language in which they are printed, which stuck to the logic of facts, and whose standpoint was fully justified to the last letter by later events. President Wilson rejected the demand of Carranza with the argument that he could not negotiate with him, and that he (Wilson) had to deal with Huerta, because he was in actual control of the Mexican government, as well as in control of that section of the country occupied by our soldiers. The Illinois Staats Zeitung wrote under the same date of April 16th, as follows: "Now we can point out that Tampico is not yet in the hands of the constitutionalists, and the satisfaction we demand is from the place where the insult occurred, therefore only in Tampico."</p>
