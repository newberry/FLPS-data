   <p>The Chicago branch of the Bund Deutsch-Amerikanischer Buerger (Federation of German-American Citizens) held its first public meeting last evening in the Lincoln Turner Hall. The session was well attended, especially by German societies. The Gesangverein Hermann Schwestern (Choral Section of the Hermann Sisters), under the leadership of Mr. Johannes Schulze, contributed to the enjoyment of the evening by rendering several vocal selections. The Gesangverein Harmonie, Fidelia, Harugari Choral Federation, Schweizer Maennerchor (Swiss Male Chorus), and Mozart Maennerchor, all members of the Bund Deutsch-Amerikanischer Buerger, also sang. They were led by Mr. H. von Oppen, and merited the applause of the audience. Several vocal solo numbers, too, were rendered.</p>
   <p>Ferdinand Walther, president, opened the meeting, whereupon Judge Michael F. Girten spoke on the topic, "Training in American Citizenship"</p>
   <p>Mr. Girten declared that Germans are not strangers in this country, but that <pb facs="5418474_10_0629.jpg" n="2"/>their presence in America dates back to colonial times. "They earned their right to American citizenship by participating in the movement for America's independence, and by fighting for America's liberty in the Revolutionary War." The speaker stressed the necessity of holding on to the achievements of those struggles, the Constitution and representative government. He reminded the audience of Washington's "Farewell Address" to the American people and Thomas Jefferson's letters and addresses and called them a "precious heritage". He declared that, as long as our people cling to our American form of government, nothing can hinder the successful development of the American people.</p>
   <p>"Unfortunately," he said, "we have failed to give this matter its due attention during the past few years. Therefore, it is necessary that we recover what we have lost. To that end we of German descent must reassert our rights, and it is our special duty to acquaint ourselves with the prevalent social problems, and help solve them, and also study our national needs. The philosophy of Adam Smith, of England, must be abandoned, must be applied no more by our <pb facs="5418474_10_0630.jpg" n="3"/>industrialists. The employers in America must learn to treat their employees as human beings, and fellow citizens, and not as material things. Employers and employees must work together, and not against each others, so that conditions as they exist in Russia do not gain a foothold in our country. To solve this problem, we need pamphlets, lectures, and newspapers. It is incumbent upon the public press to introduce immigrants to American life. From the very beginning the Americans of German descent have contributed to the development of American culture....They never dreamed of establishing a second Germany here. They were never anything but good Americans, for this country is their home. But they have sinned, by 'keeping their light under a bushel,' and they received the punishment for this sin during the World War. Now it is up to them to see that their contributions to the cultural development of America receive due recognition, and participation in the primary election and in the regular election is an effective means to that end. The American nation must become a thinking nation; then it will remain an independent nation."</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0631.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The Reverend Alfred Meyer was the second speaker of the evening. His subject was "The Preservation of German Culture". He expressed the following thoughts:</p>
   <p>"It is wrong to think that Americans of German descent would enjoy more honor and success, if they would practice camouflage in order to conceal their German origin. The opposite is true. They can retain the respect of their fellow citizens only by honest deportment and concerted action. Americans of German descent can look back to a glorious past, and just recently their loyalty was put to a severe test, but it was not found wanting. While it is true that Disraeli said that a German is the 'best fertilizer for culture,' his words can be interpreted to mean only that this 'fertilizer' sheds its nature in the act of impregnation....Because we love this country, we must see to it that German culture does not perish here. We must foster German culture--music, art, science, dramatics, and physical culture."</p>
   <p>In conclusion the Reverend Meyer requested the audience to try to gain new <pb facs="5418474_10_0632.jpg" n="5"/>members for the Bund Deutsch-Amerikanischer Buerger, and to show more interest in local, state and national politics, not as a German party, but as individual American citizens, in order to avert attacks and to elect men who understand and respect German ideas and German character.</p>
   <p>Thereupon the secretary of the Bund spoke about the purpose of the organization.</p>
