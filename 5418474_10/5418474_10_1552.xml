   <p>The well-known Lincoln Park Congregational Church corner of Garfield Avenue and Mohawk Street has been bought by the Lutheran Johannes Congregation, which had their church on North Park Avenue and were making arrangments to build a new church.</p>
   <p>The new property of the church represents a value of $50,000 but has been sold for $24,000. The church has seating capacity for 1200 persons, is elegantly furnished and has one of the best organs in town, The Johannes congregation and their Shepards, Mr. Zimmermann and Mr. Klein can be congratulated to have come into possession of such a favorably situated completely furnished church in such a manner. They will move in the beginning of October, after the necessary improvements and decorations have been completed.</p>
