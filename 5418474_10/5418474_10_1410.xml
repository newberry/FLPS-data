<title level="a">THE UNION OF GERMAN-AMERICAN CITIZENS PROTESTS AGAINST NATIONAL ORIGIN CLAUSE.</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A protest resolution against the National Origin Clause, of the Immigration Law, was accepted at a meeting of the Union of German-American Citizens of America, and is to be forwarded to all the members of the United States Senate. At the same time United States Senator Deneen, is requested to introduce a countermand of this clause, to the Senate.</p>
   <p>The protest resolution is worded as follows: "The Union of German-American Citizens of the United States, considers the clause of the present Immigration Law as an extremely unjustified, thoughtless and prejudicial act of legislation.</p>
   <p>"Out of this clause speaks, a rude distortion of our historical past, a defamation of our National development and a mistaking of present endeavors of the upholding of the National type.</p>
   <p>"This clause must lead to discord and discontent among the majority of the <pb facs="5418474_10_1411.jpg" n="2"/>population. The quality of our citizens will be degraded instead of being uplifted, which is the purpose, according to the assertion of their defenders.</p>
   <p>"The Union of German-American Citizens agrees, wholeheartedly, with the opinion of President Hoover, who thinks that the present clause of "National Origins", in establishing the Immigration quotas of the different nationalities, is without any reliable foundation. We consider it as a duty of your corporate body, either to remove the clause in its entirety or at least to postpone its becoming law, until a more satisfactory way to solve this question is found.</p>
   <p>"The Union of German-American Citizens, consider it essential to the interest of our country, that Congress at the coming special session assume the necessary measure to induce either a countermand or a further postponement.</p>
   <p>"Since the initiative is obligatory to Congress, we expect that you will apply your influence, to bring into effect the acceptance of a suitable modification.</p>
   <p>"The Union of German-American Citizens of the United States</p>
   <p>"Herman Wollberger, President."</p>
