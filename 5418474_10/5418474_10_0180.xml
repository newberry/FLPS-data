   <p>The magnificent peace celebration in New York has been taken advantage of for an attempt to create a permanent organization of the Germans in America. It is not the question of a German party (which would be a castle in Spain) but of an organized collaboration to preserve those German peculiarities which are to be regarded as a substantial gain for the American national character.... This is a point of view which does not in the least clash with a just acknowledgement of all that the Germans can learn from the Anglo-American character. It is not a German know-nothingism. Only a foundation shall be laid for the complete equality of the various national characters that will eventually merge, from the American character. This can be brought about only when the Germans with assured self-confidence hold fast to their virtues and force the other members of the population to respect them...In order to gain influence for the German-Americans in this country, it is not necessary to prove that Germany has achieved great and meritorious things, but that the German-Americans themselves deserve respect for their intellect, morality and active energy.</p>

   <p>Among the aims of the proposed association the New Yorkers mention "making felt in politics the influence that is due the Germans". This is vague and only emphasizes a cliff on which the whole enterprise might easily go to wreck. A collaboration of the German-Americans in politics is as unthinkable and undesriable as it would be in religion. And any attempt in that direction will fail for the simple reason that the concept of German nationality (deutsche Stammesangehorsgkeit) does not correspond with any particular political or religious philosophy. Common endeavor, however, is well imaginable in regard to the following "objects of the association's activity".</p>
   <p>1. Furtherance of the German language in school and home, through promotion of its use in German families; founding and fostering of German schools, reading rooms, libraries etc.</p>
   <p>2. Furtherance of German clubs through founding and fostering of German societies and beginning of systematic collaboration.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0182.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>3. Furtherance of the material and legal interests of the Germans in America -through influence exercised on the legislature, through legal protective associations, furtherance and increase of German immigrants' benevolent and relief societies.</p>
   <p>4. Furtherance of the feeling of national unity - through extension of the national society over the whole Union, through German-American national conventions, through founding and annual celebration of a national holiday.</p>
   <p>In regard to these objects we would like to see the Germans collaborate without difference of political partisanship or religious confession. What it will be possible to actually achieve in this direction is another question, that will find an answer when one is in a festive mood, and a different one if one form's one's opinion by past experience. But if New York shows the way by a successful example, the realization of the desired union may possibly be easier than those whose expectations have been lessened by unfortunate experience would be inclined to believe.</p>
