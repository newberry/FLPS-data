  <body>
   <p>The large annual fair of the German Catholic St. Paul's Church, 163-165 Ambrose Street, which started today, will be extended over ten various and carefully prepared evening entertainments. The well-known rector of the church, George Heldmann, has made the arrangements and the preparations were made under his supervision. The different organizations of the church, as well as the members in general, have been working together with eagerness to offer their guests original and stimulating entertainment.</p>
   <p>The Bazaar opened with a musical evening with the cooperation of 60 members of the church. Tomorrow night the young men's club will entertain the visitors with their gymnastics. The next evening will be a huge procession of the workers exhibiting their different trades and skills. A special evening is dedicated to the charity organizations of the church. A beautiful flower decoration will characterize the evening for the women of the church.</p>
   <p>One evening will be given to propaganda for the extension of the transportation facilities on 22nd Street, and it is expected that it will make adequate impression upon the respective officials. During another evening the members <pb facs="5418474_10_1597.jpg" n="2"/>of the church will appear in their various national costumes. Instructions and demonstrations on the recently introduced Australian election system will occupy another evening. This will present a welcome opportunity to many a citizen to receive desirable information and preparation. The last evening will have special attraction. A debate and contest will take place to show the relative strength of both political parties.</p>
