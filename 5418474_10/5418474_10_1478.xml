   <p>Yesterday was an important day for the Evangelical Lutheran Bethel Church. They celebrated the laying of the cornerstone of the new House of Worship, which is being erected at West-End and 42nd Avenue and is to be finished at the end of November. This new church will contain 500 seats. It is built in the Gothic-Roman style and the cost is estimated at $18,000.00.</p>
   <p>The old church, having about 250 members and being established about 20 years ago, is located at Carroll Street and 43rd Avenue. Quite a few of the "German"Sister Churches took part in the ceremony, which began about 3 o'clock.</p>
   <p>The pastor of the Church laid the cornerstone and a number of pastors assisted him. Several short addresses were given by the ministers present.</p>
