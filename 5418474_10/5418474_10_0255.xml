   <p>It can not be denied that the star spangled banner is being misused. One can see it everywhere; on loaves of bread, on patent medicines, on soap wrappings, on handerchiefs, on lingerie, and what not. All this, is, unquestionably, very regrettable misconduct, but worse yet was the legislative regulation that the American flag must wave day after day from all public buildings and all schools.</p>
   <p>Americans like their flag very much, and its misuse is not due to bad intentions, but to a lack of a proper estimation of the "eternal fitness of things." There is an uncertainity existing as to the manner of expressing ones sentiments, respect and love. The recent demonstration of the star spangled banner made it very obvious. As soon as war was declared Flags went up everywhere. All houses and windows were decorated with it; and the star spangled banners waved in the wind day and night for four months. Cities looked like places of great festivities. If we would have lost a battle and would have had heavy losses of human lives, the banners would have waved in the air, proudly and defiantly in spite of misfortune.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0256.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>When the peace treaty was signed, the removal would have been required according to this logic, but this seemed to betray a certain regret that the shedding of blood was over, and this was not true.</p>
   <p>The result is, that flags are still waving and they will remain until wind and weather destroys them. One would be glad not to see anymore the torn and soiled banners.</p>
