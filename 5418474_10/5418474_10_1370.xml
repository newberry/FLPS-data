   <p>The Evangelical Immanuel Parish, 17th Street and Michigan Avenue, looks back this week on fifty years of existence. It has planned a number of fitting festivities.</p>
   <p>Next Sunday, September 24, there will be German services at 9 A.M. and English services at 10:45 A.M., at which Pastor W. Rathmann from Bartlett, Illinois, and Pastor A. A. Zimmermann, president of the Northern Illinois district, will deliver festive sermons. The ladies' club has planned an excellent noon dinner, in which all members of the parish and their friends may participate. The price will be fifty cents per person, in keeping with the times and circumstances. Reservations should be made in advance. Late in the afternoon and evening, further celebrations will be held in the church; affiliated parishes will participate.</p>

   <p>All parish members and their friends are invited to the jubilee banquet which will be served at 6:30 P.M., Thursday, September 28, at the same moderate price. Here, too, advance reservations are necessary, as many guests are expected.</p>
   <p>Also, during the month of October, there will be festive services every Sunday, and other celebrations will be held in connection with the Golden Jubilee. Among other things, the church choir has arranged for a musical evening on Thursday, October 12. The following Thursday, October 19, the young men and young ladies will entertain the members of youth organizations of other parishes.</p>
   <p>The parish was founded September 12, 1883, at Dearborn and 46th Streets. In 1914 it was moved to 70th Street and Michigan Avenue. There, in 1929, the present modern parish hall and the pastor's house were added to the church.</p>
   <p>During the fifty years of its existence the parish has four spiritual leaders: Pastor Wilhelm Hattendorf, 1883-1914; Pastor John Bollens, 1914-1922;</p>

   <p>Pastor Georg Hildebrand, 1922-24; and the present pastor, Hermann J. Schick, since 1924. They have officiated at 3683 baptisms, 1383 weddings, and 2676 funerals.</p>
