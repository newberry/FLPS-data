  <body>
   <p>When it comes to celebrating anniversaries in a worthy manner, the German-Americans, as is well-known, rank among the first.</p>
   <p>A worthy anniversary celebration on the occasion of the two hundredth birthday of George Washington, which was held at the Midland Club, united the leaders of the German-American department of the Illinois Washington Bicentennial Commission with those of the German Club and other German-American societies. The festivity was well-attended, thanks to the efforts of the chairman, Charles W. Peters, and of Ernest Kruetgen, president of the City Commission of the Bicentennial celebration.</p>
   <p>After an excellent lunch Charles W. Peters made a few introductory remarks in which he expressed his pleasure at the large attendance and welcomed the audience heartily. He was followed by the vice-president of the Board of Local Improvements, Ernest J. Kruetgen, who, as toastmaster, introduced the principal <pb facs="5418474_10_1065.jpg" n="2"/>speaker for the day, Congressman William H. Dietrich of Beardstown, Illinois.</p>
   <p>Mr. Kruetgen's address to his fellow countrymen was the expression of that love and highest esteem which he felt towards the great leader who was born to the American people, namely, George Washington. He also declared how proud he was of those people of German origin who were the friends and coworkers of Washington, beginning with the plain soldier up to those who held the highest positions in his army during the war for independence.</p>
