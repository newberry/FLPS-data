   <p>In spite of the severe blow struck the United States by the death of Lincoln, the scarcity of gold and silver, and other factors, the German societies began to flourish during the period after the Civil War.</p>
   <p>The Germania Men's Chorus sang at the bier of Lincoln, and even the English papers of those times admitted that the singing of this chorus was one of the most striking features of the funeral ceremonies.</p>
   <p>The Chicago Sharpshooters Society, already organized in 1863, increased so rapidly in memberships it could take the risk of buying a shooting stand in Lakeview for thirty thousand dollars.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0465.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The North American Sharpshooters Festival was held at the new stand, and was attended by a large number of sharpshooters.</p>
   <p>In 1869 the Turners held their union festivals, which was very lively. The Turner Society Vorwarts obtained first prize through a guest turner, John Gloy, a cabinetmaker, who arrived only lately from Germany.</p>
   <p>Festival followed festival. Chicago became more and more the center of meetings of the united societies. Carl Schurz was working as editor on the Post, which was published in Watertown, Wisconsin. The war of 1870-71 was tensely followed; the news of victory received with great enthusiasm, and the founding of the German Empire celebrated with elaborate festivals. This condition lasted till after the Great Fire in 1871, when, after the clearing up and rebuilding of the city, the German talent for organization came again to the fore. But then it began to go downwards as a result of political <pb facs="5418474_10_0466.jpg" n="3"/>differences. From this dissension they could not easily recover, but as long as the German Empire stood powerful, a holding together was felt which quite often could be observed. The social life progressed and was industriously cultivated.</p>
