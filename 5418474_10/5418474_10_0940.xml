   <p>While Germanism in Chicago has kept pace with Germans in other cities, such has not been the case as far as social life is concerned. There was lacking a center from which all the German undertakings could proceed. There was lacking a place to which the German business man could go to rest after the day's labor. Such a place will now be made. As Baltimore has its "Concordia", St. Louis its "Germania", New York its "Liederkranz", so Chicago will now have its club called the "German Club".</p>
   <p>The best site for the new Club building is considered to be on North Clark St. between Ohio and Superior Streets. Plans for the building are still incomplete, but it will contain a big hall, library, reading room,mucic room, billiard room, restaurant, etc. There will be two classes of members, ordinary members who are stock-holders, and extra-ordinary members, who pay an annual fee. Prospects for the subscribing of the stock-capital, which has been put at $50,000, are excellent.</p>
