   <p>Following an old custom the Swabian Society celebrated yesterday in the Northside Turner Hall, the anniversary of Frederich Schiller's birthday, who was born 165 years ago in Swabia. Johann Frederich Schiller is not only a Swabian, he was one of the greatest Germans who ever lived, and for this reason, representatives from all sections of Germany, besides the members of the society, were present to help celebrate the beautiful festival.</p>
   <p>The Schiller celebration by the Swabian Society is always more like a family affair, and so it was this year too. The Genefelder Liederkranz which was strongly represented, took over four numbers, and executed them under the direction of the second leader Joseph Keller, in a brilliant manner. Especially Seidl's "The sun went down" and Socinet's "The Sailors Grave" pleased those present. The audience listened with close attention, and demanded additonal songs which were gladly given by the society.</p>
   <p>After president Wm. Jauss's short speech of welcome, Pastor Alfred Meyer followed with a memorial address, which lasted more than one hour, but in spite of it <pb facs="5418474_10_0581.jpg" n="2"/>the guests displayed a great interest to the end. The theme was: "The tenth is bigger than the eleventh." The speaker pointed to the fact, that November 10th is the birthday of the great man to whom the festival was dedicated, the greatest apostle of liberty who planted the ideas of liberty so deeply into the German people, in contrast to November 11th, the day of the Armistice, the day of Germany's disgrace, the day on which its slavery started. The tenth is bigger than the eleventh the speaker continued, because it deals with a deception, which must be corrected. On November 11th the German people were deceived by a far superior enemy with hypocritical words, the fourteen points were not kept. That bill is therefore false. The real fact is, that on November 10th, the greatest thought of liberty was brought to the German people in Frederich Schiller; this thought of liberty is deep rooted and it will live forever, as long as the German tongue is heard. A nation that produces a man like Schiller, cannot be destroyed by force or underhanded tricks. Frederich Schiller lives and therefore the German people will shake off the chains of slavery in spite of the Versailles Treaty. The tenth of November is greater than the eleventh.</p>
