   <p>It can no longer be claimed, that in a large city like Chicago a getting together of all"Germans" for the celebration of the "German" Day is impossible since such a celebration has taken place recently even in New York. "Germanism" is far more influential in Chicago than New York, However, the "Germans" in Chicago have not been sufficiently aroused to be fully aware of their own importance. They seem to have no desire for politics and even along other lines they do not play the role in public life which they should due to their numerical strength and intellectual culture. They do not assert themselves and hence they are overlooked. Perhaps it is rather a lack of knowledge, that the "German-Americans" fail to understand the importance of "Germanism" in the development of this country. This can only be remedied, if the "Germans" themselves show up these facts in their real significance. A demonstration showing the arrival of "German" pilgrims 200 years ago, will accomplish much. It will remind the Americans that the "Germans" have their pioneers in this country as well as the "Anglo-Saxons." Other ways and means must be used besides this demonstration. The proposition to organize a club for historical research of "Germanism" in the United States, is worthy of <pb facs="5418474_10_0836.jpg" n="2"/>serious condideration. This research Society should then find entrance into the new Chicago University. Another suggestion that should not be ignored is the erection of monuments for real outstanding great "German-Americans."</p>
