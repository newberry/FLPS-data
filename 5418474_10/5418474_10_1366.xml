   <p>(During 1870-1893), An influx from abroad was filling, up certain sections, that presaged far-reaching home adjustments. The St. Paul's church of old was no longer a neighborhood church. New home missionary ventures were launched, in every possible nook and corner, little frame churches or other more formidable buildings were either bought outright or quickly erected. The St. Pauls members, who lived a bit far from Ohio and LaSalle Streets, those more specifically, who lived in the town of Lake View, were really importuned to disassociate themselves from the mother church and come to worship in the little nearby houses of prayer. The old mother church--now found itself in no small predicament.</p>
   <p>On a certain morning, the residents of Lincoln Park surroundings awoke to find the excavator squads busily at work at the corner of Orchard Street and Kemper Place, a formidable, spacious complex of land, still strongly <pb facs="5418474_10_1367.jpg" n="2"/>wooded with the mighty trees of an infinite past. Suffice it to say that after daily careful supervision by a competent Committee on Building Operations, there dawned the happy day, when the portals of Chicago's then most pretentious church were thrown open.</p>
