   <p>One of the caprices of Secretary of State Fish was, his opposing of a German-American to be appointed for the post of a consul in Germany. Rumor had it that this was Bismarck's suggestion the grounds that such positions occupied by the 48ters would lead to a revival of revolutionary activities and thus could bring about trouble in Germany. But this was proven to be incorrect, furthermore, Bismarck favoured the idea of German American consuls for Germany.</p>
   <p>Those of German-Americans appointed for consular service for Germany and various other European countries, proved themselves worthy of their office, but with one exception that of the honest but eccentric Gustav Struve (deceased) who as the United States consul in Sonneberg committed several indiscretions which prompted the then States minister Seward who appointed him for that office, to recall him. Trouble which Struve the great 48ter caused was not of much significance and long since forgotten. Seward the great statesman notwithstanding the experience with Struve did not hesitate to appoint German-Americans to this post again and immediately chose Mr. Hirschbach of Illinois as Struve's successor to Sonneberg.</p>

   <p>The new Secretary of State Evarts does not share Mr. Fish's prejudices but declared in a discussion which he had with the Chicago congressman Brentano who was a very able consul at Dresden, but through Fish's action lost out. He said: "The State Department will not follow Fish's principles whereby German Americans or naturalized citizens of the United States would not be eligible for consular or diplomatic appointments in their native country, moreover appointments to such office will be made regardless of the fact where the individual happened to be born.</p>
