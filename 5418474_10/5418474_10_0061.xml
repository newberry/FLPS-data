   <p>Yesterday marked the beginning of the school year 1914-15, and within the next few days all school children in or beyond the fifth grade in elementary school will be handed the well-known German questionaire, which means that the parents or guardians of such children will be asked whether or not they desire to have their children given instruction in the German language.</p>
   <p>German-American parents will know what to do. During these great days for Germany, they do not have to be preached to. It is their duty to their children, to themselves, and to the German element within this nation, to answer this question in the affirmative.</p>
   <p>It is simply unthinkable that there should be any cases, even isolated ones, where the value of the German language should have to be explained to <pb facs="5418474_10_0062.jpg" n="2"/>German-American parents, or where it should be necessary to point out to them that knowledge of the German language will prove to be of inestimable value to their children, and that it is their duty to secure German instruction for their children. But we are living in turbulent times. The war is uppermost in everybody's mind. Then there is politics and--last but not least--the daily struggle to make a living, which the war with its consequences has augmented. There is danger that questions pertaining to school may be relegated to the background; that some people may forget to put down that important "yes," or to ask their boy or girl for the questionaire in case they did not get one or have lost or "forgotten" it. Just because this "yes" is taken as a matter of course, it may be overlooked, as one takes everyday matters for granted.</p>
   <p>That is why we give this reminder. Furthermore:</p>
   <p>We point out to German-Americans that it is positively their duty to make it clear to their now-German fellow-citizens that the German language is of <pb facs="5418474_10_0063.jpg" n="3"/>great importance now, but even more so in the future. We attempt to make them understand that it is their duty too, for their children's sake and for the country, to take care that German is taught as much and as extensively as possible, because the German language is destined to become the world language, and that he who does not master it to some degree at least, will suffer economic disadvantages or will have less chance of progress than those who understand and speak German. If not yet today, the German language surely is bound to become the second language of the land and the world language within the near future. It is the duty of every good parent to take good care that his children learn this language.</p>
   <p>In former years it was sometimes impossible to have all children get German instruction who were enrolled for it because of a lack of capable teachers. This is not the case today. Supervisor Schmidhofer reports that there is sufficient teaching personnel for all the schools. In February, 1911, only about seven thousand elementary school children were taught German. In February, 1915, that last figure should be twice as high and all the pupils <pb facs="5418474_10_0064.jpg" n="4"/>in the four upper grades should learn German! By that time it would be advisable to start with German in the first grade, to make this instruction general in all Chicago schools and to put it on an equal footing with English!</p>
