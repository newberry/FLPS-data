   <p>The first mass-meeting of the district organizations of the German Catholic Societies of Chicago was held last night in the spacious assembly hall of St. Michael's congregational school. The reason why the Catholic Societies desire to be united is to give all the members a chance to join in the discussion of religious questions as well as those of public interest. The meeting was presided over by Professor A. Lauth and the welcoming address was delivered by Rector Beil of St. Michael's Church. The speaker of the evening was Mr. John Grzybowski, who chose for his subject "What does the workingman owe the Catholic Church? What does he expect of the State?" He referred to the misery of the masses to the benefits derived by unity, and stated that the Catholic Church was an indispensable factor in solving social questions. He denounced the employment of women and children in big industries and spoke for a more just distribution of tax assessments. He finally introduced two resolutions which were passed unanimously. They are the following: 1. We demand that the state recognizes the just demands of the oppressed working class. 2. We appeal to the chosen leaders of Catholicism to introduce in this country courses, after the pattern of the well known social courses in Germany, for the study of <pb facs="5418474_10_1524.jpg" n="2"/>social problems, and means of remedying them...</p>
   <p>Then Attorney M. Girten spoke and denounced the government for its activities against the Indian-Catholic schools. The next speaker was August Benz, whose subject was: "The St. Joseph Home at Shermerville, our German school for industry; a contribution to solving the social question". The last speaker was Joseph Matt, editor of the Wanderer in St. Paul, who spoke on the present political conditions. He said: "The star spangled banner, the symbol of freedom, has become merely a sign of oppression." He protested against the sacrilege committed by American Troops against Catholic churches in the Philippines.</p>
   <p>Three more resolutions have been passed unanimously, they are the following: 1. We energetically protest against the execution of the Treaty by the Government, in the case of the Indian-Catholic schools. 2. Great satisfaction was voiced by the meeting concerning the erection of St. Joseph's Home. 3. The repeated protest against the sacrilege committed against Catholic churches in the Philippines.</p>
