   <p>Five years have passed since representatives of the German Associations of Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois in the hall of the old honorable German Society of Pennsylvania, founded the German-American National Union of the U. St. of America. On the place, where Dr. Oswald Seidensticker and Dr. Gottlieb Keller had worked, they pledged to continue the work of these founders of the German Day, and to make the 6th of October a National Anniversary of the German Americans . Like the Irish celebrate their St. Patrick's Day, the French their Storming of the Bastille, so the German-American should proudly acknowledge German Day as a remembrance of his birth and descent. Local conditions may make the celebration of the German day more suitable in the open before the 6th of October; also on certain holidays. At these preliminary festivals the idea of the unity can be proclaimed to the people which should be revived afresh at the German Day of each year, be it in the family, in the community, or in meetings, wherever German-Americans assemble.</p>
   <p>Last year the National-German Day, on the occasion of the world's fair has been celebrated at St. Louis by delegates of the German American Press and eminent <pb facs="5418474_10_1335.jpg" n="2"/>German-Americans in such a worthy manner, that German Day was one of the most remarkable gala days of the world's fair. This year the German-American National Union will celebrate the National German Day in connection with its third National Convention, taking place October 4, 5, 6 and 7th at Indianapolis and would greatly appreciate the support of the German American Press. A hearty invitation is sent to all German-Americans, to take part in this celebration of German Day.</p>
   <p>Whoever cannot come personally, may send us a dedication in poetry or prose by telegram or letter. Our German-American Professors, poets, artists, journalists, composers,pedagoques teachers, history-writers etc. are asked to send their dedication and literary contributions, which will be openly read at the celebration October 6th and be published in the German-American annals. Plastic designs for a Pastoral memorial, sketches, pictures, etc. will be exhibited during the period of the convention. The address is: National-Union, German House, Indianapolis, Indiana. It is hoped that this celebration of the Germans of the U. S. will bring the parties closer together in an intellectual union, and induce them to arrange future celebrations of German Day. This is the hearty wish of the Board of the German-American Union.</p>
   <p>The Committee.</p>
