<title level="a">GERMAN-DAY COMMITTEE ELECTS OFFICIALS FOR 1930</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Amid strong participation, this year's delegates met at the general convention held at the Hotel Atlantic to select the officials for the ensuing year. J. W. Kobalter was re-elected president of the committee.</p>
   <p>After submission of the year's reports, which were read by the president, the financial secretary and the treasurer of the committee, the new officers were elected. Delegates were present in huge numbers, and the hall proved too small for the purpose, many having to be content with standing room.</p>
   <p>Scores of candidates were nominated, but all declined excepting J. W. Kobalter and Leopold Saltiel, speaker of the Illinois Gymnastic District, who were willing to accept if elected. The ballots showed one hundred and twenty-four votes for Kobalter and seventy-seven for Saltiel. Thus the former president was re-elected.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0525.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>George Weideling, Dr. William Teichmann, and Fred Rixmann obtained the largest number of votes for the next office, and so became first, second, and third vice-presidents. Among the ladies, Mrs. Huch was given the highest number; whereupon she qualified as fourth vice-president.</p>
   <p>The other election results are: Prommrich replaces Justus Emme as correspondence secretary; William Behrens becomes recording secretary; Joe Schmittel, financial secretary; Herman Loesicke, treasurer; and A. Glauche, supervisor.</p>
   <p>William Behrens, Schmittel, and Loesicke acted in the same capacity last year. The election of committee chairmen had to be postponed for the December delegation due to the late hour. Induction of officers will then be on the agenda. Justus Emmer was nominated honorary secretary in recognition of his valued services during the preceding year.</p>
   <p>The Reports of 1929</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0526.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Financial secretary Schmittel gave an account of receipts and expenditures in 1929. He showed that admissions and other sources up to November 18, produced an income of $7,980.25, and that expenditures mounted to $8,664.24. The German-Day Celebration Committee, also, paid $1,500 rent for the Stadium. Mr. Schmittel declared that some clubs have refrained, even unto the present day, from giving an account of the blocks of tickets entrusted to them; and that participants in the historical groups failed to return costumes loaned to them.</p>
   <p>Treasurer Loesicke, in speaking about the financial aspect of the committee, showed that a surplus of the German-Day celebration in 1928 apparently covers the recent loss, and that the present fund, therefore, amounts to $637.47.</p>
   <p>The assembly relieved its officials of further responsibility after the statement of account was found correct and accepted.</p>
   <p>In his report about the last German-Day celebration, Dr. Kobalter enumerated the difficulties which arose due to the extensive program. He thanked all officials and delegates for their cooperation, the press for its support, and <pb facs="5418474_10_0527.jpg" n="4"/>the South Park Board for its courtesy in reducing the rent of the Stadium by five hundred dollars.</p>
