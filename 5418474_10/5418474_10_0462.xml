   <p>Yesterday evening the new clubhouse of the Deutsche Volksbund (German People's Alliance) was solemnly dedicated. The clubhouse is on the corner of Byron and Ashland Avenues. It is simple but attractive, and was erected under the supervision of a committee headed by Mr. Clemens Rath. In the building there is a reception room, an office, and a large hall with stage, cloakroom, and the other usual arrangements. The furnishings are simple, durable, and in good taste.</p>
   <p>On all sides the guest beholds the black, white, and red colors, and the swastika, for the Deutsche Volksbund is the organization of local Germans who are pledged to Adolf Hitler's cause. The leader (Fuehrer) of the Bund, Mr. Fritz Gissibl, heartily welcomed the members and guests who were present. He thanked those who had co-operated in the building and decorating of the clubhouse, and expressed the hope that it would develop into a home and meeting place for the whole German community of Chicago.</p>

   <p>Mr. Gissibl also stated that the National Socialists had ceased to be a party; that in Germany they were the embodiment of the will of the German people, while abroad they were the representatives of the German race. Then, in short, clear sentences, the speaker set forth the principles and purposes of National Socialism, and announced, among other things, that the Volksbund would soon establish a German school in Chicago.</p>
   <p>Consul Wilhelm Tannenberg and Vice-Consul Noehring, of the local German General Consulate, were present as representatives of the German Government. Consul Tannenberg extended the greetings and best wishes of the General Consulate and of the German Government, and expressed his hope that the new home of the Volksbund would be a concentration point for German forces abroad. This was the conclusion of the official part of the program....</p>
