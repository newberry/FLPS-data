   <p>It is a beautiful custom to set aside one day, every year, to pay tribute to the memory of the men who gave their lives for this country. Our patriotically inspired citizens commemorated this day, yesterday, in a very becoming way. Yesterday's Memorial Day was marked by a special celebration of our German veterans. It was the unveiling of the monument dedicated by the German veterans, at St. Boniface Cemetery. The meeting place of the veterans and Catholic civil societies in front of the Staats Zeitung swarmed with people who joined the procession to the cemetery.</p>
   <p>A. C. Hesing, Washington Hesing, a number of the German Catholic clergy, the speakers and prominent veterans, and Edward Rumme, the mayor's representative from Lake View, took their places on the platform. The unveiling ceremonies over, A. C. Hesing, president of this celebration, gave the following address: "This monument which we dedicate today, has been erected by our Germans, thus honoring the heroes who have died for our great and free country. The unbroken courage of those fighters, not even wavering through years of hardship, can not find its equal on the recent battlefields of Europe. I do not mean to belittle the glory of the Germany army in France, but the services and accomplishments of our German volunteers to <pb facs="5418474_10_1226.jpg" n="2"/>whom we pay tribute today, were equal to their glorious deeds. The memory of these fighters will by far outlive this solid granite monument erected in their honor."</p>
