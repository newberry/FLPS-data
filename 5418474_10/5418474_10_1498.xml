   <p>On the occasion of the Roman Catholic Church's Diamond Jubilee in the present arch-diocese of Chicago, the Rev. L. Erhard of the Holy Cross church in Batavia, will write a history about the merits, displayed by the German Catholic clergy and the laymen. The work also will include the dioceses of Peoria &amp; Alton. It will begin with the year 1832. At that time Pastor Erhard's father, George Erhard, and his uncles, John Busch, John Belz, Anton Weber, Franz Xaurer and Caesar and Klemens Periolat, assisted in the erection of the first church of Mary. Busch, a blacksmith, made the cross, which was placed on the top of the church. The Sisters of Mercy, retained this cross as a keep sake, but it became, like many other things, a victim of the fire in 1871. Pastor Erhard, who is able to relate many interesting events of those former days, asks for the assistance of all Catholic clergymen in the state. He would like, to get a detailed historical report from every one, in regard to the progress of Catholicism in their diocese, and will gratefully accept reports from laymen.</p>
