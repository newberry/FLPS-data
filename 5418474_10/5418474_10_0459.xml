   <p>The "German Womanhood" a branch of the Friends of New Germany, yesterday offered the public its first performance and achieved a complete success. The leader of the local group opened the program and cordially welcomed all present. Following the welcoming address, Mrs. Melida Hinkner, who recently returned from Germany, brought greetings from the homeland. The leader of the local group of the Friends of New Germany discussed the duties of women in the National Socialistic organization. He pointed out that National Socialism denies to women a place in politics. If, in spite of that, the Bund, as a National Socialistic organization, is trying to include the women also, it does not do so in an effort to prepare them for political activity. The scope of uniting the women lies rather in the field of social activity. It should be one of the purposes of womanhood <pb facs="5418474_10_0460.jpg" n="2"/>to give aid and support to the unemployed of the group. A further significant purpose is the creation of a German school. From these two purposes sufficient and gratifying activities may result for the women.</p>
   <p>Following this speech, representatives of the North German Lloyd showed a film; "A journey through Germany". The exceedingly beautiful photographs from the homeland were enthusiastically received.</p>
   <p>The members and guests remained until a late hour, and a social evening was enjoyed by all.</p>
