   <p>Ogden's Grove presented a brilliant spectacle yesterday afternoon when the Schwabenverein of Chicago gave its thirteenth annual celebration of the Cannstatter harvest festival. There was a crowd of nearly 6,000 people present and the grounds were beautifully decorated. The celebration began yesterday afternoon and continued last night. It will conclude today.</p>
   <p>At some distance from the entrance to the grove and in an open space, a large column of fruits and vegetables had been erected. The column was about thirty feet high, and rose out of a cluster of sheafs of grain of various kinds. All the fruits and vegetables on the column were distinctly American products. Near the top of the column was a fine collection of Indian corn, then came immense clusters of grapes and other fruits, a portion of which were brought all the way from California for the occasion.</p>
   <p>The vegetables were mostly from kitchen gardens belonging to the members of <pb facs="5418474_10_0856.jpg" n="2"/>the society, and presented a fine aggregation of squash, carrots, red pepper, and potatoes. On the side of the column was the Coat-of-Arms of Wurtemberg. The lion rampant was worked in green pepper and the deer was worked in blue potatoes. The talismanic devices were in radishes and other garden products.</p>
   <p>Near this column was a booth profusely draped in red, white, and blue bunting. Two large hogsheads of Neckar wine were standing in this booth gayly decorated. The wine came from the cellars of the Emperor of Germany. A committee consisting of two members of the society, Messrs. William Schoeninger and Carl Haerting, was delegated to visit Germany for the special purpose of purchasing the wine. They succeeded in buying 325 gallons of the precious liquor and, after much trouble and expense, finally had it safely delivered in Chicago. Smacking their lips over the delicious wine, the members of the society and those persons who were fortunate enough to be present declared with unanimity that it was perfection so far as wines go.</p>
   <p>A German Comedy Presented.</p>
   <p>Farther off, and about 100 feet from the wine booth, a temporary stage had <pb facs="5418474_10_0857.jpg" n="3"/>been erected for the presentation of the comedy, "One Will Have Her". The three acts of the comedy depicted amusing scenes in a German village. Two lovers were struggling for one pretty lass, and after considerable fun the piece concluded with a marriage. There was some good singing and dancing and all the members of the society acquitted themselves gracefully. The dancing program began after the conclusion of the comedy, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, and continued late at night. The arrangements for the celebration were made by a committee.</p>
   <p>Although the celebration was the Cannstatter Volksfest, an effort was made to make it distinctly American so far as the exhibit of garden and orchard products was concerned. Carl Haerting, Secretary of the society, said yesterday that the "harvest festival" in Chicago was to serve the same purpose as the festival in Germany, which is to familiarize the members of the society with the products of the country in which they reside and to rejoice in unison over bountiful crops or to discuss the prospects for the coming year. Last year, he said, there were 10,000 members of the Schwaben societies and their friends present at the celebration, and this year he expected a much greater attendance. The anticipations of the members of the arrangement <pb facs="5418474_10_0858.jpg" n="4"/>committee were in part realized yesterday, and they have no doubt of seeing them fulfilled today.</p>
   <p>Program for Today.</p>
   <p>The program for today will be the same as yesterday, so as to enable all members of the society and visitors to witness the elaborate entertainment prepared.</p>
