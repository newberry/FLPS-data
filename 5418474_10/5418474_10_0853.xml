   <p>For those who desired to do so there was full opportunity to continue the celebration of the Fourth of July in the groves and private parks in the northwestern part of the city yesterday. Half a dozen picnics in full operation, beer galore, and numerous bands which were up in all the late German waltzes could be found within an area of a mile square. The weather couldn't have been better, and thousands climbed on the Clybourne and Lincoln Avenue cars and went out to the picnics. The Gambrinus Arbeiter Unterstuetzungs Verein took possession of Belmont Park early in the day. This organization with its big name, is composed of the beer brewers of the city. It was organized in 1879 and it has a membership of 150. It is entirely a social organization. Andrew Brandler is its President.</p>
   <p>The brewers brought their wives and children and sweethearts, and their friends, their wives and children. They thought the weather a little warm. They are accustomed to pass their time in cool beer cellars. Only one day in the year do they find freedom from toil. All holidays are the same to them but just about Fourth of July time each year they arrange for an <pb facs="5418474_10_0854.jpg" n="2"/>outing. It might be expected that the brewers would sadly reduce the visible supply of beer at their annual picnic, but the fact is that the men in charge of the beer stand in Belmont Grove yesterday hardly had enough to do to keep their blood in circulation.</p>
   <p>The brewers devoted all their time to the women and children, to the bowling alley, and to the waltzes that were in continual progress in the dancing pavilion. In the afternoon there were races and other contests for the children and some beautiful prizes were awarded. Nearly every child on the ground received some kind of a reward. There were some outside attractions in the way of speculation, such as cane racks and wheels of fortune, but they were disregarded. The principal event of the day was a bowling contest between members of the Verein, in which four prizes were offered.</p>
   <p>After a basket luncheon, served at dusk, the festivities were resumed and continued until midnight. There were many new arrivals after supper, a large number of the brewers having been unable to leave their work during the day.</p>
