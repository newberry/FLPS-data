   <p>The 250 Swabians of Chicago attempted to begin their annual after-harvest festival at Ogden's Grove yesterday. The festival lasts two days and is generally a scene of great merry making. The storm which came up at 4 o'clock put an end to the festivities and drove the crowd into the tents and other places of shelter on the grounds. When the storm had passed the grove was covered with water two or three inches deep, and the crowd went home. About 4,000 people were present.</p>
   <p>The officers of the society held a consultation and decided to postpone the festival until next Sunday and Monday. There were to have been a large number of races or games for which prizes were offered. A stage had been erected in the northwest end of the grove, where a series of tableaux were to have been shown. These were three scenes from "Goethe's Faust", "Faust and Gretchen", "Before the Church", "The Feast and Valentine's Death", two scenes from Goethe's "Herman and Dorothea", and three scenes from Schiller's "Wallenstein"; the whole to close with a tableaux showing the statues of Schiller and Goethe in Lincoln Park.</p>
   <p>It was the Swabian Society that started the movement which resulted in <pb facs="5418474_10_0843.jpg" n="2"/>putting a statue of Schiller in Lincoln Park. They now propose to erect a statue of Goethe in the same place to cost $11,000. They have $1,000 in their treasury, the proceeds of last year's "fest", which they will donate to that purpose as well as the proceeds of this year's "fest".</p>
   <p>"This is our fourteenth annual Volksfest," said Carl Haerting yesterday. "These festivals were inaugurated by William I of Germany at Cannstatter, a suburb of Stuttgart in Swabia. A great feature of our festivities is the wine which we import every year from the royal wine cellars of Stuttgart, and that we are able to import it is due to a special favor of the royal house Minister of the Stuttgart Court. The objects of our society are charitable, and last year we apportioned our money between the following institutions: Alexian Brothers Hospital, German Hospital, German Orphan's Home, Michael Reese Hospital, Rosehill Orphan's Home, Lutheran Orphan's Home and St. Vincent Asylum.</p>
