   <p>Among the ratified nominations after the reopening of the Congress, the one of Mr. Stallo as Ambassador to Rome was one of the very first, without any dispute. For the past several weeks, however, there has appeared in Anglo-American Democratic and Republican newspapers so-called "special telegrams" and similar reports, according to which Stallo, in Rome, is behaving himself in the most improper way. They have culminated in the report that Stallo at the German artists festival in Rome, has belittled the Americans in comparison with the Germans as "Barbarians," The above mentioned press inciters barked in unanimity: "Away with this slanderer of the American people <pb facs="5418474_10_0275.jpg" n="2"/>Of course it has been proven by the reports of European newspapers that Stallo never did make any such remark, but, on the contrary, he celebrated, in his oration, the Germans and the Americans as the carriers of Germanistic culture, and especially praised the Americans as the distributors of the seed of this culture in the Western hemiphere.</p>
   <p>But still the insinuations continue. They originate, as has now been established, from the same Democratic gang of enquirers, in Cincinnati, who tried to make it impossible for Ambassador Pendleton to go to Berlin. To this gang the independent thinking and acting Stallo, although for years a supporter of the Democratic National Party, is just as hateful as the Reform Democrat Pendleton.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0276.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>But these lies about Mr. Stallo to President Cleveland, could do just as much harm as they did to Pendleton. As is reported from best sources, President Cleveland on February 18, told the Democratic Senator Payne of Ohio, who tried to influence him against Stallo: "In the unfavorable reports about Mr. Stallo there is not one word of truth. Besides, Mr. Stallo was nominated by me as Ambassador to Rome not because he is a citizen of Ohio, but because he is one of the most important representatives of the Germans of the United States." And this is all about this affair!</p>
