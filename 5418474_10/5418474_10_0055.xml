   <p>Shortly before the outbreak of the war, a collection of lectures and articles by Professor Julius Goebel of the German Department of the University of Illinois was published by the Duerr Publishing House in Leipzig. The closer cooperation of the German-American element during the last few months, and the resultant growing interest in their own history, should induce many Chicago Germans to read this timely publication. The one-hundred-and-forty-seven-page book serves a twofold purpose: It aims to promote the German movement in America, and, on the other hand, it tends to inform the Germans living in the old country about its spirit and origin.</p>
   <p>The first fourteen articles of this inspiring and comprehensive collection come at once to the point of the main topic. Professor Goebel makes an analysis of the causes of the negligible influence which the Germans have enjoyed so <pb facs="5418474_10_0056.jpg" n="2"/>far in American politics and society and of the duties they are destined to perform. The German element had a holy mission to fulfill, not by pursuing a narrow-minded German national policy, but by promoting culture on a large scale. The German influence should manifest itself each time when propaganda and demagogy threaten to obliterate the true liberty of the American citizen.</p>
   <p>"The existence of a nation and her prestige among other peoples does not depend in her material wealth, and still less on the wiliness of her diplomats, but upon the strength, development, and regenerating capacity of her moral forces contained within herself.</p>
   <p>"German culture and German spirit are competing in the United States with the culture and ideology of other nations. To make the influence of the former as strong as possible is the duty of every German-American.</p>
   <p>Of the remaining articles in the collection, many readers will be interested in the story of the derisive nick-names "Dutchman" and "Dutch," the origin <pb facs="5418474_10_0057.jpg" n="3"/>of which goes farther back than many would suppose. The book also contains the "Deutsche Briefe on Karl Biedermann" (German Letters to K.B.), which have been included by special request. Other essays have as their subject German poetry and literature in the United States, giving various phases and episodes from the history of the Deutschtum (German element, everything pertaining to it) in the New World. The meritorious work concludes with a prognosis of the future of the German-American element, whose aim should be the creation of a new ideal for mankind, "embracing the best of the German heritage and the best of Anglo-Saxon culture, thus bringing about a new era in the achievements of man, and an awakening of spring for all humanity".</p>
