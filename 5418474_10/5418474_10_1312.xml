   <p>Chicago had the honor to be host to the Concord Society of America. This Society has as its principal aim the study of the history of the German-Americans. It has branches in numerous American cities and a banquet is held annually at which the members from all parts of the country assemble.</p>
   <p>At yesterday's banquet, at the Atlantic Hotel, three highly prominent men were elected honorary members of the Concord Society, namely, Prof. John Harris Aal of the University of Oslo, Norway; United States Senator Robert C. Owen of Oklahoma, and Prof. John A. Russell of the University of Detroit. Prof. John Harris Aal was the first to attack the lies of the war guilt propaganda immediately after the Armistice. Although, of English descent, Prof. Aal had protested during the war, against the injustices perpetrated against Germany. Being one of the most prominent students of International Law, his opinions were held in high esteem before the war. But during the war, English propaganda succeeded in influencing the Norwegian people; and it was therfore impossible for Prof. Aal to gain appreciation even in his own country.</p>
   <p>He came to America in 1919. Prominent German-Americans had raised large funds <pb facs="5418474_10_1313.jpg" n="2"/>in his behalf. Prof Aal traveled through all the allied countries and visited especially all the neutral countries.</p>
   <p>Fights Against Lies of War Guilt</p>
   <p>He carried the fight against the lies of war guilt to the Peace Court of the Hague.... For the German cause, for the sake of truth, he sacrificed his health and was therefore, forced to give up public speeches and to resort to the pen.</p>
   <p>Senator Owen of Oklahoma, as the first prominent American, attacked publicly the lies of the war guilt.</p>
   <p>Prof. Russel of the University of Detroit, wrote an excellent book on the history of the Germans in the state of Michigan; a historical masterpiece, which deserves a place in the home of every German-American.</p>
   <p>The banquet hall of the Atlantic Hotel, was scarcely large enough to hold all the select guests, who had come from far and near. Dr. L. A. Fritsche, the toastmaster of the evening, welcomed the guests. He expressed his pleasure at <pb facs="5418474_10_1314.jpg" n="3"/>the presence of so many distinguished guests, and then presented to Dr. Carl Selmer, who acted as Prof. John Harris Aal's representative, the diploma by which the honorary membership of the society was conferred upon him.</p>
   <p>Prof. Dr. Schiedt of Lancaster, Pa., as the first speaker, dwelt upon the aims which the society pursues, namely to give to the new country all the benefits of German achievements.....</p>
   <p>The effective speech of the vice president of the Steuben Club, Judge Walter L. Meyer, was also in praise of the German spirit.....</p>
   <p>The president of the National Historical Society, Thomas C. Augerstein, demanded recognition for the accomplishments of the Germans in America.....</p>
   <p>The following gentlemen also spoke: Fred Gantuer of Germantown, Pa., Rev. Dr. Karl Kretzmame of Orange, N. J., J. H. A. Lacher of Waukesha, Wis., David Maier of New York City; Victor W. Richter of Chicago, and Harry Rickel, Mt. Clements, Mich.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_1315.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>At the conclusion of the meeting a resolution was unanimously adopted to demand the reintroduction of the teaching of the German language in the public schools...</p>
