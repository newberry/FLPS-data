<title level="a">ST. LUKE'S EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH OBSERVES ITS FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Yesterday, January 20, just fifty years had elapsed since the founding of the St. Luke's Evangelical Lutheran Church, which has a very impressive house of worship at the corner of Belmont and Greenview Avenues; and is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and other states.</p>
   <p>In honor of the charter members of the congregation who were all of German parentage, a special German service was held last evening. Today, the first Sunday of the jubilee week, at 6 A.M., there will be a special preparatory service which will be conducted by the Reverend A. R. Kretzmann, the pastor of the Church. The German festive service will be at 9:30 A.M. The Reverend Otto A. Boecler, of Desplaines, for many years pastor of St. Luke's, will preach the sermon. The English festive service will be at 11 A.M. Doctor O. C. Kreinheder, president of Valparaiso Lutheran University, will be the speaker.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_1360.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This afternoon, at 4:30, a concert will be given. All choirs of the congregation will sing individually and also altogether. Mr. Carl Rupprecht, well-known organist of St. Luke's, will render several selections on the organ.</p>
   <p>Services Every Evening</p>
   <p>Every evening at 7:45 there will be services in which the speakers will dwell on the importance of the various organizations and institutions of the Church and their contributions toward its maintenance.</p>
   <p>In Monday evening's service the Reverend H. E. Brauer, of St. Martini Church, will stress the work which the ladies have done for the congregation. On Tuesday evening Professor W. G. Polack, the chairman of the Synodical Committee on Church Music, will speak on the value of the choral. In this service the choir of Pilgrim Church will render several selections, and the director, <pb facs="5418474_10_1361.jpg" n="3"/>Mr. Walter Sassmanshausen, will offer several organ numbers.</p>
   <p>On Wednesday evening the Reverend Paul Miller, of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of St. Paul, Fort Wayne, Indiana, will speak on the importance of the Christian day school. On Friday evening Professor O. P. Kretzmann, the newly elected executive secretary of the International Walther League, a young people's organization with a membership of 75,000, will emphasize the value of the work of Christian youths.</p>
   <p>Banquet</p>
   <p>On Thursday evening, at 6:30, a banquet will be given in commemoration of the work of the Reverend J. E. A. Mueller, for many years a faithful pastor of St. Luke's.</p>
   <p>On Sunday January 28, the closing festive services will be held. We will have the pleasure of listening to a sermon by Dr. F. Pfotenhauer, president <pb facs="5418474_10_1362.jpg" n="4"/>of the Missouri Synod. In the English service Professor William Burhop, president of Concordia College, Fort Wayne, Indiana, will preach.</p>
   <p>Gleamings from the History of St. Luke's</p>
   <p>The congregation was organized to accomodate those members of St. Jacobi Church, Fremont Street and Garfield Avenue, who lived quite a distance north of their house of worship. A parochial school had been erected at Hoyne Avenue and Wellington Street in the year 1881. Several services were held there between 1881 and 1883 by J. E. A. Mueller a student at Concordia Seminary, Springfield, Illinois. In December, 1883, thirty-four voting members of St. Jacobi Church, who lived in the vicinity of the district school, resolved to organize a new church, having received permission from the Mother Church to do so. This St. Luke's was founded on January 20, 1884. The Reverend J. E. A. Mueller was called to the pastorate, and he accepted the call.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_1363.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>A New Church Erected</p>
   <p>In the same year (1884) the young congregation built a house of worship on the corner of Belmont Avenue and Perry Street. The building was dedicated to the service of the tribune God in October, 1884. However, after only three years this edifice was not large enough to accomodate the growing attendance, so the congregation resolved to enlarge it. The reconstructed building was dedicated in November, 1888. Both the school and the church enjoyed a healthy and rapid growth.</p>
   <p>The Reverend J. E. A. Mueller, who was assisted by his son, the Reverend Fred W. G. Mueller, from 1907 to 1910, died on August 20, 1917. The Reverend Fred Mueller accepted a call to St. John's Church, of Wilmette, Illinois, in 1910. The Reverend J. E. A. Mueller was succeeded by Professor Otto C.A. Boecler, of Concordia Seminary, Springfield, Illinois. In 1925 Professor Boecler was called to a professorship at Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, Missourri, and was succeeded by Professor Carl J. A. Hoffmann, of Concordia <pb facs="5418474_10_1364.jpg" n="6"/>Seminary, Springfield, Illinois. Professor Hoffmann accepted a call to First Trinity Lutheran Church, Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1927. Then the present pastor, Adalbert R. Kretzmann, who had served St. Luke's as assistant pastor for a short time, entered upon his duties as pastor, and has been very successful in his work.</p>
