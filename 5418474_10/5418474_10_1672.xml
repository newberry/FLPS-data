   <p>The committee on mission activities reported that procedures coincided with ecclesiastical laws, and that no irregularities had been found.</p>
   <p>The committee on statistics gave a very interesting report. We append some of the items: The community has 1545 ministers and 109,778 members. The 1434 churches are valued at $3,170,602. The 449 parish houses are appraised at $406,561. The 1918 Sunday schools are attended by 118,640 children, and 20,553 church officials and teachers take care of this branch. Persons expecting to be baptized number nearly 10,000. The library for young people has 184,564 books.</p>
   <p>The revision committee was given additional work. Many delegates were of the opinion that church administration, as far as buildings were concerned, could be improved.</p>

   <p>The report on missions also contained interesting items. Collections for local and foreign missions amounted to $280,681.70 during the last four years, and $314,022.71 was spent for this purpose. The present fund is $52,114.01. The mission fund has a deficit of $19,418.45. However, it should be remembered that these are donations only for missions. Donations for pastors and churches, etc., are not included in this amount. The reports give ample proof of the exceptional generosity of the various communities.</p>
   <p>The next general conference is to be held in 1883, in Allentown, Pennsylvania.</p>
   <p>Pastor J. Berger of Gelsenkirchen, Germany, will travel extensively in America to collect funds to build churches in Europe.</p>
   <p>The Mission Society held a session in the evening.</p>
