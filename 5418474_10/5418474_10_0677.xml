   <p>Herewith we submit the 54th report of the treasurer. The increase of the fund from December 23, 1915, to January 13, 1916 (12 P.M.), was $4,888.23. The total sum so far is $351,136.05.</p>
   <p>It is gratifying to note the growing interest in the cause, and that contributions have grown during the last fortnight. Our efforts in behalf of the Siberian and Canadian prisoners are being rewarded, and, when we state that donations have been sent from New York, Connecticut, Virginia, Montana, Minnesota, and even from distant Alaska, then it only proves what popular acclaim our call received, and how generously and eagerly the people of the nation are helping the unfortunates of the World War.</p>
   <p>We call your attention in these lines to the forthcoming Festival of German Friends, which will be given in connection with our annual convention at the <pb facs="5418474_10_0678.jpg" n="2"/>Northside Turnhall next Tuesday, Jan. 18, 8 P.M. The minutes of the society will be submitted then , which will also be distributed in printed form.</p>
   <p>A speech by Dr. Julius Hofmann, of Baltimore, on the founding of the German Empire and the significance of this historical event, will undoubtedly be of interest to all German-Americans. Dr. Hofmann is considered to be one of the best and most renowned German speakers in America, and he is probably more able to fascinate and enthuse his audience than any other.</p>
   <p>The program appears elsewhere, but we again call the attention of the public to a rare treat: Mrs. Theodor Brentano has consented to sing.</p>
   <p>Thousands who have been thrilled by the magic of her soulful voice, have not had an opportunity to hear her in recent times and here, then, a musical event <pb facs="5418474_10_0679.jpg" n="3"/>is in the offing. Next Tuesday her talent will be devoted to this Work of Love, and we know that she will not merely sing with throat and chest, but her renditions will be animated by a genuine German heartfelt sentiment.</p>
   <p>(Signed) German and Austrian-Hungarian Aid Society. Chas. H. Wacker, president; Oscar H. Mayer, treasurer; Julius Goldzier, secretaty; Karl Eitel, chairman of the Finance Committee.</p>
   <p>The Melting Pot</p>
   <p>Below we append the cash value of all gold and silver which has been sent. These items will be held for ten days before melting so as to guard against mistakes. [A list of names follows. Amounts: highest, Mr. Henry Otto, $7.40; lowest, Otto Peisert, 2 cents. Transl.]</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0680.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>F. Bode (for the German Red Cross), $500. [Contributions of German clubs, associations, etc., are listed. Highest amount, $391.47, was derived from the sale of articles during the May festival. Lowest sum, $5.15,collected by the Hamburger Club, accounted for by F. Wolf. Transl.]</p>
   <p>Contributions of ten and five dollars. [A long list is published, comprising clubs, individuals, and business houses.]</p>
   <p>Contributions of two dollars, one dollar, and fifty cents follow. [Amounts for special purposes, such as "For the Blind Soldiers in Muenchen, Bavaria," are also included; sums range from fifty cents to five dollars. Transl.]</p>
   <p>Collection Boxes: Song Club Harmonie, $38.25; Berghoff Company, $12.50; Hotel Bismarck (Bar), $4; Hotel Bismarck (Cigar stand), $11.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0681.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>For the Prisoners in Siberia: Net profits of Sylvester Concert, in Montana, $162; F. Riewe [smallest sum, Transl]., $12.25. [The list of names cover several columns.]</p>
   <p>Letter, addressed to the editor of the Abendpost, [ for which the latter accepts no responsibility. Transl.] :</p>
   <p>"To the Editorial Department of the Abendpost.</p>
   <p>"As a result of the World War, the East Prussians and Galicians suffered more than others. Austria-Hungary had to endure greater hardships than Germany, as it is weaker financially, and because food prices have risen tremendously. We are therefore justified to give our recognition to the Austrians and Hungarians who fought so valiantly with their German Brethren, regardless of <pb facs="5418474_10_0682.jpg" n="6"/>economic handicaps. They deserve our highest praise and unstinted esteem for their bravery.</p>
   <p>"Emperor Wilhelm's birthday, on Jan. 27, gives all our former nationals an opportunity to express their brotherly solidarity. No period is more auspicious than the present one to spread gladness to the Emperor and the people by sending small gifts as a token of practical sympathy. During the Eighties, when the Kaiser Wilhelm Contribution was organized, only amounts limited to 1 - 10 Pfennige were accepted, and millions were made available for benevolent purposes. I believe that a similar drive, in view of the small amount, would produce a large sum among the Austrians, Hungarians and Germans here; it forms also the basis for a highly suitable birthday present to the Emperor.</p>
   <p>"In order to avoid offending the poorer classes, as well as the children, and <pb facs="5418474_10_0683.jpg" n="7"/>to enable them to participate, the highest amount should be limited to ten cents. If their patriotic response toward their former Fatherland coincides with general expectations, then it should be possible to raise a sum of $5,000,000, which amount would be sent to the Emperor with the request that it shall be given to the sufferers of both empires, according to his discretion.</p>
   <p>"I hope that this suggestion will reach the proper channels, and that responsible people will promote it.</p>
   <p>"Respectfully F. H. K."</p>
