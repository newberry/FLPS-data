   <p>The yearly convention of the Hermann Sisters was held at the North Side Turnhall yesterday. It was a festive meeting, given for the purpose of inaugurating main officials and committee members. The affair was attended by a large number of guests and members of the Order. Margarete Drinkhause, ex-grand president gave a very impressive speech, which was followed by the ceremonies, in which Martha Janke and Alvin Spalding ex-grand presidents, officiated. They were assisted by Marie Weissbecker, the grand leader. The program went on, with the collaboration of twenty-four drill guards from Harmony Lodge No. 3 under the leadership of "Captain" Anna Brookmann. The performance of the guards ended with a fancy drill. Grand officials, former and present, were presented with cut glassware, as a token of affection.</p>
   <p>Then came the ball, a very jovial affair, as the constant growth of the Order and the good attendance had buoyed up the spirit of the assembly.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0643.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The present directorate comprises the following: Marie Herzog ex-grand president; Auguste Beckmann, grand president. [A list of twenty-two names is given].</p>
