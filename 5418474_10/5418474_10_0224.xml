   <p>While the machine guns were rattling in the streets of the seaport Vera-Cruz, which opened the way for the American Bluejackets, the Secretary of State had to stand for a little private lecture from the German ambassador. Count Bernstorff, a foreign diplomat had to remind the Secretary of State that at the second Hague peace conference, which was held from June 15th to October 18th, 1907, all great powers agreed, to consider the bombardment of open ports, seatowns and settlements by war vessels, as a crime upon civilization and culture, and to refrain from such actions, which are a crime against humanity, in case of war. The United States have like all great powers, ratified these arrangements; in spite of that, the head of American foreign policy had to have his attention called by a third party to the fact that it was strictly a breach of International law, which we committed in Vera Cruz. So far it concerned only the hint of a friendly Diplomat for which Mr. Bryan should be grateful to Count Bernstorff, because he protected him from further exposure to ridicule. But then, the German Ambassador, as representative of his country, called the attention of the Secretary of State to the fact, that the United States had no right whatsoever, to seize the German steamer in the port of Vera-Cruz, to confiscate its cargo, or even to prevent the vessel from unloading. In this case, the country must blush about the <pb facs="5418474_10_0225.jpg" n="2"/>ignorance of its Secretary of State. The German American incident at Vera-Cruz, has been settled between Bryan and the German Ambassador, with the result, that the German steamer was allowed to take its cargo back to Germany. Had we, in a similar case, been dealing instead of with German's sincerity and good will, with England's double-crossing and perfidy, we would not have been spared reprisals. The United States will have to value the German friendship in greater measure, for the very reason that it was entirely in the power of the German captain, to play the arms and munition cargo of his vessel into the hands of our enemy Huerta. With the fifteen million bullets, which were on board the "Ymiranga", many an American youth would have been killed had the captain made use of his right to land his cargo in some other Mexican port. Three days ago, the Illinois Staats Zeitung pointed out at this place that it was high time to clarify the situation through the declaration of war or the official decree of a blockade in order to avoid conflicts of International law. Even today they operate with incomprehensible timidity, around the conception of war and shrink from calling the matter by its right name. But now we should not hesitate another minute to place ourselves on the ground of those treaties about armed conflicts, whose eloquent advocates we always have been.</p>
