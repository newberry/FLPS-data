   <p>A most impressive affair turned out to be the Grand opening celebration of the new Bismarck School at the corner of Central Park and Mc Lean Avenues. Over 800 children and numerous residents of the school district met at the beautifully decorated Aula while of the entire membership of the School Council only Mr. Otto C. Schneider was present.</p>
   <p>Special acclaim was earned above all by the pupil Carrie Schild by the recitation of an Ode to the Prince Bismarck that ended with the words: "Heil, Deutschlands Hort In Sachsen Walde."</p>
   <p>Mr. Otto C. Schneider as festival speaker expressed in his address that every German must be proud of Bismarck who knew how to bring back the justified respect to his nation: "It is an honor to be a pope of the school that carries the celebrated name "Bismarck" and it is my earnest hope that all of you, my dear children, will flourish some day, like Bismarck, in power, wisdom, and true fulfillment of your duties. I have now the pleasure to dedicate the picture of the "Intellectual giant Bismarck" which was donated by the "Werner Book Company." The picture shows Bismarck in the uniform of the "Cuirassiers."</p>

   <p>The young ladies of the North Division High School sang under the direction of Prof. Katzenberger. "Die Wacht Am Rhein" and the singing of "America" by the entire audience brought the celebration to a worthy conclusion.</p>
