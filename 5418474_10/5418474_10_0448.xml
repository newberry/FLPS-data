   <p>A large number of visitors made their appearance on debating night, last Wednesday, at the Lincoln Turner Hall. The first part of the program was a moving picture lecture, dealing with the marching of millions, on the first of May, at Tempelhof Field, in Berlin. It was received with great applause.</p>
   <p>During the second part of the program, three speakers took the floor: the district leader of the Middle West, Fritz Gissibl; the secretary of the Dawa (German-American Propaganda Office), Herr Spier; and a member of the Bund, Herr Kruse, from Portland, Oregon, who brought friendly greetings from his local group to the Chicagoans. Herr Spier was brief, because, as he expressed it, he "needed his powder" for the coming Dawa congress, and did not want to blast all of it.</p>
   <p>District leader Gissibl spoke in his customary fiery manner, and, as usual, <pb facs="5418474_10_0449.jpg" n="2"/>managed to captivate his audience, who rewarded him with great applause.</p>
   <p>Let it be pointed out that next Wednesday, October 24, two speakers from the East will be heard, namely Bund O. D. Fuehrer J. Schuster, Brooklyn (speaking in German), and Bundes Werbeleiter (propaganda leader) Louis Zahne, New York (speaking in English). The meeting will begin, as usual, at 8:30 P. M.</p>
