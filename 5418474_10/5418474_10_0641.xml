   <p>True to its tradition of being a faithful exponent of German social activities and German songs, the Young Men's Chorus gave its third entertainment of the winter in the North Side Turner Hall. During the celebration lively dances predominated, interspersed with musical and humorous interludes, which seemed to transform the hours into minutes. The chorus sang under the leadership of director, Hans Biedermann. The offerings of the Music Club, a division of the Young Men's Choral Association, were rewarded with great applause. Mr. H. Ruhwiedel was the leader. Their zither numbers, "Constable March" and "Gambrinus Gavotte," were excellent. A bevy of humorous selections were contributed by Carl Rupprath and others.</p>
   <p>All preparations for the festival were in charge of a committee of ten headed by Mr. Theodore Pilgram.</p>
