   <p>Three members of the German Veterans' Association commemorated their twenty-fifth anniversary as members of the organization.</p>
   <p>The German Veterans' Association of Chicago is the oldest organization of its kind in the United States; its members are ex-service men of the German army and navy. Three members of this association were honored in the grandest manner last night on their twenty-fifth anniversary as members of the society. The comrades referred to are: Wilhelm Schmidt, Carl Wohlfeld, and William Mester. The German Veterans' Society always honors its deserving members most befittingly. Thus, invitations for participation at this anniversary celebration were sent to all military organizations within Chicago, with the request that they appear in large numbers and thus help to make this a memorable event. The response was astonishing.</p>
   <p>This should be no surprise, however, because the mere mention of the <pb facs="5418474_10_0774.jpg" n="2"/>name of comrade William Schmidt, suffices to bring every military society into prompt action. Those who know him know also that Mr. Schmidt is among the few Germans who have never ceased to defend the interests of the German people; furthermore, he is always ready to give assistance to German institutions without any claim for recognition for his humanitarian impulses. But this is not all. The German Veterans' Association is indebted deeply to Mr. Schmidt for his numerous and highly valuable services, in gratitude of which his name and the description of the merit appear in gilt letters in the annals of the organization's history. Thus the society has bestowed upon him the distinction of the holder of every honorary office of that organization.</p>
   <p>The comrades Wohlfeld and Mester were also distinguished members and officeholders in the realm of that association for twenty-five years. Their activities for the benefit of the organization are also greatly appreciated. They too are highly esteemed by their comrades, which explains sufficiently why the hall proved much too small to comfortably accommodate all those who came to pay their respects to the celebrants.</p>
   <pb facs="5418474_10_0775.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Among the notables present last evening were the German Consul,Doctor Wever,an honorary member of the Veterans' Association and Dr. Zoepffel-Quellenstein,the German Vice-Consul.</p>
   <p>After the current business matters of the organization were settled, the presentation of honors to the celebrants was commenced. Thus we saw the three distinguished comrades in the company of three co-founders of the organization,Messrs. Schlenker, Forch, and Corleis step before Mr. Lebrecht Tanzer, the president of the German Veterans' Association. He addressed the celebrants,whom he simultaneously presented with a golden memorial cross with these words:</p>
   <p>"It is indeed a great honor and an unsurpassed pleasure to convey to you the congratulations and good wishes of the comrades of the German Veterans' Association upon twenty-five years of your distinguished association with this organization. In behalf of this society may I express to you the gratitude for your faithful work, which you so richly deserve. You may be convinced that pride and esteem gladden <pb facs="5418474_10_0776.jpg" n="4"/>the hearts of every comrade who is not devoid of the sense of appreciation. Your faithful services as well as your intense interest displayed in the welfare of this organization during a period of twenty-five years-almost the half point of the average human life-are incomparable. You, distinguished members of the organization, joined at a time when our revered founders were confronted by great difficulties. In order to emerge as victor from this battle ,strength, courage, and patience were required of every comrade during those critical times. But this great enterprise had the good fortune to enlist members who safe-guarded and watched over this young organization which in the course of years has developed into the largest institution of its kind in the United States of America. Honor and high respect are inseparable with the name of the German Veterans' Association, which is largely due to the efforts of you, my esteemed comrades. You were the supporting pillars upon which the organization was built and upon which the security of its development rested.</p>
   <p>"I beg you once more in behalf of our organization to accept the deep <pb facs="5418474_10_0777.jpg" n="5"/>felt gratitude of every comrade for your outstanding work, and permit me, too, to present to you on this occasion a golden cross bearing the insignia of the association, in commemoration of this day. May good health in years to come permit you to wear and display this token of gratitude, signifying honor and devotion, conferred upon you by the comrades of the German Veterans' Association."</p>
   <p>After the loud and lasting ovation subsided, comrade Wohlfeld replied in the name of the honored members of the association. He thanked the organization, the German Consul, and Vice-Consul and also the representatives of various military societies for the honor of their presence. Then followed a short summary of the organization's activities since the day it was founded. He referred to the German Veterans' Association as the first of its kind whose members were former German soldiers. "Now, of course, there is a similar organization in every state throughout the Union. Furthermore," he said, "this organization is directly responsible for the founding of the mighty German Veterans' Alliance. In addition, it is the only institution in foreign lands which is in <pb facs="5418474_10_0778.jpg" n="6"/>possession of a flag presented by the late Emperor William I." Mr. Wohlfeld proudly pointed out that the present financial status of the organization exceeds any previous record. The speaker was loudly acclaimed at the conclusion of the address.</p>
   <p>The memorial crosses are of pure gold, studded with small diamonds representing the association's insignia. At the top of each cross appears the engraved name of each celebrant. One side of the memorial cross bears the inscription "1874. The German Veterans' Association of Chicago." While the following inscription adorns the opposite side: "In commemoration of twenty-five years of faithful membership. 1876-1901."</p>
   <p>Carl Wohlfeld enlisted Jan. 2, 1865, in the third Battalion of the Fifth Thuringian Infantry, Regiment No. 94. William Schmidt served as the Hannover rifleman of Battalion No. 10; and William Mester served in the former Imperial Army in Hannover. Comrades Wohlfeld and Schmidt enlisted as members of this organization on March 6, 1876, while <pb facs="5418474_10_0779.jpg" n="7"/>comrade Mester joined the association on April 2, 1876, two years after the German Veterans' Association was founded. Mr. Schmidt is president of the reputable William Schmidt Bakery Company; Mr. Mester is the proprietor of the City of Hannover Hotel; while Mr. Wohlfeld is associated with an insurance company.....</p>
   <p>A real ovation was tendered comrade Max Heidelmeier, police inspector. His appearance in the hall electrified the audience which rose to greet Mr. Heidelmeier with a thunderous and prolonged hurrah. Although "Our Max" did not contemplate a speech, he was compelled to comply with the general request. Thus he urged the German members of various German organizations to forget their differences which do arise within the societies and devote their united efforts in the cause of upholding German customs and German club life. "The importance of their unity manifested itself when the English press showed its unfriendly attitude towards the German people." Continuing, Mr. Heidelmeier said that he was arrested on the day of his twenty-seventh anniversary as a police officer, a victim of vicious lies intended for a sensational prosecution- needless to say, an experience hitherto unknown to him. A most <pb facs="5418474_10_0780.jpg" n="8"/>contemptible attack against him was launched by the English press for no other reason than for his being a member of the German race and for the unforgivable offence of his holding the office of an inspector. However, had the case been reversed with an Irish inspector as the target, these newspapers would have carefully avoided an exhibition of their antipathy.</p>
   <p>High spirit prevailed throughout the extremely pleasant evening, the hours of which stole away like an invincible thief. Hail to the celebrants and to the Veterans' Association!</p>
