   <p>Amid the participation of great masses of the German - Catholic inhabitants of the North Side the imposing St. Alphonsus Church was consecrated yesterday at Lincoln Avenue, corner Wellington and Southport Avenues. Archbishop Feehan, who personally officiated at the act of consecration, was called for at his residential palace by a large number of Church Societies and was accompanied in festive procession under the leadership of the Marshall Lorenz Brieske to the festival place. The festival sermon was delivered there by Bishop Richter of Grand Rapids, while Pater Gerardy, the Order-Provincial of the Redemptorists, celebrated the High Mass. Numerous priests participated at the festivities. Those names are: Rector Loewenkamp, the minister of the new church; General Curate Boenig of Grand Rapids; the Reverends Heldman, Barth, Erz, Schaefer, Mathias; Adolph, Engelkamp, Dettmer, Murray, Walden, McShean and Gill, and the Redemptorists - Patres Thomas, Jaechel, Karcher, Essing, Distler, Hild, Froelich and Hahn.</p>
   <p>The regular church ceremonies were supplemented by a magnificent church <pb facs="5418474_10_1531.jpg" n="2"/>concert arranged by Mr. Ederer, the Organist, and Chorus-Master of the Alphonsus Parish. At this concert cooperated, besides the excellently trained Chorus of the Alphonsus Church, also the Chorus of the St. Michael's Church and twenty-five able musicians. The fine hymn "Grosser Gott, Wir Loben Dich" sung with its mighty sound effect by a chorus of the entire congregation brought the celebration to a dignified conclusion.</p>
