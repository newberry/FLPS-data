   <p>The dissension in the local Evangelical Society led to a riot, yesterday, in one of the churches. The society split into two factions, as was previously reported. One of the factions was led by the discharged Bishop Escher, and the other faction, the stronger of the two, was under the leadership of the former Bishop Dubs. Both factions held their conference in different churches, and appointed pastors for certain churches for the following year. Rev. Morloch, Pastor of the Humboldt Park Church, delivered his farewell sermon, yesterday, and at the same time he had to introduce his successor. It so happened that both factions of the church had a successor appointed to take Morloch's place, and both of those appointees were present, Rev. A. Heilman from the Dub's faction, and the Rev. John Vetter from the other faction. Rev. Morloch, himself, is in favor of Dubs, but the director of the Sunday School of the church, Th. Krueger, recognizes the Bishops Escher and Bowman. During the Sunday School, Rev. Heilman, who instructed a class, suddenly stepped toward the Rev. Morloch and whispered something to him. Then the Rev. Morloch went into the pulpit and closed the Bible, and the Rev. Heilman declared the Sunday School dismissed. In that very moment, the chairman of the directors of the church jumped up and demanded to know by whose authority Heilman closed the Sunday School. While he still was speaking, the Rev. Vetter, the candidate from Escher's faction, walked <pb facs="5418474_10_1625.jpg" n="2"/>walked toward the pulpit. Now, a certain Mr. Hintz jumped from his seat and grabbed the Rev. Vetter by his collar, the latter asserts, and the whole affair resulted in quite a riot. The children screamed and fled in haste toward the exits. The Rev. Vetter was finally put out of the church by united efforts. In his sermon the Rev. Morloch explained the situation, and expressed his regret in regard to this happening.</p>
