   <p>The Telocvicna Jednota Sokol Slavsky (a Czech Gymnastic Association), sent many enthusiastic members to different fronts during the recent World War, and their common motto was: to fight not only for the cause of the Allies and, therefore, for the Czechoslovakian cause, but also for democracy in general. From the beginning, the boys voluntarily entered the United States, Canadian, and French Armies and finally the Czechoslovak Army. They were among the first to fight on different fronts. The association greeted the boys who returned home at a reception held in the latter part of last year. Looking over its ranks, the association discovered that one of the boys was missing and that he would never return. The missing member was brother Vaclav Kovarik, who was reported to have been killed in action upon the battlefield at Soissons, France. At one of its past meetings, the association resolved to honor the memory of the fallen brother by remembering his parents, who live in the old country which their son <pb facs="5418478_7_1355.jpg" n="2"/>helped to free. It was resolved that the sum of two thousand five hundred Czechoslovak kronen [approximately $25.] would be sent to them as proof of how much their son was liked and respected, and as proof of real brotherly love and remembrance.</p>
