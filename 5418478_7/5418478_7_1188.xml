  <body>
   <p>A monthly meeting of the board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) was held under the chairmanship of President J. Pecha last night. The pay roll for the past month amounted to $3,646.69, the high amount being explained by the fact that there were five paydays in October. Letters from a number of orders and lodges were read, dealing with the idea of building a John Huss monument in the newly opened section of the cemetery. Since all of the members were against this proposal, the board agreed to abandon the idea.</p>
   <p>Cash on hand reported in the previous meeting was $24,454.29; income in October, $6,283.40; total, $30,737.69. Expenses in October amounted to $5,834.56. The sum of $20,000 was lent out at 3 per cent interest. The amount on hand with the treasurer is $4,903.13.</p>
