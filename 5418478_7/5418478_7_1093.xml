<title level="a">LITIGATION BETWEEN ARCHITECT RANDAK AND THE CESKY NARODNI HRBITOV</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The crematorium of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) is not only the first Bohemian institution of that kind in the world, but now it is also receiving the distinction of being involved in a lawsuit and discussed in a court of law. The case of Architect Charvat against the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov for a fee of $1,000 for plans and drawings of the crematorium was called by Judge Cook of the County Court yesterday.</p>
   <p>When the question of building a crematorium was shaping up into a more definite form, the board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov arranged for a competitive submission of plans for it which was participated in by five architects. It will be remembered that the board of representatives had formulated a number of conditions for the contest, among which was the stipulation that the existing chapel should be utilized for the crematorium, and that the cost should not be in excess of $35,000.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1094.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The building committee gave the first prize to Architect Frank Randak, the second prize to Architect Ant. F. Rusy, and the third prize to Architect Ant. Charvat. The contract, however, was not awarded in accordance with the stipulations of the contest. The board of representatives declare that they had been told by all architects with whom they conferred that no crematorium could be built for $35,000. Therefore the whole contest was rejected [sic] and a more expensive building contemplated. Without arranging a new contest, the board accepted conditions and plans submitted by Mr. Randak. His estimate was $70,000. But this decision has brought about a lawsuit by Mr. Charvat, whose attorneys, Mr. Otto Kerner and F. Posvic, base it on the contention that the crematorium should have been built for the amount stipulated in the conditions of the contest, that is, $35,000. Mr. Charvat has never said that he could not build the crematorium for that amount. He has satisfied all the conditions of the contest and should, therefore, have been awarded the contract.....</p>
   <p>Mr. Charvat feels, therefore, that he is entitled to the usual commission of <pb facs="5418478_7_1095.jpg" n="3"/>one and one half of one per cent of the amount for which he has offered to build the crematorium which, including interest, would be in the neighborhood of $1,000. How far his claim is justified will be up to the courts to decide.....</p>
   <p>Yesterday was spent in the presentation of evidence by the plaintiff; today is reserved for the defendants.....</p>
