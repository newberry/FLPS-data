<title level="a">MEETING OF BAPTIST BRANCH OF THE CZECH NATIONAL ALLIANCE</title><title level="a" type="sub">Reported by the Secretary</title></bibl>

   <p>The meeting of the Baptist Branch of the Czech National Alliance was opened by Mr. V. Kralicek. He defined the term 'good shepherd': It applies to men or women who serves his or her people in all exertions, national, political, religious, cultural, moral, and economic; sincerely and devotedly, without the pursuit of personal, selfish aims. Men and women of this kind are needed by our nation today, and we should endeavor to emulate them.</p>
   <p>An executive and an agitation committee were formed, and Messrs. V. Kralicek and Jaroslav Zmrhal were elected representatives for the District committee. It was resolved to hold a big agitation meeting on the first Sunday of next June, to which Mr. V. Benes and prominent educators of the University of Chicago have been invited. Professor Jaroslav Zmrhal announced that Professor Matthews has promised to be present.</p>

   <p>It was also resolved to delegate Mr. Zmrhal and Mr. Kralicek to the Northern Baptists' convention in Cleveland, the expenses to be defrayed by the Czech Baptist branch of the Czech National Alliance. The Northern Baptists have over six million members, and our two delegates are to awaken the interest of the convention for the liberation of the Czechs. Some of the foremost professors of the University of Chicago have announced that they would attend the convention, and lend their support to our national exertions. Fifteen new members have joined the Czech Baptist branch of the Czech National Alliance. This brings the membership to sixty-nine. Dues amounting to $70 were paid.</p>
   <p>The firm, Universal Varnish Works, has offered to donate two per cent of its profits to our branch. The offer was gratefully accepted.</p>
   <p>At the close of the meeting, Mr. Zmrhal read a letter sent to him by President Pratt Judson of the University of Chicago. This communication <pb facs="5418478_7_0558.jpg" n="3"/>was received with much gratification, for it defined most emphatically the reasons why the Czechs must become independent.</p>
   <p>Jan Maivald, secretary.</p>
