   <p>Today is the fifty-ninth anniversary of the death of Karel Havlicek Borovsky, one of the best sons of our nation in the last century. The anniversary will probably be remembered by our Sokols and many other organizations by a pilgrimage to Douglas Park where his monument stands.</p>
   <p>Karel Havlicek Borovsky was born October 31, 1821, in Borova near Nemecky Brod, and died July 29, 1856, in Prague. In his political and literary writings, he clearly indicated the direction which Bohemian endeavors should take. His views are so realistic that they have remained authoritative and have retained their leadership in the old country until the present time. But his views are exceedingly applicable also to American conditions, conditions of much greater importance to us, and therefore they should be <pb facs="5418478_7_0094.jpg" n="2"/>given much more attention by American Bohemians than has been given them so far.</p>
