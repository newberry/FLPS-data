   <p>Among those mentioned in official reports from the battlefields are three Czechs. The first is Vaclav (Venceslas) Sasek, 24, butcher by trade, fell in battle July 18. Born in Bohemia, he came to Chicago from the West and resided in the home of Mr. Macek, former tavernkeeper at 1831 South Laflin Avenue. When the United States declared war, Sasek hastened to enlist for service in the United States army, thereby knowing that he was doing his duty to his new country as well as to the motherland. All honor to his memory!</p>
   <p>Joseph Strnad is another volunteer who shed his blood for the cause. He was 21 years of age, and was in the 23rd Infantry regiment of the U. S. army. Before his enlistment he was employed in war industry by the Chicago Screw Company, and resided with his uncle, Mr. Suran, at 1532 West 18th Place. He had been a resident of Chicago for several years when he left for the army with a contingent of members of the Sokol Chicago, March 1917. He had always <pb facs="5418478_7_1370.jpg" n="2"/>been an ardent Sokol, and was one of the best in the group of the Catholic Sokol of St. Vitus, No. 48. He was wounded on July 18, but has a good chance to recover.</p>
   <p>The third of our fellow countrymen is Joseph Susterka, 3320 Hirsch Street. His name appears in one of the latest reports, and details are lacking. The War Departments' information states only that his condition is grave.</p>
