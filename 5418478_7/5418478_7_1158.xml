<title level="a">THE SECOND CONVENTION OF ALL BOHEMIAN-SLAVONIC CHURCHES IN THE UNITED STATES</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The Second Convention of all Bohemian-Slavonic Evangelical Evangelical Churches in the United States was opened with a sociable meeting in the Bethlehem Church, 1853 South Loomis Street last night at eight o'clock. A welcoming address was given by Reverend V. Vanek of Chicago, chairman of the temporary committee.</p>
   <p>The participants in the convention were greeted by the old worker, Reverend E. A. Adams of Chicago, who is American born, and who learned the Bohemian language because of his love for the Bohemians.</p>
   <p>Then followed the answers of five delegates of five individual churches. The Reverend Doctor Vincent Pisek from New York spoke for the Presbyterians; Reverend Jan Musil of Cleveland, Ohio, addressed the meeting on behalf of the Congregational Church; the old Slovak Baptist preacher, the Reverend August Meereis from Creighton, Pennsylvania, brought greetings from the Baptists of <pb facs="5418478_7_1159.jpg" n="2"/>his section; Reverend V. J. Louzecky of Cleveland, Ohio represented the Methodists; and the Reverend V. Dudycha officiated for the Reformed Church.</p>
   <p>The program of the evening consisted of vocal solos and choral selections rendered by the entire chorus. The Reverend Vaclav Losa of Coraopolis, Pennsylvania led in prayers; the Reverend F. Pokorny of Ely, Iowa spoke with a great deal of sympathy about the sickness of the Reverend V. Prucha; the last address was delivered by the Reverend A. J. Moncol of Holdingford, Minnesota, in his melodious Slovak language.</p>
   <p>A conference dealing with the publication of books and of a united Evangelical newspaper will be held in the Bohemian Settlement House at 1831 South Racine Avenue today.</p>
   <p>The afternoon discussion will be devoted to the topic, "How should the American Bohemian Protestants celebrate the memorable year 1915?" It will begin at two o'clock.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1160.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>For eight o'clock in the evening a mass meeting is scheduled at the First Baptist Church, 1609 South Throop Street, where the following preachers will deliver addresses: Reverend Edward Wrbitzky of Silver Lake, Minnesota; Reverend Miloslav Filipi of Tyndall, South Dakota; Reverend A. P. Slabey of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and the Reverend Jan Blum, a Pole.</p>
