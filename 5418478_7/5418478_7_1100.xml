   <p>Those who were on North or South Crawford Avenue yesterday had a very sad experience. This street, whose calm is usually marred only by the din of an occasionally passing streetcar, or a still rarer funeral procession, took on a most unusual appearance. There was a continuous line of cars and other personal vehicles interrupted, at shorter or longer intervals by, here a black, there a grayish, or a white hearse. This procession started in the early morning hours and led to the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) and other cemeteries in its neighborhood, stopping here and there to disentangle itself from the frequently occurring accumulations of traffic caused by vehicles going in the opposite direction. This applies mostly to cars going north, but even the southbound were interspersed with hearses carrying their dismal loads to cemeteries situated in other parts of the city. And this grim procession lasted until the early evening hours.</p>
   <p>While the appearance of the street was very unusual, nobody thought of asking for the reason. Everybody knew, was still thinking, of the Saturday morning <pb facs="5418478_7_1101.jpg" n="2"/>when the news of the "Eastland" catastrophe spread with a lightning speed throughout Chicago.</p>
   <p>There were sobs and tears in all Chicago cemeteries, and happy were those who could unburden their sorrows in these material outlets of suppressed emotions.</p>
   <p>The Cesky Narodni Hrbitov alone received fifty-seven bodies of the victims of the "Eastland" catastrophe, and most likely there was a comparable number of funerals in our Catholic cemeteries, the St. Adalbert and Resurrection, yesterday.....</p>
