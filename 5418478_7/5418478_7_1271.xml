<title level="a">MEETING OF BOHEMIAN NATIONAL CEMETERY ASSOCIATION</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>P.2--In spite of the severe cold which descended upon Chicago yesterday, a large number of members of the Bohemian National Cemetery Association gathered in its meeting, which was held as usual in the lower hall of the Bohemian-English Liberal School on Eighteenth Street. The meeting was brought to order by the chairman of the association, Mr. Jan Pech, at eight o'clock sharp.</p>
   <p>The secretary, Mr. Joseph Filip, read the minutes of the previous meeting, which were unanimously accepted. It could hardly be otherwise, because Mr. Filip's records are always distinguished by their absolute correctness. Following this, communications received were read; of these there were many on hand. They were for the most part acknowledgements from school sponsors to whom New Year's gifts had been sent.</p>
   <p>The treasurer of the Old People's Home had deposited another thousand dollars with the Cemetery Association. Of course the Cemetery Association does not need this money, but the Home's money is well taken care of here; so why should not its treasurer deposit it with us? Several lodges announced the <pb facs="5418478_7_1272.jpg" n="2"/>names of new representatives to the Association.</p>
   <p>Mr. Potter is offering new bonds to replace the city bonds, which the Association has on hand, and which have matured. This matter was left in the hands of the managing committee. It was decided to have five hundred copies of the semi-annual report printed. For the good of the Association several motions were offered; Mr. Smejkal's motion that hereafter no free burials shall be allowed was accepted. It was resolved, however, that if investigation proves that the petitioner is really poor, the cost of the grave will be refunded.</p>
   <p>The financial secretary, Mr. Husak, then announced the receipts and disbursements for the month of January.</p>

   <p>In the last half year the total receipts of the Cemetery amounted to $23,790.18, and disbursements were $20,459.30. This left a balance in the <pb facs="5418478_7_1273.jpg" n="3"/>treasury of $3330.88. The Association owns $80,071.62 worth of miscellaneous commercial paper.</p>
   <p>We can gain some idea of the immensity of the business of the Cemetery if we realize that between the beginning and the end of the last half year a total of $726.30 was paid out as wages to employees of the cemetery. Eleven lots valued at $1,376.00 were sold. There were 86 burials, five of them free. $267.69 was placed in the reserve fund.</p>
