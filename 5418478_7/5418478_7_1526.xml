  <body>
   <p>A Bohemian troop of Boy Scouts of America is being organized in Svatopluk Cech Park which is located at Twentieth and May Streets. The park management was successful in securing the services of an excellent instructor, Mr. Vaclav Washa, who, as a soldier, has had much experience in this class of work. Mr. Washa is a sincere Bohemian, and is enthusiastic about this new movement of our youth. According to his statement, our Bohemian boys have an opportunity to organized one of the best troops not only of Chicago, but of the entire country. They have the necessary qualifications and capabilities belonging to Boy Scouts.</p>
   <p>In order that we might somewhat inform Bohemian parents with this new movement among our youth, we announce that the Boy Scouts of America, primarily, are trained in strict obedience by means of various military marching drills, flag, and other signal communication, telegraphy, and <pb facs="5418478_7_1527.jpg" n="2"/>other useful skills. Here is an opportunity for our Bohemian youth to be represented in a dignified manner before Americans. It is up to our Bohemian parents now to aid us in this direction, and place their sons under the American flag and they will surely contribute to the honor and fame of our Bohemian people in this new country of ours.</p>
   <p>Boys from twelve years upward are accepted into this new organization, and they must have the consent of their parents. There are no expenses involved, except for the uniform which costs about two and a half dollars. Applications are being accepted by Mr. V. Kodl, the manager of Svatopluk Cech Park, in his office, and Mr. Vaclav Washa, 1615 Jefferson Street.</p>
