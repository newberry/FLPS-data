<title level="a">MEETING OF THE SBOR ZASTUPCU CESKO-NARODNIHO HRBITOVA</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The regular monthly meeting of the Sbor Zastupcu Cesko-Narodniho Hrbitova (Society of Representatives of the Bohemian National Cemetery) was held yesterday at the usual place. After reading the minutes of the last meeting and announcing the bills payable, the secretary proceeded to the reading of letters.</p>
   <p>The first item to be read was the proclamation of the Straz Osvojenych (Guard of the Enlightened), in which an appeal was made to Bohemian rationalist societies and Bohemian individuals to become more active in behalf of the rationalist cause than they have hitherto been. For the purpose of furthering national rationalist activity, the Straz Osvojenych is undergoing reorganization. It therefore invites all rationalist societies to join the new organization and to send their representatives. The annual dues are a mere two dollars. The money received in dues will be used to arrange lectures and for other educational purposes. Although the preliminary meeting has been held, <pb facs="5418478_7_1171.jpg" n="2"/>it is not too late to join. At this first meeting, Mr. Frank Masek, Sr. was elected representative, and the annual fee was fixed at two dollars.</p>
   <p>The financial secretary, Mr. Husak, announced that the February payroll amounted to $234.82, and that forty people were employed in the Bohemian National Cemetery. Referring to the reports of the various committees, Mr. Mencl said that the building committee had very little to announce. Because of the severe cold weather, the construction of the building has been delayed. He reported that the contract for the building of an oven in the crematorium was given to the Jarvis Engineering Company, of Boston, Massachusettes, which submitted the most advantageous bid. Investigation....has revealed that this firm is reliable and trustworthy in its transactions.....The oven will cost $6,500.</p>
   <p>Some of the representatives called attention to the promise of Mr. Randak, the builder of the crematorium, that the building would be under roof long ago, but all such objections were overruled, because it was realized that the extreme cold weather hampered building activities.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1172.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Mr. Joseph Smejkal announced that he had visited the office of the Collector of Internal Revenue. He believes that the Sbor Narodniho Hrbitova will be exempt from the payment of income taxes because it is a nonprofit organization. The chairman, Mr. Jan Pecha, later called the attention of the representatives to the sixtieth anniversary celebration of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Society) to be held at the Sokol Chicago Hall on the afternoon of March 22. The celebration will be followed by an evening theatrical performance in the Cesko-Slovansky Hall. Everyone is invited to attend.</p>
   <p>Mr. Frank Masek made a motion that those present honor the deceased members of the rationalist societies by rising from their seats. This act of respect was duly carried out. It was further resolved that our representatives send a wreath of flowers to be placed on the graves of the deceased brothers in St. Louis. The secretary was likewise authorized to send a letter of congratulations to the St. Louis brothers.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1173.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Mr. Sedlacek called attention to the meeting to be held soon in Pilsen Park in protest of the statement made by Professor Roose that the Bohemians and Slovaks are undesirable as immigrants.</p>
   <p>For the purpose of beautifying the graves, the sum of $600 was deposited by Louise Cadok, Marie Dobes, Emma Kufner, and Joseph Kostner.</p>
   <p>The committee on arrangements was ordered to select a subcommittee to arrange for the Memorial Day celebration.</p>
   <p>The report of the financial secretary showed the following: cash from the last meeting, $12,489; receipts, $4,831.55; disbursements, $3,463.95; balance, $13,857.61. Of this balance, $10,000 has been deposited at 31/2 per cent interest. The cash on hand reported by the financial secretary is $3,857.61.</p>
