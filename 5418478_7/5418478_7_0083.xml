   <p>"....Decoration Day does not mean an empty, superficial celebration, an opportunity for flag waving and blabbering about liberty. While we are honoring the dead soldiers, it should inspire us to deeds worthy of the name, "American patriot." The time which calls us under the "Star-Spangled Banner" is greater than other great periods of the past.</p>
   <p>"There never was a time more portentous than the present, but there never was an aim more sublime for which to fight. Here we have the old struggle for freedom, only more keen, and loaded with fateful possibilities, and of the greatest import for the future.... It is a decisive contest for which we must accumulate and expend all our power and resources....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0084.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Everyone of us should buy Liberty Bonds, and become a member of the Red Cross. We should not hesitate to lay down our lives upon the altar of our new homeland.....</p>
   <p>"We Czechs are, however, also under obligations to our motherland, Bohemia. It is up to us to join in the action which is sure to bring freedom to our people. This War fills us with hope that our old homeland will be wrested from the yoke of Hapsburg rule. We have begun to pursue our aims by the activities of two main organizations: the National Alliance of Czech Catholics and the Czech National Alliance. It is our duty to do the utmost for the support of the united action....."</p>
