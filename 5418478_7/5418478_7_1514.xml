   <p>Students of Czech descent at the University of Chicago have organized. It is of interest to observe the aims and purposes of this group, which is becoming influential among native American students. The slight interest which the younger set of American educated men has hitherto shown in the Czechoslovak cause is to be traced to the students themselves, and not to the University proper. Certain opinions and traditions are deep-rooted. There are some Czech students who may have asked themselves questions similar to the one asked by that renegade who visited the Czech art exhibition last week--he wanted to know how the Czechs could be independent when there are Germans in Bohemia also?</p>
   <p>The difference between this student and those mentioned above is a flippant manner on one hand and sheer lack of national consciousness on the other.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1515.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>However, the soil is being prepared. There will be a need for a great deal of information, and it will be necessary to eradicate manifold prejudices which prevail among those very ranks of Czech-American students. These circles will have to brace themselves for determined action among our young spirits who should grow into active forces, propelling our propaganda.</p>
   <p>J. Horak called several meetings of Czech-American students last month, the result of which was the founding of a Cesky Klub (Czech Club). Mr. E. Zbitovsky is president; Miss A. Jiranek, vice-president; Miss J. Janovsky, chairman of the program committee; Mr. A. Novak, secretary; Mr. A. French, treasurer. The activities of the club will be of a social, propagandist, and informatory nature.</p>
