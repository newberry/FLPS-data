<title level="a">MEETING OF THE FEDERATION OF BOHEMIAN FREE THOUGHT SCHOOLS</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The meeting of the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) was called to order by Mr. Joseph Tichy, chairman, at the regular time. Many delegates were in attendance. The minutes of the previous meeting were presented by the secretary and were approved as read.</p>
   <p>The names of new delegates were then read. The chairman, in greeting the new delegates, reminded them that it is absolutely necessary to attend the meetings regularly. He explained the need for their co-operation, because this year we have four hundred more children in our schools than last year. It means that more than 2,400 children are attending our schools this year. Inasmuch as school supplies are more expensive and the salaries of the teachers had to be raised, the Federation is in need of more money. For that reason, it is the duty of every society which has not sent any delegate to do so now, because we must take care of the Bohemian schools. The chairman also reminded the <pb facs="5418478_7_0938.jpg" n="2"/>delegates that a theatrical performance for the benefit of the Sdruzeni Svobodomyslnych Skol will be arranged in the near future, and he asked all those who were present to take care of the advance sale of tickets.</p>
   <p>The elections were next in order, and the following delegates were elected: Mr. Joseph Tichy, chairman; Mrs. Soucek, vice-chairman; F. Soukup, secretary; Dr.Antonin Mueller, treasurer.</p>
   <p>It was also mentioned that the Svobodna Skola (Free School), a periodical devoted to children, does not have a wide circulation. The Svobodna Skola should be subscribed to by every Bohemian family, because it is an instructive periodical for our children. Therefore, it was resolved to start a campaign to gain more subscribers for this publication.</p>
