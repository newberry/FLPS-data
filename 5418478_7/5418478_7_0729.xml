<title level="a">THE THIRD GENERAL CONVENTION OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF BOHEMIAN CATHOLICS OPENS TODAY</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The third national convention of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics [of America]) will begin its sessions today in the Ceskoslovenska Americka Sin (Czechoslovak-American Hall) at 1436 West 18th Street. It is expected that the attendance of delegates, from all parts of the United States, will be great. Everything seems to indicate that it will be one of the most important conventions ever held by the Svaz, and according to the program, which has already been published, many serious and momentous problems await the delegates.</p>
   <p>The convention will last three days, and will consequently close on Thursday.....The delegates were already beginning to arrive early yesterday, and before the day ended most of the out-of-town representatives had arrived in Chicago. Most of them are delegates of the many Bohemian-American parishes scattered throughout the land. The extensive preparations made by the committees <pb facs="5418478_7_0730.jpg" n="2"/>guarantee splendid results.....[Translator's note: Here follows a repetition of the convention program already reported in previous issues of this newspaper.]</p>
