<title level="a">MEETING OF THE FEDERATION OF BOHEMIAN FREE THOUGHT SCHOOLS</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The meeting of the Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Skol (Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools) was opened by the president, Mr. J. Tichava. All of the officers of the Federation were present except Dr. A. Mueller, the treasurer, who excused himself by letter. The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved. The following letters received by the Federation were read:</p>
   <p>A letter from the Bilalilie (White Lilly) Lodge No. 68 of the Sednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies Union) informing the Federation that a two-cent tax, levied in support of the schools of the Federation, shall be so levied by the Jednota, and expressing the hope that the Jednota will recognize the need for the levying of this tax.</p>
   <p>A letter from the Narodni Slovenska Skola (National Slovak School) asking the <pb facs="5418478_7_0809.jpg" n="2"/>Federation to send a delegate to a festival which the Slovak school will hold on May 30, 1922, and where the delegate could deliver a brief talk on education. The invitation was accepted and Mr. Tichava will attend the said festival.</p>
   <p>A letter from the Sbor Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Ucitelu (Board of Delegates of the Bohemian Free Though Teachers) in which they announced some minor changes to be made in the printing of school certificates and record blanks. These changes were adopted. In the same letter the teachers made a request for older teachers to be paid their salaries during the summer vacation. Mr. Veverka (one of the teachers), in a brief talk, mentioned three of our oldest teachers, pointing out the fact that they deserve to receive their salaries during the vacation period. Among other things he said: "Teachers such as Miss Zeman, Mr. Straka, and Miss Koller, have devoted their lives to the cause of education as engaged in by the Free Thought movement. Now, when they are old and feeble, they deserve to be taken care of by the Bohemian public, to say nothing of merely paying their salaries during the summer vacation." The text <pb facs="5418478_7_0810.jpg" n="3"/>of the letter was fully considered and it was decided to ask the opinion of the various Jednotas.</p>
   <p>The meeting continued with the reading of the quarterly report of periodical, Svobodna Skola....Mrs. Dobias reported on the conditions of the schools. All text books, according to her report, were found to be in good condition .... She complained about the small attendance, however, saying that although we own beautiful school buildings, there is a noticeable indifference to class attendance. It is necessary, therefore, to propagate our work, to appeal to the parents in order that school attendance might increase during the next school year. The teacher, Mr. Veverka, also pointed out that our Sunday schools are inadequate, and that it would be better to arrange lectures, soirees, get-togethers, etc. These would advertise our work and benefit us morally. Mr. Jelinek concurred with him in this and suggested that recitals be given in which the school children would participate, thus bringing about co-operation between parents and teachers and leading to an increased attendance.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0811.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Mrs. Stary presented a bill for $150 for the rebinding of text books furnished by Mr. Safranek; one thousand books were rebound by Mr. Safranek. The said amount was ordered paid. The entertainment committee made a report on the proposed festival which is to be held by the Sdruzeni on September 15, 1922. A school contest for the individual schools was announced; three prizes were offered [for the best work of any student in our schools]; they are to be $50, $40, and $30.</p>
   <p>Mr. Veverka resigned as a teacher for the reason that next year he is to teach in Czechoslovakia. In a brief address he thanked all who had co-operated with him in making the Free Thought cause continue to flourish, and urged more systematic activity in that regard so that Free Thought schooling might prosper in Chicago. The president Mr. Tichava thanked Mr. Veverka for his activities in the interest of such schooling....The Sdruzeni in losing Mr. Veverka is losing and indefatigable and valuable worker and teacher who, during his many years of activity, earned the respect of the Free Thought School movement. We wish him great success in his new field of activity.</p>

   <p>Mr. Jelinek announced that on June 2, 1922 there will be a picnic at the Pilsen Park pavilion; one half of the proceeds of this picnic shall go to the Sdruzeni. This being the case it was considered desirable that the picnic be well attended. Mrs. Hrisny, a delegate from the Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage), reported that the Utulna decided to organize a Sunday (morning) school, but that the school cannot function very well in the morning because of the great number of pupils (74). It is impossible [according to the report of the delegate] to take care of so many students at one time. It was decided therefore, to start additional classes on Saturdays. One half of the students will be taught on Saturdays, the other half on Sundays. This arrangement seemed to be more adequate. After reading of the financial report the meeting adjourned.</p>
