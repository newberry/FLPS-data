<title level="a">DEDICATION OF THE BOHEMIAN SOLDIERS' MONUMENT</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>Bohemian valor in the cause of liberty has now for the first time an enduring memorial.</p>
   <p>At the head of the main avenue in the Bohemian National Cemetery at Irving Park stands a monument, typical of the Bohemian-American defenders of the Union. It was dedicated yesterday with all the pomp and solemnity of the Grand Army ritual in the presence of 5,000 Bohemian citizens of Chicago.</p>
   <p>The statue is of bronze of heroic proportions representing a private soldier in full fatigue uniform. He stands in an attitude of dauntless courage, with his left hand supporting a color staff, the pike partly buried in the earth at his feet, and its silken folds flowing about his shoulders. In his right hand he holds his bayoneted musket ready to repel anyone who dares assail the flag.</p>
   <p>President Matousek delivered the address of welcome. Chief Marshall Lewis invited the Grand Army to perform the rite of dedication. H. A. Dietrich, Past Senior Vice <pb facs="5418478_7_1493.jpg" n="2"/>Commander of the Department of Illinois, responding to the invitation, said: "In the name of the Grand Army of the Republic I thank you for the honor you have done us in asking us to dedicate this beautiful monument. Our Bohemian citizens responded bravely when our country was assailed, and left their homes to preserve the flag of their adopted country. This monument is not only a memorial to your heroic dead, but will hereafter teach all men that there can be but one government, and one flag." Commander Hawison pronounced the words of dedication. The military symbols were then removed, and the veil which had concealed the statue was drawn down. A prolonged cheer went up from the assemblage, the Bohemian Sharp-shooters fired a salvo of three and the circle of colors around the monument was dipped three times. The first Bohemian soldiers' monument in America was dedicated.</p>
   <p>Wm. Kaspar, the President of the Bohemian Memorial Association, then presented the monument to the officers of the cemetery.</p>
   <p>President Vaclav accepted the gift for the official board.</p>
   <p>After this the Bohemian societies sang "The Unveiling of the Flag", a song composed for the occasion by Prof. J. Simonek. The Hon. Carter H. Harrison then delivered <pb facs="5418478_7_1494.jpg" n="3"/>an address. Assistant prosecuting attorney Elliott and Joseph Cermak delivered the closing addresses, and after the song"Evening" by the societies, and the song of the "Retreat" by Bugler Van Horn the ceremonies were ended,</p>
