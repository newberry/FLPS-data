  <body>
   <p>The board of representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) held an important meeting last night, the last one of this year. The important item on the agenda of that meeting was which of our national organizations will benefit this year by the board's Christmas munificence, and what amounts will be donated to each.....</p>
   <p>The financial secretary, Mr. Husak, reported that the pay roll for the month of November amounted to $2,888.15, which was paid out to fifty-six men employed by the cemetery. The president introduced new representatives, advised them as to their duties, and impressed upon them the fact that the success of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov rests squarely on their shoulders.....</p>
   <p>....The board discussed the financial help that should be given to the John Huss Memorial....The first proposal was $500, the second $1,000, which <pb facs="5418478_7_1129.jpg" n="2"/>amount the board appropriated for this purpose. During the debate it was pointed out that the principal purpose of the donation is to show approval of the idea of the John Huss Memorial by such a body as the board of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov here in Chicago itself, because until this time, most, if not all, of the donations for the John Huss Memorial were coming from the rural districts and smaller communities.</p>
   <p>The request of the Druzstvo Pro Postaveni Delnickeho Domu (Workingmen's House Building Association) in Cicero for a contribution was not denied, but the discussion of it was postponed until a future meeting. The reason for the postponement was the fact that the Sokol Karel Jonas is building its home in the very same neighborhood where it was proposed to build the Delnicky Dum. It was pointed out that it is a very poor policy to build two expensive public buildings in such a small community as Morton Park, and the board of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov instructed its secretary to suggest to the two bodies that they pool their resources and erect one building of which the whole Bohemian community in Chicago could justly be proud.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1130.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A letter from the Ustredni Sdruzeni Ceskych Svobodomyslnych Spolku Pro Oslavy Husovy V Roce 1915 (Central Association of Bohemian Free Thought Societies for the 1915 Commemoration Festivities of John Huss) explaining the program of the body and asking for a loan was read.....A loan of $50 was approved.</p>
   <p>The discussion of the petition of the Cesko-Slovansky Pomocny Vybor (Bohemian-Slavonic Auxiliary Committee) was deferred.....</p>
   <p>The board took up the subject of Christmas and New Year's donations and decided to contribute....$2,500 to the Free Thought schools, and $500 to the Ceska Utulna A Sirotcinec (Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage). A long and useless debate about the proposed donation of $25 to the Cesky Delnicky Pevecky Sbor (Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Society), during which many an uncalled-for remark was passed, ended with the approval of the donation by a vote of 30 to 4.....</p>
   <p>The Matice Vyssiho Vzdelani (Council for Higher Education) received....$50; <pb facs="5418478_7_1131.jpg" n="4"/>the Cesko-Americka Tiskova Kancelar (Bohemian-American Press Bureau), $25.....</p>
