<title level="a">SECOND DAY OF THE CONVENTION--COMMITTEE REPORTS YESTERDAY ACCOMPANIED BY UNDIGNIFIED DEBATE</title></bibl>

   <p>One more session like the one which was held by the convention of the Freethinkers yesterday, and we will not hesitate to say that the convention has completely failed in its purpose, and has done more harm than good to a good cause. Whether some like it or not, we are certain that many of the delegates agree with us in this respect. They came to the convention to establish a sound organization for the Freethinking Czechs, and not to hear the quarrels and unnecessary arguments which some willful people bring up. Even the least quick-witted can recognize that three factions have developed in the convention. Each of these wants to be recognized and wants to force its own ideas upon the others, disregarding the fact that by so doing it ruins the chances of accomplishing the things that were expected of the convention.</p>
   <p>The session was called to order at 9:00 A.M. by the chairman, Mr. J. Pech.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0658.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The secretary, Mr. J. Tupy, read the minutes of the previous meeting, and Mr. Janda read the communications received. Reports of the committees were then made.</p>
   <p>The chairman of the resolutions committee, Mr. Rosicky, read the convention's resolution which outlines in brief the purpose of the convention, which is to work for the liberation of the mind from religious superstition and to help those who already are active along these lines in other fields, social and economic. After a lengthy debate the resolution was adopted. Delegate Cetka, chairman of the committee on organization, education and publicity, introduced a motion to the effect that the organization be named "Bohemian-American Free Thought Association." Dr. Frank Iska moved that the resolution be printed and distributed to the delegates during the afternoon session, in order to give delegates an opportunity to read and study the proposals and to aid them in making a correct decision in the matter.</p>
   <p>Dr. Jicinsky proposed a resolution which called for the inauguration of active <pb facs="5418478_7_0659.jpg" n="3"/>preparation for a dignified celebration of the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Professor Klacel, which will fall on the seventh of April, 1908. This and several other resolutions were adopted, after which the session adjourned.</p>
   <p>During the afternoon session there was a little more harmony, and consequently more was accomplished. This improved considerably the impression left by the morning session. The chairman appointed to the auditing committee Mrs. Stepanek, Mrs. Smrcek, Dr. Wedeles, and Messrs. David, Ptacek, Nosek and Jambora. They are to audit the treasurer's books and submit a report today. After the reading of the minutes of the morning session the secretary read the communications received.</p>
   <p>The next order of business was the report of the organization, education and publicity committee. A lengthy debate ensued, in which Messrs. Pergler, Camsky, Cejka and Mrs. Klaus participated. The resolution was finally adopted. In the meantime Miss Porchert and Mr. Fritz arrived as delegates from <pb facs="5418478_7_0660.jpg" n="4"/>Milwaukee. They were welcomed by Dr. Iska. The proceedings then continued.</p>
   <p>The convention is to be held every four years, in accordance with the motion made by Mrs. Vodak. The chairman announced the sudden death of delegate Herout. Dr. Iska reported on the previous evening's session. Mrs. Veselsky, was entrusted with the speaker's chair for this evening. The chairman then adjourned the convention to 9:00 A.M. today.</p>
