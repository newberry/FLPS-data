<title level="a">A GENEROUS GIFT THE NATIONAL CEMETARY ASSOCIATION DECIDED IN IT'S MEETING YESTERDAY TO DONATE$1000.00 TO THE BOHEMIAN LIBERAL SCHOOLS</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Yesterday's meeting of the representatives of the Bohemian National Cemetary Association will forever remain entered in golden letters in the history of the Bohemian schools. Golden because the schools were remembered in a truly golden way. The immeasurable importance of the Bohemian schools to our national life is becomming more evident and the necessity for their existence is understood by everyone. The National Cemetery Association was at no time a step-father toward the Bohemian school, yesterday however, it proved itself to be an overly-kind father towards them.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order at 8:00 P.M. by the chairman Jan Pech, in the lower hall of the Bohemian-American Liberal School, in the presence of all <pb facs="5418478_7_1292.jpg" n="2"/>officers and an usually large number of representatives. The secretary Josef Filip, read the minutes of the previous meeting and these were approved after several notations. Bills against the Association were read and ordered paid. Then the payroll of the laborers employed by the Cemetary was read. This lasted quite a long time, and it seems that things of that kind only serve to unnecessarily prolong the meeting. After these various communications were read, some of which were quite significant. A letter from the Czechoslavak Union in Prague requesting the Association to send it the addresses of all lodges was read. The request was granted.</p>
   <p>The Oldmouce School Association writes, that it maintains a school with 256 pupils in its two grades. This of course entails great sacrifices since the state contributes nothing to the upkeep of the school. The Association therefore is seeking contributions. Alas, this request did not find enough favorable representatives, and was rejected. Several communications were <pb facs="5418478_7_1293.jpg" n="3"/>then read in regards to the moving of graves; in some instances the requests were granted. The Association of Representatives for the good of the Bohemian Liberal schools requested in it's letter, that the customary gift to the Bohemian schools, be forwarded to the Association of Representatives in it's entirety and the Association will see to the distribution thereof. This request was rejected after a lengthy debate and it was resolved that the customary procedure would be adhered to. A request for a contribution for the singing school of the Vesna-Slovan Singing Society was rejected. A certain representative wittily added "He who wants to learn to sing should pay for it." Immediately following this it was resolved to grant a contribution to the singing school of the "Slavoj" society, which likewise had requested a contribution. Surely both organizations could have been accomodated, for Bohemian youth is educated by song also.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1294.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>Then discussion was started in regards to the customary gift to the Bohemian schools. Three motions were offered. One called for $500 the second was for $600 and the third was for $1000. All of these proposals were actively discussed. Many speeches were made, many of which pointed to the fact that the association was represented by many, in fact almost all, of those who realized the necessity of providing for our youth, that they might be raised in our mother-tongue. During the voting three votes were cast for the $500, nine were cast for the $600 and finally the $1000 proposal was accepted unanimously. Later the accountant, Mr. Husack, read the report for the preceeding month.</p>

   <p>There were buried thirty-one minors and ten adults on lots, seventeen minors and twenty-three adults in single graves. Two were buried free of charge. After the roll-call of those present this memorable meeting was adjourned.</p>
