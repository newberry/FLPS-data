   <p>"Authorized circles in the United States have become convinced in the course of the last few years that the immigrant wave is growing so rapidly that the newcomers cannot be assimilated fast enough. New laws were passed to impede the flow of immigrants. These measures have lost their meaning now, since immigration has been on the decline during the war, so that the dearth of laborers is being felt throughout the country.....The longer the war lasts,the more the United States will have to cope with a preponderance of emigration over immigration.</p>
   <p>"As far as Czechs and Slovaks are concerned, there may be many who will return to the old country. This will depend upon the fulfillment of the promise by the Allies to establish a Czechoslovak state.....We have no desire to judge these possibilities prematurely, because certain facts which will govern the <pb facs="5418478_7_1542.jpg" n="2"/>peace treaty are not known to us.</p>
   <p>"Our foremost duty now is to prove ourselves loyal and grateful to our new homeland and to repay it for the benefits which it has granted to us. We must help the United States to win this war which she entered not only to preserve her own freedom, but also to liberate the small nations from oppression, among whom we Czechs and Slovaks are numbered.</p>
   <p>"Whatever the future may have in store for us, we are here in America now, and we shall work to make it the happiest of all countries."</p>
