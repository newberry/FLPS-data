   <p>The Czech Presbyterian community of Chicago will assemble tonight for the celebration of the birthday of Jan Amos Komensky, famous Czech pedagogue and creator of a system of education, who presaged that the Czech nation would win back its independence, and whose teachings are a beacon light for those who work for the realization of his prediction. The rites will be performed in the Hubbard Memorial church on Lawndale Street between 25th and 26th Streets. The Reverend Krenek of Silver Lake, Minnesota, an ardent worker for the Czech National Association, will deliver the oration in the Czech language. The other address will be delivered by Bishop J. T. Stone, of the Presbyterian church, friend of the Czech people, who spoke so splendidly of our struggle for independence on the occasion of the commemoration of the five hundredth anniversary of the death of John Hus.</p>

   <p>The evening is also dedicated to the support of the Czech National Association, and will be a rally of the Czech Protestants for the strengthening of this organization. The Czech Protestants are now working with all their might toward winning the high dignitaries of the churches to the cause of Czech independence, and are preparing for a manifesto to be sent to all Protestant churches in America.</p>
