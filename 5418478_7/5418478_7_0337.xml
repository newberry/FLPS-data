   <p>The active Telocvicne Jednota Sokol (Sokol Gymnastic Union) has celebrated this year, as it always does, the memory of our never-to-be-forgotten leader, who for his insistence on truth and freedom of thought died far away from his native land in the flames of a charnel-house fire.</p>
   <p>The celebration consisted of two sessions, one in the afternoon and one in the evening. At the evening session Tyls's dramatic poem "Jan Hus" was presented by amateur actors. The afternoon session began with a concert by J. Novak's well-known orchestra; this was followed by "Tyrol," sung by the Choral Society. With the assistance of orchestra and singers Mr. Vacl Zajicek gave a monologue entitled "Delnik Boz Prace" (A Workman without Work), which was a great success. The timely poem "Prace" (Work), read by Mr. F. Stetka, was also well received. The celebration as a whole as well as the several productions which it comprised was entirely satisfactory to all those who attended.</p>
