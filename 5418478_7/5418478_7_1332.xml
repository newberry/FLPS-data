   <p>We are complaining of the lack of wholesome amusements. The people say there is no place where our young men and women can pass their leisure time and that's why they amuse themselves with drinking, parties, card games, etc. It is true that this happens all the time, but not because there are no places where our young men and women can go to amuse themselves in a wholesome way.</p>
   <p>We do not intend to enumerate societies and clubs where young people can find anything they want in decent amusement. We will point out to our young people only the singing clubs. In the sixth ward there is the Club Lumir, conducted by Mr. Kounovsky. Can there be for a Bohemian youth any better entertainment than a Bohemian song? In our neighborhood there is the active society Lyra, and everyone knows that what Lyra has accomplished. Should not every young man be proud of being a member of <pb facs="5418478_7_1333.jpg" n="2"/>such a society? Everyone possessing a little ability in singing should not stay away from a singing society.</p>
   <p>We are a talented, musical people and the membership in the singing societies is proof that singing is our hobby.</p>
   <p>There are founded many new educational societies. Why organize more when the strengthening of the old ones would be more helpful to the racial development of the Bohemians? Our duty is to help the existing singing clubs, so that they may prosper and be the pride of our people.</p>
