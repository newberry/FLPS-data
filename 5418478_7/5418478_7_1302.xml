   <p>The minutes of the previous meeting were read and approved without change.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Pinta announced that she wishes to remove the body of her first husband Krize from the National Cemetery and rebury it in the Catholic Cemetery, which request was granted by the Association, providing she receives a permit from the Health Commissioner. The Slovanska Lipa (Slovak Basswood) invited the National Cemetery Associates to a fair, which it is holding from Dec. 7 to 13 and sent fifty complimentary admissions. A gift of $10 worth of flowers was made to it.</p>
   <p>Prokop Vitek of 1152 S. Albany Avenue requested a new deed, claiming that he lost the original. In this regard his request will be granted, when he makes out a sworn statement of the facts. K. D.Lusk, recommends that the National Cemetery Association buy a machine for lowering coffins into the graves. The matter was referred to the management committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1303.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The patronage of the Bohemian Liberal School "Jan Amos Komensky" requested a donation for the exhibition held on Nov. 27, 29, 30. In as much as the communication arrived after the affair had been held, it was impossible to comply with the request. A gift will be made during the holidays.</p>
   <p>The managing committee turned over the warranty-deed from the Recorders Office covering the newly acquired land. The committee was successful in borrowing from Bohemian citizens as much money as was needed. The managing committee was authorized to accept bids for the landscaping of the newly purchased sixty acres. Liberal-minded schools were granted as holiday gifts the sum of $500 to be apportioned according to the number of pupils attending. The committee appointed by the National Cemetery, which met in joint sessions with the society for the Cremation of the Dead, announces that the latter named society has had an invitation from an English society, to unite with them. The Bohemian society however is giving preference to the Bohemian National Cemetery, and it was decided that the Cemetery Committee should <pb facs="5418478_7_1304.jpg" n="3"/>introduce estimates as to the cost of building the crematorium and the costs of incineration. The managing committee was authorized to place a tomb-stone on the grave of the Bradovy child, it being the first corpse buried in the National Cemetery. Expenses in this case are not to exceed fifty dollars. During November twenty lots were sold for $2045, ninety bodies were buried, two of them free of charge, being the children of Mrs. Anny Mastne, and Vinsovych. The reserve fund increased by $477.98.</p>
   <p>During November the wages paid to workingmen amounted to $1,068.98. Borrowings amounted to $56,220.</p>
