<title level="a">DEDICATION OF THE CORNERSTONE OF THE NEW BOHEMIAN CHURCH IN MORTON PARK</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The cornerstone of the new Bohemian Catholic church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, the Heavenly Queen, in the flourishing colony in Morton Park, was laid yesterday. The ceremony was observed by a large gathering of our countrymen who had been trying for a long time to have a church erected in Morton Park where they could worship their God and attend to their religious duties. The dedication proper was preceded by a fine parade, participated in by all associations that had promised to be present. Many of the societies attended with their full membership, others were represented by strong delegations, and individuals from far and near assembled around the church grounds in large numbers.</p>
   <p>The parade started on the dot, and after welcoming Bishop Rhodes, whom it went out to meet, returned to the site where the attending clergy and the bishop performed the ceremony of the laying of the cornerstone.</p>

   <p>After the ceremonies, which were impressive and worthy of the Bohemian Catholic colony in Morton Park, all those present were conducted into the hall of Sokol Karel Jonas, where the celebration was concluded by a banquet.</p>
   <p>The speakers of the day were Judge J. P. McGoorty, Reverend Vojtech J. Dedera, Mr. Geo. Comeford, Mr. W. V. Vavra, and many representatives of participating organizations. All of them gave their good wishes to the colony for continued success in its development.</p>
   <p>(The upper part of the Church will house a class room.)</p>
   <p>Many presents were given to the Church by the delegations of the various organizations. Most of these presents, of course, were in the form of money.</p>
