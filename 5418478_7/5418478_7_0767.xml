<title level="a">THIRD CONVENTION OF THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF BOHEMIAN CATHOLICS</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>According to the decision of the Executive Committee of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics), the Third General Convention of the Svaz will be held in Chicago during the days of October 3, 4, and 5. The Cesko Americka Sin (Bohemian-American Hall) on West 18th Street will house the convention.</p>
   <p>According to the constitution of the Svaz the convention should have been held on the second Tuesday of June, but since the expedition of the Svaz to Czechoslovakia demanded many preparations, and since many national and organizational workers left with that expedition, it was necessary to postpone the third convention until fall.</p>
   <p>This year's general convention will be a conspicuous manifestation of our <pb facs="5418478_7_0768.jpg" n="2"/>Bohemian Catholic people in this country. The convention will be opened on Tuesday, October 3, at 10 A. M., by a high pontifical Mass. The details of the program will be mailed to the appropriate agents. Thus we shall meet for the third time [in our history] to survey our work, to learn about our progress, to gain more self-confidence for the setting-forth of all future plans, to increase our organizational network, and to strengthen our activities. Therefore start your activities today. Remember that the national convention of the Svaz has all the legislative powers, and is the highest judicial authority in all matters pertaining to the Svaz. Elect your delegates to the convention if you have not already done so. Work diligently on all motions and resolutions so that when we meet, you will be able to present a finished product of your deliberations, thus accomplishing something for the good of our mission among the Bohemian Catholics in America. Let there be a full attendance of the delegates of our societies and other organizations, and let this general convention overshadow the two previous ones. Our steadily growing organization needs more new, and more efficient workers.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0769.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Today we have an organization which ten years ago did not exist; let us therefore bend all our efforts to making it more effective and more powerful. The executive committee of the Svaz....: The Reverend F. W. Jedlicka, chaplain; Mr. Josef J. Janda, president pro tempore; Mr. Josef Kopecky, treasurer; Mr. Anton V. Tesar, manager of the central office; Mrs. Rozalie Nedved, Mrs. Marie Novotny; Jan Novotny, and Vaclav Kadlec, trustees.</p>
