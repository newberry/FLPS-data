  <body>
   <p>The solemn dedication of the new SS. Cyril and Methodius Church took place yesterday afternoon. The church is located at 50th Street near Hermitage Avenue, and its cornerstone was laid July 14 of this year. The celebration was participated in by numerous clergy-men and a multitude of our Catholic countrymen not only from Town of Lake, but also from other parts of the city. It was preceded by an impressive parade in which many Catholic organizations were represented. The dedication ceremony itself was performed by Bishop J. E. Quigley.</p>
   <p>After the Mass which followed the dedication and was celebrated by the Reverend Frantisek Bobal of St. Ludmila Church, there was a reception for the attending clergy in the parish house.</p>
