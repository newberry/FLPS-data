  <body>
   <p>Since yesterday, we have two countrymen in Chicago, who, for their ability and reliability, were appointed as postal superintendents. The first one appointed was Mr. Joseph H. Richak, who has been in charge of the Pilsen Post Office, at 18th Street and Ashland Avenue, for many years. Yesterday. Mr. Joseph F. Chmelik, of 4146 West Harrison Street, was placed in charge of "C" Post Office, at Madison Street and Racine Avenue. It is one of the most important post offices in Chicago because it handles two million letters every month, not including other mail, such as newspapers, parcel post, etc. Mr. Chmelik comes from an old Bohemian family, well known in our Pilsen district, where Mr. Chmelik's father conducted a dairy business at 17th and Wood Streets....The recognition given Mr. Chmelik is fully deserved, because he has been employed by the postal department for the past thirty-five years. In the year of 1885 he started as a messenger and delivered the so-called "special delivery" letters.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1353.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Later on he worked as a clerk and a foreman at various postal branches and for the past twelve years he has worked at "C" Post Office. He is very popular among his friends and his promotion brought him many congratulations. It is also necessary to mention that these two Bohemian superintendents were Schoolmates; they attended the same class in the Throop School. Mr. Richak was known as "big Joe" and Mr. Chmelik as "little Joe".</p>
