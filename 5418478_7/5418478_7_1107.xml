   <p>Our Catholic countrymen who are settled in considerable numbers on the North-west side of Chicago held a celebration yesterday at which not only they but all Bohemian Roman Catholics of Chicago commemorated the twenty-fifth anniversary of the settlement around the church of Panna Marie Dobre Rady (St. Mary of Good Counsel), situated, as most of our readers well know, at North Western Avenue and West Walton Street (sic). The celebration had been prepared well in advance and turned out to be a fine success. Through the care of the spiritual leader of the settlement and the priest of the Church, the Reverend Father Frantisek Jedlicka, a memorial pamphlet was issued for the occasion containing the history of the settlement, a brief history of all associations in the settlement, biographies of all its former shepherds, and a biography of its present leader.</p>
   <p>The pamphlet is very well put out, contains many fine photographs, portraits, and other illustrations, and will be of real service as a memorial to the <pb facs="5418478_7_1108.jpg" n="2"/>present members of the congregation and their descendants. Here are a few data taken from the pamphlet.</p>
   <p>The parish of Panna Marie Dobre Rady was formally founded September 4, 1889, although one of the associations which founded the settlement had been in existence for a year prior to that date. A great deal of help and many suggestions were given to the founders by the late Reverend Father Josef Molitor of St. Wenceslaus Parish. Upon his initiative a large piece of real estate, in fact, all the land bounded by Western Avenue, Campbell Avenue, Walton Street, and Iowa Street, was bought by the original settlers. The original church stood on Walton Street and was moved to its present site later on. Next to the church there is a large school building. Some of the lots in the block have been sold to members of the parish.</p>
   <p>The first pastor of the church, at that time not yet quite ready, was the Reverend Father J. F. Jedlicka, who was followed by the Reverend Fathers Hodyc, Hynek, J. Kestl, Keclik, Kolar, and, finally, F. W. Jedlicka. The <pb facs="5418478_7_1109.jpg" n="3"/>church and the school were built by the late Jos. Strnad. It is important to mention that the original settlement was not Bohemian only; there were also Slovaks there. There are many children in the school, and the settlement, or community, is rather a strong one.</p>
   <p>The celebration started in the forenoon by a mass attended not only by local associations but by many people from farther away. There was a parade in the afternoon, whose marshal was our countryman, Vaclav Kozojed. The parade assembled around the church and marched out at two o'clock, going east on Walton Street to Cakley Boulevard, south on Oakley Boulevard to Chio Street, then east to Leavitt Street and north to Superior Street, west to Oakley Boulevard and on Walton Street to the church.</p>
   <p>Many uniformed Catholic associations marched in the parade as well as many not in uniform, and there were also many automobiles bringing groups of celebrants. The whole neighborhood was appropriately and richly decorated. Numerous guests marched in the parade. After the parade there was a solemn <pb facs="5418478_7_1110.jpg" n="4"/>benediction in the church during which the associations marched to the neighboring parish garden, where the festivities were concluded by a spirited party, at which Mr. Vaclav Vavra and Mr. J. J. Janda presented short addresses. The official speaker was the Reverend Father J. J. Hroch of Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
   <p>Finally we mention the names of the most important associations in the parish: Spolek Nasledovani Krista Pana (Association of Christ Followers), No. 151 of the I. Ustredni Jednota (First Central Unity), Spolek Rytiru Sv. Jiri (Association of Knights of St. George), No. 176 of the I. Ustredni Jednota, Spolek Kadetu Sv. Augustina (Association of St. Augustine Cadets), No. 310 of the I. Ustredni Jednota, the Spolek Zen Panny Marie Dobre Rady (Association of Women of St. Mary of Good Counsel), No. 32 of the Jednota Zen Americkych (Unity of American Women), the Dvur Sv. Anastazie (St. Anastasia Court), No. 202 of the Catholic Order of Foresters, the Cesko-Slovansky Podporujici Spolek Sv. Josefa (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Association of St. Joseph), Spolek Sv. Vaclav (St. Wenceslaus Association), No. 79 of the Katolicka Druzina <pb facs="5418478_7_1111.jpg" n="5"/>(Catholic Fellowship), the Marianska Druzina (St. Mary Fellowship), the Spolek Sv. Ruznce (Rosary Association), the Spolek Sv. Klimenta (St. Clement Association), of the Katolicti Rytiri Americti (Catholic Knights of America), the Dramaticky Klub Kollar (Dramatic Club Kollar), and the Spolek Pannen Bl. Panny Marie Lurdske (Association of Virgins of St. Mary of Lourdes).</p>
