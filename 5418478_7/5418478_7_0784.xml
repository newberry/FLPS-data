   <p>It has been some time since the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics) received a letter of thanks from the Holy See through the Archbishop of Chicago, the most Reverend George Mundelein. In that letter the Svaz was informed that the initial installment of a collection, made for the benefit of the Bohemian college at Rome, and amounting to ten thousand dollars, was duly received by the Holy See and applied to the purpose intended. In this issue, we publish another letter, recently received which acknowledges the receipt of the balance of the said collection. This national gift of ours was transmitted through the Archbishop of Chicago and the papal legate in Washington. The committee appointed by the Svaz to make the collection consisted of the most Reverend Josef M. Koudelka, <pb facs="5418478_7_0785.jpg" n="2"/>bishop of Cleveland (now deceased), chairman; the Reverend Frantisek W. Jedlicka, chaplain of the Svaz, vice-president; the Reverend Prokop Neuzil, O. S. B., secretary; Mr. Josef Kopecky, treasurer. Thanks to the generosity of American Bohemian Catholics, the total of $8,171.26 was forwarded to the Holy See for the Ceska Rimska Kolej (Bohemian College At Rome), which sum, when changed into Italian lire, amounted to many hundred thousands.</p>
   <p>When we consider how our countrymen of the Catholic faith generously contributed to the cause of liberating Czechoslovakia, how much they gave to the various national activities and enterprizes,.....at the same time being obliged to keep up their parochial schools and churches, and other Catholic institutions, paying their diocesan fees according to the needs of each diocesan and for the use of seminaries, paying for the diocesan charities, for the Catholic university, for Indian and Negro missions, paying the cathedraticum, for sick priests--in short, paying for everything <pb facs="5418478_7_0786.jpg" n="3"/>which relates to or is associated with the movement of the Catholic Church in the United States--it becomes quite clear to our countrymen in Czechoslovakia and in Rome what an enormous financial burden is borne every year by the Bohemian-American Catholics all out of love for their religion. Our people are not exactly wealthy either; on the contrary, it is just those countrymen of ours who were most blessed by riches in this country who were the first ones to forget God.</p>
   <p>Below is a letter from the secretary of the Holy See, cardinal Gasparri, in its Bohemian translation:</p>
   <p>"From the State secretariat of His Holiness:</p>
   <p>Vatican, May 30, 1922.</p>
   <p>"Most honorable and reverend Archbishop! The magnanimous gift of $8,171.26 which you have sent through the papal legate in Washington, D. C. for the <pb facs="5418478_7_0787.jpg" n="4"/>benefit of the Bohemian college of Rome, caused sincere joy to the Holy Father who sees in this deed the true blossoming of Christian charity, also--and this is still worthier--a great love of the generous givers for the faith of their fathers.</p>
   <p>"To co-operate in the maintenance of those young men who have consecrated their lives to God, means to work together with them in their apostolic mission. Therefore, in this respect, the president of the Narodni Svaz....all its members, and the chaplain of that organization, the Reverend father Frantisek W. Jedlicka, could not do a more exalted and a more deserving deed than to help in this manner those young men who, following the ways of the greatest teacher of mankind, train and prepare themselves for their mission in their native land in order to diffuse there a true ordering of virtue, and, by their zeal, gain souls for God.</p>
   <p>"..... The Holy Father thanks Your Grace and expresses his wish that you render the thanks of His Holiness to all who so generously contributed to the <pb facs="5418478_7_0788.jpg" n="5"/>gift. He assures you that the said gift was delivered by him to the rector of the said college, and that he bestows his papal blessing as was requested upon the Reverend Father Frantisek W. Jedlicka and upon all those who have contributed to this religious collection.</p>
   <p>"I remain, most honorable and reverend Archbishop, your servant,</p>
   <p>"Peter Cardinal Gasparri."</p>
