   <p>The Bohemian National Cemetery Association has allowed $1,200 for Czech schools and $200 for the Bohemian Orphanage. Although the Association raised the wages of the employees recently, there is no fear of an impending bankruptcy. The Association enjoys a gigantic income, and is earning more money than many other similar enterprises of Czech ownership. The gifts mentioned above need not, therefore, appear under the heading, "luxury," on the accounts.</p>
   <p>Mr. S. J. Halik, secretary of the Association, made a wise and true statement when he said: "The Association is earning money off the Czech people; it is money from the Czech people that we are accumulating. Well, it is our duty to refund this money to the Czech people in some way or other. Let us give to the schools, which are our future, and we should also not forget the destitute."</p>
   <p>This declaration was received with great satisfaction, for it indicates that a new era has begun in the conduct of the affairs of the Association, and <pb facs="5418478_7_1262.jpg" n="2"/>that a new attitude has been taken. Only a short time ago the very suggestion of "paying back to the people" would have alarmed the majority of the representative committee. But lo and behold, this idea was greeted with vociferous approval when it was put into practice today. Now our people will understand that the purposes of the National Cemetery Association were not solely the burial of the dead and the decoration of their graves. Our people must be convinced that the good care of the finances, which has ever been of foremost importance to the committee, and the perseverance exercised in the business, though often criticized, were beneficial to the people themselves. The conduct of the committee was guided by wisdom, so that the fortune built up by the Cemetery is the property of the Czechs of Chicago today. This fortune is bound to bear rich fruit. These are the guarantees that our schools shall not perish, and that our charitable institutions shall not deteriorate, as they might without the aid from the Association.</p>
