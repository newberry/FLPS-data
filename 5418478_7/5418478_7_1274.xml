   <p>There was not much to be settled in yesterdays meeting of the National Cemetery Association for only two new requests for contributions had been received. The School Association requested a donation for its exhibition and the Workingmen's Choir also asked for a gift. It was resolved to give each of them $10 worth of flowers from the cemetery's greenhouse. In regards the request for a contribution for the purchase of Bohemian books for our public library, it was decided to postpone action on the matter until the annual meeting of the Association, at which time contributions to schools and patriotic-like purposes will be dealt with.</p>
   <p>The cemetery management announced that during October, twelve burial lots were sold for $1,555 and that $321.50 was deposited into the reserve fund.</p>
   <p>Total receipts at the meeting amounted to $2,880.01; disbursements, $2,458.04; balance on hand, $2,421.97. The meeting had a quick, smooth course as usual, which is the object of all successful associations.</p>
