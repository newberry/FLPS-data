   <p>Last night the Polk Street Depot was crowded with our countrymen who came to say goodbye to their relatives and friends who were leaving for Czechoslovakia, The expedition was arranged by the Slavia Shipping Corporation of New York, and all the participants will be guests of the Olympiad which will be held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, this year.</p>
   <p>Many of these people are going to Czechoslovakia for a visit, but a number of them intend to establish homes there. Among the participants were several families who with their children are moving to Czechoslovakia with the intention of spending the rest of their lives in the country where they were born. The train of the Wabash Railroad pulled out of the depot at 9 P.M. and many cries of bon voyage were heard from those who were left behind. Before the departure Mr. F. Strunc, who was in charge of the part of the expedition from Chicago, bade farewell to the people and thanked them for their <pb facs="5418478_7_1537.jpg" n="2"/>participation. This morning the train will make a stop in Detroit and another in Buffalo at Niagara Falls. [Names of 122 Chicagoans making the trip are omitted in translation.]</p>
