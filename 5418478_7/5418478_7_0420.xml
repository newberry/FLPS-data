  <body>
   <p>The second convention of our young but growing fraternal organization, the Cesko-Americka Jednota (Bohemian-American Union), is being held at the present time in Zastera's Hall at Blue Island Avenue and 19th Street.

   <p>The following delegates were elected officers for the convention: Brother Jan Foit, chairman; brother James Basta, vice-chairman; brother J. Jelinek, secretary; brother V. Kalina, assistant secretary. The chairman appointed various committees such as the ways and means committee, constitutional <pb facs="5418478_7_0422.jpg" n="3"/>committee, financial committee, propaganda committee, and resolutions committee. Following the reading of congratulatory communications and proposed motions, the president read his annual report. The secretary's financial report showed that the Cesko-Americka Jednota has 1743 members whose insurance amounts to $1,276,000.</p>
   <p>In the afternoon session it was resolved that Brother Havelka, past secretary, participate in the convention as the representative of the main office. Further, the annual report of the treasurer was read and approved by the financial committee. The committee on preparations presented its recommendations that a central sick benefit fund be instituted; that the membership dues be increased ten cents a month; that the main office and the Grand Lodge be made independent bodies; and further it recommended the discontinuation of the $250 insurance policy. All these recommendations were referred to the proper committee.</p>
   <p>The finance committee presented its report which shows that the total <pb facs="5418478_7_0423.jpg" n="4"/>assets of the Cesko-Americka Jednota total $53,633.23. The inventory committee then presented its report according to which the main office equipment is valued at $1725. Both reports were approved to the general satisfaction of the delegates.</p>
   <p>The motion of Brother James Basta, vice-chairman, that the office of president and the office of president and the office of organizer be held by one person was defeated.</p>
   <p>Brother William Pflaum's motions introducing the initiation ceremonies and the creation of English-speaking lodges were postponed for further consideration. It was recommended that membership in the National Fraternal Congress be retained, and representatives to the next convention of this organization be elected in the next meeting of the Grand Lodge.</p>
   <p>The convention unanimously approved the resolution against the limitation of personal liberties, and copies of this resolution will be sent to members <pb facs="5418478_7_0424.jpg" n="5"/>of Congress, state legislatures, and newspapers.</p>
   <p>The question of separating the office of secretary and financial secretary was discussed. However, it was resolved to keep both of these offices combined. The motion to separate the main office from the Grand Lodge was approved, and the motion to institute a central sick benefit fund was passed by 35 votes against 18 votes.</p>
   <p>In the Saturday morning session it was resolved that Brother Havelka be authorized to prepare reports for newspapers.</p>
   <p>Dr. Antonin Mueller, head physician of the Cesko-Americka Jednota, presented the bylaws of the proposed central sick benefit fund with several supplements, and the matter was referred to the constitutional committee. In the matter concerning our youth, it was decided to refer the report to <pb facs="5418478_7_0425.jpg" n="6"/>the propaganda committee for further recommendation. A lengthy discussion about insurance rates followed, but final decision was postponed.</p>
   <p>Denni Hlasatel, May 3, 1920. </p>
   <p>Convention Ends After Three Days' Session</p>
   <p>The Saturday afternoon session was called to order at 3 o'clock. First of all the congratulatory letter from the Bohemian Typographical Union was read, which also urged that all printing be given to union print shops only. This was noted and placed on file. The preparations committee recommended changes in the increase of insurance rates as follows: a twelve cent increase on a $1000 policy, eleven cents on a $500 policy, and ten cents on a $250 policy. This change is due to the fact that much more will have to be paid out than before.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0426.jpg" n="7"/>
   <p>Dr. Antonin Mueller recommended in the name of the resolutions committee that an initiation fee of two dollars be requested from every new member, and a special assessment of one dollar a year, together with an initiation fee from every new member who is over forty years of age. It was accepted conditionally that the sum of one dollar of the initiation fee be kept by the lodge.</p>
   <p>The convention's finance committee presented its report on the status of the youth department, whose treasury contains a balance of $861.15.</p>
   <p>In regard to the high cost of printing, the resolutions committee recommended the publication of quarterly reports only. The motion was defeated, and the report will be published every month as heretofore. The resolutions committee recommended that the rent for the main office should not exceed the sum of three hundred dollars a year, and that the Grand Lodge shall decide on its location. Beside that, it was resolved that the main office maintain a regular establishment, and that it should not be located <pb facs="5418478_7_0427.jpg" n="8"/>in the residence of an officer. The resolutions committee presented corrected resolutions concerning the rituals and introduction of the English-speaking lodges. This was approved by a 23 to 9 vote. The committee recommended that all dues and assessments be collected by the main office and not by the treasurer as was customary heretofore. A gift of twenty-five dollars was appropriated for the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage, and the sum of seventeen dollars and fifty cents to the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Bohemian Free Thought Federation of America). The Saturday session ended at 7:25 P. M.</p>
   <p>The following session was called to order yesterday morning at 9 A. M. The congratulatory letters of the Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska Podporujici Jednota (Czecho-Slavonic Fraternal Benevolent Association) and the Straz Osvojenych (Sentinel of Freethinkers) were read.</p>
   <p>The matter of bonding the officers was discussed; that is, whether bonds should <pb facs="5418478_7_0428.jpg" n="9"/>be furnished by the security companies or by private persons. It was resolved to leave it as is, except that the bonds of officers of the subordinate lodges should be furnished by the respective lodges. It was also resolved that the treasurer of the main office should be insured against robbery. The same was recommended to subordinate lodges.</p>
   <p>Dr. Antonin Mueller, in the name of the constitutional committee, recommended the following salaries for officers of the main office: president, $100 a year; vice-president, $25 a year; financial secretary, $700 a year; treasurer, $25 a year; members of the inventory committee: chairman, $25 a year, and two other members, $20 each; members of the auditing committee (3), $3 apiece for each audit. Head physician shall receive 25c for each certificate made out, and editor of monthly journal, $15 a month.</p>
   <p>Then a lengthy debate about the individual offices, bonds, and duties of officers followed. The president's salary and his $1000 bond were approved, <pb facs="5418478_7_0429.jpg" n="10"/>and it was resolved that he shall be held responsible for the payment of all bills, especially death benefits. In a case where the vice-president fills the office of president for a long period of time, his bonds shall be increased to $1000.</p>
   <p>The financial secretary's salary and bond were approved. It was resolved that for each increase of 200 new members he shall receive a special compensation of $50. The members of the auditing committee shall receive $2 each for every audit. The editor's salary was approved without discussion. Bonds of the trustees were reduced to $3000. Compensation for the flag-bearer was stipulated at $2 for each performance. Immediately thereafter the morning session was ended.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session was called to order at 2 P. M. The constitutional committee presented the amended section of the constitution, according to which the chairman of the inventory committee must present his report to <pb facs="5418478_7_0430.jpg" n="11"/>the grand lodge every month and is requested to appear at every meeting of the auditing committee. All officers of the main office were invited to the meeting of the Grand Lodge of the Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska Podporujici Jednota which will be held in Chicago at the time of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych convention. This meeting will be attended by Brother Zicha, president, and Brother Karnik, secretary of the Cesko-Slovanska Bratrska Podporujici Jednota, both from New York. The question of uniting all Bohemian benevolent societies in America will be deliberated in Chicago.</p>
   <p>As a special reward and recognition of merits, the convention appropriated the sum of $150 to Brother Havelka, heretofore secretary of the Cesko-Americka Jednota. The convention accepted a resolution expressing recognition to conventional chairmen and secretaries. To these above-mentioned a special reward of $15 and $10 was appropriated by the convention. The motion of Brother Frantisek Liska to establish a baseball team was approved, and the propaganda committee was authorized to fulfill the plans.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0431.jpg" n="12"/>
   <p>Finally, the convention came to the most important matter--the election of grand officers. The elections, except for the office of financial secretary which apparently no one seemed to want, proceeded smoothly. The following delegates were elected: Jan Foit, president; J. Moravek, vice-president; Jan Kubecek, financial secretary; Karel Vajc, treasurer. Dr. Antonin Mueller was unanimously re-elected as head surgeon and representative to the Federation of Bohemian Free Thought Schools of Chicago. As trustees these following were elected: Frank Horky, V. Kalina, and James Basta. The following were elected as members of the auditing committee: J. Zenisek, F. Vaclavek, and Karel Vittner. All the above-mentioned officers will form the National Grand Lodge. J. Jelinek was elected editor of the monthly journal.</p>
   <p>The next convention of the Cesko-Americka Jednota will be held four years from now or sooner, according to the need. Following the epilogue of President Jan Foit, who thanked the delegates for work they accomplished, the second convention of the Cesko-Americka Jednota came to a close before 8 P.M.</p>
