   <p>A proposal was made to notify the debtors to pay the unpaid balance of lots purchased from the cemetery. The debtors are, Joseph Parizek, who owes $42; Mr. Frank Ort, $43.50, and Mr. James Krofta, $34.50, a total of $120.</p>
   <p>After a short debate it was decided that these debtors should be notified by mail, and should they not meet their payments or ignore the notice, they will be dealt with according to the rules of the by-laws. Another motion was made and carried to the effect that the auditing committee make an annual inventory report of all property belonging to the cemetery association.</p>
