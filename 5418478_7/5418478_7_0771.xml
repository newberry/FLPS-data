<title level="a">MINUTES OF A REGULAR MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DELEGATES TO THE BOHEMIAN NATIONAL CEMETERY ASSOCIATION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>The regular meeting of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova (Board of Delegates to the Bohemian National Cemetery Association) was held last night in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies) on 18th and May Streets. Instead of the president, Mr. Jan Pecha, who at present is visiting in Czechoslovakia, the vice-president, Mr. Stanislav Simecek, acted as chairman. Because of the strike of the streetcar employees, the attendance was relatively poor. The....minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read. The same was true of all current bills which had reached the office....Then followed the reading of letters. The grand lodge of the Sesterska Podporujici Jednota (Bohemian Sisterhood) asked for a gift of some flowers to be used as decorations on the occasion of the sixth convention of its organization, which is to be held in Chicago on August 19. The next letter was from the grand lodge of the Jednota Ceskych Dam (Bohemian Ladies' Union) which asked the same favor [as the Sisterhood], and supported <pb facs="5418478_7_0772.jpg" n="2"/>its request by stating that the Ladies' Union, on the occasion of the convention of the Sisterhood, will be host to its delegates on August 27 in the hall of the Sokol Chicago, where a banquet will be given in honor of the delegates, and,therefore, some flowers will be needed for the tables. After these two letters were read, Delegate Zrust asked for the floor. He expressed his astonishment at the requests of these two women's organizations which [said he] are financially well fixed, yet ask for such favors as gifts of flowers. He was of the opinion that they have no need, to beg alms from the Sbor, being quite able to purchase the flowers they need. Finally, Mr. Kriz moved that, at any rate, about ten dollars' worth of flowers should be sent to them gratis. This motion was carried. The third communication was from the Ustredni Zenska Utulna (Central Old Women's Home) of Brno, Moravia. The management of the Home expressed its thanks to the Sbor for a gift of 1,500 Czechoslovak crowns, which were transmitted to it by President Pecha in the name of the Hrbitov....The semiannual, the financial, and the auditing reports followed....The executive committee announced through its chairman, Mr. Smejkal, that $280 had been collected last month <pb facs="5418478_7_0773.jpg" n="3"/>in interest from certain securities. No report could be made about the installation of a new centrally located pump for the use of the cemetery; the time was short and therefore this matter will be reported on in the next meeting. A small fire occurred at a certain place in the cemetery but the damage was slight and the property is covered by insurance. The matter of the columbarium was likewise postponed until the next meeting. It was reported that sections of the cemetery still unsold are being equipped with water supply and sewerage systems. The contract for the marble work for the new toilets was awarded to the M. Keating &amp; Sons Co., 4046 Wentworth Avenue. The said firm is willing to do the job for $1,740. Offers made by a competitor--the Corley-Meseroy Marble Co. of 919 South Fairfield Avenue--were read, but its price for the job was ten dollars more. The bids of the two concerns came at the same time and the contract was awarded to that company whose offer was lowest.....Mr. Smejkal presented a resolution in which owners of cemetery lots were ordered to repair and paint the benches belonging to their lots. The benches are rather shabby, are in a general state of disrepair, and make an ugly impression....This resolution was adopted without <pb facs="5418478_7_0774.jpg" n="4"/>any debate. Delegate Cipra then moved that the date of September 15 be included in the resolution; that any bench found in disrepair and unpainted after that date be removed by the cemetery authorities.</p>
   <p>A motion made by the executive committee, that a comptometer be purchased for the cemetery office, was carried....Mr. Kriz reminded the delegates that during the last week of the current month there will be a state convention of our foremost Free Thought organizations--the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies--at Cleveland, Ohio. It was moved and carried that a greeting be telegraphed to that convention in the name of the Sbor. Mr. Smejkal reported that the truck belonging to the cemetery had had a collision but that the damage was slight and was covered by insurance, and that no one was hurt. Because of the strike of the streetcar employees, the cemetery trucks are busy providing transportation for the employees of the cemetery, and it is therefore to be expected that the bill for gasoline will be higher this month.....[Translator's note: Material dealing with transfers of cemetery lots from one owner to another is omitted in translation.] The following persons paid <pb facs="5418478_7_0775.jpg" n="5"/>for the perpetual care of graves...[Names of persons, names of graves and amounts omitted in translation. The total was $900.] During the month of July sixteen cemetery lots were sold for $3,800.50; also two urns were sold for $377. The sum of $981.46 was deposited for the sinking fund. The payroll was $7,901.26. There were 81 burials and 4 cremations. The total receipts amounted to $17,942.91; total disbursments, $35,922.44.</p>
