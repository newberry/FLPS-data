   <p>The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Brother Josef Vodrazka, with 56 representatives present. The chairman exhorted the members to greater activity in the work for the cause, than they have shown thus far.</p>
   <p>The minutes of the previous meeting were approved as read. The next order of business was the reading of letters received.</p>
   <p>The first letter was from the office of the children's newspaper, Volne Skoly (Free Schools), in which they ask us to subscribe for their paper. This was agreed on, and the publication will be sent to our trustee.</p>
   <p>A letter was received from the Secular Union and Free Thought Federation <pb facs="5418478_7_1089.jpg" n="2"/>and reads as follows: "Friends! On Saturday, January 29, and Sunday, January 30, a convention will be held at the Augitorium in conjunction with the hundred and seventy-ninth anniversary celebration of Thomas Paine.</p>
   <p>The freethinkers of Chicago have gained in numbers in the last few years. No fewer than seven Free Though lectures are delivered in Chicago every Sunday, with fair attendances. This convention of the freethinkers will be one of the most interesting held in America.</p>
   <p>The meeting will be held in the Auditorium Hotel. On Sunday evening a banquet will be held in honor of Thomas Paine, and it is expected that a thousand persons will attend.</p>
   <p>Among the speakers will be: J. E. Remsburg, C. S. Darrow, J. E. Roberts, Dr. Frantisek Iska, Scott Bennett, the foremost Free Thought speaker in New Zealand, who is visiting here, Seymour Stedman, H. J. Bridges, William Thurston Brown, R. J. Cooney and A. W. McGee. Mr. McGee is the <pb facs="5418478_7_1090.jpg" n="3"/>newest defender of rationalism, and was, until recently,a preacher in the Saint Joseph's church in Rosenberg, Oregon. He now delivers a Free Thought lecture every Sunday.</p>
   <p>Mrs. (Dr.) Lucy Waite will represent the ladies as a speaker. The master of ceremonies will be H. E. Wentworth. The presence of other prominent speakers from other cities is expected. The Czech rational circles should be represented, and we hope that your organization will attend.</p>
   <p>The invitation to attend was acted upon and Brothers M. J. Kara, A. Cada, V. K. Soukup, and F. Kozeny were chosen to represent our organization.</p>
   <p>....It was agreed that the yearly remuneration of officers should be: secretary, $20; financial secretary, $10; and treasurer, $2.</p>
   <p>The next business was the election of officers for the year, and the following were chosen: Brother A. Cada, chairman; Sister Frances Soucek, vice-chairman; <pb facs="5418478_7_1091.jpg" n="4"/>Brother V. K. Soukup, secretary; Brother V. Janda, financial secretary; Brother R. Mejdrich, treasurer; and Brother Dr. F. Iska, trustee. Brothers Frantisek Vykouk, J. Prudik, and M. J. Kara were chosen to audit our books. The following brothers were elected as members of the organization committee: Frantisek Strunc, M. J. Kara, Antonin Zdarsky, V. F. Soukup, J. Kropacek, A. Hajek, K. Wittner, and Josef Sak.</p>
   <p>It was agreed that the Straz Osvojenych celebrate the five-hundredth anniversary of the burning at stake of Jeronym Prazky (Jerome of Praha). This motion was referred to the organization committee.</p>
   <p>Dr. Iak's motion to petition the Congress of the United States to pass a resolution favoring the freedom of small nations in Europe, was finally passed, and referred to our organization committee for further action.</p>
   <p>Josef Halousek, secretary.</p>
