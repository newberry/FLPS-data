   <p>"Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is not only a great honor, but an extreme pleasure as well, for me to represent here today the greatest protagonist of true temperance and the greatest defender of personal liberty; namely, the Brewers' Association of the United States of America.</p>
   <p>"When the next new history of the United States shall have been published, the name of this Association will appear there in conspicuous letters--recognized and appreciated. I wish to prove the validity of my assertion to those people not acquainted with the history of the brewing industry.</p>
   <p>"This Association was founded in 1862 when the condition of the United States was at its worst, and was based on national enthusiasm. At that time, the United States needed money for the prosecution of the war, and <pb facs="5418478_7_0594.jpg" n="2"/>certain manufacturers, upon whom the Government had relied, evaded the payment of taxes, even organizing groups for that purpose. At that time, the brewers who organized the North American Brewers' Association, came to the aid of the United States treasury. They formulated a plan according to which taxes were to be deposited and collected, and thereby assured tax collections and prevented fraud. This plan was submitted to Congress, and unanimously accepted by it. The main arrangements in this plan have been adhered to even to this day. Those brewers were patriots who aided the United States in time of need, and set a good example for other industrialists on methods of properly paying their taxes.</p>
   <p>"Later, the Brewers' Association extended the field of its activities. In its constitution are the following paragraphs: (1) The protection of the brewing industry and its improvement in the best manner. (2) To keep up a relentless fight against prohibition and fanaticism. (3) The propagation of true temperance. (4) The expansion of the right to personal liberty.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0595.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Fifty years ago, almost all of the New England States were under the yoke of prohibition. Massachusetts, Maine and Pennsylvania were opened to liberal ideas only recently, mainly through the efforts of the Brewers' Association, which suggested to these states a study of the issue. The states were given proofs by experts that beer is a healthy beverage; they defeated prohibition, and were glad to have gotten rid of that sore which fitted only the times of blue laws and serfdom, both of which have been rejected by the majority of the population. I hope that those states which are still under prohibition will soon free themselves from it, and increase the number of liberal-thinking inhabitants. Nobody can deceive the American people in regard to beer today. Almost all Americans in the past four years, have discussed and argued this issue. Those people do not, of course, know as much about beer as do you, Gentlemen, brewers and brewmasters, for if they did there would be no need for a Brewers' Association. The people would like the brewing industry and protect it themselves.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0596.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"The Brewers' Association expects that through the work done by this convention and from the next session of Congress they will enlighten the American public on the common sphere of the brewing industry and the people. It was always my opinion that the brewing industry is the business of everybody, and people who are engaged in it must, therefore, expect to be criticized, justly or unjustly.</p>
   <p>"One wonders, indeed, at the neglect the brewing industry has suffered in America to this day. Many thousands are employed in this business, from the farmer to the manufacturer, from the workman to the brewer, from the brewer to the consumer; more than several million dollars is invested in it. Observe the European countries; they take much better care of their people and their health. The majority of the European universities have professors who lecture on the science of brewing beer and other beverages, and have schools on the science of brewing open to everybody.</p>
   <p>"Why should we not have something like this in our country also? Why should <pb facs="5418478_7_0597.jpg" n="5"/>we not have public schools on the science of brewing? Why should our poor boys forever be denied the hope of becoming brewers? Why should we depend only on private institutions, which are excellent to be sure, but are too costly? It is my opinion and advice, therefore, that all liberal bodies and the North American Brewers' Association should take steps toward the founding of these public institutions, and that the science of brewing beer be taught at all State universities.</p>
   <p>"At any rate, it is much better to know the methods used in the preparation of beverages and food than to advise their rejection, especially when the people, who propose their rejection, do so out of malice or ignorance. Here in America temperance beverages are sold which are made from plain water and some injurious substances, which, if properly analyzed, would be condemned even more than moonshine whiskey.</p>
   <p>"The Brewers' Association of the United States has always acted publicly, it has no secrets, but takes the entire public into its confidence. The <pb facs="5418478_7_0598.jpg" n="6"/>Brewers' Association proclaims that only the purest and healthiest beer should be brewed, that bad and immoral saloons should be closed, and personal liberty extended as much as possible, and because this land is a land of freedom, a land we all love, the improvement of which we all strive, we all shall have equal rights here. The Brewers' Association will be always on guard so that these principles are preserved and always defended.</p>
   <p>"Gentlemen, Masterbrewers, now comes your hardest task. You must brew beer which will always alleviate sorrow and pain, and bring joy and happiness into the hearts of those who drink it.</p>
   <p>"I know that your convention will be beneficial not only to the brewing industry, but to all of the people of the United States.</p>
   <p>"The Brewers' Association of the United States wishes the Masterbrewers' <pb facs="5418478_7_0599.jpg" n="7"/>convention success, and I say, in advance, that it will meet with success, for which our enemies may or may not pray."</p>
