   <p>As reported in another issue, former pupils of the Vojta Naprstek School have founded a Senior Club which already has a large membership. The Sdruzeni Svobodnych Skol (Association of Free Thought Schools) is promoting the organization of the club by a proclamation directed to parents and pupils, as well as to the public at large, in which the need for similar youth organizations is emphasized. There can, of course, be no dispute about the existence of this need at the present time, in view of the future of our aid, Sokol, and other associations. If these organizations intend to plan for the future, they must first see that our youngsters do not become totally estranged from us. If they can be won for the youth organizations, there is well-founded hope that they will later join our own adult associations instead of those of other nationalities. The ranks of our societies will thus be constantly strengthened.</p>
   <p>Some of our organizations began to found clubs for adolescents several years ago. The results were not satisfactory, because the number of associations <pb facs="5418478_7_1508.jpg" n="2"/>that employed this system was too small to produce any far-reaching effects for all the brotherhoods.</p>
   <p>The members of the Association of Free Thought Schools are tackling the organization problem with much enthusiasm. We are certain that they will soon be able to report to the public about their successes.</p>
   <p>It is desirable that other schools follow this example by forming strong, virile junior clubs. Here is an opportunity for useful work. The Association for Free Thought Schools intends that its undertaking benefit not only its own, but also other Czech organizations.</p>
