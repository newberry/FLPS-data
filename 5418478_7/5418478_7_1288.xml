   <p>The National Cemetery Association held it's annual meeting last night in the Bohemian-American Liberal School. In spite of the fact that the meeting was very important, relatively few representatives arrived. We will not further comment, limiting ourselves to urging the Lodges, which send representatives, to ask the delegates elected to the National Association why they ignore the meetings so often.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order at 8 o'clock by the chairman, Jan Pecha. The secretary of the association, J. Filip, read the minutes of the previous meeting and they were approved without debate. The financial secretary, Mr. Husak, read the bills payable; these were accepted after a short discussion and ordered paid. Mr. Kubik asked why the fodder for the horses used in the cemetery was not being furnished by a Bohemian firm. The gardener, Mr. Inne, explained that Mr. Libal told him it did not that the fodder was delivered to the cemetery only in small lots.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1289.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Communications received were these read, one of which was a request from Vaclav Batek for work of some sort on the cemetery. His request was granted and the managing committee will arrange it. Several of the Lodges announced the election of new delegates to the association;these were introduced by the chairman and accepted as members.</p>
   <p>The meeting then proceeded to the most important act of the evening, the election of officers. Before this was accomplished, however, representative Holy made a motion that the pay of the officers and their bonds remain as they were. Representative Pospisil moved that the pay of the secretary be increased from $30 to $50. In the voting on these matters it was finally decided that everything should remain as it was.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jan Pech, the past chairman, was nominated for chairman by representative Topinka. Mr. Rehak moved that Mr. Pech be elected chairman unanimously. Mr. Mencl was unanimously elected as vice-chairman. Mr. J. Filip was elected secretary by unanimous vote. He is really a good secretary and the representatives made no mistake in re-electing him.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1290.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Our friend Jos. Jurka was elected as treasurer. The associations treasury is in good hands. To the following members were elected to the executive committee Messrs. Jos. Smejkal and Frant Vytlacil. Mr. Smejkal was elected for two years and Mr. Vytlacil for one year. Mr. Frant. Husak was elected unanimously as financial secretary. Mr. Leopold Inne was elected gardener. The National Cemetery such a competent is fortunate in having a gardener. Messers. F. J. Pechota, J. V. Matejka, and T. David were elected to the auditing committee.</p>
