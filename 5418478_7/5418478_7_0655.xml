   <p>At nine o'clock yesterday, the chairman, Mr. J. Pech, brought the third, and last, day's session of the convention of Freethinkers to order. The chairman placed on the agenda for discussion an item deferred from a previous session, namely the motion of delegate Sadilek to reconsider the already-accepted explanation of the essence of Free Thought which is the foundation of the new organization and upon which everything will depend in the future. After a lengthy discussion, during which an effort was made to substitute the report of Dr. Frank Iska and the minority for the organization committees majority report, which had already been accepted, the convention finally reaffirmed the adoption of the majority report.</p>
   <p>Before the committee reports were heard, nominations to the executive committee were held. There were so many nominees that it was resolved, on motion by the chair, that the nominees hold a meeting among themselves and select fifteen <pb facs="5418478_7_0656.jpg" n="2"/>members for appointment to the executive committee.</p>
   <p>Secretary Cada read the treasurer's report and the auditing committee's report. Both were accepted as read. Delegate Martini moved that the next convention be held in Omaha. Mr. Palda protested, urging that the convention be held in Chicago. Several other delegates spoke in favor of Chicago, and when the matter was finally put to a vote the majority was for Chicago.</p>
   <p>Toward the end of the session it was resolved to send a telegram to Bohemia congratulating the Sokols and other members of the mission. Then, after several other speakers had addressed the assembly, the convention was adjourned.</p>
