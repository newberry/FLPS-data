<title level="a">MEETING OF DELEGATES OF THE BOHEMIAN NATIONAL CEMETERY ASSOCIATION</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The executive board of the Bohemian National Cemetery Association held its regular monthly meeting last night in the smaller hall of the Bohemian-American Free Thought School on West 18th Street. The meeting was opened by the chairman, Mr. John Pecha, promptly at 8 o'clock. The minutes of the previous meeting were read by the secretary, Mr. S. T. Husak, and were unanimously approved of and accepted as read.</p>
   <p>The financial secretary [then] gave a report of the last month's receipts and disbursements; receipts were as follows: payments on lots purchased, $2,121.45; for grave decorations, $718.35; mounding of graves, $5; rough boxes, $73.25; fund for perpetual care, $450; for flowers, $408.80; for new foundations of individual graves, $36.65; for 67 graves, "246.50; for 20 small graves, $166; for graves on 22 small lots, $40; for graves on larger lots, $151.50; reburials <pb facs="5418478_7_0651.jpg" n="2"/>at $5 each, $75.55; total receipts, $4,498.05; balance on hand from last month, $6,841.31; total of receipts and balance, $11,339.36. The disbursements were $3,142.51; balance in the treasury, $8,196.85. Fifteen lots were sold for $1,905; the revenue from 140 burials, $424.29, was assigned to the reserve fund.</p>
   <p>The secretary then explained to the executive board the two per cent discount due on a bill presented by Janes B. Clow and Sons, which did not show discount allowed. After a short discussion it was decided to pay this bill less the two per cent discount, calling Clow and Sons attention to the deduction. An invitation from the School Association to its twenty-fifth anniversary celebration, to be held on the 27th of this month in Slovanska Lipa Hall on De Koven Street, was read and accepted. The Orphanage asked for permission from the board of directors of the Bohemian National Cemetery Association to order a carload of coal for the coming winter supply. This was referred to the managing committee for their approval. Mr. F. B. Barcal, an ex-police captain, suggested the necessity of cemetery guards. Mrs. Joseph Smejkal stated that <pb facs="5418478_7_0652.jpg" n="3"/>there are no guards and approved of Mr. Barcal's suggestion; it was decided to have a guard stationed at the entrance of the cemetery grounds. The delegates were furnished with printed copies of the semi-annual financial report and were told of the necessity of reading these reports in the meetings of their respective lodges. The chairman reminded the delegates of the survey of the cemetery grounds which is to take place next Sunday and hoped that every delegate would be on hand. It is also understood the reporters of this newspaper will be there. Mr. Rehak brought to the attention of the delegates the urgent necessity of repairs to the water tower. This work was ordered done as soon as possible. Mr. Fisher, a delegate, made a motion to donate a large wreath to the School Association on the occasion of their twenty-fifth anniversary. This motion was passed, and the secretary was instructed to attend to this as soon as possible. A report was given by Mr. Halik concerning three persons who owed money to the Association for lots purchased. Of these debtors one made a substantial payment, and the other two ignored the notices sent to them. Mr. Kralovec proposed that these two debtors be notified once more by <pb facs="5418478_7_0653.jpg" n="4"/>mail, limiting the time for payment to the fifteenth day of this month, and that should they fail to make a payment, the Cemetery Association should cancel their sales contract and notify them of the action taken. A number of persons deposited money for perpetual care of the graves on their lots; they were as follows: Mrs. Agnes Hartvik, $100 for her mother's grave; Mrs. Rosalie Hartvik; Mr. John Kveton, $100 for perpetual care of his grave after his burial; Mrs. Marie Pardus, $250 for three graves on her lot; Mrs. Rose Vrzal, $200; Mrs. Marie Havir, $100 for her husband's grave; Mr. Vavrinec Matejka, $100; Mr. Joseph Krouzil, $100; and Mr. James Havranek, $200.</p>
   <p>A delegate, Mr. Frydl, inquired of the Association whether a map of the cemetery grounds is available. He was informed that it was not. A discussion followed, and a motion was made and unanimously carried that a surveyor be engaged to make a survey of the cemetery grounds and to furnish a blue-print map to be framed and hung up on the wall in the office of the Bohemian National Cemetery. The chairman, Mr. John Pecha, suggested to the executive board and to the <pb facs="5418478_7_0654.jpg" n="5"/>delegates the buying of bonds. Two delegates suggested that instead of buying bonds it would be much better to lend to the C.S.P.S. (Czechoslovak Benevolent Association) the sum of $5,000 for general repairs to their building and for painting and decorating it. The names of the delegates making this proposal were recorded, and this matter was tabled until the next meeting. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
