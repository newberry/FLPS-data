  <body>
   <p>The Saturday afternoon session of the convention of the Slovanske Evangelicke Cirkve Ve Spojenych Statech (Federation of Slavonic Evangelical Churches of America was begun at 2 P. M. The Reverend V. Kralicek referred to the establishment of the Slovanske Evangelicka Podporujici Jednota (Slavonic Evangelical Benevolent Society). The speaker called attention to the fundamentals of such a society and in conclusion said that the society should be founded on a mathematical basis. As Christians we must be honest toward our members, and we must make no promises which cannot be fulfilled. The speaker especially warned against joining old societies only because of their low rates.</p>
   <p>At the invitation of Doctor Pisek, it was unanimously resolved that the next convention of the Slovanske Evangelicke Cirkve (Slavonic Evangelical Churches) <pb facs="5418478_7_1142.jpg" n="2"/>should be held in June of next year in New York City, prior to the departure of the excursion to Bohemia.</p>
   <p>The Reverend L. C. Barnes of New York spoke on the establishment of a joint seminary for the education of church workers. The discussion was participated in by the Reverends Zavodsky, Wrbitsky, and Kralicek, Professor Barta, Doctor Grauer and Professor Miskovsky. The entire matter was entrusted to a committee which is to discuss it and make a report on the matter at the next conference.</p>
   <p>Another subject of discussion was the creation of a benevolent society. The speaker was the Reverend, W. Regnem, who called attention to the success of our brother Slovaks in that respect. The report was received with enthusiasm. Others who spoke on that subject were Reverend Chladek, Moncol, Pisek, Musil and Wokoun. A committee of five members consisting of Reverends Kralicek, Regnem, Mysicka, and Wokoun was elected to work out the structure <pb facs="5418478_7_1143.jpg" n="3"/>of the benevolent society and at the same time to undertake the necessary agitation.</p>
   <p>The colonization committee in its report recommends that the permanent committee, the members of which are: Reverend Nloncol, Louzevsky, Dudycha, Jos. Vanek, Micha, Wokoun, Cernovsky and Dr. J. F. Smetanka, furnish information to Slavonic Evangelists as to where to settle in order to avoid being taken advantage of by various agents and companies.</p>
   <p>The resolutions committee recommends sending letters of thanks to the Southern Alliance of Bohemian Methodist Ministers for their extended greetings, and the expression of the Convention's sympathies to families of the sick: Reverend V. Prucha's and Dr. Davis'. On the motion by Dr. Pisek, the officers of the Convention were authorized to send a letter of thanks to Mrs. Jenkins, who made it possible to establish the Slavonic Immigrant Home in New York.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1144.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The committee for the establishment of the joint seminary was selected as follows: Reverends Miskovsky, Zavodsky, Barta, Kralicek, Nilla, Strelec, and Pokorny.</p>
   <p>The various denominations appointed the following delegates as members of the committee for the Federation of Slavonic Evangelical Churches of America: Methodist: Reverend Blum (for the Poles); Reverend Olejan, (for the Slovaks); Reverend Mysicka and Sladek, (for the Bohemians); Congregational: Reverend J. Prucha, Moncol, Bastl and Doctor F. Zavodsky; Baptists: Reverend Hlad, Kralicek, J. Vanek and Sturman; Presbyterian and Reformed: Reverends Dudycha and Regnem, Cunek and Bren.</p>
   <p>The committee for the establishment of a joint publication consists of Reverends Duhy and Kralicek, Vaclav Vanek, Bastl and brother laymen Sticha, Preucil, Wokoun and Brazda.</p>
   <p>This session of the Convention was brought to a close by singing by all, and <pb facs="5418478_7_1145.jpg" n="5"/>a prayer by Reverend Krenek. A blessing was pronounced by Professor Miskovsky.</p>
   <p>The second interdenominational convention cemented the friendship between all our Slavonic Evangelical Churches; ministers became mutually acquainted; and, the Convention, in this way, laid the foundation for a new expansion of Christian work among Slavs of America.</p>
   <p>Reverends K. J. Sladek and A. J. Moncol, and Dr. J. F. Smetanka were secretaries of the Convention.</p>
