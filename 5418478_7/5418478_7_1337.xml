   <p>Our Bohemian Catholic fellow-citizens have of late been showing activity such as would be befitting as more reasonable and noble purpose. We are informed that St. James Church on De Koven St. is to be enlarged and is to have a new steeple added to it. The outlay for this remodeling is estimated at $16,000. Also the Catholic community around St. Prokop Church is also considering the erection of a new large edifice to cost in the neighborhood of $36,000. Indeed, our Bohemian American Catholics surpass us so far in generosity and willingness, that every free-thinker must feel ashamed. All of our free-thinking Bohemians were fearful, that we would be able to raise not more than $5,000 to $10,000 at the most for the foundation of a Bohemian Orphanage. Hundreds of thousands of Bohemians unable to furnish $10,000 and about from 8,000 to 10,000 Bohemian Catholics in Chicago undertake to furnish among themselves over $40,000.</p>
   <p>Free-thinkers, go and learn from your own fellow-citizens and Bohemian Catholics. They surpass you in generosity to your personal shame. Learn generosity from those, whom you consider as stupid. </p>
