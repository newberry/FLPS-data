   <p>[Translator's note: This article is typical of reports from the front appearing in this paper almost daily, accompanied by pictures of soldiers.]</p>
   <p>Yesterday's official report from the scene of war contains the names of five Chicago men, among them a valiant young Czech soldier, Joseph G. Prochazka, who, before his enlistment, lived with his brother at 5402 West 24th Place, Cicero. The official report from France, relayed from Washington, merely states that Private Prochazka is among the missing. Since no other information is given, it is not known whether he was wounded or taken prisoner by the Germans. More news is eagerly awaited by the young man's numerous relatives.</p>
   <p>Prochazka is 25 years of age and was born in Chicago. He enlisted immediately after the outbreak of war, was first sent to Camp Grant, Rockford, Illinois, then to the camp at Houston, Texas, to Company D of the 131st <pb facs="5418478_7_1383.jpg" n="2"/>Regiment of Infantry. Three months ago he was sent with his regiment to France. After a brief period behind the firing lines, he took part in the fight. He sent several letters from the front to his brother and to his half brother, S. Rickl, 2509 South Homan Avenue. The last letter which was received by Mr. Rickl on July 26, from "somewhere in France," informed him that the writer was hale, hearty, and contented. It further stated he liked France, that the people are very friendly to the soldiers, and that the weather was pleasant.</p>
   <p>Prochazka, obviously, was, on his way to the front for he writes that they slept in stables along the road side; they had no complaint and were in a merry mood. Then, again, he writes that from the moment they entered France they were "in hell," and he expected to be in the firing line soon. His anticipation must have been realized as evidenced by the official report. The missing soldier's parents have been dead for some time.</p>
   <p>In yesterday's report we find among the wounded the name of Corporal <pb facs="5418478_7_1384.jpg" n="3"/>Robert J. Bangert. His mother, Mrs. Paula Bangert, nee Novak, 3712 West Twelfth Street, is well known in Czech circles here. Young Robert enlisted when only 16 years of age; he will be 17 in September. On account of his youth he was known in his company as "the kid," at the same time enjoying great popularity. At the recruiting station he had given his age as eighteen, and was believed, because he is almost six feet tall and weighed 165 pounds.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Bangert received the official report about her son last Sunday stating that he was severely wounded. A letter written by him was delivered yesterday. In it he imforms her that he has a bullet in his right arm and will send the missile to her after he has undergone an operation. The young soldier has sisters and younger brothers here, also a grandfather, who is a veteran of the Civil War. He is justly proud of his grandson.</p>
