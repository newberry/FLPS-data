   <p>One can scarcely believe that the Hubbard Memorial Church, which is located in the very center of our Bohemian colony, at 2520 South Lawndale Avenue is already about to celebrate its seventh anniversary. The time seems even shorter to us because we know under what circumstances and with what difficulties the church building was started. The pastor of this church is the well-known national and humanitarian worker, the Reverend Vaclav Vanek. The financial means of the group were small, and thus almost all of the building had to be financed on credit. It is therefore amazing to learn that the church, which is worth fifty thousand dollars, is entirely paid for and clear of all indebtedness. The last mortgage has been paid. This significant fact will be mentioned during the morning services which will begin at ten o'clock, and again during the evening service which will start at 7:30 P. M. The evening service will be followed by a friendly get-together of members and friends in the basement of the church. There will be refreshments. Everybody is welcome.</p>

   <p>Deserving of mention is also the fact that this church and its congregation worked tirelessly for all the national and humanitarian causes, and that during the past Christmas season, a collection was started which brought about seventy-five dollars. This sum was devoted to the support of the Czechoslovak and Russian undernourished children.</p>
