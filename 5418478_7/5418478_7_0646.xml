   <p>P.1--The afternoon session commenced at 2 o'clock sharp. The delegates' names were read and it was found that all were present.</p>
   <p>The secretary read the minutes of the morning session and these were approved as read. The chief-forester then proceeded with the installation of the elected convention officers. The newly elected chief-forester, Mr. John Budilovsky, began the proceedings with an ardent speech to the delegates and with hearty words thanked his predecessor for his work, for the good of the organization.</p>
   <p>"Lesnik" lodge sent a communication in which it requested that brother Sik, who is incurably ill, be paid one half of his death benefit, which is $250. The request was turned over to the grievance-committee for consideration.</p>
   <p>The Rules-committee which was appointed at the morning session, worked diligently <pb facs="5418478_7_0647.jpg" n="2"/>during the noon recess and introduced the rules at this time. According to these, the convention sessions will start at 9 A.M. sharp and last till 12 o'clock noon. The afternoon sessions will start at 2 o'clock and last until 5 o'clock. The proceedings and order of business are to be such as have been customary on such occasions and are to conform with the laws of the Order.</p>
   <p>The election of a committee on by-laws followed and the following delegates were elected: Mrs. Mary Stepanek, Joseph A. Smejkal, James E. Marek, Joseph Kundrat, Mrs. Caroline Souhrada, Frank Hejna, and Frank Hudecek.</p>
   <p>The following committees were then elected: An auditing committee composed of Henry Kafka, John Bouse, Anton Blaha, Frank Orth, and Mrs. Agnes Vanecek.</p>
   <p>The Grievance committee with Joseph Bidlas, Frank Kodat, and Mrs. Josephine Becvar.</p>
   <p>Resolutions committee of Frank Cisar, Albert Pech and James Kotas.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0648.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Publicity committee of Zigmund Chobotsky, Charles Martinek, and John Pyskacek. </p>
   <p>A Rituals committee of Leopold Pick, James Kus, and Frank Bobek.</p>
   <p>Next came proceedings for the good of the order and several very good ideas were exchanged. St far as changing the table of rates is concerned, it can be assumed from the inclination of the delegates, that they will remain as they are. The reserve fund however, will not be made up of bonds hereafter, instead, the reserve fund money will be used to purchase first mortgages. Although this has not yet been definitely decided, the majority of the delegates have expressed themselves as being in favor of approving such a resolution. </p>
   <p>The request of Lesnik lodge #6, that brother Sik be paid $250 out of his death-benefit, was then discussed. Delegate Mrs. Smrcek, moved that an assessment of five cents per member be levied and sent to all subordinate lodges for collection. The motion was approved with the understanding that action be completed before February 1, 1910.</p>
   <p>With that, yesterday's proceedings were ended and the chairman adjourned the <pb facs="5418478_7_0649.jpg" n="4"/>session, until the next day. The work of the convention is proceeding rapidly and the delegates expect that the convention will terminate, at the latest, tomorrow afternoon.</p>
