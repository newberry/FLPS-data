   <p>The celebration held yesterday, Decoration Day, can be called the biggest affair of its kind ever to be held at the Bohemian National Cemetery.</p>
   <p>A pleasant spring day, and refreshing cool breezes tempted thousands of Bohemian settlers, from all parts of the city and countryside, to come to the National Cemetery.</p>
   <p>From 8 A.M. until evening, street cars packed with people kept arriving at the cemetery gates. Great throngs of people crowded through the main entrance to the cemetery, which gave the appearance of a human ant-hill.</p>
   <p>The parade assembled before the C. S. P. S. (Czech-Slavonic Benevolent Society) <pb facs="5418478_7_0257.jpg" n="2"/>on 18th Street at 8 A.M., and extended from the hall to beyond Center (Racine) Avenue.</p>
   <p>Numerous societies took part in the parade, and then the journey to the cemetery, by street cars, was begun. The participants arrived at the cemetery at about 11 A.M.</p>
   <p>At the Soldiers' monument, a platform was built for the speakers. The cemetery committee, with its chairman, Mr. John Pech, and secretary, Mr. Halik, took their places upon the platform, followed by the speakers. The Bohemian-Working-men's Singing Society and guests were seated there also.</p>
   <p>Mr. Pech inaugurated the ceremonies, speaking reminiscently about the speaker of the occasion, Mr. Joseph Cermak, author of "Dejin Obcanske Valky" (History of the Civil War). Mr. Pech also spoke about the liberal-minded speaker and reformer, M. M. Mangasarian; and the veteran of the Spanish American War, L. A. Gaslie, adding that the reputation of these men was an assurance of the fullest <pb facs="5418478_7_0258.jpg" n="3"/>instruction about the significance of this celebration, and an explanation of the bloody Civil War in this country.</p>
   <p>Following this introduction, Brousek's Band played a medley of American national and military airs. Mr. Pech then introduced the speaker for the occasion, Mr. M. M. Mangasarian. The speaker spoke concerning the significant sacrifice made by those immigrants who fought in the ranks of the northern army, saying that they were people of distinguished, moral character. The chief reason for this War was the existing slavery in the South, and the slave trade as practiced by southern aristocracy. For that reason, the struggle of the Sixties was a fight for humanity and civilization, where the white men faced the bullets of the enemy in order to liberate the black race, defending in that way the fundamental law of this great republic, "that all people are born equal."</p>
   <p>Every citizen of this country has the right to enjoy all rights of citizenship, but he must recognize the deep significance of liberty. No one can be a free citizen politically, if, on the other hand, he is a slave to religion. Only a <pb facs="5418478_7_0259.jpg" n="4"/>free soul in all respects can understand. Freedom suffers no contradiction, it resists all opposition, and revenges itself as it did against the seditious South. The speaker added that it should be remembered from historical records of the city of Chicago that the first contingent to leave for the field of battle in 1861 was a regiment composed almost entirely of Czecho-Slavs, who chose this land as their country, and took up arms for humanity and civilization.</p>
   <p>To them, as well as the others, who slumber here in everlasting dreams, this monument was built by this great Bohemian community, indicating that the Bohemian people know how to appreciate the merits of those who left everything that was near and dear to them, and went to the field of battle in defense of the Union, in that way to protect the country against disastrous separation. They are deserving of credit for all the growth and progress that America has made since then.</p>
   <p>It is mainly due to the merits of the immigrants that America has become a great and powerful country. Europe sent to our country young, enthusiastic, <pb facs="5418478_7_0260.jpg" n="5"/>industrious, and energetic people of robust blood and healthy minds, and all this intelligence and strength united in one whole, raised this country to an unforseen degree of industrial and social progress. In that way, America received healthy, powerful, material raised in Europe at no cost. The older people remained by their hearths, in their homeland. It was the youth only which gave its energy to the amazing prosperity of the United States.</p>
   <p>In conclusion, the speaker once more admonished the public to appreciate its freedom in every respect, both politically and religiously, and to turn it over to their descendants intact.</p>
   <p>At the conclusion of his talk, the band played a melodic concert selection. Following this number, Mr. Pech introduced Mr. L. A. Gaslie, a young veteran of the Spanish-American War, who lost one arm, and had the other permanently crippled upon the battlefield.</p>
   <p>The speaker, a greatly sympathetic young man, addressed the gathering with a <pb facs="5418478_7_0261.jpg" n="6"/>well prepared and enthusiastic speech. He was dressed in the uniform of a sergeant, and well deserved the medal of honor worn on his breast. He said, in substance, that he did not have any merits as a veteran of the Sixties, but that he is proud of the fact that when the United States took up arms against despotic Spain, he helped in his feeble way to cut the chains which bound the "Pearl of the Antilles," Cuba, to the Hidalgo Empire. It also was a War of humanity and civilization. He called attention to the luxurious castles of European Royalty, especially the magnificent dwellings of the Bourbons in France, where the heroism of kings is related, whereas every monument erected to the veterans of this country, proclaims patriotism and humanity.</p>
   <p>Then the Bohemian Workingmen's Singing Societies sang a festive choral by Bendl. Mr. Pech introduced the Bohemian speaker, Mr. Joseph Cermak, who was greeted with a storm of applause.</p>
   <p>Our readers surely know the remarkable innate oratorical delivery of this <pb facs="5418478_7_0262.jpg" n="7"/>speaker, of his unusual knowledge of the history of this country, and of his cheerful character, with which, from the days of his youth, he was always able to enrapture his listeners. The speaker squandered no unnecessary words, but proceeded to the gist of the whole celebration. He called the attention of the gathering to the main motive of the Civil War, that is, to the long seditious preparation of the southern aristocracy to create a large, independent slave state, and in that way, to divide the United States.</p>
   <p>The sons of those who signed the Declaration of Independence degenerated to such a degree that out of plain selfishness, and deviation from fundamental national principles, they brought on a bloody Civil War in this land. People born on the same soil, nourished on one maternal milk, breathing the same air, met in a fratricidal conflict. It is our duty, when we read the history of national heroes, to think about them, and not merely to satisfy our curiosity. The Civil War furnished us with many such great men. They preserved freedom <pb facs="5418478_7_0263.jpg" n="8"/>for us, prevented the division of the country, and from their noble deeds, we should draw instruction and follow their examples. The Civil War originated as a result of the fact that the American people deviated from their principles, from their great ideals, and every nation which fails to take such a course, must suffer the consequences. The fact took an ugly revenge upon the Southerners, who impudently, and without regard for consequences, violated the Constitution, violated the fundamentals of freedom and humanity, founded by their forefathers, and handed down to them as a sacred heritage. It is up to us now to guard these liberties, because impudent hands are again reaching out, suppressing and striking at the freedom of speech, as has been noted in many instances of late. It is only a spark, which can at some time flare into a powerful flame, and again lead to the crossing of swords between those, who would abridge the liberty guaranteed to every citizen by the memorable Declaration of Independence, and those who place themselves in its defense. The past must be the teacher of the future, and we must not limit ourselves to transitory celebrations, but labor earnestly and wisely for the preservation of American freedom, civilization, and humanity.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0264.jpg" n="9"/>
   <p>The Bohemian Workingmen's Chorus than sang a beautiful composition "Bojovnici V Noci," (Warriors in the night). Following this, the band played a medley of Bohemian national airs, with which the program ended.</p>
