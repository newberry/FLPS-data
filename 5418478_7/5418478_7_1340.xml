   <p>The celebration yesterday at the Bohemian National Cemetary, occasioned by the laying of a corner stone, was attended by over 8000 people. The crowds were orderly.</p>
   <p>The success of the celebration was heightened by the decorations of buildings and streets along the line of march. Twenty eight Lodges and six bands were in line on their way to the trains. P. Hudka was Marshall. The parade moved out at 9 A.M. through streets jammed with thousands of people. Two trains of 17 coaches each were required to carry all those who wished to go to the cemetary. Arriving at their destination, the parade reformed and marched to the cemetary where dedicatory exercises were held.</p>
   <p>Speakers at the gathering were Mr. V. Stehlik, Mr. Matonsek, Mr. Fr. B. Zdrubek, and others. More than 5000 people were in attandance.</p>
