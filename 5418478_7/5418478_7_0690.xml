   <p>The Reverend Frantisek Bozenek, chaplain of the parish of Svaty Cyril A Svaty Metodej (St. Cyril and St. Methodius) in the Town of Lake, Chicago, visited the town of Valasske Klobouky during the recent organized tour made by the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics), to Czechoslovakia. His presence there, and the aid and counsel given by him to the people of that parish, had some beneficial results as was attested to by a letter recently received here and sent by the Spolek Svatych Cyrila A Metodeje (the St. Cyril and St. Methodius Society) of Valasske Klobouky.....This letter reveals that the Reverend Bozenek did not come to censure and to criticize, to admonish and to blame, but to give counsel and aid to the people of that parish by precept, example, and also materially. Such help is worth more than gold. The Spolek mentions all of this in its letter of thanks. The counsels and lectures of the Reverend Bozenek bore good fruit, and the sum of money which he <pb facs="5418478_7_0691.jpg" n="2"/>contributed to the building of a town meeting hall, made it possible to start the building operations at once. The building is now complete.</p>
   <p>At the time of making his gift the Reverend Bozenek addressed the Spolek in a straightforward American fashion. He told his audience that everybody, even those in poor circumstances, could aid the building project substantially, not by money but with labor such as digging, hauling of building material, etc. This counsel was something new for the people of the old homeland parish and was most enthusiastically received. The members of the parish society dug the foundations, hauled bricks, sand, made mortar; their own craftsmen gave their time and labor and before long the building was completed. Best of all, the cost was not great. It was only natural that the committee remembered their benefactor, after the completion of the building, by sending him a letter which overflows with gratitude. The letter is also a proof of how, with a certain degree of intelligence, willingness, and friendship, we may help our countrymen abroad and at the same time know of a good deed well done.</p>
