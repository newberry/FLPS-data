   <p>Yesterday's meeting of the Svobodna Obec [v Chicagu] (Congregation of Bohemian Freethinkers [of Chicago] was and will remain of great importance to all Freethinking Bohemians. The group convened in the school of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Societies), and the meeting was opened by the president, Dr. Frantisek Iska, who welcomed a very large attendance at the meeting....</p>
   <p>The constitution and bylaws committee.....proposed a number of amendments, all of which were designed to clarify the character and status of the Svobodna Obec as an Illinois corporation in compliance with all laws of the State of Illinois dealing with religious societies, and to make certain that the Svobodna Obec is endowed with all rights and privileges of such a society under the laws of the State of Illinois. All proposed amendments were unanimously adopted.</p>
   <p>Article 1, dealing with the principle of the Svobodna Obec, will now read as <pb facs="5418478_7_1126.jpg" n="2"/>follows: "The Svobodna Obec v Chicagu is founded....for the purpose of religious liberalism on the basis of the rationalistic foundation of the Scriptures and articles of faith of all religions; for the teaching and promotion as well as protection of the scientific monistic conception of the world, the propagation of the noble principles and duties derived from this conception which a man owes to himself, to his family, and to human society; for the dissemination of generally recognized principles of morality and the fostering, by written and spoken word, of the freedom of religious thinking and rationalistic morality.</p>
   <p>"Anyone who receives services on the occasion of baptisms, weddings, funerals, various family or private emergencies, and by that act gives evidence that his religious convictions are in agreement with the Freethinking principles of the Svobodna Obec, is considered a member of the Svobodna Obec."</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1127.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A new paragraph was added to the provisions concerning the Recnik Svobodne Obce (Speaker of the Svobodna Obec).....</p>
   <p>....The group at the meeting discussed the question of taking over the entire enterprise connected with the erection of the John Huss Memorial. It was agreed that it should be in the hands of a committee. Twenty-five members were then elected, and they were given the right to fill any vacancies by the societies co-operating with the Svobodna Obec in the building of the John Huss Memorial have the right to attend the meetings of the committee and the Svobodna Obec, and they have a voice in making decisions on matters connected with the John Huss Memorial....</p>
