   <p>In the clubrooms of the Sokol Tabor Slovanska Lipa (Czech Sokol's Association Hall), located at Karlov Avenue and Thirteenth Street, a special meeting was held Saturday evening, to welcome all the Sokol Volunteers, who after completion of service in the United States Army, returned home. The program was opened by a speech of the president of the association, Brother J. Lang, who, in a few sincere words, mentioned the meritorious work of the member legionnaires. Each of the legionnaires was given a gold sokol emblem as a remembrance, with the assurance of the respect of all the members present. Dr. Antonin Mueller, president of the Central District of the sokol's organizations, gave a talk on the social and economic problems of the Czechoslovak Republic. Brother Frana Klepal spoke a few words for the legionnaires, as did Brother Karel Penas, who has been decorated for bravery on the European battlefields by General Pershing. Our humanitarian causes were not forgotten. The collection among the members brought in the sum of $61, which was turned over to the Dr. Alice Masaryk fund for relief work among the poor widows and <pb facs="5418478_7_1357.jpg" n="2"/>orphans. The Sokol Tabor Slovanska Lipa is one of our oldest sokol organizations. The restlessness during the World War affected almost every one of our national organizations, and even this one was not permitted to enjoy the fruits of its achievements. However, the members are looking toward the future with great hope, and they believe that wherever there is enthusiasm to work there also is hope for successful results.</p>
