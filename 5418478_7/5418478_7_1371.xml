   <p>Brothers: We are calling on all of those who are subject to the law on registration. When you name your nationality, register as Czechoslovaks! Anyone who allows himself to be registered as Austro-Hungarian is openly proclaiming himself as belonging to the ranks of the enemies of this country.</p>
   <p>In answering the question about his place of birth, every sincere Czechoslovak should give the name of the land, thus: Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia, Slovakia. Yugoslavs will answer similarly: Croatia, etc.</p>
   <p>It is your duty to our old motherland, and also to this country which has so hospitably received us--it is your duty to designate your nationality as Czechoslovak. He who allows himself to be registered as Austrian or Hungarian will expose himself to the scorn of the Czechoslovak people.</p>
   <p>We are addressing ourselves to our national organizations and our Sokol groups.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1372.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We address ourselves to our priests in the Czechoslovak parishes, and urge them to speak about this matter to their fellow members and brothers, and to their flock; to admonish, and remind them of their national obligation to register as Czechoslovaks.</p>
   <p>Czechoslovaks! Make use of your rights and do your duty!</p>
   <p>For the Bohemian National Alliance:</p>
   <p>Dr. J. P. Pecival,</p>
   <p>The Reverend Father I. Kestl.</p>
