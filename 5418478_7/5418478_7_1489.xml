  <body>
   <p>The news that the Zouaves are again in action has caused Chicago to rejoice. It is generally said that our well-known Bohemian Lieut. Col. J. F. Kohout will be honorary successor to Ellsworths, one of those distinguished warriors of the Civil War. The Zouaves previously belonged to the militia units. The name of their strictly disciplined and well-trained unit was regarded with highest honor all over the United States, and they were recognized as the best soldiers in our new country. Furthermore, it will comfort our countrymen when we bring to light that among the Zouaves, Bohemians were always honorably represented.</p>
   <p>Lieut. Col. Kohout has decided to form an all-Bohemian company. It is a very welcome opportunity for our honorable volunteers, for if they are in the ranks of the Zouaves, they will be noticed by the public from the first time they take to the field. Of course, the Zouaves have stricter conditions of acceptance than other volunteer bodies. Whoever wishes to join their ranks and <pb facs="5418478_7_1490.jpg" n="2"/>accompany them into the field must be at least eighteen, not over thirty-five years of age, and single.</p>
   <p>The governor has been notified that the regiment is ready to take to the field at the next call for volunteers.</p>
