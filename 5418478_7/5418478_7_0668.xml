   <p>The afternoon session was attended by all the delegates. The minutes of the morning session were read and approved of. Next the committee on resolutions rendered its reports, which were also accepted. Thereafter a report was made by the accounting or financial committee. Then a report which suggested certain changes in the by-laws of this organization was submitted by a special committee. A vote was taken concerning the changes in the bylaws, all of which were approved of printed copies of the proceedings of the convention and the proposed and accepted changes in the by-laws were then forwarded to the Grand Lodge for reference.</p>
   <p>The remainder of the afternoon was spent in the election of new officers for the Grand Lodge, the majority of whom were prominent Bohemian men. The <pb facs="5418478_7_0669.jpg" n="2"/>officers were elected to serve for a term of three years.</p>
   <p>Before the meeting was adjourned, the newly appointed officers each gave a brief speech, and the convention closed at 6 P. M.</p>
