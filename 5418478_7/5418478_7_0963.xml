   <p>There are only ten days left in the month of November and yet, during these days, very much can be accomplished for the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych (National Tax of Freethinkers). It is only necessary that the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych be recognized as an urgent necessity. Here and there some Freethinkers are to be found who will say to themselves, "I am a member of Sokol, Sokol is a Free Thought organization; why should I also support the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers?" Others will say, "I am a member of a fraternal benevolent society which, according to its bylaws, is bound to support the Free Thought movement. Why should I therefore still contribute to the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych?" Such views only give proof that, not-withstanding the seventy years of its existence, the Bohemian-American Free Thought movement is not very deep rooted but is only superficial. If the Sokol or any benevolent society is a Free Thought organization, it means <pb facs="5418478_7_0964.jpg" n="2"/>that its members as individuals, and the society as a whole, shall not do anything that would contradict the Free Thought principles of the world; that such individuals and such a society are willing, according to the best of their abilities, to support the Free Thought movement--but not more than to support it. The real work, on a large scale, must be conducted by an organization which was established for that purpose because the Sokol and fraternal benevolent organizations have their own programs which must be followed by them.</p>
   <p>The Sokol organization is taking care of the physical development of its members and juniors, and should also, by its influence, work upon their spiritual development. Therefore this organization cannot devote itself to the systematic care of the Free Thought movement. The fraternal benevolent societies, in a similar way, must, in the first place, take care of their funds so that the death benefits are properly paid out. Therefore they cannot fully propagate the Free Thought. It is really peculiar that the Catholics do not even dream that it should be necessary <pb facs="5418478_7_0965.jpg" n="3"/>to state a reason why their Narodni Sdruzeni Ceskych Katoliku v Americe (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics of America) should be in existence, in addition to their churches and Catholic societies. They fully comprehend the significance of such an organization and they are fully aware of its influence upon public matters. But we, the Freethinkers, are still provincial in our thinking and roam around in circles. Many individuals are of the opinion that if they say, "I am a Freethinker," it is sufficient. Individual settlements are of the opinion that it is sufficient if they, every once in a while, do something for the Free Thought movement in their vicinity. But such a duty as belonging to a national organization which takes care of the greater tasks, which no individual or individual settlements, no matter how large they are, can tackle, is an awful burden for them. There are also fellow Freethinkers who, instead of contributing to the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych and then asking, later, "What have you accomplished with all the money?" right now are closing their pocketbooks, in order that very little money might be collected, and later on will say, "I told you so--the tax was collected and no results are apparent." Certainly, if you <pb facs="5418478_7_0966.jpg" n="4"/>want music, you must pay the piper. If the proceeds of the Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych are insignificant, the achievements will be insignificant also. The sincere and enthusiastic workers of today then, seeing that such miscomprehension of, and such very little interest in, the Free Thought movement prevails, will say to themselves that they will not uselessly spend their time and exert their efforts, and the Bohemian-American Free Thought movement will sink again into a state which may not be death, but is not life, either. Rather nothing at all than such a miserable existence!</p>
   <p>Collections for churches and other religious purposes are being made continuously, organizations with religious purposes abound with financial means, only the Free Thought movement is expected to exist on nothing. There are only ten days left. Therefore let us all do our duty; let us take into consideration how expensive it is for religious people to belong to a church, and say to ourselves, "What they can accomplish we can accomplish, too. Our generosity shall not be less than theirs!"</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0967.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>Let the results of the first Narodni Dan Svobodomyslnych be a living proof of the Bohemian-American Freethinkers' deep devotion to the freedom of thought, to that which was instilled into us by our greatest people, from Vojta Naprstek down to the just recently deceased Vaclav Snajdr!</p>
