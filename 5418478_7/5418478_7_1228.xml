   <p>"Auditing Committee."</p>
   <p>The Board of Trustees consists of representatives of the following societies: Spolek Svateho Frantiska (Society of St. Francis), Spolek Svateho Vita (Society of St. Vitus), Svur Katolickych Lesniku (Order of Catholic Foresters), Spolek Svateho Cyrila A Methodeje (Society of St. Cyril and St. Methodius). These societies are represented by the following officers; Frank <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> Vokoun, president; Joseph Cada, vice-president; Joseph F. Trzil, secretary; Frank Krizek, financial secretary; Joseph <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/> Krodej, treasurer; Karel Cemradek, John Koutnik, and Atej <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, managing committee. The Board of Trustees <pb facs="5418478_7_1230.jpg" n="3"/>was organized May 7, 1903, and was incorporated on January 4, 1912; therefore, as yet it has not been in existence a full four years. During that time it has gained the support if its members, although not in the measure which it deserves. The reason for this is primarily the lack of harmony among the members of Catholic societies; if there were fewer disturbers and underminers, and more hope and confidence in the work begun, it would not be long before a site could be purchased for the erection of a building or society hall, such as in needed for the Czech Catholics in the Merigold [district] community. This would be an honor and proof of the strength of Czech Catholics to all of us. Let us look at other communities! Why cannot the societies in our community have and own their own hall? It will not be long before there will be an urgent need for a larger hall in our community, because it is plain to see that the community is constantly expanding, day by day, so that in a very short time there will be a need for a hall of such proportions as will accommodate the influx of people coming into the community. The delegates, always mindfol of the need for a lodge hall, at their last meeting, decided to elect a promotion committee.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1231.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The duty of this committee will be primarily to formulate a plan by which the Board of Trustees can be strengthened financially and by which it can gain the much-needed confidence of their fellowmen. Other contributions and duties are not, and never shall be, required of the members. All the property the Board of Trustees owns today has been accumulated by proceeds from dances, picnics, and one bazaar. The Board of Trustees, with the and of brothers and friends, will continue to prosper financially and materially from such affairs. It firmly believes that it will not be long before the Catholic brothers of our community will be able to point with pride to their own building as a monument to the Czech Catholics of Merigold.......</p>
