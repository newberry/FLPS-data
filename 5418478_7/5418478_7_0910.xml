<title level="a">THE MEETING OF THE SBOR CESKEHO NARODNIHO HRBITOVA</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>The monthly meeting of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova (Bohemian National Cemetery Association of Chicago) was held last night and was fairly well attended by the delegates of our national organizations. The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Mr. Jan Pecha, at 8 P.M. sharp. The secretary of the Association, Mr. Victor R. Filip, then read the minutes of the previous meeting which, after a lengthy debate and a minor change, were approved. The reading of bills then followed. Mr. Smejkal, a member of the board of directors, announced that $10,000 worth of the City of Chicago bonds and $15,000 worth of the Cook County Forest Preserve bonds were bought. The Jan Zizka Lodge No. 1 of the Taborites announced the appointment of a new delegate, Mr. Jan Vrba. He was accepted. The board of directors reported that the sum of $6,114 was received for flowers in the month of May. During the same period the expenditures for the decoration of graves amounted to $1,713.20. A complaint was made that many of <pb facs="5418478_7_0911.jpg" n="2"/>the delegates and the members of the board of directors did not participate in Monday's (Memorial Day) parade which marched from the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies' Hall. The members of the board of directors excused themselves because they were busy with other matters at that time.</p>
   <p>The board of directors presented a report in reference to the investigation of a holdup which took place at the cemetery some time ago and at which a watchman, employed by the cemetery, was badly injured. The sum of $125 was stolen, but the loss was covered by insurance. In consequence of this holdup a new regulation, regarding the daily depositing of the money received at the cemetery, was put in force.</p>
   <p>A letter in which the Bohemian Old People's Home and Orphanage is asking the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova to buy a piece of its property called the "spice" (point) aroused a lengthy debate which lasted almost one hour. Finally it was decided to invite the members of the board of directors of that organization to hold a joint meeting with the members of the board of directors of the Sbor <pb facs="5418478_7_0912.jpg" n="3"/>Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova. At this meeting the details of the sale are to be discussed and the results reported at the next meeting.....</p>
   <p>Receipts for the month of May totaled $41,275.70; cash from last month amounted to $23,634.15. Total receipts were $64,909.85; disbursements, $37,176.05; cash on hand, $27,733.80.</p>
