<title level="a">MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DELEGATES TO THE BOHEMIAN NATIONAL CEMETERY ASSOCIATION</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A meeting of the board of delegates to the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery Association) took place last night at eight o'clock in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies). There was an unusually large attendance of delegates of our Free Thought organizations who followed the proceedings of the meeting with interest and took an active part in the deliberations. Immediately after the opening of the session by the president, Mr. Jan Pecha, the minutes of the previous meeting were read and accepted. All bills presented for payment were approved. The new delegates, Messrs. Novak, Bernard, <gap unit="words" extent="1" reason="illegible"/>, and Vojicek were introduced and welcomed by the president. Letters of thanks were then read from all those parties who received New Year's presents from the Association....The executive committee presented a report concerning the distribution of pamphlets describing the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov to individuals and organizations located outside of the Chicago area. These pamphlets were mailed to them upon <pb facs="5418478_7_0855.jpg" n="2"/>their own request and give a description of our crematory and cemetery. To insure perpetual care of certain graves, the following sums due to the Association were deposited with us: Mrs. Charles H. Alsip, $200; Mary Feuerback, $100; James F. Pavel, $200; Josef Petrasek, for his own grave and that of his wife, Marie, $400; John Rezek, $150; Josef Kohout, $300; Anton Harazim, $100; Mildred Dvorak, $200; Josefa Ligler, $150; Josef Krizenecky, $250; Anezka Prosek, $100; Josefa Riha, $550; Edward J. Benes, $300; James Liftner, $250. The total amount reaching us in dues paid for the perpetual care of graves was $3,250. For temporary care of certain graves, Bohumil Kroupa paid $150.</p>
   <p>Mr. Smejkal, who is a member of the executive committee, reported that the Association purchased Chicago and Colorado Springs municipal bonds totaling $10,000. The offer to install a clock costing approximately $1,200 in the tower of the Cemetery was discussed at this meeting. This item was debated by Messrs. Zrust, Jelinek, Lang, and others. All agreed that the clock in question is solidly built and really artistic in design. It was then decided that the executive committee should study this matter thoroughly and submit the recommendations at the next <pb facs="5418478_7_0856.jpg" n="3"/>regular meeting. The semiannual report of the Association's office was then read; it will be printed. Delegate Smejkal reported on a survey made of the incomes and expenses of the cemetery for the last ten years. This survey shows that the earnings of the workingmen and officials of the Association for the period mentioned have trebled, but one does not find a similar increase in the income of the cemetery. In a debate which followed, the business routine of the cemetery was discussed by Messrs. Lang Kopecky, Dr. Miller, and Cipra. All of them recognize the hard work the executive committee is doing; its sacrifices are a guarantee of the success of the whole enterprise. The semiannual report was approved. The chairman reminded the delegates that they should make preparations for Decoration Day, which is on May 30.</p>
   <p>Delegate Pine had the floor and voiced his astonishment at the fact that at the time when New Year's gifts were distributed, the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) was overlooked. Chairman Pecha then explained that the Association received no request from the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost and therefore, no steps could be taken. Mr. Pine was certain that <pb facs="5418478_7_0857.jpg" n="4"/>the request was sent, and he made a motion that this session approve a gift of $100 and that that amount be sent to the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost, request or no request. Delegate Jelinek then rose and expressed his amazement at the fact that a gift should be sent to someone who has not asked for it. Let them send their request and describe the charitable work they are doing. Delegate Nosek was of the opinion that the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost favors certain sects, and he said that he would not be surprised if even the Salvation Army put in a request for a gift under the pretense that they are doing charitable work. Delegates Cipra and Lang announced that since no formal request for a gift was made, the approval of it would be unconstitutional, and that the constitution of the Association is quite explicit about such matters. The chairman then called for a vote on a motion made by Delegate Pinc. Since only four delegates voted for the granting of a gift of $100, the motion was not carried and no gift will be made.</p>
   <p>This debate was followed by an election of officers of the Association for the ensuing year. The results of the election were just as had been expected.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0858.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>The vote was unanimous for the election of the following officers: Jan Pecha, chairman; Victor H. Filip, secretary, Josef Jurka, treasurer; Josef A. Smejkal, members of the executive committee for two years. Stanislav Simecek was elected to the office of vice-president by forty votes; Frank Boucek was elected by thirty-two votes to serve as a member of the executive committee for one year. The following delegates were elected to the financial committee: Josef Kriz Jan Klaus, Vaclav Waska. The following men were re-appointed by the chairman to fill their old offices: Messrs. L. Tuma, Otto Scheiner, and E. J. Kozak. </p>
   <p>During the past month, twelve cemetery lots were sold, which brought $2,832.50; ninety-eight persons were buried; three were cremated; $302.34 was added to the reserve fund. The income was $26,764.33, and the expenses were $18,837.84. The cemetery employed fifty persons, whose combined wages amounted to $5,135.46.</p>
