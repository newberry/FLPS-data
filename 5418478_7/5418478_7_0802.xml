   <p>Last Sunday night will remain unforgettable in the minds of the parishioners of Panna Marie Svatohorska V Cicero (Our Lady of Svata Hora in Cicero), for on that night a splendid banquet was arranged for them in Mr. Chlupa's hall at 26th Street and Austin Boulevard. The young people of the parish decorated the hall in good taste, and there was a festive mood among all who attended. The banquet began with an opening speech and a prayer by Reverend M. Krizka. A specially arranged Bohemian menu displayed a number of tastefully prepared and varied Bohemian dishes. It appeared that all who attended were provided with a good appetite. A table of honor was set apart for the several dignitaries of the church, public offices, and commercial houses. [Names of special guests are omitted in translation.] The master of ceremonies was Mr. J. J. Janda. The time between speeches was filled with music furnished by the choral society which sang in the English and Bohemian languages.</p>
   <p>The main speakers of the evening were County Clerk Robert Sweitzer and <pb facs="5418478_7_0803.jpg" n="2"/>Mr. A. V. Tesar. The former spoke in English, and the latter in beautiful and harmonious Bohemian.</p>
   <p>The first speaker mentioned the work accomplished by the Catholics in this country, paying them the respect which was due them because of their labors in social, cultural, and patriotic endeavors. He began by stating that it was a Catholic who had discovered America; he mentioned the Catholic missionaries who, in their desire to serve God, had penetrated a wilderness without fear. He mentioned the fact that although twenty per cent of the people of the United States are Catholics, the Government of the United States ascertained that forty per cent of all the American Catholics served in the United States Army, defending the interests of democracy against its foes; all of which proves that the Catholics are great patriots....</p>
   <p>The second speaker on the program was Mr. A. V. Tesar. He mentioned our Bohemian pioneers who began to build our parishes, and the great hardships these men had to undergo. Among other things he said:</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0804.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Ninety-nine per cent of our people who come to this country had no knowledge of English, had no material means, were not prepared to live in a foreign country, but withal they brought with them an unflinching desire to better their position, and an astonishing perseverance to perform hard work. And lo and behold, today we may see the results of the admirable pioneering effort of our people."</p>
   <p>In his speech he pointed out states which, thanks to the efforts of these pioneers, were changed from a wilderness into fertile lands; he mentioned cities in which many of our people had secured positions of trust and were otherwise successful in industry, commerce, banking, and the professions. Despite their successes, those pioneers have not forgotten to pray; they clamored for Bohemian priests; they desired priests of their own faith and nationality. And the priesthood answered the pressing demands of our pioneers. Today the Bohemian Catholics have about three hundred parishes and two hundred priests. It costs about two million dollars....a year to maintain these parishes and schools. All of that we have done without outside aid.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0805.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>He continued:</p>
   <p>"We Catholics have a clear aim--to protect the nationality, the family, and the individual. We are fully conscious of the fact that we are doing good; such knowledge is a power which cannot be subdued."</p>
   <p>Mr. Tesar then indicated the might of the Narodni Svaz, the importance of the position it occupies among our people who are responsible for its growth. His address was both serious and humorous, and revealed a man possessed of great experience. It should be added that his address left a deep impression....Free entertainment followed Reverend Dedera's announcement that the program was ended.</p>
