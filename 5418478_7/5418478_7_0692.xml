   <p>We appeal to our Bohemian Catholic societies to send in their annual dues as soon as possible so that they may be posted in our books before the end of the year. Many of the societies have failed to do so and we now take the liberty to remind them of the fact. Make an effort to pay your dues for the year 1922 during the course of this year to avoid chance of error, for it frequently happens that when a society is in arrears it does not know, when finally making a payment, whether such payment is for the current or the previous year.</p>
   <p>The secretary of every society receives a copy of our official organ, the Hlidka (Sentinel), and in it he will find acknowledgement of all payments made by societies. A brief mention of the activities of the Narodni <pb facs="5418478_7_0693.jpg" n="2"/>Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics) is made in every issue of the Hlidka, and the secretary of every society should have a copy of it on hand during every meeting of his society, so that the activity of the Svaz may be followed by all members, every one thus being fully informed. He will also learn how the two cents contributed by him for the benefit of our people and our Bohemian-Catholic interests are expended. Every member will surely be willing to pay the twenty-four cents a year dues to the Svaz provided he receives the correct information as to what happens to the funds thus contributed.</p>
   <p>At the third general convention recently held in Chicago, the delegates of our societies made very complimentary remarks about the Svaz, promising that all of the [Bohemian Catholic] societies will eventually join it. They promised to support the organization with all their energies, for its importance is now generally recognized. For any Bohemian Catholic not to belong to our organization is unthinkable today. That organization <pb facs="5418478_7_0694.jpg" n="3"/>is our life, our strength; it is gaining for us a position and a prestige which we deserve. Let all of us, therefore, put our shoulders to the wheel so that the Svaz may be thoroughly built up and thus become an organization of which we are all proud. Let us devise a slogan: Every Bohemian Catholic a member of the Narodni Svaz! And without further ado let us all go to work!</p>
   <p>Antonin V. Tesar,</p>
   <p>Director of the central office. [1440 West 18th Street, Chicago, Illinois.]</p>
