   <p>According to a resolution adopted at the last Chicago convention, the local alliance is the fundamental unit of the Bohemian-American Free Thought organization. These local alliances must prepare themselves immediately to collect the national Freethinkers' Tax about October 28, the second anniversary of Czechoslovak independence. We are just beginning to build a new organization, and therefore it is necessary that a new local alliance be founded by our Free Thought organizations and ardent Freethinkers in every one of our Bohemian colonies in the United States.</p>
   <p>The executive committee of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers), because of insufficient funds, cannot afford to appoint an organizer to travel from colony to colony and help organize these local alliances. This can be done only if the national tax on Freethinkers meets with success. Until that time, all members of the executive committee of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych are zealously working toward this purpose which, in the future, <pb facs="5418478_7_0987.jpg" n="2"/>will be the task of an organizer. In view of that, it is necessary that the executive committee be supported in its effort by adherents of Bohemian-American Free Thought in every one of our Bohemian-American colonies. Therefore, do not wait until you are urged by the executive committee to do so, but begin to work immediately, so that you can joyfully report on new activities of your colony in the Free Thought movement.</p>
   <p>The inception of this movement is graced by such great names as Vojta Naprstek, Karel Jonas, Ladimir Klacel, and other enthusiastic pioneers whose renewed agility will be proof that Bohemian-America is not leaving the standards of "Freedom of Thought and Progress of Humanity."</p>
   <p>Send reports on your renewed activities to the secretary of the executive committee of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych, Mr. V. K. Soukup, 2000 South Ashland Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, or to the editor of the Vek Rozumu (Age of Reason), Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan, 2004 South Albany Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0988.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>For the executive committee of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych:</p>
   <p>Dr. Jaroslav E. S. Vojan,</p>
   <p>J. J. Jelinek,</p>
   <p>Dr. Karel Neumann.</p>
   <p>All Bohemian-American newspapers are requested to publish this proclamation.</p>
