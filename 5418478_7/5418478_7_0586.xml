  <body>
   <p>The great yearly convention of the United Societies of Chicago was held yesterday in the hall of Sokol Chicago. It was presided over by President George Landau and attracted an unusually large crowd of members and delegates.</p>
   <p>After the reading of the minutes of the last convention and a presentation of the annual report by Secretary Anton J. Cermak, the chairman of the assessment committee, Cyrill Jandus, addressed the meeting and remarked that the present State's attorney, Maclay Hoyne, is the first State's attorney to pay attention to this problem of assessments.....</p>
   <p>The United Societies have been working since their inception to achieve equitable assessment of rich and poor, of large corporations and small businessmen alike. But, all their efforts had been in vain, for other State's attorneys just laughed at the organization's officers who lodged complaints in this respect.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0587.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Cermak delivered an excellent speech in which he stressed the beneficial results of the organization's work.....Also, the speech of Attorney Clarence Darrow was a remarkable one.....</p>
   <p>After Mr. Darrow's address, the convention adopted a resolution against the Hobson bill that is now pending before Congress, according to which the Constitution of the United States would be amended by an article providing for national prohibition.....</p>
   <p>There were 829 delegates present at the convention, representing 962 societies with 205,000 members. A new executive committee was elected, consisting of 105 men and 28 women. This committee will elect the Societies' officers at the next meeting, which will be held at the Bismarck Hotel next Thursday.....</p>
   <p>The following of our countrymen were elected members of the executive committee: John A. Cervenka, Anton J. Cermak, Jos. Z. Uhlir, Josef A. Smejkal, Jos. Ring, <pb facs="5418478_7_0588.jpg" n="3"/>Jos. Stastny, Ferd. Svoboda, Jos. Policek, Vaclav Sedlak, Jacob Fink, L. Pino, Jos. Houska, John Smolku, C. D. Jandus, Jos. Bolek, Jos. F. Janda, Jos. F. Bambas, William Krouzilka, Anna Zenisek, Anna Velik, Mrs. Sistka, Marie Petrik, and Antonie Hoffreiter.</p>
