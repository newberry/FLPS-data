   <p>Representatives of half a million Bohemian-Americans, to whom was entrusted the difficult but meritorious task of gaining honor for the name of Bohemians among other nationalities settled in this part of world, opened their Second Annual Convention yesterday afternoon at three o'clock, in the hall of C. A. Svob. Skola, (Bohemian American Liberal School) on 18th Street for the purpose of rendering an accounting of what has been done during the last year in the interest of Bohemian-Americans. That the committee would not please all members could have been fore-told from the very beginning. Some people appeared, who thought that the committee accomplished very little and charged its members with unconcern, unfitness, and other bad habits. But these people accuse and judge everything done by others; in the meantime they themselves are lacking in activity.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0675.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These unrecognized prophets would rather see every advantage gained by the people fall apart in ruin, rather than recognize the efforts of others. Truly, it would be nice if our committee was entirely composed of "Jonas's and Capeks" the chronicle of the committee's accomplishments would then appear differently, but we must remember that we are in America and not in Bohemia.</p>
   <p>Our Intelligentsia is yet small, and we must be content temporarily with those who willingly bind themselves to the difficult task, and from that viewpoint they are deserving of the thanks and gratitude of the rest of our people.</p>
