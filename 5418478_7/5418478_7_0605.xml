   <p>The entertainment sponsored by the Fuegner-Tyrs Sokol group in honor of the competitors and guests was remarkably successful. The singing of Mr. Ferd. Novak, baritone, was especially well liked by the listeners.</p>
   <p>The entertainment was started by Sokol A. Dolezal, president of the group, who, briefly, but with significant words, welcomed the guests. The speaker of the evening was Sokol Jar. Kosar. He laid stress chiefly upon the need of American Sokols for national development as well as physical and spiritual development.</p>
   <p>A festive parade was held by the sokols yesterday. They paraded through the Bohemian neighborhood to Pilsen Park, arriving there shortly before noon. A public exhibition drill was performed there. Taking part in the <pb facs="5418478_7_0606.jpg" n="2"/>exercises were more than two hundred pupils, one hundred male and forty-eight female sokols. Altogether, it can be said that the moral success was remarkable.</p>
   <p>While the sokols in the park were working hard, the convention proceeded with its business. In the absence of the president, the convention was brought to order by the vice-president, Sokol Mejda. The Committee on By-laws reported that the by-laws recommended for the Fuegner-Tyrs Group by the Cleveland Sokols are not suitable for local conditions.</p>
   <p>It was resolved that the present Committee on By-laws be continued, and that the committee continue to work on the setting up of suitable by-laws.</p>
   <p>It was further resolved on a motion of the Committee on By-laws that for out-of-town societies a representative be appointed from among local delegates, and that local delegates be allowed to represent not more than one out-of-town society. It was also decided that one delegate should be <pb facs="5418478_7_0607.jpg" n="3"/>elected for each fifty members, and the smallest number of members to be allowed a delegate should be twenty-five. Therefore, a society having one hundred twenty-five members is entitled to have three delegates.</p>
   <p>It was further resolved that each society should see to it that the mother tongue be used in all exercises, and any violation in that direction be punishable by expulsion.</p>
   <p>The use of the words "Society" and "Association" is to be discontinued hereafter, and the name "Sokol" used instead.</p>
   <p>The following resolution introduced by a committee accredited for that purpose was accepted: "We, the delegates gathered in this convention of the Fuegner-Tyrs Group, take note of the undertaking of the building of the Hus House with pleasure, and recommend the general support of this undertaking, which is so important not only to the Group, but to all fraternal societies." The resolution was introduced as a result of a <pb facs="5418478_7_0608.jpg" n="4"/>proposal by Doctor Iska.</p>
   <p>It was further decided that the Czech Sokol Community should be allowed to continue in existence with the exception that the Group will publish its own journal, and that assessments will be paid to the Czech Sokol Community on a per capita basis by both Groups.</p>
   <p>The Grievance Committee also pointed out that all arguments in the journal should be avoided.</p>
   <p>It was further resolved that either the president or commander of the Group is to attend the drills of the various societies.</p>
   <p>The request that the women's departments of the various societies be given autonomy was vigorously rejected.</p>
   <p>A committee of three was elected which is to take the necessary steps <pb facs="5418478_7_0609.jpg" n="5"/>for the publication of the Group's own journal.</p>
   <p>The election of officers for the coming year will be held at a meeting of the Group during the month of November.</p>
   <p>It was also resolved that a traveling expense fund be created, and is to be taken from purely voluntary contributions.</p>
   <p>The next convention, according to a resolution, will be held in Racine, Wisconsin, three years from this date .....</p>
