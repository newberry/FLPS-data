<title level="a">THE BOHEMIAN NATIONAL CEMETERY ASSOCIATION HAS DECIDED TO SUPPLY THE BALANCE NEEDED FOR THE KAREL HAVLICEK MONUMENT</title></bibl>

   <p>P.1--A special meeting was held in the Bohemian American Liberal School by the representatives of the Bohemian National Cemetery Association last night. The main topic of discussion was the question of providing money, to the amount of $1,500, for the erection of the Karel Havlicek monument, and whether the money should be taken from the Cemetery's treasury or not. As is known through many letters of protest, the Association is threatened by court action from diverse lodges and individuals, in case it should grant the amount required. The Association thus finds itself between two fires, for it can not comply with the wishes of one side, without making an enemy of the other side. Sound reasoning is required to avoid making enemies, therefore, the special meeting was called for in time, to give ample opportunity to everyone to gain information on the attitude of the parties concerned.</p>
   <p>The meeting was called to order by chairman J. Pech, who announced at the outset, that the discussion would be restricted to the problem of furnishing <pb facs="5418478_7_1247.jpg" n="2"/>the money. The majority of the members took part in the ensuing debate. For lack of space, we give only a brief summary of the speeches.</p>
   <p>The first to take the floor was delegate Mr. Kara, who suggested it would be best, if the committee of the Association for the building of the monument, would give a full explanation, which would serve as a guide for the action of the delegates, and then, to decide the question whether or not the committee has the right to dispose of the money. He stated, that the Association decidedly has the authority, because the owners of the lots have the right to the lots only, and not to the funds of the cemetery, jurisdiction over which is reserved solely to the lodges represented in the Association. The money accumulated in the fund comes not only from the sale of the lots, but also from contributions collected from Bohemians at various entertainments and festivities and from that, some amount can be refunded to the people. Delegate Frydl said, that although he is against wasting money, he still maintains, in a matter wherein the honor of our people is at stake, it is imperative to help. Those who are loudest in their clamor know the least of the beginnings of the National Cemetery.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1248.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Forest Home Cemetery was given by delegate Rotbauer as an example, of common ownership by everyone who buys a lot there, and of the right of these owners to elect the management. So it should be and will be with all the cemeteries, Rotbauer continued, referring similarly to the Bohemian National Cemetery and he does not believe, that the money yielded by Bohemian National Cemetery should serve to decorate parks for the living.</p>
   <p>Various other speakers took part in the debate, which was followed by a vote on the entire matter, resulting in twenty-five affirmative and twelve negative votes. In accordance with this result, a motion will be made at the next regular meeting to appropriate $1,500 of the Cemetery's funds for the completion of the Havlicek monument.</p>
   <p>Then the meeting adjourned.</p>
