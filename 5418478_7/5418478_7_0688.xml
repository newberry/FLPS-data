   <p>At the meetings of the local branch of the Svaz Svobodomyslnych (Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers) the following resolution was adopted and was also adopted in the protest meeting held by the Mistni Odbor (local branch) of the Federation in the Town of Lake, October 15, 1922.</p>
   <p>"Be it resolved that the revision of the state constitution, of the State of Illinois, has, by the great number of new provisions in it, shown itself to be inimical both to the best interests of the citizens of the City of Chicago and the County of Cook and the life requirements of the residents of these places.</p>
   <p>"Be it further resolved that the entire revision of the said constitution has, by its spirit of conservatism and its reactionary philosophy, totally disregarded the principles of self-government of the people and for the people, <pb facs="5418478_7_0689.jpg" n="2"/>overlooking the questions of initiative and of referendum.</p>
   <p>"Be it further and finally resolved that the introduction of the Bible into the schools, which the new constitution makes possible by permitting its introduction into all public and non-denominational schools, is in direct contravention to the provisions made in the Constitution of the United States." The above resolution was passed in a meeting held by the Mistni Sdruzeni of the Federation in the Town of Lake. It was likewise passed in a meeting held by the Mistni Sdruzeni of the Federation in Chicago on the same day (Sunday) in the Vojta Naprstek Bohemian Free Thought school. The assembled citizens of both sexes and the voters of the State of Illinois pledged their wholehearted opposition to the proposed new revision of the state constitution on December 12, 1922; considering it reactionary and opposed to the progress, development, and freedom of the people.</p>
   <p>For the two above-named local branches of the Federation of Bohemian Freethinkers.</p>
   <p>The Propaganda Committee.</p>
