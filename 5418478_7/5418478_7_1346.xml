  <body>
   <p>In various departments of the United States Civil Service many of our countrymen are employed and, although some of them are holding responsible positions, very little is known about them among our Bohemian people. Very few of us know that even in the United States Department of Forestry our countrymen are to be found, and that a Bohemian expert occupies a high and important position. This Bohemian expert is Mr. E. J. Hanzlik, who at present is the Chief Forester and is an expert in the Far West, with offices at Seattle, Washington. Seattle newspapers and those of other cities quite often publish reports of his activity, and his special treatises are filed with the official reports of the United States Department of Forestry.</p>
   <p>Just recently, Mr. Hanzlik returned from his two-month inspection trip, during which he inspected national forests in the western parts of Oregon and Washington. He presented to the Department his official report on the felling of trees in national forests of the Santiam and Snoqualmie Counties in these <pb facs="5418478_7_1347.jpg" n="2"/>two states. In his report he points out the manner in which the trees can be cut down and new ones planted so that the lumber industry of the Great Northwest will not be ruined.....</p>
   <p>The forestry expert of the government is a late Chicagoan whose mother, Mrs. Anna Hanzlik, lives at 2857 South Springfield Avenue. He was born in Chicago just thirty-seven years ago; he attended local public schools, and then for two years he studied forest culture at the Illinois State University and for three years at Michigan State University. Nine years ago he entered the forestry service of the United States and, being capable, he attained a position which, perhaps, none of our countrymen thus far have filled.</p>
