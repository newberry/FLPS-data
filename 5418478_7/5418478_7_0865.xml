  <body>
   <p>The annual meeting of the Chicago district of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku (National Alliance of Bohemian Catholics) took place last Sunday in the parish house of the Panna Marie Dobre Rady (Our Lady of the Good Counsel). The parish is located on the North Side. All of the two hundred delegates of both sexes joined in a communion, after which a tasty breakfast awaited them. The breakfast was prepared by the ladies of the parish. After breakfast, the delegates repaired to the parish house to deliberate on preliminary matters concerning the afternoon session. Several committees, such as the nominationg, resolutions, finance, accrediting, etc., were appointed. After these preliminary preparations, which consumed the entire forenoon, and excellent dinner was served to the delegates. The expenses connected with the dinner were borne by the members of the Ustredni Jednota Zen (Central Union of Bohemian Catholic Women) of America.</p>
   <p>The afternoon session opened with a welcoming speech by Mr. Frantisek Kovarik, <pb facs="5418478_7_0866.jpg" n="2"/>who is the president of the Chicago district of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku.....The second speaker was the local parish priest, the Very Reverend Frantisek Jedlicka, who extended a personal and official welcome to the delegates.</p>
   <p>The secretary of the Chicago district then read the minutes of the last meeting....and reports were submitted by the secretary, the financial secretary, the treasurer, and the secretary of the executive committee. According to their reports, the Chicago district of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku has 7,296 members, but 22 societies have not yet reported their membership, so that there must be some 8,000 or more members belonging to the Chicago district. There were about 206 delegates present. The executive committee consisted of fifty-seven members. All the reports were accepted. The report of the chairman of the executive committee contained many items of interest, and was avidly listened to. The nominating committee submitted the names of candidates for district offices for 1922, and those elected were: [Names of officers and members of the executive committee omitted in translation.]</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0867.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The executive committee will meet as soon as possible to begin its work with great enthusiasm, for there are many problems confronting it which demand action. After the election, there was a speech by Mr. Antonin V. Tesar, who is the organization's director of the central office. Mr. Tesar gave a comprehensive and enlightening speech in which he mentioned Henrik Sienkiewicz's great story, "Pan Volodyjovsky," comparing its content with the living conditions of Catholic Czechoslovaks in America. Mr. Tesar gave reasons for the organizational work of every society and every individual member, and the long ovation he received rewarded him for that effort. Afterwards Mr. Tesar gave a review of the activities of the entire organization during 1921, and expressed a wish that the work already performed will become a stimulus for more work in all national, religious, and cultural activities.</p>
   <p>This was followed by debates concerning the interests of the organization, one of which touched upon the projected expedition of the Narodni Svaz Ceskych Katoliku and the Katolicky Sokol to the old country. The expedition has met with the approval of our people, having been proposed by our countrymen in the <pb facs="5418478_7_0868.jpg" n="4"/>old homeland. Many applications are reaching our office, and it is necessary that every one who intends to join the expedition send in his application in time.</p>
   <p>There were many resolutions passed, and then this significant and enthusiastic meeting came to an end. The newly elected officers were then inducted into office. </p>
