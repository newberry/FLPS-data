   <p>[Translator's note: An appeal by Surgeon General Gorgas, U. S. Army, urging women to join the Women's National Defense Council and to engage in Red Cross activities, is printed in full. This is omitted in translation.]</p>
   <p>In enlarging upon General Gorgas' appeal, we inform our readers that every woman between 19 and 35 years of age is going to receive a call this week to enlist in the service of our glorious army, which must become the best of all. They will form part of a corps of trained nurses. There is a demand for 25,000 women to become nurses.</p>
   <p>"The pick of the country" is what Uncle Sam wants among women, just as he demands it of his warriors. He wants healthy, intelligent, and responsible women. Those with a college education or who have had previous training and experience will have an advantage. Three choices are open to ladies to permit them to <pb facs="5418478_7_1381.jpg" n="2"/>become members of Uncle Sam's nurses' corps.....</p>
   <p>The training will require two to three years, depending on the school.....Czech women interested should apply to Mrs. Paulina Princ, 3124 West 22nd Street, or at the Czech Bureau, 3342 West 26th Street.</p>
