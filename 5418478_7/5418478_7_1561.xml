   <p>The Census Bureau in Washington has just issued a report showing the number of immigrants in Illinois and in Chicago. The report is based on the 1910 census, and shows not only the number of immigrants, but also the number of American born citizens of foreign parentage.</p>
   <p>According to these figures there now reside in Illinois 2,926,407 immigrants who make up fifty-three per cent of the total of 5,526,962 white residents.....</p>
   <p>The report is, of course, very interesting, especially that part which refers to Chicago. It shows that the Bohemians are the sixth from the top in the number of whites in this city, and also the sixth among groups registering other than the American language as their mother tongue.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1562.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Germans hold the first place in Chicago as far as numbers are concerned: 461,981, or twenty-two per cent of the total of 2,139,057 white residents.</p>
   <p>The second place goes to the English, Irish, and Scotch, with the total of 368,651.</p>
   <p>The Poles rank third with 230,132, and form eleven per cent of Chicago's white inhabitants.</p>
   <p>The Swedes number 120,615, and the Jews 111,098.</p>
   <p>The Bohemians and Moravians together total 110,736, which amounts to five per cent of the city's white population.</p>
   <p>The Italians follow the Bohemians with the count of 75,929.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1563.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Norwegians are next in line with 49,414.</p>
   <p>The Lithuanians follow with a total of 26,355.</p>
   <p>The French number 24,718, the Danes 23,893. Holland is represented by 21,208. Hungarians number 13,253, Slovaks 13,093, Serbo-Croatians 10,085, Greeks 7,785, Slovenes 6,336, and Russians 2,906.</p>
   <p>The number of immigrants resident in Chicago is 1,693,918, which is the best proof of the strength in our city. They constitute seventy-nine per cent of all of our white residents, and the so-called American element, which does not mix with the immigrants, makes up only twenty-one per cent of the people of Chicago.</p>
