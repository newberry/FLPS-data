   <p>Last night our fellow countryman, Mr. Vitus Bzoch, from the neighborhood of 18th and Fisk Streets, Chicago, received a telegram from the United States War Department in which he is informed that his son, Private Edward Bzoch was decorated for bravery in action near Fossoy. He had twice penetrated the German firing line, and had succeeded in delivering important dispatches, though he was wounded twice during his second attempt. It is not known whether his wounds are serious.</p>
   <p>We need not mention that the tidings were received with the utmost pride by his family and his friends, and also with sincere wishes for his recovery. Before he enlisted young Bzoch was a partner in the real-estate firm of Klaus, Rozhon, and Bzoch located on 18th Street, and which enjoyed an excellent reputation.</p>
