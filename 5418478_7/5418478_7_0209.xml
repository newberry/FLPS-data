   <p>In order to avoid painful repetition, we shall not elaborate again on the flightiness of our public's national enthusiasm. It is here today, gone tomorrow.....</p>
   <p>Yesterday's commemoration of Karel Havlicek [an early national worker] was not attended as it could and should have been, and it was not like the celebration last year.....Suffice it to say that it was Sokol--sponsored, announced by the Sokolska Zupa Havlicek-Tyrs (Sokol district Havlicek-Tyrs)-- which alone has several hundred members in Chicago--and that there were twenty uniformed Sokols in the parade.....Therefore, is it necessary to speculate on what kind of an impression the celebration made on the principal speaker and our national guest, Mr. Vaclav J. Klofac?....</p>
   <p>If it had not been for the Slavonic national feelings of Park Sergeant Pianowski, the celebration could not even have taken place, because the Park Commission had not been notified. But Sergeant Pianowski, a Pole, knowing <pb facs="5418478_7_0210.jpg" n="2"/>how he himself would feel if something similar had happened to his co-patriots, took the responsibility upon himself and permitted the celebration.</p>
   <p>[Translator's note: The rest of the article is a condensed report on the patriotic speeches presented by Mr. Klofac and two Sokol leaders.]</p>
