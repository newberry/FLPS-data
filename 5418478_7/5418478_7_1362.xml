   <p>The United States Department of Commerce has taken a step which will be cordially welcomed by all who are interested in the development of close commercial relations between this country and the new Czechoslovak Republic. The announcement was made at the end of March that Vladamir A. Geringer had been appointed Trade Commissioner to Czechoslovakia with headquarters in Prague.</p>
   <p>Mr. Geringer is a native born American citizen, but his parents came from Bohemia. He is well known to Czechoslovaks in America as Manager of the great Bohemian daily, The Svornost. An attorney by training and a business man of many years experience, he is fitted for the important position to which he has been appointed. His first duty will be to reestablish old business connections between American firms and Bohemian importers and exporters. He requests all commercial houses which traded with territory now included in the Czechoslovak Republic to get in touch with him at his office, Room 504, Federal Building, Chicago. Mr. Geringer plans to sail for his post about April 20th.</p>
