   <p>A regular meeting of the Board of Representatives of the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov (Bohemian National Cemetery) was held under the chairmanship of Mr. Hladovec in the hall of the Cesko-Slovanske Podporujici Spolky (Bohemian-Slavonic Benevolent Associations) last night.....</p>
   <p>The financial secretary, Mr. Husak, reported a pay roll of $3,802.61 for seventy three employees; it was approved for payment.</p>
   <p>The Patronat (Board of Directors) of the Ceska Svobodomyslna Skola Ladimir Kacel (Bohemian Free Thought School Ladimir Kacel) requested, by letter, a loan of $1,100, and its representative, Mr. Brazda, explained that, while the school building carries a mortgage of $16,000, it has been valued at $22,000. Therefore, the loan would be amply covered in case of nonpayment. The executive committee, upon request, expressed an opinion advising against the granting of such loans, and therefore the matter was submitted to the whole Board for decision. The Board voted by <pb facs="5418478_7_1097.jpg" n="2"/>a majority of twenty to one, against taking up the matter at once. Since, however, some of the members were of the opinion that the charter, the constitution, and the bylaws of the organization do not permit such loans, the subject is to be brought up for discussion at the next meeting.....</p>
   <p>Secretary Masek read the financial report for the first six months of 1915, which showed an income of $77,028.75 and expenses of $49,136.82, leaving a balance in the treasury of $27,891.93.</p>
   <p>Total assets of the Hrbitov at the end of this semester were $673,635.88, as against $637,006.83 six months ago; that is an increase of $36,629.05. The report shows that there were 771 burials and 42 cremations. Since the foundation of the Cemetery there have been 33,273 bodies interred, of which 767 burials and 51 cremations were free of charge. Of the 5,716 lots, 5,311 have been sold, and 405 are now available for sale.....</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1098.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The members of the executive committee explained that the constitution of the Hrbitov does not permit the granting of such loans as have been applied for during recent months. Furthermore, the liquid assets of the Hrbitov are not such as to permit the granting of substantial loans. The amount of $200,000 is under court jurisdiction as guarantee for funds; there is comparatively little cash left, and that is invested in bonds whose liquidation would cause losses. Mr. Psenicka pointed out the difference between making grants and granting loans, and as an example of the danger of loaning money to individual borrowers he mentioned the Rosehill Cemetery, which is now in the hands of receivers because it has been making large loans to individuals. The report of the executive committee was adopted by a vote of twenty-eight to one, and consequently all requests for loans were rejected.</p>
   <p>Referring to the "Eastland" catastrophe, Mr. Smejkal reported that 165 of its victims were buried in the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov, as a result of which almost the whole section called "Setnactka" (Sixteener) was sold out. During the <pb facs="5418478_7_1099.jpg" n="4"/>recent exciting days there were in the Hrbitov from ten to fifteen thousand people every day, but in spite of this there was perfect order throughout, the credit for which goes to the Chief Bailiff of the City of Chicago, Mr. Anton J. Cermak, who made his personnel available to the Hrbitov for the purpose of maintaining order....</p>
   <p>Mr. Jurka remembered that on August 1 it would be thirty-eight years since the Cesky Narodni Hrbitov was founded, and suggested that this anniversary be commemorated appropriately. He proposed the erection of some kind of monument or memorial to the victims of the "Eastland" catastrophe. The officers and the members of the executive committee will give this matter consideration, and will present the respective proposals at the next meeting.....</p>
