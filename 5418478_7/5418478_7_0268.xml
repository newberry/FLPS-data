<title level="a">MEETING OF THE COMMITTEES FOR A QUIET CELEBRATION OF THE FOURTH OF JULY</title></bibl>

  </front>
  <body>
   <p>A meeting of the committees for Bohemian participation in the international celebration of the Fourth of July was held in one of the bowers of the Pilsen Brewery Park, Tuesday evening. The meeting was quite largely attended, especially by members of the active committees. Mr. John Cervenka presided. Messrs. Hajicek and Lonek gave a report on the meeting held Saturday of the societies for a safe and sane celebration of the national holiday, at which Bohemians were accorded public recognition for their active participation in this significant movement. It was agreed at that meeting that each nationality would work out its program independently, but would make reports of its activity to the central committee. Participation in the morning parade will be limited. Only allegorical floats, marchers in historical or national costumes, and societies in uniform, will be permitted. From all indications, Czechs will be at the head of the parade, and here will be an opportunity for our national guard, the Sokols, to show how progressive the Bohemians are in <pb facs="5418478_7_0269.jpg" n="2"/>purposeful organizations and physical training.</p>
   <p>It is desirable that the afternoon celebration in the Parks be participated in by our Sokols, and singers, and that trained children take part in dances, songs, and special plays.</p>
   <p>To secure this participation will be the task of a special entertainment committee, which was appointed at the last meeting.</p>
   <p>After hearing this report, the discussion turned to whether or not Bohemians should provide some kind of allegorical float. Something is sought which would at once gain the attention of all spectators, entertain them, and make a favorable impression upon them. Several suggestions were made, but no definite action was taken. It was finally left up to a committee to prepare two or three ideas which could be decided upon at the next meeting.</p>
   <p>A report which was not so pleasing was brought by Sokol Dolezal. He informed <pb facs="5418478_7_0270.jpg" n="3"/>the meeting that the National Sokol Unity was holding an excursion to Cedar Rapids on July 4, and that many active Sokols were participating. In the discussion of this situation, it was found that the excursion will be participated in by about one hundred Sokols, but that several hundred more will remain here in addition to the entire Fuegner-Tyrs group, so that, with good will, the participation of the remaining Sokols can be impressive.</p>
   <p>In regards to participation in the afternoon ceremonies in parks and woods, it was decided that the Bohemians should provide for the arrangement of elaborate programs in Douglas Park and Svatopluk Cech Park, but in addition to that, during the course of the afternoon, the best numbers on the program to be brought to other parks, such as Garfield, Lincoln, Washington, and etc., and there be re-enacted before the spectators of other nationalities.</p>
   <p>Further, the publicity committee was ordered to publish a proclamation in the Sunday newspapers, asking for the support of individuals and societies.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_0271.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The financial committee was instructed to begin activity to secure the necessary funds.</p>
   <p>The next meeting of the entire committee will take place Wednesday, May 24, at 8 P.M. in the Pilsen Brewery Park.</p>
