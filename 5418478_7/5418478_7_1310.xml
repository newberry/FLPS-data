   <p>The meeting was called to order by Mr. Jan. A. Mraz, the president of the Bohemian-American Society for the Cremation of the Dead, in the presence of the officers of that society, who are authorized to perform any committee work which may come up between meetings. The president requested the secretary, to read the communication which was sent to the representative of the Bohemian-National Cemetery, on the 6th of August of this year, in which the question of what could be done toward the building of a Bohemian crematorium on the grounds of the Bohemian National Cemetery was broached.</p>
   <p>Then there was introduced and read a letter from the representatives of the Bohemian National Cemetery in answer to the above which read as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1311.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>"Bohemian National Cemetery Association" Chicago, Aug.9, 1902-- to the honored "Bohemian-American Society for the Cremation of the Dead." In reference to the letter of August 6th from your Society, I am informing you that the Bohemian National Cemetery Association has given your communication consideration and has decided to elect a committee of three which is authorized to represent the Bohemian-National Cemetery Association in the matter of arranging for a Bohemian crematorium.</p>
   <p>When it was found after due consideration that the purposes of both committees were identical, Mr. Egermayer, moved that they be united in one body, and in order to promote more rapid progress it was recognized as beneficial to elect a chairman and secretary from their midst. This viewpoint prevailed and Mr. Fr. J. Pechota was elected chairman.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1312.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>A motion was made that the Bohemian National Cemetery Association be furnished with an estimate as to the outlay required to build a crematorium. After a somewhat lengthy debate it was decided to wait and see what decision is made in the matter by the above mentioned association. Following this Mr. Max Kirchman proposed the following resolution, which was adopted and confirmed by the signatures of the committee.</p>
   <p>"Whereas, the modern era has discovered a more suitable method of interring the dead, namely, the burning of the remains in a suitable crematorium, which is not as injurious to the health of the living as the prevailing method of burying in the ground, where the human body is exposed to the tender mercies of insects and many years of decay and from which results the fouling of air and water, thereby threatening the health of the people to a considerable degree.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1313.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"Whereas, this modern method of interment (cremation) is highly recommended by famous doctors and scholars of the whole civilized world, as proven in our own mother-country by the Society for the Cremation of the Dead, which is composed of representatives of all enlightened classes,</p>
   <p>"Whereas, in our own Bohemian-American communities there has been advanced the thought that we ought to build a Bohemian-American Crematorium, for many a deceased countryman would have given preference to it rather than to the ordinary burial, but the opportunity was lacking therefore Be it resolved: that the representatives of the Bohemian-National Cemetery Association, which is certainly made up of enlightened men, whose minds are not filled with fear, by death, satisfy the general demand and already necessary need, and build a crematorium on the grounds of the Bohemian-National Cemetery.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1314.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>"Resolved, that the crematorium he built along side of the mausoleum, and advantage be taken of the chapel now standing for the most necessary funeral rites, and in conclusion,</p>
   <p>"Resolved, that in the building choice should be made not of the most luxurious, but of the most modern method of building a crematorium, so that the Bohemian-American Crematorium to a certain extent will excell the old methods, which can easily be accomplished since the existing and previously mentioned chapel will reduce the required outlay by half."</p>
   <p>Also discussed was the objection that because of the cremation, the Bohemian-National Cemetery would suffer on the sale of lots. All those present were convinced that this is a clear mistake, for thus far, of the small number of countrymen cremated after death, nearly all were buried in the Bohemian-National Cemetery and this example will be followed in the future, for how satisfying must be the consolation, that it is possible for us to bury the deceased, rapidly changed to ashes, on a cemetery lot where nothing can disturb them in their ever-lasting peace."</p>
