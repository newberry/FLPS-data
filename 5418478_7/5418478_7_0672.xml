   <p>The third annual session of the Bohemian-American National Committee opened yesterday morning at 10 o'clock in the Bohemian-American Hall, 400 West Eighteenth Street. President L. J. Palda of this city presided. The day was taken up with the reading of the minutes of the last session and the presentation of reports of the Correspondence Bureau and Emigration and Statistics Committee and closed with a discussion on the continuance of the organ, Bohemian Voice, published in Omaha. It was finally decided to continue the publication.</p>
   <p>The Bohemian National Committee represents, through its various societies in America, 3,000,000 Bohemians. The principal object of the Committee is to represent the Bohemians before the Americans as they are, and further to collect statistics of Bohemian immigration and present the situation to the people in Bohemia who are struggling for home rule. To-day will be taken up with the reading of committee reports.</p>

   <p>The Closing Session</p>
   <p>The closing session of the Bohemian-American National Committee was held yesterday. Peter V. Rovmianek of Pittsburg opened the morning session with an address on the "Progress of the Bohemian Nation." Paul Albiera, a playwrite and author of Prague, Bohemia, in a short speech declared his intention on his return home of writing a history of America in the Bohemian language, that his countrymen might know more of the land to which so many of his people have immigrated. Mrs. R. L. Pitte of Chicago, President of the Bohemian Women's Benevolent Association, which has a membership of 4,000, delivered a short address, in which she assured the National Committee that the Association which she represented was ready to lend moral and financial support to any object which would tend to elevate the Bohemian nation.</p>
   <p>Upon a motion of Peter V. Bovmianek, it was unanimously decided to hold a Slavonic Congress in the future, in which will participate Bohemians, Poles, South Slavonians, and Russians. The congress will take place in Chicago on some day memorial to the history of the Slavonic race. The afternoon was taken up with the biennial election of officers.</p>
