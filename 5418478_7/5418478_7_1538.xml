   <p>When the vigorous protest of Congressman Adolph J. Sabath against the adoption of the law against immigrants was voted down, the House of Representatives proceeded to debate Representative Johnson's proposal according to which immigration to the United States shall be suspended for a period of two years. The proposal is supported by a great majority of congressmen of both parties and will evidently be adopted tomorrow. Its fate in the Senate is still uncertain.</p>
   <p>Congressman Sabath in his speech said: "The immigrants helped to make this country the richest and the most powerful country on earth. In all the wars this country experienced the immigrants were the most loyal soldiers. For years now we have heard the cry that we must stop immigration, but such a law was never adopted inasmuch as it was not necessary. It is not <pb facs="5418478_7_1539.jpg" n="2"/>necessary even today."</p>
   <p>On the other hand Congressman Fess of Ohio proclaimed: "If we do not pass this law, then our country will soon be full of foreign cripples and undesirable people. Europe is full of disturbance and her inhabitants are striving to enter the United States in order to avoid the terrible postwar conditions. We do not care for such inhabitants. We do not need them and we have no room for them."	</p>
