   <p>A bustling crowd was briskly assembling at the crossing of Central Park Avenue and 27th Street in front of the St. Agnes Church yesterday at 1 P. M. Pupils enrolled in the classes of Sokol societies were present in large numbers. The parade to the Pilsen Brewery Park to inaugurate a patriotic festival of Chicago Catholics was to begin at that hour. Many curious by-standers filled the streets before the procession started.</p>
   <p>The parade went along 27th Street west to Lawndale Avenue, then east along 26th Street to the Pilsen Brewery Park. Messrs. Anton Linhart and J. L. Martinek were the marshals. They were followed by the executive committee of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics and the band. Banners and flags of the <pb facs="5418478_7_1037.jpg" n="2"/>various associations lent gay color to the scene. The most impressive in number and dress were the Catholic Sokol societies, among whom there were many delegates and guests from the Sokol organizations in Milwaukee, Cudahy, and Racine, Wisconsin. To the many organizations represented either by delegates or en masse, the Club Rieger furnished a stately contingent.</p>
   <p>The procession arrived at the Pilsen Brewery Park pavilion at 2 P. M., filling the place to capacity.</p>
   <p>In a short but heartfelt address Mr. J. L. Martinek welcomed the assembly in the name of the Straz Sokola (Sokol Guard), and then immediately introduced the Very Reverend Frantisek Jedlicka, vice-president of the National Alliance of Czech Catholics.</p>
   <p>The speaker pointed with enthusiastic pride to the Czech and Slovak Catholics <pb facs="5418478_7_1038.jpg" n="3"/>who are united at the moment when the future of the old homeland is at stake. Their sincerest wishes, he stated, aim toward the independence of the homeland, and he proclaimed that the work toward that goal is a sacred duty. "How low, how wretched, would a Czech or Slovak be if he did not wish for the independence of the old country! It is true," the Very Reverend Jedlicka continued, "that demands are made upon the pockets of all those present in these meetings; yet you have to consider that the future liberty of our nation is at stake. If we were oppressed here in our new homeland, we would sacrifice not only our money but also our lives. And this is why we should fulfill our national duty to the utmost or our ability."</p>
   <p>The address, which was frequently interrupted by gales of applause, closed with the demand that from this day on, Czechs should help the fight for the independence of the old country in all possible ways.</p>
   <pb facs="5418478_7_1039.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>The next speaker, Reverend Gregor Vaniscak, O. S. B., pictured the suffering of the Slovaks under the yoke of the Magyar government. He told how their mother tongue was taken from them by the closing of their schools. He earnestly entreated the Slovaks to join hands with the Czechs for persistent co-operation which will bear fruit in the form of liberty for the two nations and independence in one large Czechoslovak state.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jan Straka then announced that several other speakers would address the meeting, among them being Dr. Milan Rastislav Stefanik; editor Hynek Dostal of St. Louis, Missouri; the French military attache from Washington, D. C., Colonel Demotal; and the head of the Catholic Sokol societies.</p>
   <p>Dr. Stefanik and the French military attache appeared at a late hour, because they came from the mass meeting held simultaneously in the auditorium of Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs. The purpose of this meeting was to organize a Czechoslovak <pb facs="5418478_7_1040.jpg" n="5"/>army in France. The address delivered by Dr. Stefanik here was practically identical with the one delivered in the Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs auditorium; it is covered in the report on the mass meeting in another page of this issue.</p>
   <p>Exhibitions by various Sokol societies entertained the crowd, while Mr. Dostal with other leaders drove to the meeting at Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs. All the stands with delicacies and refreshments were kept very busy so that the proceeds from the festival will net a handsome amount of money for patriotic purposes.</p>
   <p>In the late afternoon the leaders returned from Sokol Havlicek-Tyrs hall bringing Dr. Stefanik, who was acclaimed with great applause.</p>
   <p>Dancing and other entertainment closed the festival.</p>
