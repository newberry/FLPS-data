  <body>
   <p>The monthly meeting of the Sbor Ceskeho Narodniho Hrbitova V Chicagu (Bohemian National Cemetery Association of Chicago) was held yesterday evening in the Czecho-Slavonic Benevolent Societies' Hall, 18th and May Streets. A great number of delegates attended this meeting. The meeting was called to order by the chairman, Mr. Jan Pecha. The secretary, Mr. Victor H. Filip, then read the minutes of the previous meeting which were approved as read. The reading of communications followed.</p>
   <p>The Czechoslovak section of the American Red Cross, in its communication, asks the Sbor that data relative to the foundation and the activity of the Sbor be sent them. This communication was taken into consideration.</p>
   <p>The request of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost (Bohemian Charitable Association) aroused a lenghty debate in which many delegates participated. But it is necessary to state that the standpoint of the majority of the delegates, regarding <pb facs="5418478_7_0914.jpg" n="2"/>this request, was unfavorable to the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. Immediately after the reading of the request, the chairman, Mr. J. Pecha, explained that the Sbor performs its duty by providing a place for the free interment of the poor who are recommended by the organizations. The treasurer, Mr. J. Jurka, asked to be recognized, and in his speech he appealed to the delegates that help should not be refused to such humanitarian institution as the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. He made a motion that the Sbor contribute the sum of five hundred dollars and thus become a member of the association. He also mentioned that such a good deed would be a good example and encouragement to others. Mr. Masek and Mr. Rada spoke against the motion. Mr. Illich made a motion to appropriate the sum of fifty dollars. Mr. V. Cipra called the attention of the delegates to the fact that, according to the bylaws, such a request should be referred to the annual meeting of the Sbor. Mr. Petru spoke in favor of the request and seconded the motion of Mr. Jurka. He also reminded the delegates that approximately fifty dollars was appropriated by them for the benefit of the Ceska Dobrocinna Spolecnost. The chairman then asked the delegates to vote on the motion. Only four delegates voted for the motion. The request was <pb facs="5418478_7_0915.jpg" n="3"/>deferred to the annual meeting.....</p>
