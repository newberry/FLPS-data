   <p>They were charged with displaying pistols and daggers, Sunday March 22nd, at Peoria and 14th Streets. The distinguished American lawyer, Mrs. Mary Belle Spencer was in charge of the defense for Garza and Ramos, though they could not be located at the time.</p>
   <p>Candido Ricon and Estefano Gomez, who also took part in the quarrel, were represented by attorney Sullivan. They were sentenced to a fine and six months in prison.</p>
   <p>Ramon Solis who was represented by an attorney of the court, was fined twenty-five dollars for interfering with the police while arresting others after the fight.</p>
