   <p>The trial of the distinguished aviation instructor, Captain B. J. Venegas, charged with embezzlement, took place last Tuesday at 1:30 P.M. The charges were proffered by Benigno A. Daza, who is a native from Colombia. The charges accuse Captain Venegas of having received $275.00 from the student Daza to be used for the purchase of a plane. A receipt was signed stating that if no purchase had taken place by March 21st, the money would be refunded. As Captain Venegas has neither purchased a plane, nor refunded the money, he was arrested for embezzlement.</p>
   <p>The trial was to have taken place last Tuesday at 9:00 A.M., but was delayed due to a great number of other cases. The Venegas case came up only at 1:30 P.M. in the Court of Judge Borrelli, which is located at 48 South Wabash Avenue. Our reporter, who witnessed the disposition of the other cases found Judge Borrelli's decisions to be just and humane ones.</p>

   <p>Captain Venegas claimed in Court that a $50.00 deposit made by him towards the purchase of a plane had been lost. But he refused to say what had become of the remaining $225.00.</p>
   <p>The Judge ordered the defendent to return the money. Should he refuse to do so, he would be sentenced to a prison term of one to five years. The case was then continued until September 15th.</p>
