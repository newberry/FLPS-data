   <p>William Randolph Hearst, famous North-American journalist, has demonstrated once more his regard for fair play and justice, in an article of last Sunday's Herald and Examiner. In this article he speaks about two Mexican students, who were murdered at Ardmore, Oklahoma.</p>
   <p>Mr. Hearst's article is harsh but true and is appreciated by all honest people.</p>
   <p>Excelsior published in Mexico City, commented in the editorial of its issue of November 30th, as follows: "We have not read for a long time in the newspapers of any country such an energetic condemnation as that pronounced by Mr. W. R. Hearst, regarding the killing of two Mexican students, Emilio Cortez Rubio and Manuel Garcia Gomez, by some murderous sheriffs."</p>
   <p>Mr. Hearst on this occasion, has shown his independence and his opposition to violence and to lawlessness.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0136.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We think that there is some hope for the future in a country where public opinion is a power and where a man of such prominence as Mr. Hearst, raises his voice in condemnation.</p>
   <p>"Behold in Mr. Hearst a man who abhors injustice and crime. Not all men's lips are sealed. There are still honest men who tread the path of justice and fairness. Mr. Hearst has broken his lance for Mexico."</p>
