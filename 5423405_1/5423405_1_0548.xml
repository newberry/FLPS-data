   <p>For the first time in the history of the Spanish-American newspaper of Chicago a case as that of 5 p.m. last Saturday has occurred. Several policemen accompanied by Mr. Francisco F. Bentacourt, went to the newspaper plant "El Modelo" (The Copy) with a warrant to arrest the known Mexican journalist Elfego M. Romero. Mr. Romero is editor of the satirical weekly El Tringuete. The arrest was the basis for suppressing the Sunday edition of his paper.</p>
   <p>A reporter of Mexico came on the scene in time to witness the second act. He succeeded in getting the version of some witnessess and to see one who being so disturbed by the paper's accusation, accompanying a terrible criminal, directed a slap at Mr. Bentacourt and in consequence of all this created a major scandal.</p>
   <p>Immediately after this episode the journalist Romero was taken to the Maxwell police station. His friends said that the first steps would be those to obtain his freedom.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0549.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The famous lawyer, of the Mexican Colony, Mary Belle Spencer, was retained. She succeeded, through one of the judges who knew of the case, in getting his release after having his bond reduced from $1,500.00 to $200.00.</p>
   <p>The order which caused the arrest of Mr. Romero was based on the first page of the March 23rd, issue of El Tringuete, which said: "We have said, several times that El Tringuete was founded to take care of the needs and interests of those Mexicans who live here as foreigners. And we are much disposed to look out for the interest of those who patronize us.</p>
   <p>One of our advertisers has complained of annoyances which has been caused to him by the so called errors which Don Francisco Bentacourt made in his newspaper. It is said that many friends have approached him, inquiring as to wheter or not it was a misprint of our fellow newsman on saying 'that it was another merchant to whom the demand was directed,' that is another gentlemen, because they could imagine that the error might be an "s" or the number of the locality which because of a difference of 100 points is not the same.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0550.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>"Many thanks to our friend, for fully informing the public. It has answered his now famous "demand."</p>
   <p>The editorial paragraph transcribed above is a comentary printed on the first page of La Raza, in its edition of March 15, 1930, which under the title "Aclaracion Necesaria a Unlamentable Error" (Explanation to a Deplorable Error.)</p>
   <p>Through a typographical error in March 1st, issue there appeared a notice which said that a judicial demand had been made against one Mr. Valle, and we wish to make it clear that the gentleman to whom the demand refers is not Mr. Ignacio M. Valle, owner of the Mexican Musical Shop, located at 837 South Halsted Street, who is a well known and highly esteemed person in the Mexican Colony. The error remains explained."</p>
   <p>The previous declaration refers to another notice also published on the front page of the same paper, under date of March 1, 1930, which literally says: "The case of Mr. Ignacio M. Valle has been placed on the calender. Accordingly to the citation it has been set for March 3rd, 9:30 A. M.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0551.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>"It has been booked under unmber 2003700 and March 3rd, 9:30 a m. has been fixed as the day of appearance before the judge, at the instance of Mr. Bruno Heirich, attorney for Mr. Francisco F. Bentacourt, editor of La Rasa, as is said the referred to demand affirms as debtor Mr. Ignacio M. Valle, who is proprietor of "El Arte Mexicano" located at 837 South Halsted Street, because of libel published in the said newspaper."</p>
   <p>So that, then taking into consideration the special circumstances of the case, the journalist Romero in his satirical style, has asked for a necessary explanation and in exchange has been imprisoned because Mr. Bentacourt maintained before the authorities that the writing of the imprisoned journalist showed motives sufficiently serious to ask that he be held.</p>
   <p>The journalist Elfego M. Romero is well known for his patriotic and sincere work, on behalf of the Mexican residents of the United States, and he has popularized his satirical pen-names of August Franco and Juan Sin Miedo, which signatures he used brilliantly while with various publications including La Noticia Mlndial.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0552.jpg" n="5"/>
   <p>At the home of the Mexican journalist, arrested by order of the editor of La Raza, there can be found his wife and small children, deeply effected by his absence.</p>
   <p>Yesterday at 9:30 p.m. the time was fixed for hearing the case, but neither Mr. Bentacourt nor his lawyer made their appearance in court. Because of this the case was continued until April 15th. Attorney Mary Belle Spencer succeeded in having another reduction made in the amount of her client's bond. This time from $200.00 to $100.00 thus making it possible to secure provisional liberty for her client.</p>
   <p>The charge against Mr. Romero has caused profound sorrow in all the circles where he is known. This is true because he has been considered an industrious and honorable member of our colony. The notice that the editor of El Tringuete was imprisoned and that his case was to come up in court yesterday, brought a crowd of his followers to hear the proceedings, all eager to hear the result of the cause of action.</p>
