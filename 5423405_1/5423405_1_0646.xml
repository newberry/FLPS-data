   <p>The year of 1934 has unusally awakened the youth from both sexes to the basket-ball attraction. Necaxa vs. Morelos. These two groups with very powerful units were confronted at the University of Chicago Settlement last Monday. The Necaxa were led by Antonio Gomez and had an easy victory. The score was 24 to 8, for the Morelos who were led by L. Torres.Amazonas vs. Sports. The Mexican team Amazonas was defeated last Tuesday by the American Team Sports, the score was 26 to 14. The encounter was a prelimenary one and was preceded by the "Alas Rojas" vs."Red Aces", both teams being of first magnitude, sustained a clean cut game. The "Alas Rojas" won under the leadership of Lucila Rios with a score of 18 to 8.</p>
