   <p>The newspaper has played very important roles in the life of humanity. The history of journalism is replete with records of achievements. When the newspaper first came into being, it appeared as an agent of the controlling powers. It was used as a harbinger of these powers to promulgate religious doctrines, to dictate military movements, subdue the weak, to control production, freedom of thought and defenders of right. The right to express opinions was not permitted, and the public had to be subjected to the caprices of their egoistic rulers.</p>
   <p>Time registered its work in the talented brain of those men who feel and think, and thus their ideas triumphed. The dream which the public coveted was realized and the yoke of servitude, which those vested with the so called divine right refused to release from the neck of the public, has vanished.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0051.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Ignorance, naturally, perpetuated control and subjugation of the public. It made land seizure, slave markets, violation of public rights and liberty a matter of course.</p>
   <p>However, out of this oppression we have Puttenbergh, who gave us printing. With it came the decline of control of the public by the so called vested interest. The course of humanity changed to that of new concepts of life which called for a free development of culture. The idealists began to promulgate their opinions; the newspapers began to formulate and champion public opinion. They began to publish both sides of questions affecting human rights.</p>
   <p>For some it is the mouth that incites; for others inspiration comes from understanding. All new accomplishments have had their reverses, and the newspaper has been no exception. It had to undergo most difficult struggles in its progress. It met obstruction on one hand, and impelling forces on the other. Time passed and the newspaper grew to be a power of the first magnitude, which produced tension on controversial questions each day. The desire to predominate exerts itself in those of the so called power <pb facs="5423405_1_0052.jpg" n="3"/>class and the group which may be classed as hypocrites. They desire to hold the mass in ignorance and thereby strangle its liberty, obstruct justice and decry public rights. But their predominance is fading and the people are throwing off, more and more, their shackles.</p>
   <p>The newspaper began to function as a medium of education, carrying from city to city, and nation to nation the idea of liberty.</p>
   <p>Marat used it to combat the ignorance of the Bourbons, to kindle the pyre which reduced to ashes the power of the tyrants; Franklin, in order to save the Thirteen Colonies, used it, and thus robbed the English of their laurels; Pi and Margall, Naquens and Ibanez, men of untiring effort and hearts of steel, used it to free fertile Spain from a decaying foreign dynasty, which dominated it and impeded its progress, strangled its liberty, and violated its rights. Thus, the newspaper has been good and bad; in the hands of the unscrupulous, it has done much damage, while in the hands of the righteous, it has been a constructive force.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0053.jpg" n="4"/>
   <p>On the other hand, these struggles and differences of opinions have made the newspaper an important factor in the defense of right.</p>
   <p>Mexico, yielding to the need of fighting for justice, come forth as a champion to defend the interest of the oppressed against the practices of exploiters; to wipe out poverty and ignorance; to raise the prestige and respect of a good natured and hard working people who has been unjustly censured, a people who has committed no other crime than to affectionately love liberty. Mexico comes out for law and order and will continue to defend the rights of the Latin-American people in the "United States.</p>
