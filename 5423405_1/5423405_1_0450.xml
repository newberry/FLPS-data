   <p>The Mexican Republic was worthily represented at The World's Fair. It is well known that Mexico is a beautiful land with plenty of regional color.</p>
   <p>Mr. Luis Lupian, general inspector of consulates, arrived from Mexico heading 26 commissioners of industrial negotiators. Messers. Rafael De La Colina, Consul-General in San Antonio, Texas and Enrique D. Ruiz, Consul-General in New York, arrived also at the same time.</p>
   <p>The noted Tipica, (characteristic musical group) which form part of the Banda De Publicia (police band) brought the fragrance of the old Mexico and enlivened things with its selected music.</p>
   <p>The Mexican visitors were lodged by the quartermaster-general of "The International Lions", 332 South Michigan Avenue. The visitors attended a reception in the Exposition fields at the Honor Court.</p>

   <p>In the Mexican Village a luncheon was served and Mr. Edward Brown, president of The First National Bank, was the host and toast-master.</p>
   <p>There were many toasts, and plenty of cordial greetings and wishes for friendly relationship between both nations.</p>
