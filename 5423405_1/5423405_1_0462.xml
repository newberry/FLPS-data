   <p>One of the most interesting groups, and one which made a splendid showing at the official inauguration ceremonies of the Great Worlds Fair was the Mexican group. This unit was made up of beautiful young Mexican women and men who were dressed in native costumes, which made them stand out distinctly during the Presentation of delegations from the various countries. The Mexican unit was proceeded by a bands, which played native music. This also was true of other native groups, who were preceded by bands, orchestras or individuals playing instruments typical of many countries of the world.</p>
   <p>The Mexican Consulate having been invited by the directors of the Century of Progress Exposition organized the Mexican group which with much dignity carried a large flag displaying the symbolical coat of arms, of our motherland. The two beautiful children of the Chicago Consul, Mr. Carlos Palacios Roji, took part in the parade which passed in review before the official stand. This unit sang the Mexican National Hymn for which it was loudly applauded.</p>

   <p>The Maya Temple offered the visitors a view of the architecture from the time when this edifice was built.</p>
   <p>Since our country was not officially represented there were a number of cafes anc cabarets built by private American interests. However, the Spanish and Mexican atmosphere was in evidence throughout these places.</p>
   <p>This group of buildings formed what was generally known as "Old Mexico" and was at the end of 35th Street while the Maya Temple was at the 31st Street entrance.</p>
   <p>In "Old Mexico", was the "1849 Miners' Camp" which depicted the gold rush of upper California in 1849.</p>
