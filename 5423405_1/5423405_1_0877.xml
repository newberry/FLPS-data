   <p>Jose Rivas of 4318 South Ashland Avenue, was taken to the County Hospital the day before yesterday. He was found on 45th and Ashland, with a fractured skull.</p>
   <p>The attacker, is a certain Victorio Sanchez of 4334 South Ashland Avenue. After having had a fist fight with Rivas he departed to return armed, either with a rock or a bottle. He struck a hard blow on the head of Rivas, leaving him seriously wounded. The quarrel took place, Thursday at 3:30 P.M. on 45th Street.</p>
   <p>Rivas according to the police, received the blow unsuspectingly. His recovery is doubtful and he may die at any moment.</p>
   <p>One of our reporters, tried to interview him, but was unable to do so on account of his critical condition.</p>
