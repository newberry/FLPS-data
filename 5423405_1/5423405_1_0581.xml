   <p>The success we expected became a reality in last Monday's Radio Program over W C F L. Miss Esther Gonzales, dramatic soprano of the National Conservatory of Mexico, took charge of the program as a courtesy to this newspaper. She has shown once more her great artistic ability by surrounding herself with such reputable talent as Mrs. Milla Domingoez, Silvano R. Ramos, Francisco Tortolero and Jose Nieto. The later being an ace in the art of recitation and declamation, is demanded by our listeners, if we are to judge by the many telephone calls received asking us to have him take part next Tuesday in our program. Silvano R. Ramos, a tenor of unquestionable popularity in the colony has an excellent voice over the radio. Many persons have written to us, others have called over the telephone, all recommending us to tell Ramos to sing in all the programs. Milla Dominguez has completely revolutionized our broadcasts. Day in and day out we receive eulogies for her work in our pro<pb facs="5423405_1_0582.jpg" n="2"/>gram, Mrs. Dominguez's voice reproduces itself marvelously over the radio and is liked by all who hear it. Her songs are embellished and executed to perfection. Miss Esther Gonzalez, of the National Conservatory of Mexico, who enjoys great popularity in our colony sang very well on the night of our broadcasting. Mr. Casanova became the main feature in the program by singing "Granadinas," "Ay, Ay, Ay," and another song which we do not recall, all of them well executed. Of the program which Silvano Ramos is preparing for next Tuesday the 22nd, up to this moment we ignore the details. The facts we have at hand, which were made available by Ramos, are to the effect that in this program there will sing Lupe Plaza, Darwin Casanova, Silvano Ramos, and others whose names we do not know as yet. Another thing that the writer heard but to which he cannot vouch is that Jose Nieto will again recite next Tuesday. Be it what it may, anybody who has a radio should tune in at 8:45 p.m. W C F L, 970 Kilocycles, or 309 meters.</p>
