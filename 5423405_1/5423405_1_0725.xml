   <p>Ashland Auditorium was the scene last Sunday night of a most brilliant festival, given by the Cruz Azul Mexicana de Chicago (Mexican Blue Cross of Chicago). The purpose of this event was to commemorate the anniversary of the glorious Puebla expedition. (Puebla is the Mexican city where the famous battle of May Fifth was fought for Mexico's independence.)</p>
   <p>The colony, led by our cultured fellowman, Dr. J. B. Medina, turned out in mass to do homage to the memory of our heroes, and to show the interest which we still have in the far away land of the Mother country.</p>
   <p>Shortly after 9 P. M., Mr. Aveleyra, Chicago Mexican Consul, came into the amphitheatre, accompanied by his wife, and took the seats which had been reserved for them. He was chosen to preside over the festival, and his arrival marked the beginning of an excellent program.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0726.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The first number was a brilliant speech by Dr. Trevino, who reviewed the famous Batalla del Cinco de Mayo (Battle of May Fifth), and gave praise to the military genius of General Ignacio Zaragoza, and other heores.</p>
   <p>The second number was rendered by Emma Valle, daughter of Mr. Ignacio Valle, who danced to the delight of the audience.</p>
   <p>The third number was a poem, recited by Mr. Jose Nieto. His rendition of "El Insurgente" (The Rebel), literary gem of Juan de Dios Peza, was well received. Another number well applauded was a folk-dance by several young women, who were presented as "Tehuanas" because of their characteristic dress.</p>
   <p>Our well known tenor, Enrique Islas, delighted the audience with his beautiful songs. An outstanding feature of the program was the singing of a twelve-year-old boy of South Chicago. This lad, Emilio Arceo, sang native songs, including "La Paloma" (The Dove), which were loudly applauded.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0727.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>The Fa-Do ( a Portuguese dance), well danced by Paco Perafan and Florence Joyce, made a lasting impression on the audience. This was also true of a dance number by Paco and Linda Rodriguez.</p>
   <p>Then came the lecture by the Mexican Consul, Mr. Aveleyra, who reviewed the pages of our history, in his fine oratorical style, to the pleasure of the audience. After the Consul's lecture, there was more singing and dancing by outstanding artists, topped by the singing of the National Hymn.</p>
   <p>The Auxiliary of the Cruz Azul Mexicana de Chicago (Mexican Blue Cross of Chicago) should feel proud of the great success of this festival. We take this occasion to praise the diligent and capable directors for the manner in which this splendid affair was carried out.</p>
