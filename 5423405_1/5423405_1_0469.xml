   <p>A great festival was held last Thursday night, May 26th, in the Louis XIV Room of the Sherman Hotel. The affair was promoted by the International Club of the Junior Association of Commerce in cooperation with the Mexican Consulate of this City.</p>
   <p>The program given was highly selected. Some of the features were as follows: The great tenor of the Chicago Civic Opera, Mr. Francisco Tortolero, who sang celebrated Mexican songs for which he was very loudly applauded; the celebrated Tipica Romas Orchestra which played a very pleasing selection; the dainty Navarro sisters, who were well applauded for their songs; the Honorable Consul Mr. Rafeal Aveleyca, who spoke on the social and economic conditions of the country which he represents and who received much applause for his very pointed address; and the showing of a picture, entitled Old Mexico, loaned gratis by the Missouri Pacific Railroad, which was the host.</p>

   <p>High personalities from industry, commerce and banking, as well as the Honorable accredited Consul at Chicago, were present at this unusual celebration.</p>
