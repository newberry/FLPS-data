   <p>The Anti-Tuberculosis Committee of Chicago, held a meeting before a large gathering last Sunday in the Hall in South Chicago Park.</p>
   <p>The Committee was represented by the Chicago Mexican Consul, Mr. Rafael Aveleyra assisted by Drs. Meixueiro, Carreras and Garcia Trevino. Drs. Goldberg and Stanford, and Miss Johns of Hull House were invited guests of the Committee.</p>
   <p>Mr. Aveleyra explained to the crowd the tangible work which had been and was being done for the conservation and betterment of Mexican health. He paid tribute to Dr. Goldberg for his accomplishment in reducing tuberculosis in the great colony from the Motherland of Juarez.</p>
   <p>He also explained that this conference was the beginning of the third series of such meetings and that the enthusiasm shown by the large attendance indicates that those to be held on the 18th and 25th and June 1st may be well attended.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0231.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Our well known Dr. Eluid Garcia Trevino gave adequate treatment to the subject "La Higiene General" (General Hygiene).</p>
   <p>As usual our leading artists and other outstanding persons and social units cooperated with the committee in making the meeting a success. Among these were the Avila brothers, gifted interpreters of Mexican music, and the leading members of the Cruz Azul de South Chicago (South Chicago Blue Cross).</p>
   <p>The eminent physician, Dr. Oscar Carreras will be in charge of the session to be held May 18th.</p>
