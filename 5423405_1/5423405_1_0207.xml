   <p>John W. Jaranowski writes this open letter to the Chicago Mexicans:</p>
   <p>Dear friends:</p>
   <p>Permit to write to you regarding some administrative conditions in Cook County.</p>
   <p>Since my candidacy for office as Civil Service Examiner has been attacked by Americans who do not have any relations with the office of Examiner I ask you to consider the following points.</p>
   <p>It is true that I consider myself handicapped for having been born from poor parents in the Calumet district. I also feel handicapped because my parents are of foreign extraction. I also consider myself at a disadvantage for having to work for a living. But I am not ashamed to confess that every cent I possess in this world I have earned through hard labor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0208.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>I am proud of my friends and neighbors and of the community in which I live and was born. This community made me what I am, and I will remain loyal to it the rest of my life. I have contributed to its development in every way I could.</p>
   <p>My community elected me County Commissioner. While in office I have done every thing possible to help the poor taxpayers. As a candidate for Examiner I am the only one who has declared that all public employees should be in the Civil Service. I am the only candidate who has openly advocated the reduction of taxes.</p>
   <p>I promise on my word of honor that when elected Examiner, the Civil Service Office will be administered on the basis of efficiency, economy and courtesy to the public. With this platform I beg that you vote for me as Civil Service Examiner.</p>
   <p>John W. Jaranowski.</p>
