   <p>The enthusiastic members of The Pan-American Society are now very glad, because they are members of the State League.</p>
   <p>The Pan-American is formed by a group of distingushed youngmen of the Spanish-American Colony and has an important soccer team, which they want to put it on the top of the League.</p>
   <p>The new instructor, Mr. J. Alcayaga T.,Chilean citizen, began his duties last Thursday, August 13, at Washington Park. Mr. Alcayaga has among his disciples, these noted youngmen: Jose Govea, Leon Lira and Jacinto Alcayaga T.</p>
   <p>The first game will be held to-morrow against the strong Italian equipment of The International League.</p>
   <p>The players of the Pan-American are as follows:</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0682.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Jorge Ramos, Balivian, left side; Mr. Cortez, and Mr. Mendoz, Balivians also, who have good technical knowledges. M. M. Palafox, Robles and Gonzales play in the middle line. Cristino Gallard, is a youngman scarcely known, but he has great ability, in order to become a good goalkeeper.</p>
   <p>This league is very expensive, and by this reason The Pan-American Association asks to all the Latin-American commerce, the support of this team which triumphs will be the triumphs of all the Latin-American Colony.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jesus Delago, Mexican citizen, who knows the importance of this team, will give one part of the total amount of this equipment. This conduct must be imitated.</p>
