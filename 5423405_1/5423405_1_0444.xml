   <p>It is very noticeable the number, and variety of work done in the last seven weeks by the girls who attended the classes conducted by the R. R. Madres Cordimarianas (Nuns) in their residence, at 1100 May Street. Since August 27th they have been in possession of these quarters of which now five rooms are used to exhibit the manual work. The R. R. Madres wish to extend a cordial invitation to the Mexican Colony to visit the exposition.</p>
   <p>The Festival presented by the Madres and their pupils was very significant and was presided over by the Rev. Padre Cummings and the head priest of San Francisco. It was due to the good influence of Mgr. Cummings that his excellency the Cardinal permitted the Madres the use of the present edifice.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0445.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The festival however gave a vivid example of how much the children, who attended the classes, have accomplished. Very soon we shall inform you in detail the days and hours, so that you may send your children to these classes. In this Catholic Center the faith is preserved and the moral of the children fortified. The children of Catholic parents must not be sent to schools where their moral may be in danger, and their faith is taken away from them. You may visit this exposition, which will last until Sept. 13th. Music, painting, embroidering, flower making and other classes to be given, for boys and girls.</p>
