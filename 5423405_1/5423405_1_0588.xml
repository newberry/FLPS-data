   <p>The interest of our colony towards the radio programs which are being presented by Mexico every Sunday, is increasing remarkably. Last Sunday, radio station W C F L was filled with a good number of our fellow- countrymen who were anxious to witness our efforts in offering the public a radio program in Spanish. Among those present, we were happy to greet some from Indiana Harbor, and Gary, Indiana, and a crowd from Chicago. Mr. Silvano Ramos and Dominik Luise accompanied by the Mariana chorus, broadcasted a part of what we shall hear at the next function that has been announced for March 8th, at the West Side Auditorium. Another excellent note of our program, was "El Relicario" sung by the soprano Lupe Plaza, a Mexican lady, who was very warmly congratulated by the audience.</p>

   <p>Enrique Islas, Jesus Quiroga and the tenor Ramirez, have demonstrated once more on this occasion their artistic talents. The program was closed by Miss Esther Gonzales. The artists were accompanied by Mr. Eustacio Rosales, a noteworthy pianist from "Colombia." Mr. Rosales was the director of one of the orchestras that participated in a recent contest sponsored by the Chicago Daily News.</p>
