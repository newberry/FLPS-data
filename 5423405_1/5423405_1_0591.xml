   <p>Our idea to present a genuine Spanish-American radio program on the air, has been favorably accepted by our colony and the Spanish-speaking colonies of the Middle West. This program will be heard Sunday, Feb. 16, 1930, over station WCFL (wave 309m.), from 7:45 to 8:30 P. M.</p>
   <p>With the selected program offered by Mexico on Feb. 1st, this publication has taken a step toward more progressive goals without scandalizing journalistic modernism.</p>
   <p>The object of this publication is that on the day of the program, it offers its best efforts to the colony, on whose help it depends.</p>
   <p>All of our readers who might not have a radio at home and who desire to hear this Spanish-American program, are cordially invited to come to station WCFL, 623 S. Wabash Ave.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0592.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>On the program,we count with the cooperation of the well-known soprano Mrs. Lupe Plaza, whose worthy artistic work is well-known to our readers. She will sing "Mariguita," "Tango Negro,"and "Yo Sufro," which are three beautiful songs of her Southern repertoire.</p>
