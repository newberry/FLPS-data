   <p>At two thirty p. m. when the Amusement Club entered upon the playing field where they were to play a game with the "German F. C.",the former was practicing with so much vigor that it was thought that the Germans would be defeated in the first contest. Victory in our favor appeared certain, but the results were deceiving.</p>
   <p>At 2:35 o'clock the whistle was sounded and those who had rushed upon the playing field began to disperse and go to occupy those places for which they were suited. The boys of the Amusement Club did not do so badly but not as well as I had thought. In spite of the fact that they were outclassed throughout the whole game, suddenly they became interested like our godmother Lola, and behold the Germans made a goal contrary to our interests. On the field some of the players could be distinguished and it appeared that some of them had lost their dexterity. "Shorty",although small, was afraid of no one.He was the hero of the crowd, because he was always under the feet of some of the players trying to get the ball.</p>

   <p>Louis, the famous Mexican, carried himself as if he knew what to do and he too should be given praise. In one of the contacts he received a long scratch on his face, but this dod not stop him. Everybody played well, but we must realize that the fault was that of the goal keeper. The director of the team should be more careful in the future and the next time see that the goal keeper eats two bowls of broth and a good plate of pork and beans before going on the field, because he needs them.</p>
