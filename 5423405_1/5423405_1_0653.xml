<title level="a">TOM'S EFFECTIVE LEFT CAUSES GASTANAGA'S DEFEAT AT THE STADIUM</title></bibl>

   <p>Before a gathering of more than six thousand people at the Chicago Stadium, the new Spanish idol of the ring Isidro Gastanaga met Tommy Loughran of Philadelphia, and suffered his first defeat. Loughran is one of the outstanding boxers of Philadelphia. The fight was exciting all the way through. Gastanaga was the aggressor all the time but, the skillful left of Loughran landed on Gastanaga's jaws at short intervals and it is due to this fact, that the Spaniard was unable to add one more victory to the list of 47 that he has already in his favor.</p>
   <p>In spite of this reverse, Gastanga's record shows that the future of this Spaniard in the boxing field is not yet at an end. On the contrary, a boxer needs varied experiences in order to improve. All the great boxers of the past and of the present had to learn to win and to lose in order to reach success in their careers.</p>

   <p>Gastanaga would be an exception should he be spared of such an experience. However, Gastanaga may still be considered an exception if we are to judge him by those he defeated: Retzlaff, Doktor, McTigue , Yipsy Daniels, who knocked out Schemeling - Oldani, Parrille, Branchi, Fournier, Malibran, Webb, Perez, Mata, Silva, Triez, Morales, Gypry, Fourchon, Lorenzo and many other boxers whose names we do not remember and who were knocked out by Gastanaga in the first round.</p>
