  <body>
   <p>Juan Godinez, 22 years of age, of 8903 Mackinaw Avenue, was seriously wounded on the left side of his neck and Pascual Velasco, 25 years of age, of 9026 Brandon Avenue, received a stab in the heart. Their quarrel resulted from a dispute as to which of the two had the right to use the telephone booth, in the restaurant of Mr. Mie Canas, on 8855 Buffalo Avenue. Velasco died Friday night, at the Illinois Steel Company Hospital.</p>
   <p>Godinez and his wife Lidia were in Canas' restaurant telephone booth, making a call, when Velasco came and ordered them to get out, as he too had to make a telephone call. Godinez told him to wait a moment, where upon the dispute followed.</p>
   <p>The men went out on the street, and began to fight with knives. Godinez, was taken to the Bridewell Hospital.</p>
   <p>It is believed that the police of South Chicago, will indict Godinez for murder.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0879.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Godinez, however, killed in self defense, as Velasco attacked him. His wife and other witnesses can testify to that. However his condition is serious and little hope remains to save him.</p>
