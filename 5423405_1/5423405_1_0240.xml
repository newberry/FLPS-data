   <p>The educational campaign to aid our people in the matter of health, is reaching a sound organic base. Prominent Mexican doctors will be in charge of lectures, on subjects of vital importance to the Mexican. Furthermore, we have obtained some interesting slides to illustrate the various lectures, so that every person may get a clear understanding of the subject. Although these pictures deal with problems of health, nevertheless, they have been arranged in such interesting manner, that besides being educational they also are entertaining and intended to be enjoyed by those who see them. The committee conducting this campaign, took into consideration the needs of the colony and has added to the membership valuable elements who, with their prestige and influence, will contribute to the success of this work. The committee is as follows: Dr. E. Garcia Trevino, Rev. Lacy Simms, Mr. Sam Fraga, Francisco Betancourt, Rev. C. M. Gurrola, Rev Guillermo O'Neil, Jose Gonzalez, Miss Mary McDowell, of the University of Chicago Settlement, Miss Anita Jones, Dr. Meixuerio, Dr. A. de L. Guevara, Father F. Saboide, Jose O. Velasco, Antonio Acosta, and Jose Fernandez.</p>

   <p>Translators' Note:</p>
   <p>Miss Mary McDowell made a great contribution to the social welfare of the Mexican people, especially among those residing around the Settlement. Her abnegation was recognized by many outstanding Mexicans and she certainly was better understood and appreciated by those who suffered most the evil of unemployment. Miss Mary McDowell received an honorary medal from the Mexican Government in appreciation of services rendered to the Mexican people in the Stock Yards District. The loss of Miss McDowell was a great loss to the Mexican people of Chicago. The Mexican will remember for some time to come the noble deeds of this great American Woman!</p>
