   <p>We have from 150 to 200 Mexican workers in our Union. Four months ago we did not have one in it. It was a hard group to start. We have one Mexican a full time paid organizer, and about 35 to 40 active helpers.</p>
   <p>Our Union aims to raise the standard of living of the worker through better wages, safety and sanitary conditions for all. We also have classes for our members they are taught not only what the Union means to them, but also educate them to become better citizens so they can be of real value to the community where they live, and to the country. They receive that without cost.</p>
   <p>On this organization drive, we take in members and for three months they do not have to pay a cent. This is the C. I. O. and I am in charge of the Calumet region.</p>
