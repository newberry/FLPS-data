   <p>Attorney Russell J. Alvarez, democratic candidate for Judge of the Municipal Court, was born in Chicago in 1898 of a Spanish father and a German mother. After he finished his legal studies he took up the practice of law. He was admitted to the Bar Association in June 1924. Alvarez is a congenial and highly respected politician and his nomination in the next primaries on April 12th will assure his election to office in the coming general election.</p>
   <p>His experiences in all phases of the law over which the Municipal Court has jurisdiction makes him the logical candidate for the office he is seeking. He is a member of the American Legion and Veteran of Foreign Wars.</p>
   <p>The Spanish American Colony of Chicago and Suburbs do not have a representative in a political office of the State and for this reason special effort should be made on the part of the Latins who are eligible to vote for a candidate who is familiar with our customs and who will be able to impart justice to our race with less prejudice than any other judge.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0204.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Do not forget, then, all who are eligible to vote cast your ballot for Alvarez if you wish to put a good man in office who merits the aid of all.</p>
   <p>Attorney Alvarez, by means of these lines, takes the opportunity to recommend Honorable Michael L. Igoe,who is in the political race with him, for governor of Illinois. Mr. Igoe has been a member of the lower house of the Illinois Assembly for 20 years. He is a great friend of the poor and is always fighting for their interests.</p>
   <p>Those who are friends of Mr. Alvarez are friends of the Colony so go to the polls and cast your vote for him.</p>
