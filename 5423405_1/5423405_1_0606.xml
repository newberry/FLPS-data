<title level="a">ENGLISH CLASSES FOR ADULTS</title>

   <p>The Hull House offers them free of charge, according to the information given by Miss Pearl Southerland, a Hull House English teacher. This institution has inaugurated Daytime Classes for adults, for those who were born here and due to some circumstance were unable to finish the Elementary school. Also for those who have come from a foreign land, who may perhaps had high school training, yet they are confronted with the necessity to learn the English language. Undoubtedly, these special classes will be of great advantages to persons whose opportunities are very limited due to the lack of knowledge in the English language. The time set for these classes are from 1:00 to 3:30 in the afternoon, so that the people who are unemployed and those who work at night may attend without injuring their interests.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0607.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>These studies are conducted to suit the necessities of each student, and not of the group. Under this method it makes no difference how little English the student may know, or how far advanced he may be so long as he has the ambition to continue his preparations. The classes will be conducted five days a week, from Monday to Friday inclusive. If more information is needed kindly see the teacher whose name is mentioned above.</p>
