   <p>Educational campaign is instituted by Municipal Sanitarium. An intensive campaign for the elimination of tuberculosis among the 10,000 Mexicans of Chicago is announced by the Municipal tuberculosis sanitarium. It will take the form of school of public health instruction and will be directed by Dr. Benjamin Goldberg, medical supervisor of the institution. The city now has 642 of the Mexican colony under its supervision for tuberculosis.</p>
   <p>A series of lectures covering basic facts about the white plague, given in Spanish by native Mexicans, and moving-picture films to illustrate various conditions and point out salutory lessons, are to be used", said Dr. Goldberg. Leaflets printed in Spanish will be distributed to the entire Mexican population, so that they will be enabled to understand tuberculosis-breeding conditions and endeavor to remedy them.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0771.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Messages on health also are being printed in the Spanish Language newspapers. Lectures on the prevention of tuberculosis will be given for four Sunday evenings at the University of Chicago Settlement in the head of a large colony of Mexicans working in the Stockyards, and later in the South Chicago Steel-mill district. The first meeting was held last Sunday night at Hull House, attended by 400 Mexicans and addressed by Dr. Goldberg, LeRoy Miller of the Sanitarium board of directors; Rafael Aveleyra, Mexican Consul; and Dr. E. Garvia Trevino.</p>
