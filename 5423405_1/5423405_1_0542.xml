   <p>Mexico Publishing Company, is going to make an interesting innovation. It has already been said that, since Mexico came out victorious in the hard struggle to keep alive; it will now redouble its efforts resolved to carry out the real task for which it was called.</p>
   <p>One of the things which are of real interest to the thousands of Latin-Americans found here unorientated, alone, without funds and in need of a job is some protection and any effective aid that may give them the orientation they are looking for, than helping them secure what they need. Aid Department. Seeing at this time the situation of thousands of people in a deplorable condition Mexico in its new effort has seen fit to create an "Aid Department," which will be under the leadership of Miguel Angel Peral, for the exclusive purpose of helping the Mexican and other Latin-Americans who may be disorientated and without employment.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0543.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>In this manner, all who need help may come to our offices for information or consultation on what will be published in the "Section of Information and Aid," so as to satisfy their wishes and remove their difficulties. Mexico, will increase its circulation beginning with the next edition, because it wishes to be the only organ of the Spanish- speaking people, the only artery through which like blood may circulate, the whole voice and spirit of the Latin race. There-fore, this newspaper offers its services with the understanding that it will not charge one cent to those who may offer or receive information or use these columns to offer employment or solicit the same.</p>
