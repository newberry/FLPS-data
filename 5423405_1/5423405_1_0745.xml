  <body>
   <p>The Sociedad Femenil Mexicana has performed one more noble deed by which it expresses its charitable mission amongst our countrymen who happen to be in need and distress. Mrs. Arredondo de Novaez, of 1204 W. Roosevelt Rd., lost a two and one-half years old son two days ago. The misery of this woman is extreme. Her husband deserted her and her four children, two of whom are sick in the hospital. The afflicted mother is engaged in a life and death battle with her misfortunes. The remains of her deceased son will receive a Christian burial; thanks to the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana. The Mexican mother is now trying to save her other children from sickness and death.</p>
   <p>The Sociedad Femenil has called our office on the telephone asking us to inform the colony that three of their members have been assigned to collect funds amongst the Mexican people in order to pay the burial expenses of <pb facs="5423405_1_0746.jpg" n="2"/>the deceased child and to help the rest of the distressed family as much as possible. We wish to congratulate the Sociedad Femenil Mexicana for this humanitarian deed and it is our belief that the Mexicans and Spanish-Americans will give their share be it small or large to a desolate mother whose sole resources are those given to her by a kind public. A good example has been set by the Sociedad Femenil-Mexicana. As soon as the society heard that there was no money to bury the boy its members decided to meet and to find out what they could do to help a grieving mother. It is up to the Mexican colony, or rather to all those who speak Spanish to show once more that they are really united and hospitable. It is not a matter of putting up a monument to our own glory, but to bury one of our nationals who for the two and one-half years of his short existence lived and died in poverty. "May he rest in Peace."</p>
