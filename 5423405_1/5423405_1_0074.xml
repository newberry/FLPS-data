   <p>Interview with Mr. James Brydon, Director of Boys, and Mrs. Genevieve Byrne, Director of Girls, Newberry Center, 1335 Newberry Avenue, by Victor Chavez, November 11, 1936.</p>
   <p>Both of the interviewed are graduates of Northwestern University and are practicing their professions.</p>
   <p>Education: This community is composed of the very low class of Mexicans, mostly of the peen class; so they do not have any interest in higher education and are satisfied with an elementary one.</p>
   <p>In this section there is much drinking and no knowledge of blue laws.</p>

   <p>Interview with Mr. James Brydon, Director of Boys, and Mrs. Genevieve Byrne, Director of Girls, Newberry Center, 1335 Newberry Avenue, by Victor Chavez, November 11, 1936.</p>
   <p>The family organization is very unstable, and not very many get married. Girls of 15 are known to become mothers, in other words morality is at low ebb. The Mexican community is pathological, the death and birth rate are among the highest in the city.</p>
   <p>The man is always the head of the family. Sometimes he goes to the extreme. Some exercise strong measures to preserve the morals of their children, while others allow their children complete freedom.</p>
   <p>Most of the families are on relief.</p>

   <p>Interview with Mr. James Brydon, Director of Boys, and Mrs. Genevieve Byrne, Director of Girls, Newberry Center, 1335 Newberry Avenue, by Victor Chavez, November 11, 1936.</p>
   <p>In this Center classes are given in Spanish and Mexican Folk tales. They are told in the Spanish languages to the children by Miss Edelin, a student of Northwestern University. Miss Mendoza also gives classes on the same subjects.</p>
   <p>Many Mexicans were imported as strike-breakers and although they work for big business, when working they patronize the small stores. They desire to go into business for themselves. It seems that they mistrust unions in general. The Unemployed Workers Alliance meets in the building. This Alliance is mainly interested in seeing that the relief clients are taken care of properly.</p>

   <p>Interview with Mr. James Brydon, Director of Boys, and Mrs. Genevieve Byrne, Director of Girls, Newberry Center, 1335 Newberry Avenue, by Victor Chavez, November 11,1936.</p>
   <p>Social organizations are not very well organized. There are Mexican folk songs and dancing and fiestas and social gatherings but there is not a fixed schedule for them just now.</p>
   <p>Politics: Perhaps one in 50 is entitled to vote. They are not interested in local politics.</p>
   <p>There is a Communist Society, some where on North Halsted, but the interviewed does not know anything concrete about it.</p>

   <p>Interview with Mr. James Brydon, Director of Boys, and Mrs. Genevieve Byrne, Director of Girls, Newberry Center, 1335 Newberry Avenue, by Victor Chavez, November 11, 1936.</p>
   <p>The mothers do some Mexican embroidery and bead work and the children pottery, woodwork, carving, paintings etc. They also take part in sports in the Center.</p>
   <p>The deliquency is the second highest in this community. Prostitution is also very high although not organized and mostly due to economic family conditions. In the winter this situation seems acute. The Maternity Hospital in the neighborhood attends some cases of illegitimate children, but the midwives take care of most of them.</p>
