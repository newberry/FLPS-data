   <p>Vicente Garcia, 40 years old, native of Jalisco, recently arrived in this city and became the victim of a clever swindle while he was walking on Canal Street last Saturday. Two individuals undoubtedly noticed that our countryman was new in the city. One of these two walked a little ahead of Garcia, and the other behind him. The one who was ahead dropped a pocket book and his accomplice immediately picked it up and disappeared. The first man then accused Garcia of having taken his pocket book and as he was getting very angry, Garcia in a good faith showed him his own to convince him that he was innocent. The swindler snatched the pocket book out of his hand and ran away.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0886.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Garcia says that his pocket book contained $12.50, the only money he had. He also lost very important documents together with the money.</p>
   <p>We have been informed that Garcia came to Chicago to see if he could locate his wife and four children. He says that his wife and four children came to Chicago last June with a brother of hers named Atiland.Garcia believes that his wife is in Chicago or in a nearby town.</p>
