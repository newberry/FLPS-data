   <p>One more step toward the ideal we have dreamed of. This ought to be the title heading these lines, because El Liberal in its nine editions has advanced one foot at least toward the end which impulsed us at the start. In viewing the future before us, we perceive an era of prosperity and abundance for tomorrow. Perhaps this way of thinking may appear as a fantastic dream in the field that we began to explore. But, even if this was true, our firm conviction is as solid as a rock, ready to support with impassible rampart and rectitude the strong winds without diminution of temper.</p>
   <p>We are fighters, for this reason we understand that every undertaking in its beginning meets all sorts of obstructions, misery and wakefulness. But, what does it matter when we know that in the end we shall achieve the reward of our sufferings?</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0534.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Everything human is possible in this world. This world that talks comments, sighs and lives with us. That is why as long as we may have a spark of life and some one may encourage the continuation of our paper as they have in the past, we shall correspond to the sincerity of our readers, for we live with them and shall work in harmony with them.</p>
