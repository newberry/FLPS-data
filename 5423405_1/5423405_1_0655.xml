   <p>Isidoro Gastanaga, the new Spanish terror of contemporary heavy weight pugilists took part in a boxing match last Monday, at White City Park, in this city. He was cool and calm, and wore a robe with the red, yellow and purple of the Spanish flag.</p>
   <p>Arriving at the ring, Gastanaga sat in his corner, awaiting the moment he so anxiously desired. His countenance showed the assurance of the victory, which later on was to be his. The bell rang and the two contestants shook hands.</p>
   <p>A blow on the jaw, another on the chest and then the count of ten that completed the foregone victory of Gastanaga, over Joe Doktor.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0656.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Once dressed, he and his faithful manager, returned to The Sociedad Espanola. At the end of the dinner given in the champions' honor, all those present shouted: "Viva Gastanaga".</p>
   <p>Believe it or not, Gastanaga has participated in 57 boxing matches which he has won 47. Twenty-seven of these fights were won by the champion in the first round. This should show that our visitor means business. Mickey Walker is to be his next opponent.</p>
