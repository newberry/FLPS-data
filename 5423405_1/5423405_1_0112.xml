  <body>
   <p>The following information was sent to us by our good friend, Jose R. Vega: On May 24, 1928 Refugio Vazquez died at the County Hospital of pneumonia.</p>
   <p>Vazquez, our compatriot arrived a few days ago from Montana, San Luis Potosi, Mexico accompanied by his wife and a brother-in-law. His wife and brother-in-law not only suffered the shock of Vazquez's death but, also the misfortune of being without the necessary resources to fulfill their last obligation of burying the deceased. The situation was so bad that the wife was forced to make an appeal to her friends. A collection was taken up among the Mexican colony in that sector with magnificent results.</p>
   <p>The generosity of the Mexican people was once more demonstrated on this occasion. The amount collected was $94.10. Jose R. Vega and Isidro M. Comparan each donated $20.00. Other donations consisted of five dollars and down to 25 cents.</p>
   <p>The family and friends of the deceased, through this newspaper which is the organ of the Mexican colony,wish to express their gratitude for the kind contributions.</p>
