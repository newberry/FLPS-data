   <p>It is a rare treat to see a departure from either the conservative or the radical schools of painting that is unusual enough to be called an artistic innovation which at the same time the average man can understand and appreciate it without the aid of an interpreter. The exhibit by the eminent Mexican artist Enrique Dusolier Laureola, of painting on tile, at Fred Leighton's Indian Trading Post, 619 North Michigan Avenue, is as different from the academic and modern school as the materials and textures of its presentation. It is an artistic innovation of beauty as to execution and design.</p>

   <p>RAPHEL - LIKE TECHNIQUE</p>
   <p>There is a Raphael-like technique combined with the bolder methods of later artists in his "Crucified Christ" as conceived by the Indians of Mexico. It is presented on the blocks that have been fitted into a frame for hanging or easel showing. Each tile is about 4x4 inches. The paintings are done by a secret process that was achieved after years of research by the artist, who also is professor of the history of art in the University of Mexico.</p>
   <p>The finest and most delicate shades of coloring are applied to the tile in a manner that fixes the colors so securely that they will be preserved for all time. Taureola has presented in this manner the image of Christ that the Indians were supposed to have been shown by the Christian fathers who came to the Aztec empire as missionaries four centuries ago. The leg end says that the image was on a medal, an image so realistic and human of the agony of Christ that his expression thus portrayed accounted for the miracle of conversion.</p>

   <p>OTHER FINE WORKS</p>
   <p>In addition to this masterpiece of color and workmanship there are others as finely done as miniatures in the old art galleries of Europe. Among them are "The Assault" in soft colors, a medieval street fight in a latin land; a reproduction of "Picador", the original of which is in the Del Prado, Madrid Spain; "The Convent of Churubuso", in a lovely lavender sepiashade, a drawing with pastelike crayon that also was fixed by fire like the major works; "The Patio Colonial", an example of one of the beautiful houses of the period when Mexico was a Spanish colony. As to the secret process:each color and shade given in the painting proper implies determined degree of cooking by fire. The sketch is done first and then each tile is individually painted and burnt for preservation. The work is guaranteed against all discoloration and deterioration by the elements. The artist has gone far beyond the ordinary Mexican tile and pottery craftsmen for whom Mexico is justly famous. There are also on exhibit at the Trading Post some fine works of Awa-Se-Day, the Pueblo Indian artist whose colors have become noted for their pictorial art of the aborigines.</p>
