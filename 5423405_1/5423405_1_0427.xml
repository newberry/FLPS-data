   <p>Those who love the idea of going round and round on the arms of a congenial partner, and those who can do expertly the "Jarabe" and the "Jota," will be happy to hear that on Saturday, December 8, there will be a dancing contest at the West Side Auditorium, with valuable prizes for the winning couples.</p>
   <p>In addition to the dance which will come last, and which promises to be highly entertaining, the debut of the popular and well-known theatrical group, "Pro Arte Hispano-Mexicano," will take place at 8:30. It will present the two beautiful dramas, "El Arcediano de San Gil," and "Los Amores de Ramona." The last one is based on the great moving-picture "Ramona," which is famous through-out the world.</p>
   <p>An orchestra, under the leadership of Mr. Simon Atilano, has been engaged to furnish the music. The famous conductor is well known for his beautiful music.</p>

   <p>Do not forget the date, Saturday, December 8, and the place, the West Side Auditorium. The program prepared for this occasion has been carefully selected. The features were chosen so as to provide the best possible entertainment.</p>
