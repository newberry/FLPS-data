   <p>The presentation of the operetta "Marina" in the West Side Auditorium, last Saturday, was an unprecedented and outstanding success. The whole colony is said to have been in the spacious West Side Hall, giving their support to this performance, which was a benefit affair for the popular Mexican tenor, Silvano R. Ramos.</p>
   <p>A large crowd assembled long before the show was to start. This crowd grew to gigantic proportions as the hour to begin the performance approached.</p>
   <p>All the artists taking part in the play were loudly applauded. Miss Esther Gonzales was noisily acclaimed several times for the superb acting she displayed in "Marina".</p>
   <p>Dominick Luise, young Italian baritone, from the Metropolitan Opera Company, demonstrated once more his artistic talent.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0408.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Silvano R. Ramos, in his role of Captain, displayed, in a full and pleasing manner, his versatile and graceful expression. The hall was shaken many times by applause from the patrons, who left the theater highly pleased.</p>
   <p>In a word, as we have said before, the affair was a success, a triumph never before witnessed in the history of our colony.</p>
