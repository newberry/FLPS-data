   <p>Cruz Azul Mexicana,</p>
   <p>Chicago, Illinois.</p>
   <p>In care of the Chairman,</p>
   <p>Honorable Board of Directors:</p>
   <p>With due consideration I beg to call your attention to an article which appeared in the newspaper Mexico, on Apr. 5th, signed by Narciso Gonzalez, of South Chicago, entitled "El Problema de la Cruz Azul Mexicana" (The problem of the Mexican Blue Cross). As for myself, although I have ceased to be a member of your Directive Body, I have a great interest and enthusiasm for the Mexican Blue Cross, and the article here mentioned is very significant for these reasons; (1) The article, written in a conscientious and spontaneous manner, has come from our modest working class, the main element of our Mexican colony in South Chicago. Through it a call is made to the Mexican colony <pb facs="5423405_1_0733.jpg" n="2"/>to give their contributions and entire support to the Cruz Azul Mexicana. (2) The writer, as I said before, belongs to the working class; he knows perfectly well what the needs are because he is in close contact with both the existing misery and prosperity in the Mexican colony of South Chicago. It is for this reason that he is authorized to speak on the matter the way he did. And, lastly, the article in question is highly significant because, having been written by a humble person,--a laborer,--it simply shows the interest that exists among the Mexican working class element of South Chicago as regards the Mexican Blue Cross. It further shows that the South Chicago territory should be a very favorable and fertile camp for the activities and development of this beneficent and noble institution; favorable, because of its large Mexican colony, among which funds could be raised to maintain this aid society.</p>
   <p>Unfortunately, the geographic location of South Chicago in regard to the center of activities of the Mexican Blue Cross makes it difficult to <pb facs="5423405_1_0734.jpg" n="3"/>extend such activities into that territory, due to the enormous distances the nurses of this institution would have to cover to investigate cases, and visit the sick, etc. The article goes on to say that the colony of South Chicago needs the Mexican Blue Cross, that the Mexican Blue Cross needs the cooperation of all the Mexican colony, and that it is imperative to take up some measure in order to correct the deficiency that now exists due to the difficulties above mentioned. That the S. Chicago colony has received little attention is self-evident to any observer who, as myself, has had the opportunity to know and be in close contact with the needs of our colony there. How many times, while discharging my medical duty, have I seen families in misfortune, not only unable to pay the doctor's fee or buy medicines, but unable to buy their daily bread. And, in spite of that I have chosen not to call upon the Cruz Azul Mexicana to solicit aid for these needy people, because I understand perfectly well that due to the distance, cases <pb facs="5423405_1_0735.jpg" n="4"/>could not be attended with the required efficiency. How many times have I preferred in such cases to extend my services to them free of charge, giving them medicines, etc. Taking into consideration the aforesaid, with the utmost respect, I beg the Honorable Board of Directors of the Cruz Azul Mexicana to please take up in the next session the following motions which I wish to submit merely as a Mexican: (1) To establish a Sub-Brigade or a Delegation in South Chicago, (2) That such Brigade, or Delegation, be a subordinate to the Brigade of Chicago, (3) That the Sub-Brigade of the Cruz Azul Mexicana be granted an autonomy, that is to say, that it be free to take the initiative and to decide upon any problem that might arise, such as carrying out the work of charity as it may judge pertinent, organizing festivals in order to raise funds, etc., always in common agreement and with the cooperation of the Cruz Azul Mexicana of Chicago, (4) That the Sub-Brigade of the Cruz Azul Mexicana of South Chicago <pb facs="5423405_1_0736.jpg" n="5"/>shall consist of a directing body elected by the Mexican colony of South Chicago in a mass meeting, so that it be composed of persons residing in South Chicago, who are familiar with the needs of that colony, (5) That on decisions concerning the management of funds, said Sub-Brigade be instructed by the Honorable Board of Directors. Having not the least doubt that this Honorable Board will give due consideration to my motions and accord them their support, since they have an altruistic aim, I remain with the utmost respect,</p>
   <p>Your attentive and obedient servant,</p>
   <p>Oscar G. Carrera, M.D.</p>
   <p>South Chicago.</p>
