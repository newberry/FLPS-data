   <p>We have the pleasure to inform our customers that our new Mexican department, "Salon Azteca," has definitely been installed on the second floor of our musical store. This new department has been beautifully decorated and it will make you remember our distant country. A distinguished Mexican artist has been engaged to decorate this new department, of which we may be proud and very sure that this will be the first of its kind in the United States. Come to visit us and we shall make your visit a very pleasant one. At the head of this department is Mr. Angel Pimentel, well known to all our Mexican customers because of the courtesy which characterizes him. As usual, we have a large supply of portable phonographs and victrolas of the most accredited makes in the market, such as "Columbia," "Victor," "Brunswick," "Harmony," "Q.R.S.," "Lark," "Carryola," "Rialto," and others. We have over 50,000 Mexican records of the most famous makes, which will guarantee that the most fastidious taste will be pleased by us.
