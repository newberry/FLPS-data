   <p>In 1502 Christopher Columbus, sailing along the Caribbean Sea on his fourth and last trip to the new world, discovered a "rich coast," which he named Costa Rica.</p>
   <p>Women planted the first coffee seeds in Costa Rica, seeds which had come from Arabia a century ago, at the time when Costa Rica was negotiating to secure the independence of this land from Spain.</p>
   <p>In 1933 Victor Iglesias came as guest to the Century of Progress exposition. He came as an official Costa Rican to introduce the famous coffee of his native land and in the spirit of Columbus, discovered he liked Chicago and stayed here.</p>
   <p>Iglesias' success as a super salesman of coffee and as a restaurateur at the Fair resulted in a permanent Chicago establishment, the Costa Rican Coffee House, at 111 South Clark Street.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0271.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>The Iglesias establishment has now inaugurated a new fiesta room of Spanish colonial design, which for its color is as interesting as the Spanish dishes served therein. The vivid colors of the tropics, as well as the easy tropical friendliness also are to be found therein. In a tiny recess in one wall is an ancient carved statue of a saint with glowing vigil lights.</p>
   <p>On another wall is a plaque with the Aztec calendar, colored in the same hues that give the room its vividness.</p>
   <p>Nowhere in Chicago can one find the Spanish dishes as served at this coffee house. The Taquita Mexicano, for instance, is a dish of chili pepper and taco, which consists of highly seasoned meats and cabbage rolled in tortillas.</p>
   <p>Black bean soup, new in Chicago, is made from whole black beans rich in iron and grown only in the soil of Costa Rica volcanoes. The soup is a tasty tonic.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0272.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>Tostada and Spanish rice (a salad on a tortilla), and many other dishes comprise a unique menu. Prices are reasonable and the Costa Rican dinner is an enjoyable dinnertime adventure.</p>
