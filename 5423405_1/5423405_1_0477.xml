   <p>During the past week, there was opened to the public of this great city, the annual floral exposition and meeting of gardeners and florists, which is considered one of the largest and most unique of its kind in the world.</p>
   <p>On Sunday March 22nd, it was estimated that between ten and four o'clock, there were no less than fifty thousand people in the place, and there was a time when the manager of the exposition was obliged to close the doors because of the large number of visitors.</p>
   <p>THE MEXICAN STAND</p>
   <p>It is appropriate to mention the space which "The Azetec Shop" occupied at this exposition. This "Shop" exhibited articles manufactured in Mexico, especially in works of pottery, paintings and Mexican agave which caused admiration among the thousands of persons who visited the exhibit.</p>

   <p>"The Azetec Shop" is a genuine Mexican enterprise which has been set up for the purpose of acquainting the public of this country with the fine work which artistic Mexicans have done in pottery, painting, weavings and other articles which are highly admired by Americans and also by foreigners who live in this country.</p>
   <p>In the Mexican Pavilion there were the beautiful Miss Josephine Lupian and Mrs. Consuelo de Medina, wife of the cultured fellow countryman and doctor, Don Juan B. Mdeina who have always distinguished themselves as ones in this country who know Mexican manufactured goods. The two women mentioned, dressed as Chinese, gave splendid attention to those who visited the Mexican booth.</p>
   <p>The exhibition in The Aztec Pavilion was in charge of Mrs. Leonard L. Tuck and Mrs. Consuelo de Medina who were the organizers.</p>
