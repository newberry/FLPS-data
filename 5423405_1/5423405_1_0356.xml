   <p>We wish to thank several Mexican musicians of the City of Chicago for the organization of a Brass Band. One of these musicians mostly responsible for it is the well known Mexican guitar player, Mr. Rodolfo Hernandez. He has secured for the new organization the most outstanding and accomplished artists of the city. Young Hernandez has received the most complete cooperation from our Colony, which sees in this move the nucleus of a native Mexican band.</p>
   <p>On Sunday, November 13 at 2 P.M. there will be a meeting regarding the organizing of an orchestra which would be a subsidiary of the Banda Mexicana de Chicago. This meeting will take place on the third floor of the building at 618 Blue Island Avenue. The organizers have requested all music lovers, be they experts or not, to attend this meeting. The first meeting is for the purpose of getting the views of those who see the need of promoting cultural musical programs.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0357.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>We hope much success will come to our friend Mr. Hernandez and to all those with whom he will be working.</p>
   <p>Classes have already been started and they will continue daily from 7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P. M.</p>
   <p>Those who might be interested may get details from Professor Juan Hernandez.</p>
