   <p>The Orquesta Tipica Obreros Libres Mexicanos De South Chicago has been definitely organized by Mr. Marciso Gonzalez, who has sent us the following circular:</p>
   <p>Countrymen: Being the inalienable duty of every good Mexican to contribute some little effort to the prestige of our dear and beautiful country, on this date we have inaugurated musical rehearsals with the purpose of organizing a string band which will depend directly and exclusively on the Sociedad Mutualista Obreros Libres Mexicanos, and whose supervision and direction will be under my care. Therefore, I am making a call to the Mexican colony to give it an active and spontaneous cooperation, - be it a personal contribution or its moral and material aid, - in order to materialize the task we have now undertaken. In our social medium it is a <pb facs="5423405_1_0372.jpg" n="2"/>necessity of great importance to seek our collective betterment, materially and intellectually as well. Taking in consideration the progressive spirit which characterizes us in the crystalization of our efforts, we feel the need of a decisive cooperation from all our racial brothers, in order to help in the reconstruction of our country's soil, that at this moment demands the aid of all its sons and the sacrifice of our personal interests, so that with fraternal harmony we may from a homogeneous group that may accomplish our final end, that is, to give our best efforts for the good of our beloved country. The rehearsals of the Tipica Obreros Libres Mexicanos will take place on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays every week, from 7:00 to 9:00 P.M., at 9011 Brandon Ave. This society cordially invites all Mexicans interested in this organization, which with in a short time will be one of the best ever had by the colony of Chicago.</p>
