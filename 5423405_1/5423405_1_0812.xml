   <p>The arrest of three men yesterday by agents of the federal secret service completed the capture of a band of twenty dollar bill counterfeiters, according to the findings of Captain Thomas J. Calloghan. It is said that the imitation bills were among the best that have been found in the history of the city. They found that the counterfeiters washed the one dollar bills with some kind of acid, and then reprinted them by means of some ingenious process into twenty dollar bills.</p>
   <p>Cormine Pirofalo, Leo Cuda and Louis C. Olivo were examined yesterday and confined to prison pending a bond of $10,000.00 for each of them.</p>
   <p>The printing according to the report was done by Pirofalo, who it is said quit a $100.00 per week job in order to work with Cuda. The bills were printed in a workshop located at 1706 W. 51st Street, property of Olivo.</p>
