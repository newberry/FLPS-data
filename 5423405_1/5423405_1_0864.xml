   <p>An honorable and faithful Mexican wife, Gregoria G. de Marquez, was mortally wounded Tuesday morning by a suitor named Carlos Franco, who enraged by her scorn, himself drunk with passion, beat her and shot her twice as she passed from the drawing room to the kitchen. The victim fell to the floor mortally wounded.</p>
   <p>Gregoria and her husband, an honorable and industrious gentleman, live at 921 S. Ashland avenue, the place where the crime was committed.</p>
   <p>When questioned by the police the husband declared that he knew nothing concerning the pretentions of Carlos Franco, and said that since this individual had been passing for his friend he never suspected that he nursed any love for his wife.</p>
   <p>The police are trying to find the hiding place of the assassin so that he might answer to the charge of murder.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0865.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Because of the secrecy in the investigation of this case, it has not been possible for us to obtain more details of this fatal tragedy in which the principal characters are a lewd mad man and a defenseless woman who opposed his passion and suffered the consequences rather than consent to his desires.</p>
