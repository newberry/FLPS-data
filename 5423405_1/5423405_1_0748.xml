   <p>The Sociedad Femenil Mexicana has successfully completed its self imposed duties. The Society wishes to thank the Mexican Colony and especially those persons, who have so kindly cooperated in helping the Mexican children.</p>
   <p>The members of the collection committee elected by this organization were: Mrs. Maria P. de Jimenez, Josefa Ruiz and F. G. de Barron.</p>
   <p>The total amount collected in the Mexican Colony and among the American merchants was $224.06. Toys, candy. clothes and fifty baskets of groceries were distributed to different needy families on December 24th. These gifts had been donated by different groups of societies, by Montgomery Ward and Company, by the Salvation Army and by friends.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0749.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Of the above mentioned funds collected, a sum of $221.84 was spent to purchase toys, clothes, goods, groceries, carton paper, crepe paper, ribbons and lace. From $224.06 collected and $221.84 spent a balance of $2.20 was left.</p>
   <p>The documents showing for what purpose the funds were disbursed, will remain in our archives. We extend our most sincere thanks to the different groups, merchants and individuals for their charitable cooperation and for having assisted at the various festivals organized in order to collect funds to help the Mexican children.</p>
   <p>Mr. Jose O. Velasco, director of "El Heraldo Juvenil," on behalf of the Colony expressed the most cordial thanks to the Society and to the Committee in charge.</p>
   <p>We compliment the children who at the last charity function took part in the various dance numbers and plays. In the comedy, "Contra Soberbia, Humildad" a part filled by little Miss Rosaura Marin, tears were shed, so well did the little girl play.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0750.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>In fact all the children who took part in either of the plays deserve praise. Members of the committee in charge who worked so hard to reach the intended goal are:</p>
