   <p>Senorita Gonzalez Lavalle, as Mariana, and Senor Silvano R. Ramos rehearse. Closeup of the Senorita. The first opera ever to be performed by the inhabitants of "Tamale Town", Chicago's local Mexican Colony in South Halsted Street, will take place tomorrow evening in the Westside auditorium, West Taylor Street and South Racine Avenue. It is called "Mariana" and is what they call in Spanish a "rarzuela" or, in other words a light operetta. The opera will be in costume and the cast is made up of Mexicans in the colony. The opera is being presented under the directorship of Senor Silvano Ramos, noted tenor of Mexico City, who is living in Chicago temporarily.</p>
   <p>For the past weeks the group have been using the piano and practicing in the rooms of Senor William L. Ortiz, an artist living in Hull House. Another active member of the group is Senor Francisco Bustamante, a pianist and composer also from Mexico City, who recently composed the "President Ortiz Rubio March" in honor of the newly elected president of the republic of Mexico. This march number was written at the solicitation of the government officials in Mexico City.</p>
