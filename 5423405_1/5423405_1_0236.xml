   <p>As we have pointed out in previous issues of the paper, it is desirable that the Mexican colony heed the campaign of those who are aware of the value of public health. In accordance with our views, we are pleased to announce that the Anti-Tuberculosis Committee, which is composed of several representative individuals, has planned to hold a series of lectures to instruct the public in the prevention of the dread disease tuberculosis.</p>
   <p>Their first meeting took place Sunday night at Hull House, and began promptly at 7:00 P.M.</p>
   <p>It was a very successful meeting and we saw many people from the Mexican colony, which indicated that they felt the need for acquiring the facts necessary for the prevention and treatment of the disease. They also were told how to avoid passing the highly contagious germ to others. Without fear of exaggeration we can say that the audience was composed of more than three <pb facs="5423405_1_0237.jpg" n="2"/>hundred and fifty persons. Among them were a large number of girls who were eager to learn the practical method of combating tuberculosis.</p>
   <p>Dr. [S. G.] Meixueiero, active member of the Anti-Tuberculosis Committee opened the meeting by introducing the distinguished gentleman, Mr. Rafael Avelevra, Mexican consul in Chicago, and chairman of this committee. It is to Mr. Avelevra's initiative and benevolence that the success of the brilliant idea is due. Mr. Avelevra spoke, among other things, about the local health authorities who are attempting to protect the health of the Mexican residents of Chicago. Having realized the value of this campaign, he decided to offer his co-operation; for a program of such humanitarian purposes could not fail to derive some benefits. He also said that he felt complimented by the large audience, and that he was very satisfied to see that the efforts of the committee were being crowned with success.</p>
