<title level="a">SINCERE CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT "JOSE MOJICA"</title><title level="a" type="sub">By J. Xavier Mondragon</title></bibl>

  <body>
   <p>Last May, while I was in Hollywood, I had the opportunity to the premiere fim, "One Mad Kiss," in which our fellow countryman Jose Mojica, a tenor appeared as a leading figure, seconded by Mona Maris and Antonio Moreno. Journalistic frankness must be accompanied with indifference to prejudice. It is for this reason that I want to be allowed to make some criticism and although it may not be in good form yet on the other hand it will be frank and well intended.</p>
   <p>"One Mad Kiss" is a film without an interesting plot. The Play, is nothing more than an imitation of the type like those which have made Douglas Fairbanks and other leap-dancers famous and whose action is more appropriate to a dancer than to a hero.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0573.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Surely, our countryman Mojica films very well, sings better, though his acting is somewhat weak. It does not seem true, yet, our cultured artist was not sure of his part. Nevertheless, he did everything possible to sing well. In spite of the fact that he has much schooling, in the Opera there is much more to be desired and because of this fact, cannot say that this Mexican artist cannot be successful in his Motion Picture career. There are many things one can blame the vehicle picked by Fox Films, for the initial presentation of this Mexican tenor was stale. They could have easily found another plot so as to have avoided ridiculing him which as I have already stated was not his fault, for, we must understand that in the movies as well as in the theatre the directors and not the actors say what is to be done, and on this occasion they greatly compromised an excellent singer of the note of Jose Mojica.</p>
   <p>I understand that Mr. Mojica, is an accomplished Opera singer with more than eight years experience with the Chicago Civic Opera Company. His reputation is enough for him to succeed in the movies and on the stage. He photographs excellently and his personality and physical qualities are superior, his voice and schooling are of the first class and his ability as an artist is higher.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0574.jpg" n="3"/>
   <p>All the above, makes me think that Mojica's film was taken and scheduled by exhibitors as a second class picture. It is enough to convince anyone when it is known that this film was not shown in first class theatres. This is one reason why our Spanish speaking people did not know when this picture was exhibited in the local theatres. In a large city like Chicago, with three and a half million people, one does not know what is happening a half block away. Mojica's film was classified as a second class picture and this explains why critics of the big press did not make any comment. Another feature is that the music is absolutely inattractive, although it was very well sung by our countryman Jose Mojica.</p>
   <p>Trenslator's Note:</p>
   <p>Jose Mojica lived in Chicago for over ten years, he was connected with the Chicago Civic Opera. He sang at some of the National celebrations in the Mexican colony. Mojica is a native of the State of Guanajuato, Mexico. - J. Xavier Mondragon, the author has resided in Chicago for the last 18 years, he is the correspondent for La Prensa of San Antonio, Texas.
