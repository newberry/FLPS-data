   <p>(Monday) 1. Mexican dinner, 5:30 to 6:45 - 50c complete. Enchiladas (you will have to guess the contents), tortillas, Mexican rice, frijoles (Mexican bean dish), Mexican slaw, guayaba paste (a very rich pastry dessert), Mexican cheese. Also Not tamales, 5c; for those who do not care for Mexican food there will be such good American dishes as roasted sirloin of beef, ham and eggs, a variety of vegetables, etc. 2. String trio during dinner hour. 3. Senorita Concka Martizen from the cast "Flying Down to Rio" accompanied by Mr. Ruben. 4. Mr. Manuel Contreras, also from the same cast, with his cornet. 5. Notion pictures of Mexico with intimate scenes from the daily lives of the Mexicans; panoramic views of lakes, valleys, and mountains - from ox-carts to Ford automobiles and back to wheelbarrows.</p>
   <p>These four reels record a trip through Mexico within the past three months. The native Mexican manufacturing scenes and the six donkeys herded in front <pb facs="5423405_1_0318.jpg" n="2"/>of the street car to provide locomotion will fascinate you. 6. Drawings for the Mexican pottery, favors given in person by Mr. Guillermo Hawley of the Mexican National Railways. Mr. Hawley and his wife will be in native costume. There is no charge other than for your evening meal. We urge that you come early for the better tables. Make reservations today for parties of four or more by calling the Cloister Club. A few less than a hundred have already made such reservations. We'll see you this evening at 5:30 at the Cloister Club.</p>
