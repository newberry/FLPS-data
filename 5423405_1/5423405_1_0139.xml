   <p>Every day the attitude of local policemen is more intolerable. Sometimes they imprison honest Mexicans who are not guilty of any law violation.</p>
   <p>The local police who are afraid to catch criminals and who are not able to combat them, persecute honest people who have had no conflicts with the law.</p>
   <p>Sometimes the policeman display their authority and stupidity among our countrymen.</p>
   <p>Last Friday, several policemen came into the billiard parlor "El Gato Negro," guns in hand and abusing those of our compatriots who were peacefully playing billiards and those who were watching them.</p>
   <p>The policemen after using profane language and without any explanation, took with them innocent Mexicans. These Mexican people had not offended anyone.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0140.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>This abuse caused great resentment among the persons present because it is not just to arrest honest people.</p>
   <p>The Mexican Consulate must take note of this case and make some energetic protests to the chief of police.</p>
   <p>It is funny that the policemen do not persecute the genuine criminals, but cowardly beat and insult our defenseless compatriots.</p>
