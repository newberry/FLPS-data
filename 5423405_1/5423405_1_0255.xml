   <p>A very lively and well attended party was given last Saturday, March 27th, at the residence of Mr. Rafael Diaz, 2517 West Jackson Boulevard. The purpose of the function was to celebrate the daring Mexican aviators Rafael Diaz and Luis Herrera for their successful return flight from Arizona to Chicago.</p>
   <p>Because the flight was full of danger, as is the case with most flights our mentioned "aces" of aviation in Chicago are entitled to much praise for the manner in which they carried it out.</p>
   <p>The party, which was enlivened by a very good orchestra, lasted until the early hours of the morning. Mr. F. Rayes Mata, well known in our colony, amused us with his sleight of hand and juggling tricks.</p>
   <p>Mrs. Diaz, wife of our illustrous aviator, entertained the guests with beautiful native songs. She was accompanied at the piano by our distinguished and good friend Professor Justino Sanchez.</p>
