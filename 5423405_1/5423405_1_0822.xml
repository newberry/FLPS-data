   <p>Jorge Rojas, a mexican, was declared not guilty of disorderly conduct by a jury in the Municipal Court. Young Rojas, was arrested the morning of August 23rd, and accused by the police of being found embracing Miss Eleanor Swimmer. The scene of affection that caused so much aversion to the police officer, took place on 67th Street and the Illinois Central Railway. The police declared that, at the time of the arrest, they found communist literature in possession of Rojas. The couple contracted civil marriage last Wednesday.</p>
   <p>The now Mrs. Rojas, has denied the scene of affection took place as discovered by the police. The jury deliberated only 90 minutes before reaching the verdict. The parents of Mrs. Rojas, objected to the marriage, but she said; that she will see to it that her marriage with Rojas, be accepted benevolently by her parents.</p>
