   <p>Mr. O. B. Hernandez, President of the Sociedad Mutualista Obreros Mexicanos visited our office last Thursday and had a long talk with us in regards to the action to be followed in the defense of the three Mexicans who are accused of taking the life of a policeman in South Chicago.</p>
   <p>The Sociedad Mutualista Obreros Libres Mexicanos may justly be said, has been the first to demonstrate its altruism, being very active in trying to overcome the serious problem that the prisoners are confronting; "lack of funds for their defense," Other Mexican Societies ought to follow the good example, by giving their contingent for this cause which besides being just, has been left to the care of the Mexican Colony who must not be deaf to the plea of its members in misfortune. Mr. Hernandez has told us that the organization he represents will do everything in its power to help these countrymen of ours.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0792.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>One of the first steps that said society will take is to solicit a contribution from each one of its members, this money will be turned over to an attorney that will take care of the defense. All the names of those who contribute will be published at an opportune time.</p>
   <p>Translator's Note: It may seem strange that some societies and even the newspaper Mexico could have taken such interest in these prisoners. The reason is that these three Mexicans were held up by the policeman while he was not on duty nor wearing a uniform. As a result of a thorough investigation on this case then some of the Mexicans in Chicago decided to give the accused their moral and financial support. It was considered an act of self defense. However one of the accused was sent to prison from one to ten years, the other two were set free.</p>
   <p>Nicolas M Hernandez.</p>
