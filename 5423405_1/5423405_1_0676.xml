<title level="a">THE SILVER STREAKS QUINTET</title></bibl>
   </div>
  </front>

   <p>That the preponderant power of the Silver Streaks "five" is a menace to every team of its class is being proven by the successes of these young men who, by-the-way, are Mexicans. Concrete evidence of this was shown in the recent games with the powerful Marte and Southern Arrows teams, both of South Chicago.</p>
   <p>In each of these contests the Silver Streaks triumphed with a score decidedly crushing.</p>
   <p>During the night games of December 17th and 21st. they were victorious with a score of 20 to 17 and 27 to 8 respectively. In their last encounter with the Southern Arrows they piled up a score of 24 to 8, showing that this quintet of audacious players need a wider field of action with opponents of greater skill.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0677.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>All of this shows that the Silver Streaks is in evidence as one of the units of the Chicago Boys' Club which has taken a decided part in developing physical culture among its members, and whose accomplishment as authentically proven by its activities gives the Silver Streaks a worthy place of mention.</p>
   <p>The quintet of the mentioned team is composed of the following personnel: Teddy Mendoza, rg; Rodolfo Salmeron, If; Amador Manjarrez, rf; Ramon Mendoza, c; and Juan Garcia lg.</p>
   <p>The substitutes comprise Luis Gonzales, Carlos Garcia, Santos Garcia and Antonio Servin.</p>
