   <p>Maria Garcia Morales received the first prize. It was eight o'clock in the evening and the West Side Auditorium was filled to capacity. The dance had attracted the whole colony, but the lure of a "prize" overcame the indifference and the tardiness that has prevailed at so many social functions. The festive spirit of the Mexicans was general.</p>
   <p>Mrs. F. S. De Barron's original ideas contributed greatly to the success of the evening. The life of the entertainment was Miss Esperanza Barron. Another lady to whom much credit is due is Mrs. Antonia Aguilar in charge of the committees,who was responsible for the artistic presentations. The "Moraima" act was splendid. The applause was incessant and the charming actresses were obliged to make repeated curtain calls. The Comedy "El Suend Dorado" was liked very much. Mr. Jose Jimenez played his role to perfection. The "Duchess De Baltabarin" was the climax of the entertainment. Afterwards there was dancing and it made me feel twenty years younger.</p>

   <p>The prize for the person wearing the most original costume, was awarded to Miss Maria Garcia Morales. The costume was of Sevillian design with flamingo stripes and was beautifully adorned. Its sight brought back to me memories of ancient and glorious Sevilla. Never have I seen a more beautiful costume or a more graceful woman. The second prize was awarded to Miss Maria Cervantes, who also had a very pretty costume.</p>
