   <p>Mr. Santiago Rivera, Mexican, 25 years old, was acquitted last Tuesday, December 15th, by Judge B. David, at the Criminal Court.</p>
   <p>It was an impressive act, when Judge B. David said solemnly: "I would have done the same as this youngman had done in those circumstances; therefore, in the Law's name I declare you innocent.</p>
   <p>The story of this crime is as follows:</p>
   <p>A sex offender attacked Mr. Rivera's mother, who is a venerable old woman. Mr. Rivera loves his mother with unutterable affection and when he knew by his own mother's lips what had occurred, he became enraged, because the bandit who had trampled his honor was proud of his deed. Then, Mr. Rivera took a pistol and ran to kill the fiend.</p>
   <pb facs="5423405_1_0843.jpg" n="2"/>
   <p>Mr. Rivera was charged with murder; but he got the sympathy of those persons who knew the truth. Rivera's fate was in Judge B. David's hands; but this honest man was just.</p>
   <p>Mr. Rivera received his friends' congratulations. Many Mexican persons were interested in Mr. Rivera's lot; but Mr. Guillermo B. O'Neil always showed a great endeavour to help him.</p>
