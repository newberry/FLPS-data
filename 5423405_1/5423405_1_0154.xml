   <p>It would be well to find out why the Comite Pro-Fiestas Patrias (Pro-Homeland Committee) took so long to publish a financial report on the recent Homeland Festivities.</p>
   <p>The famous report is nothing more than indisputable proof of the mismanagement of funds collected from these festivities. In order to protect the good name of the Mexican Consulate of this city, the Honorable Vice-Consul should name a commission of honorable and competent men to make a thorough investigation of the handling of all funds collected and spent in connection with the last Homeland Festivities. It is truly ridiculous that the profit from a festival in which a group of a little less than6,000 persons took part is only $175. The Honorable Vice-Consul should not only name this Commission to protect the good name of the Consulate, but also to protect his own reputation, since he sanctioned the festivities by his presence. For the reasons mentioned he <pb facs="5423405_1_0155.jpg" n="2"/>should, therefore, avail himself of all means possible to see that the money invested in these festivities by members of the Colony is not diverted to gratuities and other expenditures not fully justified. The Honorable Vice-Consul should take into account, above everything, that if the people cooperated as a group, it was because these festivities were sponsored by the Consulate. If for no other reason than this, it is his duty to immediately name the Commission to which I have referred.</p>
   <p>Now is the time to act so as to prevent the funds collected in these official festivities from being diverted to the use of an "endless little group" and so that they may be turned over to the worthy Cruz Azul (Blue Cross) rather than have them go to the pockets of the sharks of our Colony.</p>
