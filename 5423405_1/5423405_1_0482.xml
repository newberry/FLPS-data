   <p>The attractive Spring-Time Festival organized by the Club Ideal which took place at Temple Hall last Saturday, turned out to be an extraordinary affair. The place was packed with a lot of good looking little ladies from whose number the Queen of May, Miss Juanita San Martin was elected by a majority of 2700 votes thus winning the crown from the other nine contestants. Miss Beatriz Macias, won second place in this interesting contest by 2,650 votes. It is significant to note that the votes were honored as per admission ticket, each ticket representing fifty votes, and each bearer had the right to only fifty votes. This simply means that Miss Juanita San Martin was the victor because of the wish of the majority, a total of 54 voters.</p>
